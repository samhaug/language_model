{"WOjYMlmn424": "- Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious home-cooked dishes to share with your family and friends. Today we're making something that's so easy.\n(mellow music) I know a lot of you are really bored with your breakfast offerings, and you wanna treat yourself\nevery once in a while. Well, why not an apple fritter? It's the donut that you don't have to have all the yeast and leavening for. It fries up in a minute, and you will be in heaven. Let's get started. If you're wondering like,\n\"What is this kitchen?\" This doesn't look like\nmy new kitchen situation. The renovations are dragging on a bit, so we moved into a rental house, and in the meantime, we're\ngonna prep our apples. We have to give 'em a peel, and just a little chop. Got a mix of a couple Gala\napples and a Granny Smith. You don't have to be too picky, just choose tasty apples. I think the key to a great\nfritter is having a lot of delicious apples held together with a little bit of batter. It makes a big difference. You don't want to have just\ndonut; it's an apple fritter. The other thing is, of course,\nfrying it the right way. It has to be in oil, of course. But you really wanna take it dark. I think my perfect fritter is really dark 'cause that's when it gets real crispy. Normally, we have a\nreally balanced breakfast. (bright music)\nActually pretty Spartan but you can't live that life every day, so on the weekends I like\nto have either some waffles, pancakes, or on an extra\nindulgent day, an apple fritter. So we'll be enjoying these very shortly. It'll be delicious. And the kids will get just a little piece at the end of breakfast. I learned having kids that\nthe key to treating them is to let them have something\nat the end of the experience so they're not brain locked\non waffles or whatever. More waffle, more waffles.\n(snickers) It's not a fun time at the restaurant. I'm just chopping this willy-nilly. It doesn't really matter if\nthe pieces are irregular, because some will be softer and some will have a\nbit more bite to them. So when I was growing, we would\nget to go to the donut shop once a week for a a special treat, and I would always get an apple fritter, but I also liked the crullers, which are my adult favorite donut. There's one place locally that has the best cruller in the world, although I grew up on the west coast, and I'm hearing, they are\nlike, \"What do you want? \"A cruller?\" And I was like, \"Yeah,\nthat one over there.\" And they were like, \"Oh,\nyou mean a cruller.\" I was like, \"Oh, is that called a cruller? \"I don't know.\" You can let me know in the comments if you say cruller or cruller, or if you have no idea what\nI'm talking about. (snickers) I called my mom after this incident, and she said it was a cruller and she's never heard of a cruller before, but she's from Mexico\nand has a slight accent if you've seen some of her videos that she is in with me. Okay, I'm just getting all the apple off this core because\n(knife scraping) I don't want to waste it. When I eat an apple, it's like\na squirrel has gotten to it. There's just the seeds hanging on the end. This is gonna go into our bowl now. (jubilant music) And I'm also gonna squeeze a little bit of lemon juice on here. I am part Greek, so lemon has to be in every single thing. I like the way it wakes the apple up. The Granny Smith is actually pretty tart, so it doesn't technically need it, but the lemon juice isn't hurting it. This can get set aside, and now it's on to the dry ingredients. (bowl scraping) We're adding about a\nquart of vegetable oil into a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. It's gonna be warming up while we make our quick batter. You know the drill. These little puppies\nare getting deep fried. For the dry mixture,\nwe're adding in 180 grams, or 1 1/2 cups, of all purpose flour. 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. One teaspoon of salt. 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder. (metal clinking)\nTap, tap, tap. Three tablespoons of sugar. Give it a sift. Sifting is kind of optional, but I think it helps things along. It's never bad to sift. You can't go wrong. We're gonna whisk it up (whisk scraping)\njust a little bit, and then set it aside. Setting it aside carefully\non a smaller island at the rental house. (laughs) Pulling that back because\nI forgot the nutmeg. 'Cause there was a bit of nutmeg in here. It's optional, but I\nlove nutmeg and apple, and if you can ever grate fresh nutmeg, that is the way to go. It is totally different\nthan regular nutmeg or the pre-made, pre-ground one. (tranquil music)\nIt's much more aromatic. Okay, pinch of nutmeg. Now I'm setting things aside carefully, and now onto the wet ingredients. For the wet ingredients, we're adding in 2/3 of a cup of milk. Mm, delicious. Two eggs, room temperature, please. And then, two teaspoons of vanilla, okay. Give this a whisk.\n(whisk clinking) This bowl should've been bigger. Okay, now we're ready\nto assemble that batter. So this is so easy. All we have to do is add\nthe wet mixture to the dry. We're gonna fold it together. Then as we get closer to\nit all being incorporated, see it turns into a dough. Oh that nutmeg smells so good. We're gonna dump the apples in. So doesn't even have to\nbe fully mixed together, because you're gonna fold the apples and that little bit of lemon juice in. And what do we have here? This looks to me like a fritter. Okay, at this point too, I'm gonna stir in that melted butter. Well, well, well, well. It makes a difference. So you can see right here, the mixture is really a\nlot of apples held together with a little bit of batter. You don't want too much batter, and that is my firm\nopinion on apple fritters. Okay, that's good.\n(mixture squelching) Now we are ready to go to our hot oil, which should be about\n360, so let's go check. Okay, so my oil hit 360.\n(oil sizzling) It's time to add in your fritters. I like to do three or four at a time. Now, it's great if you have a spider. I don't, so I'm using the\nslotted spoon situation. We're gonna let them get\nnice and golden brown and then flip them over so\nthey can cook on both sides. So keep a careful eye out because it's kinda of\nlike nothing happens, and then it happens. Now, for fritters, it's\nkind of interesting because you'd think golden\nbrown, extra beautiful, but I like them burnt. The more burnt they are,\nthe more crispy they are, and as they release their\nsteam when they're cooling, they kind of soften up a bit. So I kind of err on the side of darker. Just transfer them onto some paper towels till they kind of cool down and soak up some of the excess oil because when you blot fried\nthing off with paper towels, they become healthy. (snickers) Then let's keep that train moving. Sometimes I like to\nbeat them up little bit, right after they're in the oil, so they kind of spread out more. The thing that I don't\nlike with fritters is when they're kind of too blobby. So feel free to give them\na little flatten out. So these guys can get\nrolled in cinnamon sugar, which is really easy and delicious, but I like a glaze, and mine will have some lemon juice. It's so easy to make. One cup of powdered sugar. And we're gonna add in\njust enough lemon juice to turn it into a glaze. I love the contrast of the lemon. Really takes away some of the sweetness of that pure sugar mound. And you can, of course, use a strainer. I'm using my fingers because I can't find the\nstrainer at the rental house. I know there is one. I don't know where anything is. It's crazy.\n(calming music) You can also use water, milk. You can add in vanilla if you want. Just really any liquid. Okay, now that we're\nhere, we're gonna mix mix. Making a glaze is always kind of hilarious because it starts out so\ngunky like, \"What is this?\" But then as you mix, it\njust magically turns smooth. Gonna add in some more lemon juice because it's not magically turning smooth. (whisk clattering)\n(upbeat music) Here we go. And you can see we're getting into a more drippy, glazey consistency. There we go. I want a nice drizzle on top of these, and that's all I needed. Just a couple of extra drops. Okay, time to drizzle some on. You could also dip them in glaze, but I like, whoa. (laughing) I just doused them in glaze. Oh my gosh, what happened? Drizzle, drizzle, drizzle,\ndrizzle, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle, drizzle, there\nwe go, that's better. That was extreme bites of sugar there. Now that's what I call\na balanced breakfast. If you love apples, you've got to check out\nmy apple pie recipe. It is the perfect apple pie, and you will love it. In the meantime, you know that\nthe cook gets the first bite. (crunching) That is good. Oh my God. Hello. Be still my heart, I\ncan't take it anymore. The apples are so juicy\nin there and sweet, and just enough batter to cover it all. Zing of a lemon. Amazing.

[Donut Shop Worker] Uh no, those apple fritters were double-glazed by mistake. [Mordecai] Double-glazed...\n[Rigby] Double-glazed... [Mordecai] We'll take 'em. [Worker] Actually, I gotta throw them out, bruh, 'cos they're not safe for human consumption. [Rigby] We'll give you ten bucks. [Worker] Uh, you want those for here or to go? Hey, what's up guys?\nWelcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week I've just hit 5 million subscribers. This is not the 5 million subscriber special\n(that's coming soon), but tradition dictates I make something\nfrom Regular Show. And that clip always gets me in the mood for apple \u2014 oh geez! So, most of the recipes I found on the internet\nare [for] a quick baking soda-based fritter, but since our heroes purchased their donuts\nfrom a donut shop, I wanted to make a real deal,\nyeasted apple fritter. So we're gonna start by combining 1\u00be cups of milk,\nheated to 110\u00b0F with 2\u00bc teaspoons active dry yeast, \u00bc cup sugar, and 2 tablespoons of honey\nin the bowl of a stand mixer. Give it a little tiny whisking\nand let it sit for 10 minutes after which it should have gotten nice and foamy. To this, we're gonna add 3 eggs, lightly beaten as well as our all-purpose flour,\n22\u2153 ounces, to be precise. You might notice that I only measured the flour\nby weight, rather than volume, and that's because it's the only ingredient\nthat can vary wildly when measured by volume. Unlike, say, unsalted room-temperature butter which we're gonna cut 1\u00bd sticks into before affixing dough hooks\nand administering a beat-down on our dough. We're gonna start nice and slow\nto make sure the flour doesn't fly everywhere and then we're gonna mix on medium-high speed\nfor 6 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl\nonce halfway through until we're met with an ultra-soft,\nultra-sticky dough. At this point, you might be saying:\n\"Oh my god, I need to add flour,\" but why don't you just trust me\nfor once in your life?! Scrape down the sides of the bowl one last time,\ncover with plastic wrap then let rise at room temperature for 1 hour. Just enough time to negotiate our apple filling for which we're gonna need\n4 large Granny Smith apples. Now, there's a number of ways\nto peel an apple but only one tests your cooking prowess,\nyour finger tenderness, your empathy\nand your inner strength. And that's to try and peel it\nall in one single spiral. Can I peel this apple\nin one uninterrupted ribbon? Of course I can;\nI'm like a warrior poet with a vegetable peeler. I might not be able to, say, throw or catch a football\n(or an apple, for that matter) but when it comes to peeling,\nI am your champion. Anyway, no matter how you peel an apple we want to then core it\nand cut it into half-inch bite-sized chunks. We're then gonna toss these in a medium bowl\nwith the juice of one lemon, which is not only gonna flavor\nbut prevent the apples from browning as we make our way over to the stove top. Into a large non-stick pan goes\n\u00bd stick of unsalted butter which we're not only going to melt\nover medium heat, we're going to lightly brown it. Once you see the milk fat separate\nand start to change color add the apples, give them a toss, before adding a whole bunch of brown sugar,\nmaybe like \u00bd cup's worth, along with some spices: \u00bc teaspoon of cloves,\n\u00bd teaspoon of ground ginger, a teaspoon of cinnamon,\nand \u00bc teaspoon of allspice. Simmer, tossing ocassionally,\nfor about 4 to 5 minutes until it's nice and thick and gooey\nand complete, and the apples are just about cooked through. We don't want our filling to be too liquidous, however,\nso we're gonna thicken with a teaspoon of corn starch whisked together\nwith \u00bc cup of warm water. Cook for an additional minute until super thick\nand then set aside to cool completely. Because as you can see,\nit's been an hour and our dough has nearly doubled in size. But it's still super duper sticky\nso I'm gonna coat our worktop with what I would call\nan uncomfortable amount of flour. Scrape every little last bit of dough\nout of the bowl and then we're going to\nconvince it to form a rectangle by... ...stretching into a rectangle, on top of which we're going to dump our freshly cooled apples. As you can see, I put mine on a rimmed baking sheet\njust to get them to cool a little bit faster. And then we're gonna spread them out across the dough and fold the dough over on itself like a pamphlet, effectively laminating the apples and their accompanying sauce into the dough. We're just gonna coax that back together into a ball,\nmake sure that the apples are evenly dispersed, place back in the bowl, cover, and let rise again for one hour at room temperature\nuntil re-doubled in size. Then out onto a\u2014again\u2014\ngenerously-floured worktop we are dumping this messy, doughy,\napple-y kinda thing. A bunch of apples are gonna spill out; don't worry\u2014this is a natural part\nof the fritter-making process. Just liberally flour the top of the dough and then we're going to roll it out\nto about a one-inch thickness and then bust out your favorite biscuit cutter with which we shall cut rounds out of the dough. Just keep cutting 'til you can't cut no more and then we're gonna pull away the scraps\nfrom outside the rounds. Place the cut-out fritters onto\na well-floured baking sheet and then we're gonna re-roll the scraps back out and this is such a soft dough that\nit's not gonna make tough donuts once you re-roll it. Once everybody's all cut out,\nwe're headed over to the stove top where we've got 1\u00bd quart of vegetable oil\nheated to 375\u00b0F into which we're going to drop our donuts. They're also a little thick so I'm patting them and stretching them out a little bit\nbefore dropping them in the oil because they're gonna puff up significantly\nafter about 90 seconds of cooking. We're gonna flip them once,\nlet them cook for another 90 seconds and then once they're golden brown\nand crisp all over we're gonna evacuate them onto a wire rack\nin a rimmed baking sheet so they can drip dry. Rinse and repeat with the remaining fritters\nuntil everybody's cooked and then finally it's time to talk about\nthe star of the show: the glaze. All's you need to make donut glaze\nis a whole lot of powdered sugar and just a little tiny bit of milk. Tiny whisk with conviction\nuntil it's nice and smooth and no lumps remain and then we're ready to get dunking.\nPun intended. As that nice Jamaican donut shop employee specified,\nthese were double-glazed apple fritters. So I'm using a very thin glaze here to ensure that we get a nice, smooth,\nshiny coating on our donuts. But Pops was able to see his reflection in these fritters\nso they definitely need a double dunk. Once the first coat has hardened,\nwe're gonna dunk them again. resulting in perfect\ndonut shop-style apple fritters. But I was curious to see if I could get\nthe same results with a thicker glaze. So, with maybe, double the powdered sugar\nand the same amount of milk let's see if we can get similar results in one step. And the result were more like\na convenience store honey bun which you're not going to hear me complain about;\nI love honey buns. And while it doesn't have the mirror sheen that we were looking for \nfor the show-accurate recreation, it makes a very handsome fritter. And no matter how you glaze it,\nthese are some picture perfect apple fritters. Light and fluffy on the inside,\ngolden-brown and crisp on the outside, with plenty of pockets of warm spiced apples\ndotted throughout its twisty interior. It makes you wonder how anyone could ever\nwant something like a whole wheat donut\u2014 \u2014that is, until you eat like three of them\nfor your cooking show and things start moving in slow-motion. And with that I am off to the gym, after a quick nap. Subtitles by Spotted Metal", "-LnK51yULck": "hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with apple fritters that's right I'm not gonna lie I've never been a huge fan of apple fritters I mean I just didn't understand going to a donut shop and then not getting a donut but eventually I came to realize that had nothing to do with its lack of hold I just wasn't crazy about those chunks of what we're basically undercooked Apple so for our first official fall recipe of the season I'm going to show you my sort of reworked version of this featuring two significant changes the first is we're actually gonna cook the Apple a little bit beforehand and second well I can't tell you it's a huge surprise but you'll see that soon enough so in the meantime let's go ahead get started with the star of the show our apples and for this recipe I'm gonna suggest the Granny Smith which is my personal favorite cooking apple and what it lacks in that traditional red Apple color it more than makes up for with ideal taste and texture and to prep these what we're gonna do is peel them quarter them and then core them and I'm gonna be using the busy prep cook style to peel these which is to peel around the top and then peel down the sides like this since this is probably the fastest and most efficient method but if you're doing these with friends or family you want to do the thing where you peel around the Apple seeing who can get the longest continual peel without breaking which is a lot of fun but does take longer but anyway one way or another we're gonna peel that Apple before cutting in quarters and then we'll take our knife and trim out the core and then once our apples been trimmed and quartered what we'll do is cut each of those pieces into two or three pieces and then we'll simply turn that and slice it about every quarter inch or so and of course you're gonna try to be a little bit consistent but don't forget these things are gonna be stuck inside a fritter so no one's gonna see if you're a little off so try to relax and then what we'll do once our apples are sliced up is transfer those into a bowl and reserve those while we melt some butter because as I mentioned one major change here to the traditional apple fritter recipe is that we're gonna cook these a little bit before they go in the batter so we're gonna melt some butter over medium-high heat but we're just not going to melt it we're actually going to toast it a sort of nutty brown and please be careful butter can go from golden brown to golden black very quickly and as soon as we have something that sort of looks like this we'll go ahead and dump in our fruit and what we want to do is cook these apples for I don't know three or four minutes stirring occasionally on medium high heat until they kind soften up a little bit all right we certainly don't want to cook them all the way through but we do want to take that raw edge off and by the way we are gonna throw in a tablespoon of sugar but I don't like to do that right at the beginning I like to give these a couple minutes first so we'll give those a little saute until they just start to soften up around the edges and at that point we'll go ahead and sprinkle in some sugar and continue on for another couple minutes until we end up with something that's starting to get a little bit golden brown and starting to soften up but they're still gonna retain their shape and stay relatively firm and please keep in mind that truly raw apples are used in here so we'll probably want to err on not cooked enough versus overcooked so for me that is looking good right there and then what we'll do at that point is pull them off the heat and toss them in a strainer just in case we have any excess liquid which of using the Granny Smith you probably won't all right other apple varieties could produce more moisture and if you do have any extra it will drip down and then what we'll do is let this cool down to room temp before we add it to our batter and of course putting the components together for that batter is the next step so first up let's go ahead mix up our dry ingredients which will include - no one's surprise some all-purpose white flour as well as some baking powder and please make sure the one you're using you bought this decade we'll also want to toss in some salt and then some traditional apple fritter spices including some cinnamon some ground ginger and some freshly grated nutmeg I mean come on you're gonna make apple fritters and use now and a freshly grated nutmeg that ain't right so we'll grate in a little nutmeg before taking a whisk and giving this a thorough mix in the olden days they used to sift the ingredients but today we just use a whisk which some folks actually refer to as millennial sifting because while doesn't work quite as well it is easier and faster so nobody cares so we'll take a whisk and mix that for about a minute to combine those ingredients and once that's been accomplished we'll set that aside and move on to the wet ingredients so in a bowl we'll go ahead and crack one large egg to which we'll add some white sugar and then we'll take a whisk and give that a mix for about a minute and please at this point do not forget the melted butter which I did so I stopped and added it in and continued mixing okay so don't forget that tip I've given you in the past whenever you're stirring or mixing something always try to remember what you forgot but anyway we're gonna mix up our egg our sugar and our melted butter and once that set we can move on to final assembly so assuming our apples have cooled down to room temp or at least very close to it we'll go ahead and add those to our wet ingredients which brings us to the second significant change to the traditional technique we're gonna add some sparkling apple cider oh yeah and I'm using a gold-medal variety if you can't find that you can substitute with silver or bronze metal and why I'm using this instead of the traditional milk or regular apple cider is because hopefully that carbonation adds a little bit of lightness to the batter and even if it doesn't it seems like it's going to plus we get to drink the rest of the bottle so we'll go ahead and pour in some sparkling apple cider and then last but not least we will dump in our dry ingredients and then we'll take a spoon and mix until it's just combined so as usual we're not gonna obsess about overmixing we're just gonna simply stir until we don't see any more flour and as with all batters if it looks a little wet add a little more flour and maybe if it looks a little too dry add another splash of cider and actually as I'm looking at this it probably could have used another tablespoon of flour but I really don't enjoy a dense dry fritter so I will tend to always err on the side of slightly too moist but anyway once our batter is mixed we'll set that aside while we heat up a couple inches of oil over medium-high heat to approximately 350 degrees and once that's up to temp we will fry a couple tablespoons at a time using two spoons to safely transfer it in oh and by the way those irregular edges are one of the signature features of the apple fritter I mean these are supposed to look homemade not like something that came from a store so we'll transfer that batter in with complete disregard for any kind of uniform shape and what we want to do is we place this in a sort of flatten it out just a little bit that's gonna help it cook a little quicker and a little more evenly and we're gonna fry these for about two minutes per side and one thing I like to look for sort of like when you're making pancakes as you'll see bubbles kind of forming on the top of the batter that is generally a decent indication you're ready to flip over but like I said it's gonna be about two minutes per side so I went ahead and carefully flip those over and once those have been successfully flipped we'll give the other side a couple minutes at which point our fritters should be fried and you'll know because you're gonna test one if it's still wet and doughy inside go longer and if it's dry and burnt you went too far but happily these were perfect so we'll fish those out with a strainer and let them drain on some paper towels and yes those do look amazing but wait there's more we're gonna go ahead and ice these with a simple apple cider glazed so while our fritters are draining and cooling down a little bit we'll go ahead and take some powdered sugar and add a little pinch of cinnamon and then all we need to do is stir in enough of our sparkling apple cider until we have something just running enough to drizzle over our fritters and there's two ways you can do this you can sift the sugar first and mix this up in about five seconds or the method I prefer don't sift it and stir for like ten minutes but either way we're going to stir that until it's smooth and we've achieved a viscosity similar to what you see here and that's it our last official act will be to place these on some kind of platter and drizzle over our glaze which some people will just dip in but why the heck would anyone dip with naked drizzle so I'm gonna go ahead and spoon that over slowly and provocatively until approximately 50% of the surface area is covered and that's it our updated reimagined new and improved apple fritters are done and who knows maybe you enjoy the apple fritters with the raw apple chunks but like I said I don't I love that when we bite into these the Apple while still having some texture is kind of tender and definitely sweeter so I really do personally prefer this style and also sometimes when you use the raw Apple is there cooking juice will leak out and make the inside of the fritter soggy which is generally not considered a good thing and of course it goes without saying if you're gonna make these for some kind of party or Halloween get-together if you want to dress up the tops a little with some crushed nuts or maybe some toasted pumpkin seeds something like that go ahead it's up to you you guys are the babysitter's of these apple fritters which reminds me after this video you can watch one more but then it's time for bed okay but anyway that's it apple fritters tis the season to use apples in desserts as well as hang out with friends and family in a warm kitchen and this project is a fantastic way to do both of those things so I really do hope you give these a try soon head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] you", "ofzFLwpc7ok": "the apple fritter is its own weird thing it's a doughnut but not a doughnut it's a crispy craggy Apple II monster [Music] the way I judge a great donut shop is by its apple fritter to me it shows what kind of attention to detail we're dealing with from the very beginning we're looking for a best-case scenario a truly great apple fritter is a crispy craggy outside chunks of yeasty doughnut dough that are kind of smashed together with cinnamon II apples there's kind of like an aromatic darkness from that cinnamon it's not too sweet and there's a little bit of acid from the apples as well it's a super balanced incredibly interesting textural thing to enjoy so the question for me is can we make an apple fritter at home that's worth it and I say definitely yes I've been working on this fritter all week and I'm really happy with the product I've gotten to the good news is we don't need any special gear but we are gonna be learning some new moves along the way we're gonna be deep fried I'm gonna walk you through it it's not that scary and it's definitely gonna be worth it I'm stoked let's get started the batch size for this recipe is six monster fritters you're gonna need 275 grams or 1 and 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 5 grams or 1 teaspoon of yeast 70 grams or 1/2 cup warmed milk 1 egg 5 grams or 1/2 teaspoon salt 35 grams or 2 teaspoons sugar and 60 grams or 5 tablespoons of butter into our medium bowl we're gonna add our flour sugar salt and then East so now we're gonna add our butter I'm breaking it up with my hands so it incorporates a little bit easier into our dough when I mix everything else and then I'm adding warm milk I want my milk to about a 120 degrees because let's be honest your egg and your butter are probably coming right out of the refrigerator ideally they would be tempered so that it doesn't slow down the yeast in our dough but I don't do that 0 out of 10 times do I do that so I want the milk to counteract that warm up my dough a little bit so that it ferments a little bit faster using a spoon stir to combine once the dough has become more cohesive we're gonna flip out onto our table and we're gonna start to knead by hand using the palm of your hand work the dough to build a little strength and further incorporate the mixture we're gonna knead the dough by hand for four to five minutes or until the dough is well combined the butter is no longer visible and it has a nice shine to it we're then gonna place it in a covered container and let it ferment for two hours in a nice warm place while our dough is fermenting it's time for us to sort out our apples we're gonna need 250 grams or 2 to 3 apples 2 teaspoons of cider vinegar 2 teaspoons of cinnamon 1/2 lemon juice 2 tablespoons sugar and 3 tablespoons let's talk about fritter apples Granny Smith honey crisps both work really well but one thing I want to talk about is the cider vinegar and lemon juice if you're using Granny Smiths you don't need an additional acid they're super tart they're a great baking apple and they hold onto their texture really well once they're cooked but they can be a little bit sharp for me I like the Honey Crisp personally having done it multiple times with each Apple the Honey Crisp is what I prefer you see me cutting Granny Smiths here and they totally work I don't recommend using anything sweeter than a Honey Crisp it's a pretty tart apple but it does need a little bit of additional acid and that's where the cider vinegar and lemon juice is gonna play this is a crucial step on our path towards a perfect apple fritter the apples need to be a treat to bite into they need to have the right texture that's why we're gonna Park hook them and they need to have a siddha tea hence the vinegar or the super tart Granny Smith once we repealed we're gonna cut slabs off the center and discard the core we're then gonna medium dice our apples most of the wedges can be sliced in half and then into strips and then we dice um we're not putting these in any acid water anything because they're going right into a saute pan speaking of that heat up a large nonstick saute over high heat and then add in your two tablespoons of butter we're gonna let that foam up and start browning as soon as we're foaming we're gonna add in our apples and get a hot saute on the outside once we're all coated in butter we're gonna add in the sugar and cinnamon and continue to pan roast for about 90 seconds longer we're looking to take the raw edge off the apples in to season them well when we fry them that's when they're gonna get nice and tender once your apples are looking like this and the sugar is getting a little bit Brown we're gonna deglaze with our apple cider vinegar if we're using it and a little bit of lemon juice we're gonna cook on high for an additional 10 to 15 seconds just to reduce this liquid the mixture should be sticky brown and taste really good I've added a small pinch of salt here too not listed in the previous ingredients list but I do salt my apples in this situation because there's a noticeable difference something I've learned from my pastry chef bud Sarah Osborne is that you salt deserts most every component of every dish that she put on the menu at the restaurant we work together had some sort of salt in it and her set up it was low-key things did not taste salty it just kind of a pro-level move for a pastry chef to make sure everything is delicious as it can be once those are seasoned up we're gonna set those aside to cool and we're gonna check on our dough it's been 2 hours and there's some clear activity here when we press in with our fingers we can see some clear gas and in pation does that have butter and eggs in him like this don't usually grow like some of the more yeasted breads that we've worked with so far so don't worry if it hasn't grown by double that's not what we're looking for so next we're gonna flip out our dough into a lightly floured work surface and hit with a little bit of flour we're gonna grab our rolling pin and to start rolling it out we're looking for about a half inch thick rectangle here once I've rolled it out I like to flip the dough over and turn it 90 degrees to prevent sticking and to make sure I'm getting an even roll out repeat this until you've reached our desired rectangle size and grab your Apple Cinnamon mixture spread this stuff all over the dough it doesn't have to be perfect and you'll see why in a second then we're gonna dust this with flour this helps absorb some of the moisture and helps keep the fritter together when we go to fry what apples are not the best glue for dough so this flour is gonna be crucial in making sure that this thing stays together in the fryer once the apples are spread out we're gonna roll this thing into sort of a cinnamon roll type situation make sure it's not stuck to the counter at this point it's where we really fritter this thing take a plastic dough scraper or a dull knife and cut this fritter on a bias at about one inch spacing all the way across we're gonna repeat this cutting crossways on the other bias running our card through one more time after for good measure to really chop this thing up as you're scouring the Internet to try and find info and how the best donut shop fritters are made I stumbled upon this video from like the late 1990s of a solitary Baker working in a shop describing to somebody else how to make apple fritters this is the method to use I was totally sold from the second I saw the fritters I made before I saw this video we're not even close to perfect I was still definitely figuring it out so rest assured this is the pro level bad-boy donut shop guru move that's gonna put us in the end zone after we've got it cut we're gonna lightly flour the outside to keep this from sticking to our table the move here is to really press this thing back together after several attempts of this recipe I can say that this part is very important do not be shy don't worry about degassing really press it together into a nice loaf we need the apples and the dough to bond back together so that our fritter does not fall apart in the fryer this is where the flour we put on the apples before will help us out a little bit once we have our apple low formed grab your dough scraper and cut these into disks about 1 inch thick we're then gonna stretch them and lightly flour them to be about a half inch thick anything thicker than this will have a hard time getting all the way in the fryer this recipe makes six I'm gonna take four of these to throw in the fryer and then I'm gonna bake off two I kind of want to show you guys what these look like in the oven so you can make up your mind whether or not you want to fry these are gonna get covered with another sheet tray and set aside to gently proof while the heater oil for 20 minutes total okay so let's talk deep frying this is not a zero risk situation I am NOT gonna lie but it's also not that dangerous we just have to pay attention and we also have to make sure that we have all the tools we need ready to go we're dealing with something that holds heat extremely well and it is two times the temperature of boiling water so if you have any kids underfoot lock them in another room put on some Rugrats and pay attention let's suck fry oil real quick as well I'm using coconut oil and avocado oil you want it to be about three inches deep in your pot you can use whatever you've got that isn't olive oil to do this frying safely we're gonna make sure we have all of our stuff ready to go before we drop our first fritter that means a slotted spoon our thermometer a wire rack and a sheet tray to put our hot fritters on we're gonna make sure our oil is 360 degrees and then we're gently gonna lay down our fritters one at a time again we need about three inches total in our fryer or about one quart or four cups we're gonna fry these for about two minutes per side I'm gonna flip them gently using my slotted spoon we don't want to be rough on them they could fall apart and honestly don't sweat that too much because they're almost better if they're small I don't know maybe you make baby fritters next time you feel a little crazy and you need that next thrill okay so it's been two more minutes that's four minutes total and we have our fried apple fritter now we're gonna glaze earlier I mixed up a batch of simple glaze that's one cup powdered sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon salt and about three to four tablespoons of milk we're gonna whisk that to combine and then set it aside for later use I've glazed these hot and cool and I think they're crispy er if you left the donut cool all the way then glaze if you want something a little bit sweeter and a little bit more saturated with glaze go for it warm I personally like my fritters crispy as possible so let these cool for about 15 minutes before glazing the glacier be fairly thick as well it's a matter of personal taste here you can add more sugar if you like a thicker glaze you can add more milk if you like it thinner some people like it almost like frosting I'm somewhere in the middle as you can see here it's kind of between saucy and spreadable either way we definitely want to make sure we get a liberal amount on the top of the fritter nice heavy clays just like you see here we're gonna let that glaze set up and we're gonna brew ourselves a nice pot of super dark coffee the type your grandpa still drinks like Bulger's or Maxwell House super dark roast coffee once you got that it's time for us to bite this fritter the floor if I eat this that'll be two full ones craggy crispy so the acidity of the apples is absolutely perfect I haven't eaten this much sugar in like six months I'm gonna be in a weird spot after I eat this second one okay I'm done a proper handmade yeast fermented apple fritter is among the best things a human can put in their mouth period if you're willing to embrace the dark arts of deep-frying at home it can be yours I encourage you to give it a try as always guys if you got value out of

Mm hmm. Look at that awesome. Hello and welcome to you\nin the kitchen with Matt. I am your host, Matt Taylor. Today, I'm going to show you \nhow to make apple fritters. Oh, yeah. I love apple fritters \nare so yummy. Really easy to do. Simple ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it. Before I move on, make sure to \nsubscribe to my channel and hit that notification bill so you \ndon't miss out on any of my new videos. Let's get started down\nbelow in the description box, you'll find a list of the \ningredients and the amounts. First, let's take a pot and \nfill it with oil about an inch, inch and a half deep. I'm using vegetable oil, \nbut you could use also canola oil, lard, \nshortening peanut oil or coconut oil. And we want to heat this to \nabout three hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit began by \ntaking three apples. I'm using Granny Smith apples, \nbut any any apple will work. I like a nice tart apple. All right. And then once you peel and pour \nthe apples and slice them into little chunks, what I'm going \nto do is I'm going to add some lemon juice. And this is about \na tablespoon, two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, which is \nabout half of a lemon. And I'm just going to\npour that on the apples and just stir them around a little bit. Fantastic. And now in a medium bowl, \nI have one cup of all purpose flour and I'm going to add one \nhalf teaspoon of salt, one half teaspoon of ground cinnamon, \nabout an eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg, one and one half\nteaspoon of baking powder and three tablespoons of \nwhite granulated sugar. And then with a whisk. We will raise that together. All right, now I'm going to add \none large egg, one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Give this a whisk. One half cup of milk, I am \nusing whole milk, but you could use two percent, one percent \nand even almond milk if you want. And now I have one tablespoon \nof butter and I'm just going to melt this in the microwave 15 \nseconds or so and then put that in there as well. We don't want it\nto be too hot. So just until it melts. Oh, right. And then we will pour that in, \ngive it a good mix. Excellent. We'll take the flour mixture \nand then I'm going to switch to that spoon and we will \nstir this up. Oh, right, and now\nlet's add in our apples. And we will mix this up. I like mine to have a lot of \napples in it, so depending on how you want it, you might \nreduce it to only two apples. This has a lot of apples. All right, there we go, and now \nwe just take it over to the stovetop and Friday's up. All right. Once the oil\noil comes to temp. I'm going to take a big scoop. Of the batter and\npour it in the oil, kind of just push\nit around a little bit. And then we will\ntake a wider ladle and we'll turn these,\nyou can also use tongs and we're going to fry them \ntill they get pretty brown. Now, if you use only \ntwo apples, you'll have more of a batter than you \nwill the apple. Like I said, I really like to \nhave more apple than batter, but it's totally up\nto you, your preference. And he wanted to get them \nfairly dark and crispy. So about like that, OK, and we're going to\nput them on a plate lined with paper towel. Yeah, I mean. And then after it dries a \nlittle bit on the paper towel, then put it on a wire rack \nto cool, and this will prevent it from getting soggy\nand stay nice and crispy. And now let's make \na simple glaze. I'm just going\nto take some water, about a half a tablespoon \nat first, add some powdered sugar and then just mix\nthis with a fork and then add\na little bit more. Water is necessary to get the \nthickness that you want. And that's about a cup cup and \na half of powdered sugar, a little bit more water. All right. That is really nice and thick, so that is a good \nglaze right there. And you may even\njust a little bit more winds up being \nabout two tablespoons. All right, awesome. Now we have our glaze, \nwe'll just take the apple fritter and dip it in that glaze. Make sure you have\nclean hands or use tongs and then put it back on \nyour way, Iraq and it will drain. You also could just take a \nspoon and grab some glaze and pour it all over. The Frita. However you want to do it, \ndip it or pour it. Awesome. And there we go. It won't take too long for that \nglaze to dry and then you can eat them and now once the \nglaze dries, you can also roll these in like a cinnamon sugar \nmixture or sprinkle powdered sugar on top if you want to \ngrab one and take a bite. Mm hmm. I get that awesome. All right, the apple fritters \nare done and turned out fantastic. This recipe makes somewhere \nbetween nine and 12 apple fritters depending on \nthe size. You make them really\neasy to do simple ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it. I'm Matt Taylor. This has been another episode \nof In the Kitchen with Matt. Thank you for joining \nme as always.

take your swerve confectioner sugar water and mix it in here okay you ever just have the best day ever like you know the best day ever it's just going so great and you're like dude why is my day going so well the glaze on it it's not like how i poured it on it actually looks like a glaze it's hardened up it's firmed up you might be wondering why i have a suit on right now it's not a suit i'm just really black and you're racist and before y'all say report of the week oh you sell out you you copied report of the week go to your camera flip it around and just look at yourself you're looking real stupid right now i hadn't even heard of report of the week until a while back when i copied it i'm just kidding by the way i was actually on the phone with will a couple weeks ago because we're trying to set up a collab he was on facetime and he flipped the camera by accident and i see his youtube analytics this dude has way more subs than i thought he had sorry about that camera cut off but i think he got everything so we're good look at this piece of crap this thing it broke up into a million pieces i still gotta hold all this mess in my hands at least it's not gonna be as bad as when i was mixing it but it's still gonna suck this clump of cells clocks in at 402 calories 9 grams of fat 66 grams of carbs 9 grams of fiber and 32 grams of protein hey you hey yo stop skipping ads see you look at my eyes let's call being dead inside because you're skipping ads bro okay i keep forgetting that this thing is already broken but look oh why is that so spicy it's like i poured hot sauce in it what the heck wait a minute but i measured everything out there's no way i screwed this up it has like this weird clumpiness to it and it's dry as heck i'm just playing gotcha boy got your girl got all you maybe you thought i was lying i don't know maybe i hope i i hope i got you i hope you i hope you're sitting on the couch like not the couch but the bed or where where could you you're probably in the bathroom aren't you yeah you're in the back oh you know you ain't slick i know you're in the bathroom look at you shame on you using the bathroom it's got this lovely spice to it and it is addicting to eat now i will say it's lacking a little bit of moisture i definitely dropped something just now and the whole thing's brown so it's gonna match my carpet i won't be able to find it i'm screwed it tastes so calorie dense it doesn't even make sense like logically it doesn't it doesn't make sense scientifically either what the heck is this i got one complaint when i just ate the apple and this gonna sound real stupid so look forward to that when i bit into the apple it tasted like an apple when i have an apple fritter i like to kind of forget that i'm eating an apple if that makes sense all the ingredients blend together and then it's just a hint of apple flavor it was basically like the apple juice was squirted in my mouth the glaze takes way more calorie dense than the apple fritter the sugar which just assaulting my mouth but in a good way even the moment i sink my teeth into it it is already melting like that that is just now hold up i tried the glaze on its own way too intense way i could not just shove that down my gullet i couldn't do it it's just too it's what it is it is like sugar had a baby with stevia and then stevia met some syrup and they all just um they all just morphed together they just they just nuclear fission into the sauce added a little water and then they added a stick of dynamite not saying it's disgusting either it had a good flavor it was just like god stop it it was a salt in my mouth but in a bad way but also in a good way that's a weird thing it doesn't even make sense it tasted good but the intensity was too much now that now it makes sense you get it you know you've had some pleasure before where it's like it's too much like endorphins you're working out the gym and it's just like you get that rush and you gotta stop real quick man this thing is crispy as heck listen to this i'm so sad it's almost over bro oh that's why it annoys me when jesse james west is like last buy best fight that's like saying last paycheck best paycheck what is crunching like a granola bar in my mouth like a granola bar did you hear me guys i can describe the texture perfectly right now watch this if you've ever held a macaroon that's what this feels like right now when i take a bite of this it's like a surge a surge of power in my veins i know i can't hit my veins that quick but it's just something about it it's like it's so sweet you remember that little shot in the beginning that i'm gonna show you again because it took a lot of time that apple floating up in the air and coming down all chopped the bowl slides over yeah and if you don't appreciate it that's good that's cool don't worry about it yeah just go ahead and unsubscribe just get get the heck off my channel you know what i'm saying we got a little schmuck apple check it out and this next thing i'm about to say it's gonna sound like a complete joke but you gotta believe me i didn't get on camera but i was trying to film a spoonful of the apple fritter mixture my fingers just release almost like somebody just let go for me i i didn't tell my body to do that i didn't send the electrical impulse to do that and it just dropped into my mouth i'm not even kid look don't look at me like that i'm being serious man come on i will say the spiciness was way more intense so i definitely prefer it cooked more than the raw version but i know some versions of raw foods like meat taste better than the cooked version actually leave it in there just leave it in when you say stupid crap on camera just leave it in don't even edit it out don't and you know what else i said it with complete confidence you see this face you think i'm hesitating saying that raw meat tastes delicious and cooked meat can go jump off a cliff i mean that yo i'm wearing a suit this is a side effect of eating this i got all this residue on my hands and my watch band my getified watch band just broke again it is so close to being like 395 calories and don't even act like the difference between 395 and 402 in your head doesn't seem substantial look i just want to speak english in a free country nine grams of fat nine grams of fiber that's spectacular you know why because i love when you get to not completely get rid of fat you get to keep your hormones in check instead of you know throwing them in the toilet now i may be wrong about this but i remember hearing a while back fat is more so for long-term satiation protein it's a little more instantaneous but the filling-ness goes away faster when you combine fat and protein you get the best of both worlds and then you got the fiber fiber's filling too by the way i was completely joking about that call with william tennyson however i'd be completely open to it you seem like a cool guy and we could make the best video of all time william tennyson you are not obligated to work with me i understand if you hate me as a human just please tell me the truth tell me you hate me tell me the facts let me know how much you despise me go subscribe to william tennyson he's working harder than a news corporation trying to spin a story to suit the political narrative and if you're like josh that's a stretch i just stripped completely naked in between those two clips i could be naked right now you don't even know you don't even know this could be a green screen i'm wearing a green screen you don't even know you don't even know and you're like oh of course it's real look he can pull it like this you could pull a green screen i could be lying maybe i'm not i could just chop the clip and you would never know never never ever but now you're questioning you're like wait a minute was he naked was he actually i don't know was i you all know you don't know nothing that is the power of editing always get the full story always get the full contacts i could still be naked i could only have the jacket it might not even go around my back it could literally just be a jacket taped to the front of my body you wouldn't even know you can't see behind me no no i'm done i'm done that pretty much wraps up this video and i hope you all have a blessed day", "pj4qa8BR15U": "[Music] today we're going to make apple fritter but before we can get to this point where we have dough left we do our regular donuts we cut our rings our bismarcks long johns twists cinnamon rolls and at the end of the day there's always no left over from that is that's what we make our apple fritter with so we have about three pound eight ounce piece of dough here that we're going to chop up roughly we put about 10 ounces of apple pouch filling cinnamon to color into flavor and as we chop it and we feel it's too wet we can always add flour in to dry it up a little bit we also use flour to put on the bottom of the donut before we put it on the screen very lightly so that it doesn't stick to the screen as we proof it up so now we have the grip the mix big pieces small pieces very easy to do put a little flour down so that we can start to roll it into a log and from that point we just cut off spices probably about three ounces so like i said we can put a little flour down just tap them in there and we put them on the screen and now it's time to glaze the fritters so since i'm only doing a few i'm going to dip them into our thinnest set glaze however you can use whatever glazing method works best for your shop i just set them in gently and bring them over you can see how the glaze starts out a little thick it drips off you can see all the really lovely nooks and crannies these are gorgeous really for the fall or anytime and there we are placed apple fritters [Music] you", "bSQj4gK7Zrs": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to share with you my recipe for you can call it apple fritters but you can also call apple donuts whatever your heart desires and I'm gonna say if you're from around here from Jersey then you'll know there's sort of like two types of doughnuts that you're gonna get if you go to like an apple farm or any fall get-together or if you love a Wawa and you know what I'm talking about you either get at the classic round apple cider donuts which I've got a recipe on my website already or you get an apple fritter now I already have an episode on apple fritters which I love and they are a little bit easier to make because they're not using the Easter dough but these have the flavor of an apple doughnut with a texture of a fritter does that make sense phenomenal you're gonna love it it's not a difficult difficult or complicated recipe it's a little bit more time-consuming because you are making a yeast dough but you know me it's gonna be easy my yeast dough I always get told or foolproof and I am thrilled to hear that because if it's not then I will make it let me want you to really ingredients don't need for the dough which is all-purpose flour sugar salt some more milk melted butter active dry yeast another little pinch of sugar and you'll need some eggs these are gonna be the ingredients that you will use to make the dough and then you'll need Apple's butter brown sugar cinnamon and flour to make the filling then we fry in some veg oil then you can either glaze or do like I do with cinnamon sugar on the outside I'm tellin you phenomenal let's get going on activating the east you wanna make sure that your milk is not too hot or not too cold to it we're gonna add the sugar and the yeast and we're just gonna set these aside for about five to ten minutes or until that proves and you'll see it's trust to get foamy on top and all smell really really strong in the meantime I am gonna make this in my standing mixer with a dough hook just because it makes my life easier I'm gonna add all of my dry ingredients in and then once the yeast is ready I'll show you the next step that is perfect you can see it's really foamy and it's really fragrant so that's how you know that you're in a good spot okay everything comes in at 1:00 I know I'm telling you if it's my recipes it's not gonna be difficult if it's complicated I won't do it these are my eggs me and me this little stormy from our fresh eggs not the cutest thing you've ever seen or what beautiful one of those in and now it's very simple you let the mixer do the work it's just gonna need for a few minutes or until the dough comes together and it's nice and smooth I'm gonna take this bowl I'm not even gonna clean it out I'm gonna just rub it with a little bit of oil so that it's ready and then I'll show you what it'll fit my son that's beautiful all right it's gonna go in here and this is just gonna rise until doubled and I'll show you what it looks like when it's day I'm just gonna cover it with plastic wrap all right let's work on the Apple portion of the doughnut you need some diced apples I'm using Honey Crisp it's but we always have on hand I love to bake with Honey Crisp a little butter brown sugar cinnamon and some flour in this I'm telling you could not be easier I love love love apple pie filling like you know that's sweet sticky apples like goo so good but I don't like it from a can I don't think it tastes like apple it's not my kind of thing but if you like it then just use a can of apple pie filling instead of this and you'll be fine but to me it tastes nothing like it and it doesn't take very long at all I just add everything but the flour I'm just gonna mix everything really really well and you'll see that the apples are gonna really release a lot of their own juices and they'll start bubbling like crazy and you just want that to cook together for about once it comes to a boil a rolling boil about four to five minutes you don't want the apples to turn to applesauce you still want them to retain some of their texture all right once it came to a boil I let it cook for about four minutes now I'm gonna add some flour now I always do a little bit at a time because depending on the apples that you're using some of them can render out a lot of their own juices and some are you know some some a little bit less so I'll show you what the texture is that you're looking for it'll look really really dry but you got to keep in mind that these are gonna be fried and you don't really want a wet mixture to mix in with your dough so do that almost there so I would say in total you'll need a couple tablespoons almost where I want it and you just continue to cook this while stirring until you no longer see any row yeah that's perfect any raw bits of flour and I'm just gonna transfer this to a bowl and let it cool completely while my dough Rises and that's it all right my dough rows just about double in size it took about an hour and a half I took it out of here and I was ready to excited I forgot to show you what it look like in the bowl but it's fine know what it looks like I'm just flattening it out with my hands and this has come gonna all look messy and crazy but trust me when I tell you it works we've got our filling that's been cooling here I've got a baking sheet with some parchment paper and some flour additional flour and another baking sheet I just flatten this out till it's about a half an inch thick and then I take a pizza cutter there's really no I mean the way I do these probably not the way most people do them but I can't stand to do anything to complicate it the point is I just cut the dough into small pieces so I can incorporate it better with the filling and I'll show you it just works out really well you'll think to yourself why did you cut it makes no sense you're gonna mix it anyway because it just helps mix it with the feeling easier if I want to just add the whole thing to go in here it'll be kind of really difficult to tip mix and let it all in seam right in there with the with the hook the girl hook then you're gonna add your filling I know it looks great but if you follow me this ceramic will have seen that I made these a couple weeks ago and they work very well trust me you're gonna mix this until it's been incorporated I'll show you what it looks like just like this sprinkle a little bit of flour as this is going so that it kind of helps pull it together I also switch to a paddle works better than the dough hoe and then what I do want to just take these out okay babies out of here and I'm just gonna work with these a little bit all my work surface you can see that it looks like a mess but trust me I know it looks crazy but it does work because you want really it's kind of a really interesting texture actually it's not gonna be like a round donut so and you want it to be on the little bit of the wet side it's gonna be wonderful I have a scale ready because I have to I'm gonna weigh these out to about 2 ounces apiece because any bigger and they're really hard to fry and get them cooked evenly so I've got a bench scraper here like that see beautiful this weird texture is exactly what you want and if you've had these before then you'll know what I mean when I say that ok turn my scale on I can't see okay Alyce's let's see see how strange they look but that's what you want oh four ounces too big because remember these are gonna these are gonna rise again that's good okay flour your surface here you'll be thankful you did this trust me I know they look weird but you see that right there that's what you're looking for I'm just gonna go ahead and form the rest of them you can see what I'm doing is I'm just kind of gathering them in my hands good I gather them in my hands and then I just sort of flattened them into a little disc and then what I do is I little bit of flour on the top and then I'm cover these loosely with a kitchen towel and let them rise until nice and puffy I'll show you what it looks like when they are there ah no I already gave you one right there she is just ready to fry up some fritters you can see they have risen quite a lot and there are a little bit fragile oh thanks but don't touch the others this is one of yours I've got my oven my oven my oil nice and hot you guys know I like to reuse my oil Fitz clean you want to write about 350 you don't want it higher than that because you will scorch them but you also don't want it any lower because then those just soak up so much grease and it'll take a few minutes on each side you want them to be a beautiful golden color I will show you what they look like when they're done you're gonna take them out and place them on a paper towel lined plate platter baking sheet yes it's so sticky I just gave him one so that she could play with it and she's an absolute to heaven she wanted to do this with me earlier but you know I was a very messy job and I just was not prepared to deal with them all of that so I'm just gonna keep okay great I'm gonna keep my eye on these these are not ready to flip yeah they're gonna get there we'll just do a few at a time until they're all done alright these three just came on I just came out of the oil once you put them on your paper towel lined with you know your paper towel to absorb any excess oil you just dip them into cinnamon sugar now some places have them here maybe I'll put them over here for you some places have them dipped in a glaze which you can do which is just powdered sugar with a little bit of milk I much much much prefer cinnamon sugar but hey the world is your pickable you do whatever your heart desires yeah have a little bit go ahead and mommy's coming got a lot of cleanup to do I'm just going to bite into one that's enough honey that's enough I'm just gonna bite into one because well you know it's really hot though look at that I mean is that perfect or what it is so fluffy perfectly cooked through I'm not bringing it apart but I really want you to see and you see how it kind of breaks apart almost like monkey bread because we cut it up into small pieces you just have to make these that's the texture that you want you haven't lived your best fall life until you've made these trust me rock are you they are worth every minute of effort you want more flour yeah I don't think you need more flour I know where it is but I think you need any more laurainthekitchen.com has the recipe for you go get it I hope you enjoy strange sandwich [Music] you [Music]", "Crc9OKhpuNE": "I'll be rolling rolling I'll be smoking too Oh gasps my stash like I'm rolling in a stolen truck yeah you know sure we see the great thing is the bait Bank doe - jeez well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another strain review today we are checking out another one from Lumpy's another one a few um peas in the past but it's been a minute since we did one I want to say the last one we did was the Cali berry right yes we did the Cali berry a few months ago something like that bring it to you Lumpy's apple fritter and when i crack the jar I see perc a little bit of perp in there for sure and what is it it smells it smells along the lines of the dogs walls but is not quite that so I would say it smells kind of pervy yeah so it's supposedly apple fritters supposedly sour apple and animal cookies okay and then I think the sour apple I know it has I think it's sour D in Sydney 99 okay so yeah that's that's a nice lineage I don't know what sour apple is but there's animal cookies there's some diesel in there I just told you what sour apple is Cindy 99 Sour Diesel I'm sorry there you go sorry I agree though all the all the parents that went into that one every all stuff I would want to smoke on its own you know so that's usually a good start exactly it's better that then has like og cross with blue dream and I'm like oh why'd you go and do that - oh gee you know dude this smell is really similar to that dogs walls from from elemental wellness back in the day which is we that I love I love this turf it's actually kind of rare I feel like you know it's almost like the herbal turf but a little different yeah you definitely for me I definitely get those like sour II kind of fuelie notes in the beginning but then it's kind of more of like a sweet creamy thing like you're talking about you know I'm almost getting like as I've just broke that up I kind of got like almost like a little cheesy funk or something you know I'm really trippin on the snow guys like I like it there's many layers to it there's layers to that's a good word to describe it there's layers to the smell I'm gonna go ahead and light this joints I forgot we had it rolled I really want to taste this stuff I love me some purp great game in this thing I wonder how far we are into this video there's always somebody that comments down below the exact time and moment that one of us takes our first rip because if we're on top of our [ __ ] it's usually a minute two men in 30 seconds most of time it's usually two minutes and a half minutes and people were like hey I thought you guys were gonna [ __ ] smoke in these videos I don't you guys did high no we just blab on we're just blab blab blab but lighten up this Jeffrey here gonna get high let's see how it tastes huh definitely a good burpy I get purp on the inhale but you do get a little bit of that like almost gas eNOS I'm guessing it's coming from the sour apple or the sour deep very smooth out of the bone I like it the first and this will hit off the joints Barry I get a perfect flavor guys almost like yeah it's sweet like a sweet candy like a like a Laffy Taffy ah that's a little extreme but if I had to tie it to some it's almost like a great walkie-talkies yeah I kind of like that dogs waltz comparison that you drew cuz one that's a strain I haven't smoked in forever and I really missed back in the days when elemental had fire in San Jose that was one of our favorite strains to get from them similar parents I guess I left the cam yeah and then a vertical rise at the Kemp sister of the herbal I don't know after days Ray's dog yeah I think it was Charles about an Urkel so you get kind of that fuelly kind of more pungent thing going on from the chem whereas in this strain you have it with the sour and then you know got the cookies bringing in some of those may be sweet perk Terps not like truth no I can pure Oracle but it's a little very very hint in there to man and wife you know coming from that like great D flavor I'm getting but I almost got like a little berry flavor and there's really good guys yeah lots of lots of depth I feel like to the smells and the flavor of this stuff yeah it's been a while I think since we it may have not I don't know but I think it's been a while since we have we had honestly the best characteristic of this weed to me is the smell so far yeah the taste is good don't get me wrong but the smell I sat there and tripped on it for a minute different smell is what I am always going for you know it's always my number one criteria this strain actually won the cannabis cup a couple of years ago I want to say 2016 pack that for hell yeah y'all this trade year there you go there you go fair's fair yeah but this one the cup a couple of years ago that one was hitting out like 25 percent THC this one right here is coming in at 21.5 1/4 cultivated on 1213 package on 114 so Wow we picked this up a couple of weeks bail it's sitting on it took forever to do these reviews but I'm surprised it still has this good Terps after being packaged about four or five months ago that's really good I mean it stays like 70 degrees in hearing some of the dispensaries I'm sure go a little hot you know one of at least like that not the nice ones but yeah but we've only had it for a week or two and you know the shop it's still really they had it for four months before that so it's not usually when we get weed that was packaged a few months ago in California it's gonna be dry it's gonna be stale that's good the nose isn't gonna be there the way it is on this so I'm definitely impressed this has kind of been I don't want to say their flagship strain but one of their biggest strains over the last I don't know year - maybe longer sure this is the one that really put Lumpy's on the map for me personally and I think there's a lot of other people know yet for sure this is only my second time having it not gonna lie but the first time I believe was like you know beginning in this year maybe even like December something like that and fire both times like he said the freighter you talk about yeah the apple fritter is that what I said yeah I just didn't know if you meant Lumpy's in jail no no no that was for yeah yeah I've had Lumpy's a few other times Cali berry few of their other ones this is my first time trying the apple fritter I saw a batch of it before like one of my buddies just had like one left over and it was like a nicer nug as I look at this stuff it's some you know some of these bugs are a little bit smaller in these this particular jar that I'm looking at not necessarily the tightest no nuts what we're dense at least these particular notes sometimes if you get some like bottom or like more side note right they might just look like that if we were to see some tops of this it might be a totally different story yeah I don't know if I had to get down on rating this one I really like it I like this strain in general I think this is super fire I'm not sure if this is I do I know this isn't the best batch they've ever grown you know if you just want to go based on test results they've definitely grown more potent looking backwards some of the photos I've seen on their Instagram and from other people online I got I got a crazy little you know it's crazy sorry I just totally cut you off yeah go ahead what are you saying go ahead uncle Gard okay oh you know you're a Buddhist daughter you know how a [ __ ] beer has this always like 3.4 whatever the push there it's crazy how we can't get weed like that and do you think we will see a day that we do being that we can be able to grow apple fritter at parking the same percentage every single time well I mean there's so many variables with growing wheat everybody tell me that things are gonna be a little bit different and I think it's way easier I think it's way easier to control like every single just about every single very when you're brewing so you're saying that we will see the day no I'm saying that I don't I think that I think you can control way more of the important variables when making beer obviously I've never [ __ ] made beer I don't know anything about it but this is just what I do right now me too there are way more variables with ie just being that every strain is different yeah each one has different optimum requirement exactly I don't I don't think we're gonna see the day either I need to be able to grow the same plant at the same THC percentage every time that's not going to happen especially when you have the genetic getting weaker and weaker as you clone down I just don't see it happening all you scientists out there please prove us wrong or otherwise or other known or whatever the [ __ ] other stupid English anyways I almost rate this stuff yeah I was gonna say the best thing about this one like you kind of alluded to earlier is the nose for sure that's the first I mean and for being packaged four or five months ago and still smelling this good yeah obviously it was dried and cured properly even perfectly I would say it's keeping alone I would have loved to smell this on the plant or smell it like right after it was like fresh isn't you know at packaging time it's just to see if it was even more crazy and I love doing I would have loved to just rub the sugar that's the best part about growing at so that's the one thing I miss the most about growing is just being able to like just smell the evolution of the Terps knowing what it smells like at early the flowers date of the fire late flower stages and then like you know the color starts to turn yeah and then like once you cut it down and like after the chop and then how it how that kind of flavor just kind of like changes to that final project you know I like being able to see that evolution and like you're talking about just walking in there and doing that form is amazing so yeah we got a 10 on the smell Wow this stuff gets me high man I'm like really high sorry for the stunt 110 on the smell what's next flavor flavors not far behind but super smooth it's very smooth it could just be like more more beautiful white ash it beautiful white ass definitely that's for sure hundred percent so flavor I'm gonna give it eight I'm just gonna grab this a V you could just be more I'm gonna go with the word more really it could be it could be just more pungent I like the flavor on this one I think it's pretty good I did like it a little bit better out of the bomb than the joy let me give it one more bigger but yeah I'm gonna stick with a eight because we're running out of time on this damn video effect effects good I'm just now assessing it like I'm pretty pretty Spacey pretty a bomb-ass song right now it's very creative very uplifting it doesn't make me want to just sit here and be lazy all day so I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it it I'm gonna give it a 9 I actually really like the high so overall I'm gonna give it I don't know if those average out - I'm gonna give it a 9 9 9 so as far as the buzz goes I cheated a little bit on this one and I smoked some a couple of days ago we kind of split these last couple notes we had up and in between these jars so we could do this video or whatever but it definitely hits me like that at first it's kind of like uplifting euphoric very like clear motivational I guess I don't know what the right word for it is but it's very like uplifting at first but at least for me when I smoked it the other day it just completely did a 180 on me like mmm and then maybe 30 minutes 45 minutes after smoking it because I was feeling like this last time I smoked it a couple of days ago then the coffin in 30 minutes later yeah yeah I guess I'm coffee'd up right now I could have something to do that overall overall I'm gonna give this a solid nine and a half nine point five yeah I like the flavor on it the smell 10 flavor I'm giving that like a 9 buzz I'm giving you no flu Niner ten everything about this is pretty much a 9/10 so I'm gonna go nine point five it's good we apple fritter from lumpy shoutout to Lumpy's for growing some good weed yeah I look forward to trying another batch of this this is something I would definitely buy me too Lumpy's apple fritter from your sister pick this up by the way at atrium down in a Southern California we actually did a dispensary tour on them a couple of weeks ago with that so check it out right up here somewhere over there check it out he'll definitely let us know what you guys want to see us review next put that down in the comments if there's a strain that you have Jalen's for us to review now is the time to let us know he's rambling yeah I might I'm showing you how to throw the Gees up right now it's like they're grabbing some titties I'm Danny guys he's Shane for the CCC 4/20 right hi hey see ya no nice home yet if I told you would I had my bag that [ __ ] will be a palm tree I got more flavors than letters this in the Alfa [ __ ] star no mids around my circle no we ain't allowed", "AsxvK4kB2KY": "[Music] i can't be mad at how these things turned out this is what my life has come to what's up everybody my name is ethan thanks for clicking on the video today so today's video is gonna be broken up into two parts it's about six in the morning right now and i'm going to be doing a challenge later in the day but first we got to have our pre-workout meal will tennyson dropped an apple burger a little over a week ago and i haven't gotten around to trying it yet and i'm really interested as to how it tastes because i am a huge huge fan of apple fritters as well as donuts but that's his thing i'll clean apple fritters actually i shouldn't he's the one that came up with the recipe never mind so this recipe won't take as long to make i'm gonna quickly whip it together i'm gonna show you the calories macros taste test all the good stuff only difference that i'm gonna be doing today is i'm gonna be using a vanilla protein i don't have apple pie protein that's what he uses in his video and he admits that doesn't taste as good as an apple pie protein but tell you what it's an apple fritter it's gonna be great after we make our pre-workout meal i'm gonna head over to my parents and we're gonna take on the murph challenge you guys may or may not be familiar with it if you're not stick around till later in the video and i'll break everything down for you guys if you haven't already please drop a like down below smash the subscribe button we are almost at a thousand i want to say this real quick in my brulee puff video i made a goal that we are going to get to 500 subscribers before my birthday which was less than a week ago we're almost at 900. we are almost at 900. if we can get to a thousand by new year's i don't really know what i'm gonna do what what should my thousand subscriber special be i mean i'm not trying to be like oh i'm definitely going to get there but you guys are showing crazy support we're picking up momentum i want to do something special let's make a cool video so comment down below if you've got a suggestion but in the meantime let's go over everything we're going to need to make this recipe happen today [Music] so like i said guys we're going to keep this really quick really simple first thing you guys are going to need is some plain white flour next up you're going to want swerve confectioners sugar as well as swerve brown sugar you're going to want the lowest calorie butter you can find i'm using i can't believe it's not butter 35 calories a tablespoon good stuff next up you're gonna want some baking powder you're gonna want cinnamon non-stick cooking spray zero calorie it's not really zero calorie but we're not going to be using a ton so it's gonna be kind of irrelevant plain non-fat greek yogurt you're gonna want nutmeg you are also gonna want half an apple you can use whatever apple you'd like kitchen weapons required today you are going to need a knife yes you're gonna want a cutting board you're also gonna need a bowl to mix everything in as well as a whisk if you don't have a whisk you can use a fork the whisk is gonna do a little bit of a better job though last two things you guys are gonna need is a food scale as well as an air fryer if you guys are interested in the ones that i use i have links to them down below they're super reliable and they're super inexpensive so if you're interested you have your options that is everything you guys are going to need let's get started first thing you guys are going to want to do is grab yourself an apple as well as your knife we're only going to be using half the apple so cut it in half and then cut into smaller pieces all right set these aside we're going to use them in a bit i opted to eat the rest of the apple grab your food scale throw a bowl on top first thing we're going to do is add 30 grams of an all-purpose white flour now add 30 grams of a whey protein of your choice 24 grams of swerve brown sugar zero calorie one teaspoon of baking powder i did it again guys forgot to mention an ingredient you're also gonna need some salt we're gonna throw in a quarter teaspoon half a teaspoon of cinnamon i went a little heavy on the cinnamon i really like it now you want to put in about an eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg that is it for our dry ingredients grab yourself a whisk or a fork or whatever it is you choose to use mix everything up the anabolic diet has evolved man we started out with just french toast ice cream and a pizza and a little pita bread and now we've just evolved into things like apple fritters cookie dough apple pie you guys seriously need to check that pie out it's killer now we're going to add one tablespoon of butter mine's been sitting out for a little while so it's kind of melted if yours is really hard mike it for 15 seconds so it's a little soft mix the butter in for a while will says you're looking for a consistency that's kind of along the lines of a wet sand right don't you guys like eating wet sand just me okay once you have your wet sand we want to add 42 grams of greek yogurt so throw your bowl right back on your scale hit zero should probably grab a spoon now mix again well will does mix it with his hands in the video so maybe we should just ditch the whisk hold on last thing you guys are going to want to do is grab yourself the apples you cut up earlier dump them right in all right mix it in you're gonna want something that resembles this time to fire up the air fryer now what you guys want to do is set your air fryer to 375 and preheat it for five minutes let's do it pop open your air fryer and hit it with some non-stick now you have the option to make one large apple fritter or two small ones i'm gonna go with two small ones i do suggest you guys use a rubber spatula it's going to make getting everything off the sides much easier and you're not going to be wasting any of your batter in they go now you want to throw them in for 15 minutes three two one go last thing you guys want to do is make the icing what that's going to consist of is half a tablespoon of water as well as two tablespoons of swerved confectioners sugar i already got some water in here so i'm just going to quickly scoop some and mix it in icing that takes two seconds that right there is one of your apple fritters they don't hold together great so if you pull it out of the airfryer you might get a piece that breaks off but who cares the consistency is there and i'm assuming the taste is as well because these things are smelling the room up like an apple fritter smells amazing so we're just going to take our icing and we're just going to coat each of them though they don't hold together that well i can't be mad at how these things turned out so in each individual apple fritter if you decided to make two small ones you were looking at 265 calories three grams of fat 44 grams of carbs as well as 16 grams of protein that's not bad for an apple fritter so if you have two of these you're looking at just double that and that's going to be about a meal for you so we're just going to grab this guy right here mop up some of that icing of course time for the taste test guys cheers [Music] that hits hard that hits hard dude as good as these things taste as delicious as they are my only problem is there's a couple pockets within each of them or at least this one that have a couple of dry spots like the apple adds the moisture and when you get a bite you get a ton of apple it's perfect delicious when you get a bite that doesn't have a lot of apple in it it's a little dry it's a little you know requires a thug jug drink a gallon of water a day no exceptions to the rule you guys already know this my only suggestion to you guys would be to add the entire apple as opposed to half it's gonna be an additional 40 50 calories it's gonna add the moisture and the texture that this thing needs to be a perfect perfect ten right now i'll give it an eight and a half give it a nine the dryness is slightly off-putting but it's delicious absolutely delicious recommend it add a little bit more apple the icing and show simple gonna make such a difference i'm also not too thrilled as to how this thing kind of falls apart but like i said i'm not huge on consistency if it tastes good and if it's low calorie i'm usually satisfied and i'm super happy with this there's maybe one or two tweaks that we can make that'll perfect this apple fritter but it's an apple fritter and we got one that's anabolic so definitely try this out i'm gonna finish this up i may or may not have that second one then i'm gonna go to my parents and we're gonna do our murph challenge see you guys in a bit so we're at my parents whoa hold on not done yet um i decided to eat the second apple fritter and it occurred to me to remind you guys do not cook this for 15 minutes that's what i did initially and they burned a little bit so put it in for 12 that'll leave the inside a little under done not even really under done but it just traps a little bit more moisture it's going to be a better bite you'll enjoy it more okay back to the show so we are at my parents house i'm about to do the murph challenge for those of you unfamiliar what the murph challenge is it is a one mile run followed up by 100 pull-ups can't do it off the top of my head 100 pull-ups 200 push-ups and 300 air squats followed by another one-mile run all while wearing a 20-pound weight vest i don't have a weight vest so we're making up with it with two 10-pound weights plates whatever the average time of completing this challenge is 47 to 57 minutes my assumption is i'm probably going to fall within that range towards 57 because i'll tell you what i can bang out push-ups i can bang out air squats the achilles heel is gonna be the pull-ups i suck at those you're gonna see that real soon we're wasting daylight i wanna get started i'm gonna have a timer running on my phone all right let me throw this zest on real quick oh no yeah so in terms of tracking distance i do not have my fitbit it's dead slash missing so looping around the development once i get to about that point it's going to be about 0.52 miles obviously about a half a mile so i'm going to go around twice once i get back here it's going to be about a mile 0.04 i don't care if i run a little extra but for the sake of being accurate that's my unit of measurement um weight's on we're killing daylight i don't know if y'all can see this but as soon as i hit this timer we're getting started so three two one go see you guys so you guys saw we got some eyes in the sky we got our throne the sun's setting in about 45 minutes and we just started the challenge i don't think i'm gonna be able to get shots in the second run we're gonna do our best we're really sucked this weight it's like smacking my tailbone with every step oh my god my back is gonna hurt so bad actually [Music] 16 52 it doesn't help that's like 25 degrees [Music] i'm gonna breathe for a few seconds so i'm thinking the push-up shouldn't be a huge problem i'm used to those i need to do the pull-ups i'll probably just split those with um with the air squats that way i'm getting totally different body parts i'm not exhausting one part all right timer's gonna be right here [Music] that's gonna be the worst [Music] oh [Music] yep [Music] nice back let's see what happens [Music] ah 35 so 135 oh this video is sponsored by thug jug buy one oops [Music] seven right uh eight i think i'm at 33. you're at 80 push-ups 135 [Music] that's 30. that was six [Music] huh 80 push-ups [Music] so that's pushups it's like hard to get up you like this who needs hair though you just gotta sweat i'm going to do this from now on [Music] that was a 35 so i'm at 30 for pull to 40. 39. it's my time 35 minutes okay i don't know i just always suck the pull-ups always 46 i think a couple of those suck [Music] so i have 70 air squats left 70 push-ups and 55 it's close [Music] okay 260. it's like laying on its face too good though lazy and breathe now [Music] [Music] like the damn video i just hate how this thing pulls on my shoulders yeah it's like really red you barely breathe with this thing yeah yeah right i'm not even exchanging the weights the bags going in there the bag's not too bad we upgraded hello darkness my old friend four damn it dude these bullets are gonna keep me for another half hour you know my weak points what am i 150 for push-ups i am literally taking one minute to breathe this is what my life has come too 42 32 you're at 15 minutes i'm already at 50 minutes killing it i can't get myself up you okay yeah yeah he's filming no i'm just freaking he's doing it i'm good okay trying to breathe i'm trying man we need to finish this how many five left 38 hold on 32 32. i'm so weak right now i'm gonna try something real quick it probably won't work that more the achilles heel man i told you i called it now i know one of my weakest points mine's my legs [Applause] more five that was the worst form you've ever seen ask me how much i care okay so obviously pull-ups sucked took like 20 minutes away from me we had an hour and three minutes pitch black outside so we're probably not getting any drone footage whatever time to go your proteins here all right time to go i don't know if anyone can see me on this phone we got about half a mile left we're gonna finish strong i know the pull ups consumed a lot more time than i would've liked but we're gonna finish strong we're not gonna stop running it's like 20 degrees out and i am burning a lot let's go baby oh boy we're mobile now let's go let's get it do it i'm gonna die yo look at the box look at that we have a quarter mile left hold on i got 118 keep going almost there let's go meet you there let's go i'm gonna beat you there yeah right [Music] 123 49. how do you feel i don't know no let's go inside we'll talk in a bit i'll prepare goes all right we'll talk in a bit all right so i just got back to my house i showered i ate i'm unwinding right now and i'll tell you what as sore as i am the most painful part of my body is my butt the reason for that is the freaking plates in my backpack were just every time i took a step they would just hit my tailbone they were bouncing off my tailbone and it's red it's scraped up whatever but man it's freaking tender but guys i had a lot of fun with this challenge i had fun trying will's apple fritters we got to be creative with this video today and i hope to do a lot more of this stuff in the future but for all you that have made it this far in the video i want to say thank you because this took a lot of editing a lot of time a lot of teamwork with a few other people that were helping out with filming keeping track of the exercises now look i know my form was not perfect i know my form wasn't perfect i was trying to get as good as possible but if i tried getting perfect form i wouldn't have completed this challenge i wouldn't have this exposed a lot of my weak points i now know that i need to do more freaking pull-ups i know that now but for those of you that made it this far in the video i appreciate the hell out of you i feel like i say it a lot in all of my videos and i got a few people that probably roll their eyes and like oh here he goes thanking everybody well yeah i love you guys to death sorry if you haven't already guys please drop a like down below hit the subscribe button ring the bell and leave a comment if you have a suggestion for a video in the future i need to get to bed um got a lot of editing ahead of me tomorrow but i'm excited to get this video out i'm excited for you guys to see it hey until the next challenge video hopefully it's going to be sooner rather than later um i'm going to bed i'll see you guys in the next video take care of yourselves [Music] peace", "TgKWXaJ-Wk4": "[Music] hi youtubers welcome to dinner and desserts my name is kathy and i'm going to walk you through some of my family recipes and show you how to make them they're pretty easy let's go so today's recipe we're gonna make apple fritters everybody loves apple fritters so for our recipe we need three level cups of flour two cups of milk six macintosh apples that we're gonna peel and slice in six eggs we're gonna need a large bowl to mix it all in so i have a bowl here to crack my eggs open in you're gonna need a peeler i like to use a corer for my apples of course a spatula to mix everything and some beaters so what we're gonna do first is we're gonna mix our flour and our milk and our eggs and we're going to mix that with our beaters because we have to do the apples last because apples have a tendency to turn brown if you let them sit too long so if we have everything mixed together we can as we core and slice the apples throw them into the mix that way they won't turn brown so first we're going to put our flour then we're going to add our milk next we're going to do our eggs and the way i like to do my eggs is to crack them into a separate bowl that way if any shells go in you can get them out before it goes into your mix so it doesn't ruin the whole mix because if you have to look for a shell in there you're never going to find it so i have all the eggs in my mix and now i'm going to mix everything together so it's nice and fluffy [Music] so this is pretty much the consistency that we want our mix to be not too many lumps maybe a little bit that's okay we just don't want big thick ones so now we're going to peel our apples these are the macintosh i like the macintosh because they're a little bit tart i don't think you would want a sweet apple in this the tartness is really good and sometimes you can get larger ones which makes it a little bit easier but these are decent sized i think and we're going to peel it and now we're going to pour it i like using a corer okay so if you have a little bit you can always trim it off this is a little bit too thick we want to cut that in half and we're going to throw them right into our mix that way they don't turn brown and we're going to do this with each of the apples so when you cut the apples cut them a long way because if you don't they'll be too chunky and they don't cook as well when they're really thick so but you do want enough that you can taste the apple when you bite into it so our next step is after we mix all the apples make sure they're all coated really well our next step is going to be to fry them i like to use kirkland's olive oil from costco reason being you get two large jugs for twenty dollars which is only ten dollars a jug and it's really cost effective now you're gonna need a lot of oil so that you're gonna be able to cover the apple fritters you will flip them over though we're going to get this going okay this is a good time to put an apron on because you're going to be frying apple fritters and you do not want to get grease on a nice top so what we're going to do is we're gonna put a plate with a couple of paper towels on it that way when our apple fritters are done we can put them on the plate and the paper towels absorb some of the oil now our next step is going to be to fry the apples and mixture and oil and i like using a ladle one scoop should be good you don't want them too big they're harder to flip over this way it comes out nice and crisp and we're just gonna put those into our pan and you should get at least eight to ten apple fritters out of this mix i'm gonna heat up a little to make sure they fry nice and brown and we can keep moving them around just to make sure they're not sticking to the bottom although with my cans thankfully i have never had that problem hopefully you won't either it starts getting too dark the oil then you want to turn your heat down just a little a little bit at a time next we're going to flip our apple fritters and i like using a fork to help guide it because i don't want to get sprayed with oil very painful we're going to flip each of these over so that they're nice and brown this is the color you want them to be that way they're cooked through all right now we're going to check underneath nice and brown that's the way you want it to look and we're going to shake it a little just to get some of the grease off or oil and we're going to do our next batch and if you do have more apples and you have mixed leftover you could always add more apples and make more fritters and that way you're not wasting any of the mix i don't like a lot of the mix around the apples i like more apples in my fritters and this is what our finished product looks like a nice apple fritter and you can serve with a little bit of sugar sprinkled on top or molasses or just the way it is that was my apple fritter recipe thanks for watching hit the like button and subscribe if you'd like to see more

to know for a long time who makes the best fritter now this video was originally 45 minutes long is that I unpacked all of them on camera and analyzed them in depth breaking them down bit by bit I decided to get rid of that and it's still a lengthy video but this is serious business I do not take this lightly so just skip to the end if you want to know the winner but watch all the way through if you are a fritter enthusiast and by the way this is purely based on my own taste also I know I couldn't have possibly tried every fritter in Vancouver but I try my best let me know if I've been

with today we are going to make something that is not that healthy but once in a while you gotta treat yourself we're going to make apple fritter all these things just remind you of your childhood oh let's get started I am using a browned beer for this batter recipe but Prosecco apple cider or sparkling water can be used instead mix in egg yolks and oil then add the sifted flour salt sugar and yeast to let it rest cover for that too now by the family back is arresting I'm going to peel my apples for this recipe you will need four sweet apples which should make about 20 fritters should be enough for six people but all depends how hungry you are and you want to cut each apple into 1/3 inch slices just about 8 millimeters and core apple slices to prevent sliced fruit from turning brown immerse them in water and one lemon juice do likewise is using pineapple slices not new need of lemon juice banana works very well just peel them cut in half and split each portion lengthwise making full banana fritters when your butter has rested now beat your room temperature egg whites with a pinch of salt cream of tartar or a few drops of lemon juice to a soft peak the citric acid stabilizes the meringue then carefully fold the meringue into the batter in two times the use of the yeast by the way and the merengue lighten up the batter making it fluffier once fried set aside a batter and heat up the oil to 375 degrees tonight 190 degrees Celsius remove apple rings and bananas from the water and pat dry over paper towels I guess we are ready to fry deep apple rings of banana into batter fry a few at a time until golden brown it should take about four minutes on each side join on paper towels and sprinkle powdered sugar Shin hos ly although the hot fears you can add a cinnamon if desired to get the full recipe go to Bruno's kitchen that met subscribe please like me on Facebook and follow me on Twitter Instagram and Pinterest and give you a break look at these magnificent apple fritter rings and banana unfortunately as Anna try them out make sure that the recipe is right [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "N9ViMiPBOu0": "well it starts with the dole the Apple the cinnamon you put them together and you chop them up take you know about a minute minute and a half to chop them get it into very small pieces so that those pieces kind of men that is roll them and make them into one and then they rise pieces get too big they break apart and they're unusable so the key is really chop it up fine and get that Apple Cinnamon and don't really chopped up the rolling is where we you take that the dough itself and roll it into into the flip into the fritter so your hand roll it that way you know exactly the consistency of it to loose and they'll fall apart too tight and they won't rise and look at that nice air lock fluffy doughnut cut it and I put on my second layer which puts it in the proof box and take that doughnut we'll go through the proof box for 30 minutes and the proof box will actually drop it into the fryer which is automated as well so push through that fryer what's its salt comes out onto the conveyor and then we have a person that blazes the donor by hand why it why are they so popular is delicious the Apple the cinnamon you know the way we make them still by hand it's brush every single day so you know that it's going to out of our stores that that we supply you're going to get a fresh longer", "NLRgAVod3kQ": "well it's about that time again time for another spin of the bangle of buds here we got two delta nines on here we got the palmetto

favorite kind of donuts so i'm really hoping it tastes like a donut apple fritter holy fuck this thing is hard to open wow these are really weird containers if you push it down too much you can't open it if you don't push it enough you can't open it you gotta push it the right amount anyway oh yeah hey [Music] oh wow that is a nice smell that's very nice hmm that's awesome what a nice smell this kind of have a little bit of an apple to it maybe here we go let's see come on delta nine impress me so close delta nine is there any more in there fuck it's just underweight by 0.01 wait a minute did it get over no it didn't i thought it did but that was just the air no so it's just under it's as small of just under as you can possibly be there we go look there's a couple little scraps in there little bits and we got these four tiny ones this small one that's medium one and this other medium one wow does it ever look nice though look at that look at the cool purples and all that stuff and i can't wait to check this out with a microscope very cool anyways let's check it out with a microscope so this is the outside of the apple fritter and it is nice looking very nice looking it's almost got a nice glaze on it like an actual apple fritter a donut which i love um [Music] [Laughter] it looks really awesome i love the purple man that looks so cool that almost looks like a black leaf right there might be like black mamba or something that's one another one of my favorite strains black mamba i was had that long time ago so good yes here we go some more close-ups here of uh these things see there's like they kind of look kind of old all crinkly and stuff but you know whatever it smells nice this stuff so um delta nine's been around for a long time it just recently showed up in ontario so the weed here is probably not super new it's probably just packaged recently who knows though it looks decent looks good yeah so maybe i'll break open this one here and uh we'll we'll see what it looks like and um we'll see what it looks like when i break it open here we go wow nice hard hard nuggets so here's a look inside these things looking pretty good look at that look at all the tricoms they're clear mostly on the inside some more looks so cool looks so cool look at that wow there we go got some nice close-ups here on these guys oh my god look at these guys look at that that's so cool looking yeah the inside mostly clear the outside mostly cloudy very nice looking very nice smelling so awesome anyways i'm gonna go and try this out now i can't wait i love apple fritters and i've been waiting so long for this delta nine stuff to show up so i'm gonna go check this out and i'll be right back so i just got in from this delta nine apple fritter at 20 what was it 21.46 percent and um i can't believe it but this stuff actually does taste like apples or have like an apple sort of taste to it um it's kind of like i couldn't figure out what type of apple it was either i was like i was kind of leaning towards granny smith but at the same time it's a little different it doesn't have that same little sourness to it or whatever but um it kind of reminds me of like apples but also at the same time apple trees it's kind of like the smell that you have uh when you're uh in an apple orchard picking apples so i'm just freaking crazy that it tastes like apples i can't believe it i didn't quite get the fritter but i got the apple part yeah anyways wow impressive taste as for the high on here though it says 21.46 but it sure doesn't feel like it's quite a low sort of between low and medium the high on here it's a little disappointing in that area so the buds are real nice they're like really super hard see [Laughter] and they uh they sure look nice this one here in that one breaks up decent and uh yeah it's not overly dry it's not wet it's not super dry it's good but at the same time high is just a little disappointing so i don't know i think i might if would i buy this again probably not but um i'm not saying it's bad because i i've i'm really impressed by the taste uh it's just that it doesn't quite get where i want to go it's not powerful enough for what i want which is unfortunate because i wish it was if it was i would buy this a lot because the taste is so cool and it looks so nice it's just too light for me anyways what is there

comes up and that's it for now so we'll see you later have a good one", "8HK6vOHlQ_M": "(soft music) - [Billy] This video was\ncreated in partnership with Franke Kitchen Systems. Hey guys, chef Billy Parisi here, thanks for checking out my YouTube channel and today it is dynamite\nwith this cinnamon and sugar apple fritters recipe. The first thing we need\nto do is make the batter for the apple fritters and\nit's very, very easy to do. We're going to combine all purpose flour with some sugar, of course, for sweetness and baking powder which is going to help make our fritters very fluffy and light and obviously raise really nicely. We're gonna season it up\nwith a little bit of salt. All batter should be seasoned\nwith salt, by the way. And the next thing we're going to do is, using a whisk, we're going to\nmix the ingredients together. This isn't just to the\ningredients combine, it's also to help break up any clumps. We're next going to\nmix our wet ingredients in a separate bowl, so go\nahead and add some eggs along with some whole\nmilk and, using a whisk, we wanna whisk that together\nuntil it is combined and you do this in a separate bowl so that the egg yolk can\nincorporate or, unless you try to put this right into\nthe dry ingredients, you spend most of your time\ntrying to whisk the egg and make sure it's incorporated, so it's best to do it in a separate bowl. Now what we're gonna do is pour it right into our dry ingredients\nand give it a good mix. You can absolutely use\na spoon at this point because the batter is incredibly thick and it does get a little bit hard to stir. You can do it with a\nwhisk but just know that you can do it with a spoon as well. The next thing we're gonna\ndo is give our apples a little bit of a rinse, so gonna roll out my Franke roller mat\nwhich we absolutely love and use on a daily\nbasis for drying dishes, as a hot pad to keep our countertops safe and, in this case, as a colander and with the Franke hose,\nit just makes things so easy to wash every little square centimeter off of the vegetables and produce. So, at this point, once they\nare nice and rinsed off, I'm going to peel my apples\nand I'm using the combination of sweet and sour, so my\nred apples are Gala apples but you can absolutely use\nthings like Fuji or Honeycrisp. I really like the combination. And Granny Smith, of course,\nbeing the more sour apple really makes it for a\nnice balance of flavors in the apple fritters, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and push everything down into the drain\nbefore turning on the sink and turning on my Franke garbage disposer and I always say this\nthing could power a boat, it's amazingly strong and it's wonderful. Now what we're gonna do is take our apples back over to the cutting board and we wanna small dice them but first we wanna slice around\nthe core to simply remove the core and get as much\napple out as possible. As you can see, I use the flat part down on the cutting board so\nthat the apple doesn't rock to keep my fingers safe and\nthis is just a really old sort of culinary trick that\nwhen you have round items that need cutting and slicing, it's great to use a flat\npart to help balance it out. And once all of the apples\nare trimmed from the core, just remove the core, no big deal, and we wanna small dice them. So, first you slice long ways until they're little matchsticks and next you slice crosswise again until they're a nice small dice. You wanna keep these small 'cause these apple fritters are small, they're not gigantic doughnuts like maybe you've seen at a doughnut shop. And the next thing we're gonna do is squeeze in a lemon\njuice for some flavor and to help preserve\nthe color of our lemons, followed up by adding\nin some ground cinnamon and, for a little bit of\nsavoriness, some ground nutmeg. Now, we're going to\ncompletely mix this together, make sure the cinnamon is incorporated to all of the apples on all sides and what we're gonna do is fold\nthis right into our batter, so scrape all of those delicious apples, try not to eat too many before\nthey make it into the batter, and using your spoon,\nfold it in and the batter is thick so this might\ntake a minute or two just to make sure it's\ncompletely incorporated into the batter but once it is combined, you'll notice that it actually\nloosens up a little bit. We're going to go over to the stove top and now it's time to fry. I'm going to pour in some canola oil, you can absolutely use vegetable oil or another frying oil that you like. I wouldn't use olive oil,\nit's a little bit too strong. Canola's nice and neutral\nas a high smoking point. So, using a spoon, go ahead\nand drop little dollops of the batter right into the oil. I do about six to eight at a time and this keeps them from coming together if it's too overly crowded and\nthen using a slotted spoon, I sort of kinda poke them\naround and prod them around and make sure they're\ngolden brown on all sides and that's the main point is to make sure they're completely cooked\nthrough and golden brown. They will get a very nice brown\non them when they are done, absolutely gorgeous. And what you wanna do is,\nusing that slotted spoon strain them or into a bowl and\nyou can absolutely put them onto a towel if you wanna\ndrain a little bit more grease off of them, I'm not gonna do that 'cause I'm gonna show you why in a second and if you want to make sure, just crack one of them open\nand take a look inside. If the dough is a little bit wet, that means you're not done. So, here's why I'm keeping it wet. I'm going to add in a little bit of sugar followed up by some ground cinnamon and I'm going to give it a couple tosses. Now, I find if there's still\na little bit of oil left on these fritters, this stuff\nsticks a little bit better than if I dry them out on a paper towel but no big deal. It's now time to plate up, so, I'm gonna add a few of these little guys over to a small plate and\nto make it extra delicious and why not, of course, I'll take a nice scoop\nof vanilla ice cream and put that right on top followed up by drizzling on some honey that is gonna go so incredibly well with not only ice cream and\nof course the apple fritters that do go so great with honey\nand the cinnamon and sugar. These are amazing, so easy, so delicious. If you want an unbelievable\ndessert for friends and family, this is absolutely a go to. Thanks for watching, guys.

for you apple fritter bread now as your normal apple fritter is a fried affair and full of fat and oil and all that stuff that the doctor keeps telling me to stop eating this is actually a baked affair it's a kind of akin to a cinnamon roll with apples in it but in bread form the taste is exactly that of a apple fritter that I remember getting in the grocery stores as a kid going grocery shopping with my grandparents so this thing really brings back some memories I hope everybody out there enjoys it and you can change the fruit up in this as well you can add nuts you can go from apples instead of apples add chocolate or you know whatever you'd like so it's completely customizable I'm doing the normal apple fritter flavor today let's get this show going now the first thing we're going to need for apple fritter bread is apples this is two apples that have been peeled and cored and chopped pretty rough to that we're going to add our teaspoon of cinnamon and our two tablespoons of sugar and just give them a nice good toss real quick to get them good and coated next we need to take 1/3 cup of our brown sugar packed and add to that one teaspoon of cinnamon and just give that real nice and incorporated as well this is going to comprise the cinnamon sugar layer of our bread and it's also going to swirl throughout the top of the bread and give it that that apple fritter doughnut look now in our mixer we're going to add our 2/3 cup of sugar along with our one stick of softened butter and just get that whipping up here for a couple of minutes until it's nice and smooth once that's nice and incorporated we'll add in our two eggs one at a time just until the first one is nice and incorporated at that point you go ahead add in your second one along with the vanilla now at this point we're going to add our flour and our baking powder now quick tip I add my baking powder and whisk it into the actual flour before it goes in the bowl this way you are sure that your baking powder is evenly distributed and you don't end up with one section of cake or bread that Rises and the other part doesn't so good tip there go ahead add the flour in about a third of a cup or so at a time just until it's incorporated and then more it keeps it from flying up in your face and saves you a bit of cleanup time now at this point it's nice and incorporated go ahead and just stop your mixer real quick scrape down the sides of the bowl just so you can get any pockets of flour that may be hiding on the edges that hasn't been mixed in yet and then go ahead let it run for about another thirty seconds and we'll be done with the mixing okay now for the fun part we're going to take our greased bread mold and we're going to add in one half of the batter now be sure to get good coverage on it you want to get the corners make sure there's no air pockets all that good stuff okay next thing we're going to do is add half of our brown sugar cinnamon to this layer be generous with it because it makes quite a bit of sugar and cinnamon on top of that we will place the apples and be sure to press them down otherwise the bottom of your bread will have no apples at this point we'll go ahead and add the other half of our batter and again just make sure you get pre decent coverage you don't want generally don't want any apples from that bottom layer peeking through if you can help it so no neatness doesn't count here but it kind of helps so get good coverage we also don't want those apples to burn that would be bad all right and then we're going to add the next half of our brown sugar cinnamon now because this makes so much I actually sprinkle some on top here in just a little bit and you're going to see that that's going to make it kind of it's going to help the appearance once it's done baking begin with the next layer of apples now these are going to be the top apples you're going to see these coming on the top of the bread be sure to smoosh them down though you want even distribution of Apple per inch then we are going to yep there's the last layer of what I had left of the brown sugar cinnamon and then we take a knife and we swirl through it and this is going to give it that donut effect it's gonna look layered but not evenly kind of a swirl like a cinnamon roll if you will Pat it all back down smooth it out and into the oven set at 350 degrees for anywhere between 50 and 60 minutes be sure to stick it with a toothpick to check for doneness do remember that ovens vary so mine actually takes about about 70 minutes total to cook so here we are the toothpick has been inserted and came out clean as a whistle and you can see and how the brown sugar has kind of helped the color on the top here now these apples are not burnt they don't taste burnt they are not even crispy they are nice and moist and the cake itself is an extremely moist we're going to let it sit here for about 15 minutes while we mix up our glaze most apple fritters have a anywhere from a translucent to a opaque white glaze on top so got to do it to the bread got to stay true to the apple fritter so here we go so here's our glaze it's just a basic cream glaze with powdered sugar about half a cup and 2 tablespoons of milk to start with now it does depend on the humidity in your environment as to how much milk it's going to take to get your glaze just the way you want it so start low on the milk in whisk it and if it's still too thick add just a little touch more milk at a time I'm in Texas and Lord knows it's humid here so I started on the low end but you can I would take it up all the way to even three tablespoons of milk if you wanted it really thin or if you live in a very dry environment and now we simply take our bread that's been cold about 15 minutes though it's still pretty pretty warm we're going to just spread this glaze on now the heat from the bread is going to help this kind of loosen up a little bit and start to run that's what you want you want it to kind of find its own way inside the little nooks and crannies on top and it's going to you know it'll thin it out quite a bit but not to the point where you don't know that there's glaze there just go ahead spread it around and then we're going to let it cool completely before cutting and there you have it country apple fritter bread now this stuff again you can vary the fruit that you use you can even you know take the fruit out and put in chocolate chips it's completely up to you I just think of anything that would go good with french toast would probably go well inside this bread when you cut it try and cut it a little on the thick side it'll hold up better there are you know like I said earlier nooks and crannies on the inside it should be solid though you have places where apple are and you want to be sure to get the nice pretty effect of all that this is one of my wife's favorite desserts and I hope that you enjoy it as well

"cG1NvYrvULE": "[Music] look what i've got here this is a bud of something called apple fritter and it's from a cultivator called fresh baked and we tried another flour from fresh bake called cherry fretter and i was supposed to get the apple fritter but i got home and instead cherry fritter went into my bag so when i went down to the connected cannabis i saw oh my goodness there's lumpy's apple fritter but also at the store at the same time they had fresh baked apple fritter and i had to correct the wrong even though i didn't really want to buy two apple fritters the same strain two companies i did and then as i think back i also have synergy apple fritter which it was great it got denied so there's three apple fritters out right now and today we're going to discuss the fresh baked version and maybe later we'll have to do a multi-strain but not a multi-strain and multi-brand review of apple fritter because this flour is actually really good so let's check it out so we're gonna load one more scoop of apple fritter into vapor cup straw and it takes about three scoops it's just enough to fill it up and about a bong hits worth and we just tamp it enough to make the uh not fall out not to restrict the airplane we stick it in the vapor cup and what vapor cup is going to do is in about a minute and a half uh it's going to give off sweet water vapor that will stone you to the bone and it's so fragrant you can't imagine and there is some trick with vapor cup meaning this cup right now is very high so depending on how hot the cup is and how long you let the straw stay in there that makes the vapor so the cup turns green maybe you give it a little extra time depending on what temperature and what kind of vapor you like and you can also heat the straw in the cup and then load the straw hot it's helpful to make more vapor and i'm telling you the vapor is swedish sugar pie so uh apple fritter came in this jar and this flower has 27 percent thc and like i said i got this at the connected cannabis and that was some trip down there i was able to get alien labs fresh bait lumpies and i had never been to connected cannabis in long beach and it was definitely worth the try especially since it's right off the freeway get off the freeway into the parking lot they have their own parking lot in and out it was just fantastic so you can see when vapor cup is ready because you got all that vapor in the straw and that's how you know when it's ready is you see the vapor like that so you could say i want to try and give you because that's how you know if you're using vapor cup that's how you know it's ready it's ready to go so let's check it out apple fritter by fresh baked at a vapor cup at 330 degrees so this flower has a powdery weedy ogee-ish taste that's what it tastes like the first draws are smooth um but this is not the smoother flower but it's smooth enough you buy three different apple fritters are they all the same i don't think so so what do we think of apple fritter from fresh baked i like apple fritter strain and i like this flower too i'm giving this flower an eight seven five this flower is strong enough to fork enough it's good enough but it didn't get the nine because it didn't groom me out but it's good apple fritter is a good strain right now thanks for joining in i recommend fresh baked apple fruit or i think it's good enough it's funny as you go through and you can see lumpy's or if you see synergy and i'm going to compare all these apple fritters in another video but you got to grab what you can see an apple fritter seems to be one of the strains of the day right now thanks for joining in if you want to see vapor cup this item right here if you want to get a vapor cup you can you can get it at vaporcup.com and i'm telling you there's no disappointment in this item there is a little bit of a learning curve to it but once you get it it just keeps giving giving if you're looking for strains go to wheat entertainment.com thanks for joining in i'm the doctor party on my friends [Music] you", "MMn-HRBikRg": "[Music] I'm Mike welcome to the bank Marquette Center in Los Angeles California I'd like to lead you through a way I make apple fritters most Baker's have an objection sometimes to apple fritters in that they come apart in the fryer I'd like to address that I'd like to also address a couple of customer concerns most of the time if a customer has a concern about an apple fritter it would be because it's maybe fright too dark or it's greasy I'm gonna show you a process that will give you a superior apple fritter and avoid those three problems I'm starting off with a piece of doughnut dough a lot of people use scrap that you're welcome to do that if you like this is a piece of fresh dough but the process is the same I'm using our super roll mix today but you can use any of our doughnuts the process works the same for all of them what I'd like to show you though is one of the advantages to this particular apple filling is it's a large cut apple it's going to give you a lot of fruit identity and it's a fresh apple it's very crisp a lot of people say that using fresh apples they disappear in an apple fritter in this case because it's a large cut and it's a very crisp Apple we have a lot of fruit identity that Apple will hold up so this is the reason I use this particular Apple what I might do differently than a lot of people at this point is I'm going to add a binder to this Apple and what that does I'm gonna use cake doughnut flour you can use bench flour I prefer to use cake doughnut flour because it has better flavor than the bench bent or the bench flour and it's what I'm doing is locking up the moisture so you have less grease penetration so I've added the apples a little bit of cake donut flour and I like to use quite a bit of cinnamon when you fry an apple fritter remember that not only is that product proofed and and then fried yet also because of the proofing and frying tends to dilute flavors so I add a lot of cinnamon what I do differently at this stage I usually log it up like I would be cutting a Persian and instead of using a bench scraper I like to use a French knife I think it cuts quick quicker so what I'm looking for here is I'm going to go through this dough and then back this way and what I'm looking for is to get the pieces about as small as the apple filling if you make them too large they tend to pull apart in the in the fryer and we're gonna try to avoid that by making small pieces ok we've chopped through the donut we've gotten the pieces about the size of the Apple which I'd say is about a minimum size then what I would suggest you do is to chop off the size pieces that you want and roll them in flour flatten with the palm of your hand what that does is seals up the pores and the fissures that allow the steam to or they allow the grease to penetrate one thing I didn't cover too is the reason that I use cake donut flour I want to emphasize how important that is if you look at a fryer full of frying fritters you'll see a lot of steam escaping what that is physically is as that steam is escaping it's causing grease to penetrate so physically as that steam is escaping it's going in soaking in a lot of grease so we're trying to prevent that by binding up these apples with the cake donut flour so we're not over frying which also causes grease penetration we're removing the objection of a over fried fritter and the main thing is we're trying to bind this up so it doesn't separate in the fryer and we also have very little grease penetration for more information on products and recipes visit us at you're baked marcom you", "I5o2PwsqDKs": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] stay on route for 15 kilometers what's up guys and welcome to another cheat day video here in Florida so this morning I'm act I would say the last location here that I really truly love which is fake shack in Dania or Dania Beach they open here in just a few minutes in the meantime I wanted to let you guys know we are finally coming out with some merch to preorder pretty soon I'll definitely you know my Instagram and in my videos when the time has come but here are the four designs that you can choose from and we really hope you like them thank you so much for the love and support it's so appreciated by me and Nate and I think it's time to get some donuts [Music] okay guys so we got us six doughnuts from baked shack and I'm super stoked to dig into the east by the way happy belated international and national donut day I'm going to start with other big bust and cream and bacon and there's a little of Nutella was but Boston cream I wanted to give Boston cream another try [Music] Wow I haven't pressed the Boston cream I feel like it's some sort of pudding with the bacon and the bacon super crisp really good I'm surprised I wouldn't have thought I like that so much and since you guys always ask me for ratings this is a proper 8 out of 10 really good busting cream filling next one in all classic the maple bacon but the bacon here is really well made the dough is nice and fluffy too I mean it's a classic it's a maple bacon donut but since the bacon is really on point eight out of ten mixed up I saw that on their Instagram and it's not on the menu it's something special is a peanut butter jelly with roasted peanuts on top I gotta say there is not a strong peanut flavor whatsoever I think a gem may be homemade I gotta say I expected more from the stone out so I got actually two of them it's a 7 out of 10 because there's no peanut flavor and the next one that's what I'm telling you what you tubers should do - instead of quick baiting us when there's not Nutella don't name it at all this is Nutella mousse so I'm not expecting real Nutella but I like Nutella mixed with some sort of cream so I won't be triggered it's whipped cream and I feel like it still tastes more like and tell off then all the others claiming to be Mandela on top was just Nutella mixed with whipped cream it was a decent doughnut but I wouldn't give it more than the six out of ten next up is blueberry bliss and that looks promising so it's also filled with some sort of it's not jelly but it's like a blueberry cream I'm really liking this I can't tell that what the cream is made of but it's good really like this eight and a half out of time and last maybe least another peanut butter not not so peanut butter a jelly donut no taste more like peanut I don't know what's going on [Music] these donuts have a nice size they're easy to eat they're not that big overall I'm giving it like an 8 out of 10 surprisingly Boston cream was my favorite along with the blueberry bush but I would let you down if I didn't get you name it a beautiful apple fritter I never I don't think I ever had an apple fritter from baked shacks so it was about time and that looks so delicious [Music] halfway through and I gotta say the dough is on point but I'm missing the Apple in this also I like when the glaze is crunchy er it stuck in the baffle prayer I'm still convinced though that mojo Dodds has the best apple fritter here in Florida that was very delicious definitely check out makes a question because the don'ts are not that masa and see you for lunch he got a haircut I think it looks fire I

like that again and I hope you guys enjoy the video should you should she do muffins oh yeah should I do muck banks and ASMR videos let me know in the comments below and have a great week and I see you in the next video bye [Music]", "BlUJa-7Um-E": "hey everybody thomas joseph here and today we are tackling apple fritters one of my favorite things now perhaps you've tried to make them at home and maybe they're undercooked in the center and burnt and oily on the outside well today i'm gonna share with you a foolproof method in making apple fritters at home and they use apples in three different forms so let's get started for my apple fritters i'm gonna start by making the kind of apples or the caramelized apples that go into the fritters and then we'll tackle the dough so to get started you need a little bit of butter now i'm working in two batches here guys so you need to repeat this process twice but I've already done a batch so this is my last batch here so 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a skillet and to the butter I'm gonna add a 1/2 of a vanilla bean now I'm using a fresh Manila bean here and the way that you extricate the seeds from the pod is by using the back of your knife down the split vanilla bean and you just scrape up the millions and millions of seeds that are in between the pod so those are all of the vanilla beans there you can actually add the vanilla bean into the mix as well and we'll remove it once the apples are nice and cooked and caramelized now there are a lot of apple fritter recipes out there and some of them actually have you adding raw apple into the dough and I find that when you do that the raw Apple creates these little gummy pockets that are really kind of unappetizing so the cooking of the Apple in advance what it does is it helps to concentrate the Apple flavor but it also rids the apple of a lot of its moisture so I have here 3 granny smith apples that are cut up into 1/2 inch cubes and I'm gonna saute them in the butter here with a little bit of sugar this is 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar just sprinkle it over the top and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon now ground cinnamon adds a really great flavor it's you know a classic kind of combination with apples but cinnamon actually has a gelling power to it similar to cornstarch or something like that where it helps to thicken juices which is really interesting and nice and helpful here when we're making the fritters so this mixture is gonna have to cook down for about 4 to 5 minutes and I'm using granny smith apples here and granny smith apples are really great for cooking and baking because an apple that has a little bit more acidity and structure to it really works well the apple will maintain its shape during the cooking process and the frying process alright guys so it's been about 4 to 5 minutes here and you can see that a lot of the juices have evaporated from these apples and they're sizzling away nicely here and now it's time to add in our other ingredients which are gonna really add a great depth of flavor I have some sparkling apple cider here this is a 1/2 cup and I'm gonna just pour this over our apples and then 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar which adds a bit of complexity to these apples that will be really nice and will help to contrast all of the sugar that's in the apples here and also in the dough and this just needs to cook until our liquid here has evaporated and the apples are nice and syrupy and that should really only take about two minutes more on this high heat alright our apples look great you can see that the liquid has reduced down to a pretty viscous syrup here and now these apples have to cool completely and while they do I'm gonna start making the dough which we're then gonna fold these apples into alright guys so our apples are cooling and now it is time to start our fritter dough so in the bowl of a stand mixer here what we're gonna do is we're gonna add a little bit of milk this is two-thirds of a cup of warm milk you want milk around 100 to 110 degrees that's the ideal temperature for proofing yeast and proofing yeast again is waking the yeast up allowing it time to kind of nourish itself and to start activating and I'm using active dry yeast today this is one packet of active dry yeast and that's a quarter of an ounce this is going right into the bowl of the stand mixer with the milk I'm just gonna mix it up a little bit here and I'm going to add some pastry flour now we haven't really used pastry flour on kitchen conundrums but pastry flour is used in a lot of bakeries and restaurants and it's a finer flour it has a media level amount of protein to it and it's used for a nice kind of luscious silky texture in a lot of baked goods so this is two cups and I'm gonna add the pastry flour directly on top of the yeast mixture and so this is going to proof together now for about fifteen to twenty minutes and while this is happening I'm gonna start to mix together the other ingredients in the dough I'm gonna start by cracking some eggs now I just need the egg yolks here for this dough which really adds a nice richness to the dough and I need four large egg yolks in total and to this bowl I'm going to add a little bit of sparkling cider so we use this in the apples and again we're gonna use it here in the dough and this is a third of a cup of the sparkling apple cider right here into the bowl with the egg yolks and to half a cup of granulated sugar mix these three ingredients together stream in melted and cooled butter this is a half a stick four tablespoons so one teaspoon of coarse kosher salt this is a half teaspoon of a cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and to this mixture we're going to add the remaining pastry flour this is a quarter of a cup of pastry flour and one cup of bread flour now I have one cup and a little extra in here because I'm gonna save a little bit and you might have to add it into the dough if the dough is too tacky so reserve about two tablespoons and once we get this all mixed together then we'll add the remaining flour if necessary so I'm gonna switch here to a rubber spatula and now since our yeast has had a chance to kind of wake up and proof I'm going to add my wet ingredients this batter to our yeast milk and pastry flour mixture so mix this together on a medium speed just until it comes together and you can see the consistency of the dough and then we'll determine whether or not we need to add the rest of this flour mixture now this is going to be a very tacky dough a very wet dough which is great because in the end you're gonna end up with a very delicious and light fritter and I think we're gonna need this because the dough is kind of a little bit too liquidy it doesn't have enough structure to it so I'm gonna add the remaining two tablespoons of bread flour and I'm going to using the dough hook knead this dough for about four to five minutes in the stand mixer and what that's gonna do is it's going to encourage all of the flour and the wet ingredients to mix together and it's going to start to activate the gluten within the bread flour and the pastry flour alright guys it's been about five minutes and the dough is nice and tacky and stringy it's almost like a brioche dough that's the texture you're looking for here I'm gonna take the dough hook off lightly flour my surface here and I'm gonna turn the dough out and just gently knead it into a shape and form it into a ball and then this is going to proof in a oiled bowl for about one and a half hours in a warm spot until it's doubled in bulk and this is gonna be the first of three Rises so using one of my favorite tools this is a bowl scraper a plastic bowl scraper scrape out your dough and I will warn you this is a very wet dough as I had said before so don't be nervous or afraid if it seems too tacky it might be difficult to work with at this stage but in the end it's gonna be a really great supple silky dough so now flour your hands a little bit even flour the bench scraper and just bring up the sides of the dough into the center we're really just creating an nice shape can turn this upside-down form this into a ball and then this goes right into an oil brushed bowl cover with plastic wrap and again about an hour and a half in a warm spot until it's doubled in bulk and then we're ready to start the Apple part all right guys it's been an hour and a half and our dough is nice and puffy you can see that it really has kind of doubled in size I'm gonna remove the plastic wrap and I'm gonna spread this out on a lightly floured surface you can see how spongy the dough is it's really had time to absorb a lot of the moisture so it's a more of a cohesive mass now and now using lightly floured hands stretch this dough out to a 10 by 15 inch rectangle about 10 by 15 so this looks pretty decent and now I'm gonna take half of the apples that have cooled completely and spread these over two-thirds of the dough we're kind of replicating the laminating method that you would do for puff pastry or croissant dough but instead of butter we're using our wonderful flavorful apples so spread your apples out and a nice even layer and then we're gonna fold the dough over so the side that's not covered is gonna be folded over on top and then the side that does have apples on it over here is gonna be folded over on this side and don't worry this might be a little bit messy but doesn't really matter so now we're going to turn the dough Pat it out into a 10 by 15 inch rectangle again and then we're going to repeat the process and don't worry you guys if you get little holes in the dough from the apples it's totally fine this is just really a method in incorporating the apples into this stiff dough if you tried to mix this in by hand it wouldn't work so this laminating method really does help to evenly distribute the apples into the dough so spread this out nice and evenly I'm gonna flour my hands a little bit bring it over the side that's not coated in apples fold this side over so now we're going to shape this dough into a nice ball of another oil Bowl here dough goes in plastic wrap on top and again this is going to proof now until it's doubled in bulk it'll take about a half an hour to proof alright guys so I'm spreading out a little bit of pastry flour on my work surface I have a Dutch oven over here heating with a neutral oil so a vegetable oil a grapeseed oil something that can reach high temperatures I'm going to take my beautifully proofed dough and again since we have those apples in here it proofs at a much faster rate because there's a lot of excess sugar in this dough now so scrape the dough out onto your work surface and I'm patting my dough out to again that same size we're looking for a 10 by 15 inch rectangle but you guys it really doesn't matter you're just looking for something that's about an inch in thickness now generously flour a parchment lined baking sheet what we're gonna do is we're gonna use a two and a half inch cutter here guys I have a round cutter cut out little rounds of your dough and then this goes right onto our parchment lined baking sheet and as I cut in place gently stretching the dough to an oval and it's about four inches in length now and that's just to give it kind of a nice organic shape so you're gonna repeat the process with the remaining dough here and these fritters now need to proof or rest for just a little bit I would say maybe about 10 minutes and by that time our oil should be heated up to 375 degrees and then we are to fry these babies up alright guys our oil is up to 375 degrees and it has been about 10 minutes and our fritters have puffed up just ever so slightly here now you want to carefully pick up those fritters and place them into the hot oil and these are gonna take about 2 minutes per side they're gonna sink down to the bottom a little bit and then float up to the top don't overcrowd the pan do these in batches make sure you're maintaining the heat so if the temperature of the oil does dip down a little too much you can certainly crank it up a little bit higher so that you're maintaining 375 degrees that will help you to avoid a really soggy fritter because you want high enough temperature that the outside will Brown nicely but it will cook on the inside and one more so it's been about two minutes maybe about a minute and a half to two minutes here guys and now I'm going to flip these guys over you can start to see that the coloring around the edges is a nice golden brown and so now just using I use a fork but you could use a chopstick or a skewer a metal skewer or you could use a pair of tongs just flip them over gently and again it's gonna cook on this side now for another two minutes all right two minutes again guys and knees are nice and dark and golden brown look at how amazing these look now drain them on a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and now I'm gonna repeat the process with the remaining fritters here so now just to gild the lily here a little bit of that wonderful confectioner sugar glaze I'm using a brush here but you could certainly dip these if you didn't want to use a brush just a very light coating of this white glaze over the top while they're still warm which will help the glaze kind of melt down and become slightly translucent I think these are going to be a real treat for you and your family this is crank and hot guys but look at the inside you can see it's not gummy at all but there are beautiful pockets of apples on the inside the dough is nice and tender and rich and I can't wait to give this a try so delicious this really is the perfect recipe for apple fritters at home I encourage you to give it a try as always any kitchen conundrums you have whether they're baking or savory or whatever right in the comments section below or reach out to us using the hashtag

make easy and delicious apple fritters now fall is just around the corner and apple fritters are just one of my favorite fall snacks are so incredibly delicious you have apples and cinnamon and nutmeg and it's deep-fried and glazed and what more can you ask for these are just so good let me show you how to make them and you can't have apple fritters with that Apple so I'm going to start with the apples today I'm going to use 3 large apples you can use any variety that you have on hand just grab a peeler and peel away that peel and then grab a sharp knife and dice the apples and two pea-sized pieces I want them to be on the smaller side because I want them to cook as the fritters are deep-frying so go for a slightly smaller dice [Music] my apples are good to go and now I'm ready to get started on my batter but before I do that I'm going to get my old preheating so I have about six cups of canola oil in my cast iron pot here I've attached a thermometer I need the oil to reach at least 350 degrees Fahrenheit so make sure you get that going while you're preparing the batter into a mixing bowl I'm going to add in 2/3 cup of whole milk 2 large eggs 1/3 cup of white granulated sugar [Music] and a 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract grab a whisk and mix that all together for a minute until it's nice and smooth and now for my dry ingredients and my mixing bowl I have my flour too they all add in a tablespoon of ground cinnamon a teaspoon of nutmeg and today I'm using fresh nutmeg I love love that room of it a quarter teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of baking powder just mix that all together and then we're going to add this into the batter going to whisk in the first half of the flour and then I'll switch over to a spatula and in go our apples I have tons and tons of apples today and I love that I love to have apple with every single bite and then just fold that in so I have my apple fritter batter all done by my oil is still for heating so I'm going to take the time to show you guys really quickly how I make the glace I have 2 cups of confectioner's sugar here and I'm actually going to season that with a teaspoon of cinnamon so you have cinnamon flavor in the glaze - it's gonna be so good add that in there and then I'll add in a couple tablespoons of milk you can also use cream and just mix that in and this looks perfect you want the glaze to be on the thinner side because we're going to dip the apple fritters directly into it and want to kind of flow over all the nooks and cranny's set this aside I'm gonna use it later all right oil is nice and hot let's do this so just grab a big spoon and I like to draw up little spoonfuls in there usually do about three at a time put a quarter cup of that batter into the hot oil can't wait to eat these I know they're gonna taste so so amazing and I'm going to cook these for a good four to five minutes depending on the size you want to turn them frequently make sure they're nice golden brown and they cook evenly and cook all the way through and then just take them out and place them onto a wire rack that's lined with the paper towel to absorb any of that extra oil now while these fritters are still warm you want to get them coated in that glaze so drop them in once you take them out of the oil let them chill for about 2-3 minutes dunk them in there and then we're going to place them back onto the wire rack and how incredible do these look guys I just wanted to break one open for you they're still really nice and warm but so you can see the texture on the inside check that out they're just so fluffy on the inside you have chunks of Apple that cinnamon they either gonna be amazing and that's it for my apple fritters aren't these just so easy to make and let me tell you the O room of these cooking in the kitchen is just out of this world it instantly brings you that fall nostalgy have this cinnamon and apples what could be better time to dig in and enjoy and I love that things are still warm they look so so good mm-hmm I absolutely love all the flavors here and I love that you have so much apple with every single bite you have the cinnamon and nutmeg I love the addition of the glaze on the outside with the cinnamon just adds another level of cinnamon flavor to these treats for the full recipe just head on down into that video description box you'll find a link for this

guys welcome back to my channel so in today's video i'm gonna be showing you how to make this delicious apple fritter bread filled with tons of apple cinnamon and nutmeg perfect for the fall time and it's topped off with a delicious beautiful glaze so let's get started so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to start dicing our apples so i'm using gala apples for this recipe but you guys can use granny smith apples or even a golden delicious apples whatever you guys have on hand so next we're going to start cutting our apples so i'm cutting my apples into quarters then i'm going to slice them horizontally then you're going to cut them in strips and then those strips are going to be cut into a medium-sized dice [Music] next you're going to add two tablespoons of sugar 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of salt you're going to give that a stir and then you're going to set it aside [Music] now we're going to make our brown sugar cinnamon mixture so in a small bowl you're going to mix a quarter cup of light brown sugar one teaspoon of ground cinnamon quarter teaspoon of nutmeg a quarter teaspoon of salt and you're going to give that a mix and you're going to set that aside [Music] so next we're going to make our batter so we're going to start off by making our brown butter so brown butter is one of those ingredients that is super special in baking and also in cooking it has a very nutty flavor and smells amazing so in a pot you're going to add four tablespoons of unsalted butter and we're going to start toasting the milk solids in the butter so it will start to turn or golden brown but continue moving your pot so it doesn't burn so once that's done you're going to pour your brown butter in a small bowl you're going to set that aside to cool [Music] so now we're going to mix 1 cup of sugar 2 eggs vanilla which i forgot to put in for you put in your vanilla with your eggs then you're going to mix in your delicious brown butter and you're going to make sure that you're getting every bit of that brown butter because it's going to make this dessert even better then you're going to whisk all that until it's fully combined [Music] [Music] do [Music] so next we're going to start sifting our dry ingredients so in a medium sized bowl you're going to sift two and a half cups of all purpose flour two teaspoons of baking powder a half a teaspoon of baking soda and a half a teaspoon of salt [Music] do [Music] do so now we're going to alternate our dry ingredients with one cup of buttermilk mixing through after every addition [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so now that our battery is done we're going to put half of our batter into a lined crease loaf pan then you're going to add half of your apple mixture on top of your batter and sprinkle some of that delicious brown sugar cinnamon mixture right on top [Music] do [Music] [Music] so now you can add your remaining batter right on top and you're going to do the same thing you're going to add your apples and then you're going to add your brown sugar cinnamon mixture right on top [Music] so we're going to bake this off in a 365 degree oven for 45 to 55 minutes [Music] so once your apple fritter is out of the oven you're gonna let it rest for about 10 minutes and then you're going to drizzle some of your beautiful glaze right on top so i just mixed a third cup of powdered sugar and three tablespoons of heavy cream for this glaze so if you guys prefer a thicker glaze instead of adding three tablespoons of heavy cream you would just add a tablespoon and a half this apple fritter bread is seriously so delicious it's extremely moist and filled with fall flavors i hope you guys enjoy this video please don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up and also don't forget to subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next one bye guys", "P_8bIQ7ucUU": "[Music] hey everybody ground polka welcome grandpa cooking channel today we're going

baked apple fritter super excited about this the homies work with fresh baked i've smoked their flour in the past i visited the circle in long beach i bought this numero numerous times it's always sweet gassy it's a beautiful pine um it's just a beautiful pine gassy creamy smoothie pungent robust herby weed man that's just fire we're looking at a one gram pre-rolled glass tube 25.95 thc 30.13 total cannabinoids is beautiful the color of the joint you can see the flower inside raw cone raw paper you can see chunks of purple and dark green some light green in there as well let's dive in one hit i'm gonna talk about it two hits score out of ten you guys know it's [ __ ] good let's get it okay packaging it's literally like 100 degrees out here and then chris is on the camera let's go let's go all right here we go here we go here we go you open the tube really really nice creamy smell god i'm excited here we go here we go it's not packed too tightly nice and it's not necessarily loose it's just not jammed in there dry pull is incredible it reminds me of like a cannabis sour wheat smell crossed with like tropical fruit all right light it up light it up light it up let it light it up all right all right here we go oh man first hit delicious it's got so much pungent gassiness and pininess that it's it's like you almost want to cough and then you start looking at the ash the ash because of the paper starts off dark but when we get through the second hit it's going to lighten up watch this just like i said got a little bit lighter there the flavor shines even more so on this i'm getting even more pine a tiny bit of citrus this musky pumaline and i'm getting obviously there's spiciness and this this this uh this cushiness to it as well the apple fritter well known to be super delicious yeah look at this ash right there it's coating up perfectly delicious when i start to think about a score out of 10 i've got a it's definitely a 9. i look at the packaging the only thing that i really see the packaging missing let me see where this packaging goes only see that i think that i see this packaging really missing is this window needs some terpene information i'm guessing on the terps and i want to be able to accurately describe it just based on what's here one gram tested in earth labs harvest date may 12 2020 packaged june 15th so this is oh this is three month old cannabis if it were pressure it'd be better i'm gonna give it a score of 9.5 is where i'm sitting the point five that's missing to take away from the perfect score is i want more information i want that terpenes on there i want to like obviously i'm impressed with the high thc it looks beautiful glass tube to high joint experience everything is good on the quality but give me more information about the genetics give me more information about the terpenes that are in here and mary jane's distro there's a phone number and then the packaging date the the harvest on this is three months old so we could do a little bit better there maybe it's elevate buying this maybe it's maybe it's the uh the fresh baked who knows 9.5 is a great score read the full review of respect my region we got a blog coming out soon description a little bit more details there on youtube make sure you guys subscribe really appreciate you guys fresh baked this is delicious oh yeah wonderful some joints

so this one oh my gosh it's so clever she takes totally complete pancake mix and get it out of the cup you need two cups of it good to go there you add a cup and a half of water just like it says on the box and this becomes your batter for your fritters how cool is that I'm gonna thicken it up a bit I think I jumped myself on that first cup see this is why I don't bake I'm so lousy at measuring you just got to give it a quick beat there so you don't get your lumps out you know I think a whisk will help me out a lot better with this there we go oh look at that coming together beautifully now the only addition I've made to this because it is made with apples and I love the flavor with apples is a little bit of nutmeg get all that going in there you know Talent eat a lot of fried desserts around the holidays - we got the zeppole the fried dough with the little love you know a confectioners sugar on top Oh yummy okay yeah I'm just gonna take this down to that vegetable oil now the vegetable oil I preheated about an inch of it over medium to high heat you want to get it good and hot and in this one I'm not big on gadgets but this is a necessary thing you got to be able to core the Apple and here's why once you core it you're gonna cut it into these pretty little rings see there isn't that cute you don't want to go too thick here about a quarter of an inch thick you can use Golden Delicious Red Delicious leave your skin right on because that'll be pretty kind of peeking out at the edges there I've got my confectioner sugar for when they come out my pancake batter is perfect this is how quick and easy this is you coat him really well on both sides you can use tongs if you don't want to get goopy there and just set them right down in there awesome how easy is that isn't that a just a fantastic holiday miracle Rene is so cool I really got to thank her for this one let's get a layer in there obviously don't crowd the pan up with these you want them to brown evenly all over and have room to groove in there I'm just gonna get one more going cuz you want them to cook in batches of about the same time limit and they cook really quick I'm just gonna turn one over here and show you how pretty they get look at that look at it isn't it gorgeous just take complete pancake mix if you can believe that add a little water stir it up I add a little bit of nutmeg because I like nutmeg with apple you could also do a little cinnamon you just make apple rings dip them in the pancake mix and fry them in little vegetable oil is that amazing or what the finishing touch after you give them a quick drain it's just to hit them with some powdered sugar oh yeah that's what I'm talking about how good does that look it's snow and sugar", "hBLjBN-7RG4": "Hey everyone Sam here from Sugar Spun Run and today I'll be showing you how to make apple fritters. Apple fritters are one of my favorite recipes to make every fall. They're a great way to use up extra apples from apple picking, but they're also good any time of year. Today, I'm going to be sharing a super easy apple fritter recipe that uses no yeast. So let's get started. The first thing you'll need is 2 cups of all-purpose flour and you'll want to place that in a large bowl. We will add 1/3 cup of granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons of packed brown sugar, a tablespoon of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and a teaspoon of salt. We'll give everything a good stir. With our dry ingredients well combined, we'll set these aside and prepare our wet ingredients. You will need to use a separate bowl and we'll add two large eggs to this bowl. Now grab a whisk and we'll whisk these eggs until they're pale yellow and foamy. This will just take about ten or fifteen seconds. Now. We'll add one cup of whole milk, and A teaspoon of vanilla extract, and we'll give that a stir again. Next you'll need two tablespoons of melted butter. I like to melt my butter a little bit in advance that way it's not super hot when I add it to my wet ingredients, my milk and my eggs, so we'll add this in while whisking; and if you notice your mixture curdling a little bit that's fine. Your batter is still going to be okay. But letting the butter cool a little bit before adding it does help prevent this and helps your ingredients get combined a little bit better. At this point we're ready for the most important ingredient in our apple fritters. the apples. For this recipe I recommend using an apple that you actually enjoy eating plain. I don't really love using Granny Smith Apples here. I feel like they're a little bit too tart I like to use a more sweet apple like a Honey Crisp or a Gala Apple. In fact, I'm using Gala apples today. What you'll want to do is you'll want to peel your apples and then slice them into about quarter inch sized pieces. You want them to be pretty small. This is about two cups of apples. And for me. This is about two large sliced apples. I like to add a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to my apples, and use a spatula to just coat them in the cinnamon. We now have all of the components for our apple fritter batter. So let's get to combining everything. Bring back your dry ingredients, and we'll give our wet ingredients just another quick whisk. And then add the wet ingredients to your dry ingredients. I like to use a spatula to fold these ingredients together. You do want to take care that you don't over mix the batter. Once our wet ingredients and dry ingredients are about half way combined now, we'll add our chopped and prepared apples. And we'll use our spatula to make sure everything is nicely mixed together. Well, let this apple fritter batter rest for a couple minutes while we prepare our oil. We'll need to head over to the stovetop and you'll want to use a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. I like to use the Dutch oven and add enough canola or vegetable oil to cover about two to three inches of the bottom of the pot. You will need a thermometer to make sure that your oil reaches the correct temperature for this recipe. As you can see, I fitted my pot with a candy thermometer. It's not touching the bottom of the pot but it is in the oil still and we are looking for the temperature of 360 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit Now that our oil is heated. Let's make our way over to the stovetop and start frying these apple fritters. We will drop our fritters by about three tablespoons of batter at a time into the oil. I don't recommend frying more than about three fritters at one time because adding that cooler batter really does drop the temperature of your oil and It's really important that you keep that consistent temperature of about 360 degrees Fahrenheit. You'll fry these apple fritters for about a minute to a minute and 15 seconds, And then use your tongs to turn them over and fry them for another minute to a minute and a half on the other side Once your apple fritters are a nice golden-brown color, We'll use our tongs to remove them from our oil and transfer them to our paper towel-lined plate. Don't forget to make sure your oil comes back to 360 degrees Fahrenheit before adding more batter and frying more apple fritters. Once your apple fritters are fried, I like to dip them in an apple cider glaze. Now you can skip this step. You can enjoy the apple fritters as they are with no topping. You can sprinkle them with powdered sugar. You can roll them in cinnamon and sugar; Any of those are great options, but I like to make this really simple glaze. What you'll need is a cup and a half of powdered sugar. Just a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract, and about two to two and a half tablespoons of apple cider. Now if you don't have apple cider on hand, you can substitute water or milk. I just like the slight flavor that the apple cider adds. If your glaze is too thick at this point you can add a little more liquid as needed. And if it's too thin, you can add a little more sugar. It's really hard to mess this glaze up. Now we will dip our apple fritters. You'll want to turn them in the glaze and then transfer them to a wire rack and let that glaze cool for a couple minutes before digging in. Keep in mind that these apple fritters are best enjoyed warm. They don't really keep well or carry over well to the next day. That is all there is to my favorite super simple apple fritter recipe. I really hope you guys will try this one out And if you do, please leave me a comment and let me know what you think.

bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis straight of use so today we are going to be reviewing apple fritter by our friends over at Gro Sciences you guys $55 for an eight or three point seven unheard of basically sixty bucks after tax no discount I don't think I have paid this much for ganja in maybe since I was 16 you guys and that was like 20 years ago now you guys I cannot wait to try this out I've been looking forward to this review all week apple fritter is a true hybrid strain that is a cross between sour apple and animal cookies it is a brand-new string to our flavor to our channel although Crowe Sciences is not and we love their products over there so this should not disappoint with a $55 price tag so I'm going to bring it up on the screen now and then we're going to look at it together and get this party rocket okay so you guys just had a chance to check it out I'm gonna pop the top on this and you guys know I love that vacuum seal top on this so the one thing I wanted to say is like it smelled kind of like dirty feet when I took the jug the lid off originally you guys not my favorite smell I gotta be honest um now when I broke this stuff up in the grinder it was so stinky all those Terps came out and smelled a lot like King Louie so if you're familiar with that strain it had kind of that deep skunky smell I didn't really get any of the apple flavor or the berry flavor personally but it was pungent and it was like deep but you guys check this fatty : ugh that they hooked me up and it's funny it's got a piney coat pine cone bud structure there just like you see with cush drains and I mean this is oh you guys perfectly grown like buds shrimp excuse me leaves trimmed right up to the buds humongous THC crystals you guys like these are globs of THC now this but itself is actually pretty dark like it's all purple undertones like the entire thing this is just dark and honestly up close and personal to that naked eye this stuff just looks purple I know it looks green on the screen here but it really is purple on the undertones and I definitely am getting some turps I'm sure if I squeeze this you know I'll get some turps it's really dry though you guys this isn't super sticky so it not very moist I'll probably stick up over the packet in here keep the humidity around 58 or 62 depending on what I go to with this but I will say that that smell smelled like something I really wanted a puff on so I'm hoping that those flavours like that King Louie type skunky flavor a gasoline EDD silly type flavor comes out and we're about to find out today I have enjoy the apple fritter from gross Sciences in my eyes are extreme cubic this is set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and then that is being fed into my scientific innovations triple filter bubbler I've got some brand new water in the second filtration chamber I've left the first chamber empty which is where our charcoal goes our carbon I should say that would typically stop any ash from getting the water but it's a vape so there won't be any ash getting in this water as well as I have replaced a brand new cotton organic cotton filter to get any remaining impurities out of this bud that might not have been purged out but you guys know the gross science is well that the the model over there is welcome to quality you guys and they never disappoint so let's go ahead let's get this review started and try out some of this apple fritter by gross Sciences oh my god you guys brutal it was a really decent first rip it's almost crazy no chill totally apple in my mouth right now like great great way to describe it like an apple pastry I mean apple fritter that's what it tastes like I'm going in for the second drip you guys I'm not waiting in god I can feel I bet you there's gonna be potent stuff I can't wait for my second rep you guys get your pieces fired up let's go you guys oh my god I literally like got a chill look at there it goes chills goose bumps all over my arms hot damn this is so smooth so flavorful I'm getting a little that sweet berry now Oh guys this [ __ ] is rocking rocking and rolling it came on like I can feel it overtaking my head about three corners the way through the rip you know one capacity starting to like oh god I gotta get this out Wow unbelievable stuff you guys I'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen right now so you guys can check it out under a 25 times magnification macro lens so you guys can get an up-close view a personal view of this apple fritter $55 $60 a 43.7 I don't care I'm gonna still say it's an eight from gross Sciences so let's take a look at that now and then I'm the check back in after I finish my bowl to report back alright so here it is the apple fritter from grow science you guys how amazing are the proportions of crystals two hairs on this stuff and those bright orange hairs look at how fat those trichomes are and I'm sure you guys can see some of those insane purple undertones peeking out from underneath the bud you this stuff looks absolutely ridiculous okay so you guys just had a chance to check it out you guys it is no wonder this bud won second place at the High Times northern cannabis cup in the hybrid category like holy mackerel this stuff packs a punch thank you guys I have a little bit of a confession for you guys today I wasn't gonna tell you but I do have a confession yesterday one of my buddies came over and we were dabbing out hard hard like just dabbing out hard so I got destroyed yesterday you guys you know that's not my scene that's not typically my bag but boy oh boy I was through the roof so to smoke some herb that is getting me on this level today a day after that I was still feeling the effects of all that dabbing yesterday god that's the hangover as me you guys know cook that's why I don't do this stuff oh very often when I do oh my god this stuff packs a punch you guys great overall feeling about an awesome body effect as well but like a good mental clarity not totally down not totally up holy cow this stuff is delish and from the beginning of the bowl till the end of the bowl like very towards the tail-end is when I started getting that you know leafy flavor that earthy flavor but boy and carry that flavor throughout the one thing man if this stuff if when you pull open the jar which they vacuum sealed thank God they do that helps with the retaining the terpenes you guys and they're the only guys that I know that are doing that off or that honestly you guys 55 bucks an eighth or 60 bucks an eighth pay it pay absolutely buy it it's worth buying it and I'm gonna give you guys my final rundown on this stuff but we're going to look at it one more time before I do that oh my gosh you've got even my eyes I'm like feeling like they're just drought out put me back in that damn state of mind it this butt looks ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous honest to god in my opinion this bud would be a ten out of ten the only reason I'm not gonna give it a ten out of ten is because it didn't have the terpenes straight out of the jar you guys and that is sad that is sad that can be if this was fresher I bet you would have those terpenes I'm not joking I bet you this would be could easily be a ten out of ten so 55 bucks you guys it's a nine out of ten for me today that's what it's going to be apple fritter nine out of ten this is some of the best ganja we have had on the channel so close to a ten I even want to almost give this a 9.5 no joke you guys because all things considered god almighty they manicured this stuff perfectly the THC crystals are so so fat I am absolutely Stoney baloney I feel great but it's missing the smell and you know what I can't get it at nine point five without smell you gotta have smell straight out of the jar even though when I ground it up oh my god it smells so good so juicy you guys so juicy it's like hi like sorry I just sniffed up some of this up it's a little bit of Barry again kind of that King Louie flavor so if you know what that is you know or that stump TV silly flavor boy it's delicious 9 out of 10 100% review it so is it worth it 55 60 bucks for an 8 should you buy it hell yeah you should buy it take two of those $35 garbage eights in your hand or two $50 garbage apes in your hand - awesome up for the $55 no joke you guys I'm all about it pay charge what you got to charge for the good gun to get out of this Snickle we're no more Snickle this is a dank thumbs up check mark the green check you guys this stuff has our recommendation and I support this ganja crow sciences keep doing it you guys are killing it over there so proud of the stuff that you guys are bringing to the table so let's hope it keeps up and maintains you guys only

apple fritter cake recipe and I'm gonna give it a try today I love recipes like this because you basically throw everything in a bowl and mix so you're gonna start with two eggs and I like to start with those first just so that I can kind of mix them a little bit before I add the other ingredients in there to the eggs I'm going to mix in 3 cups of flour 1 cup of sugar 4 teaspoons of baking powder one and a half cups of milk 1 tablespoon of vanilla we're going to mix all of these ingredients together to the mixture we're going to add in 1/2 a cup of butter melted butter and then we're going to mix that all in together the batter is poured into a greased 9 by 13 pan next you're going to core peel and dice six medium apples to the diced apples I'm going to add a quarter of a cup of sugar and also a teaspoon of cinnamon and you're just going to kind of mix that together and then this is going to be layered over the batter for the topping we're mixing a cup and a half of softened butter one cup of brown sugar one tablespoon of cinnamon and two tablespoons of flour now we're going to try to evenly drop the topping across the base and it's kind of thick so you just kind of drop it on there okay this is ready to go into the oven it's going to go in at 350 degrees and it's gonna bake for about 40 minutes while the cake is baking I'm going to make the glaze all it is is 2 cups of powdered sugar 5 tablespoons of milk and a teaspoon of vanilla and the glaze is going to go on top of the cake once it's come out of the oven and probably rested for about a half-hour that's when you're going to pour the glaze on top it just came out of the oven and I actually cooked it for about 60 minutes the apples are just really juicy and it took longer than the 40 minutes so definitely check your oven as you're going just test the cake see if it's done it might need more time depending on how to see your apples are so I'm going to let it sit for about a half an hour and then I'm gonna put the glaze on top I had high hopes for this recipe and I am happy to report that it is wonderful the house smells great I just tried it it's still warm it's been about 45 minutes since it came out of the oven the apples still warm the cinnamon and sugar still melted on top and it tastes great I really love this recipe and the cake itself is light and fluffy it's not dense at all and then the cinnamon and sugar topping it's just the perfect balance the glaze it's a little bit heavy on the glaze I used about 3/4 of the glaze I think if I used all of it it would have been too much so I did use 3/4 and then it looked like it was kind of getting thick so I stopped it and pour any more on so that's really personal preference if you like it really sweet you can certainly use all of the glaze but you probably could have the recipe for the glaze and have more than enough as well so Sean is not a big fan of warm apple but we're gonna have him try it warm and I'll have him try it cold later as well and I'll try it cold also to see which way I prefer Sean's going to now taste the apple fritter cake it looks moist this is a delicious it is yeah I think it is I didn't think you were gonna say that because you don't like warm apple desserts you're gonna smell like it's not hot no but it's still warm yeah so what do you think about the cake itself not the Apple but the base I don't know it feels like it's is it what as well apples that's on top of this well I poured a little extra of the glaze on that piece so that might be it soaking it up also oh okay it's perfect it's fluffy and it's good yeah my salt yeah it is really soft a lot of times when you make your homemade cakes and these bases and things they kind of get dense this one is not dense at all really good how about the topping the apples and the cinnamon and all that that is that so it's good yeah this is very good I'm glad we left it in that extra 15 or 20 minutes though because this for how things were I've been nearly is done no it definitely needed the extra time because the base was still bubbling I can tell the apples were just really juicy so that's why this recipe is a little tricky because you have to you can't really say a definite amount of time of when to take it out you kind of have to just watch it and see when your apples are cooked and when the juice is kind of cook out of the cake so it's tricky but I'd say between 40 minutes to an hour's it's probably the average amount of time that you're going to be cooking this for I like the glaze do you think it's too sweet not sweet enough or do you think it's just right the way it is just right I don't think it's overpowering it works good with apple in that cake mm-hmm I did a little bit less than I I had a little extra so I didn't put all of it on there but I think it was the right amount I think more would have probably been a little bit too much this is a key part it's a keeper perfect time of year if you've got lots of apples try this one it's worth it you won't be disappointed definitely so now we are trying it cold I just tried it but I'm gonna let Shawn say his opinion first two dogs are here cancel all the loud sniffing is I think I liked it better warmer do you like it cold okay that's good so what do you like better or worse about it or well the only real difference is that the cooler apples oh yeah chuckles you're cooler mm-hmm I think they're softer when they're warmer so makes it easier I like it I like it cold I do really enjoy it warm I think it's nice to have it warm but you can eat this the next day it's not something that you have to try to finish in the first day and give away or anything like that it reminds me of cold apple pie so I really enjoy it and I will be making this again I still have plenty of apples so it's it's something that we're gonna be making again this season focus okay can you do that crazy face again see the apples nope all right no because then I can't see you okay Fiona sit down a video you will not sit down", "IgaHjt74jBg": "hi folks welcome to the hillbilly kitchen today we're making apple [Music] fritters [Music] happy is that people whose god is the lord and apple fritters sure gonna give you reason to be happy apple fritters are my first recipe every year when apple season rolls around because i can make them without heating up the kitchen because it's still pretty warm at the start of apple season and don't let all these ingredients scare you off because all this stuff over here is just suggestions for different ways to top them this is our ingredients right here and we're going to start with two to three cups of chopped or sliced apples and i've done these a few ways if you want to slice them and do apple rings you slice your apple this way after you've peeled it and then you pop that center out the core and just a little metal measuring spoon or melon baller or something will work for that you just go around the edge and then pop it out there's also other gadgets you can get that'll take the course out or you can chop them up just in pieces or you can slice them the other way just slice them straight down this way and then cut the core out when you get to the middle but however you make it whether you want dipped apples or you want to dice it up and put your apples in the batter it's the same recipe and we're going to do it both ways so you can see how to do it but first you got to get your apples peeled and either diced or sliced however you want to do it and you want to add about half a tablespoon of lemon juice to them and that's to kind of help keep the color and it'll help keep them from turning brown and it'll also add some flavor in your apple fritters when they're done okay the next thing we're going to do is we're going to look at our spices here now how many spices and how much of each spice you put is kind of up to you it depends on your taste i have about a teaspoon of cinnamon i have about a quarter of a teaspoon of nutmeg just a little bit and a little less like an eighth of a teaspoon of cloves so what i'm using is quarter teaspoon of nutmeg and eighth of a teaspoon of cloves now cloves are very very strong and i also have a half a teaspoon of salt now you're going to have to have some salt in them to make your batter rise but you're also going to want a little bit of salt for all those apples it will really accent the flavor and bring it out the other thing i'm using to flavor it is i have a teaspoon of vanilla and i've got about three tablespoons of sugar now you can adjust that depending on your apples it's going to vary how much sugar you need you'll want anywhere between two tablespoons and a quarter of a cup we only have a cup of all-purpose flour here so you're not going to need a ton you're only trying to sweeten a cup of flour i'm also using two tablespoons of melted butter that i've let cool to room temperature and that's going to add flavor to it and i have two teaspoons of baking powder and i'm going to get some of this combined and get some of it out of here put my baking powder in my flour and my spices i'm going to kind of divide them up i want to put most of them in my batter but after i've mixed them together so that i've kind of got even amounts of them i want to put a little bit of it in this bowl right here now this is cornstarch it's just a quarter of a cup of cornstarch and if you watched the onion ring video and you've tried those onion rings you know what a difference cornstarch makes in the batter when you're frying something so i'm going to add just a little bit of my spices to this cornstarch because i'm going to coat my apples in this maybe a quarter of my spices are going in that cornstarch and the rest of them i'm going to go ahead and dump in my flour i'm also going to go ahead and add most of my sugar in the flour all but maybe a teaspoon and i'm going to add that in my cornstarch give your flour a whisk to mix the spices in it and that will also get any lumps out and we'll just slide this over here out of the way for right now and we'll talk a little bit about our wet ingredients we have two large eggs that we brought to room temperature and we want to give them a little whisk and we're going to go ahead and add our butter to them and our vanilla now we're not gonna put all of our milk in here with our eggs because we're gonna want to adjust this batter consistency so that it's the right consistency you don't want it too thick and you don't want it too thin but you want it thin enough that it is easily pourable when we add it to our oil so i'm gonna add about half of this milk in it and i've got about three quarters of a cup of milk here um you're gonna want anywhere between a half cup of milk and maybe even as much as a whole cup of milk it just kind of depends on the humidity affects it um even i think atmospheric pressure affects it some so you're gonna have to adjust the milk a little bit to get the correct consistency on your batter okay now i'm gonna add my butter and my vanilla and my eggs and most of my milk into my flour and you don't need a mixer or anything to do this you can mix it by hand because you're not going to whip it this is kind of like a pancake and you can even use um complete pancake mix and eliminate a lot of these ingredients if you wanted to if you didn't have all the ingredients for the recipe you can use the pancake mix and you would just add your spices and a little sugar and um probably not even any butter okay i'm gonna have to add a little more milk for sure because that's way too thick that's pretty horrible i think i want to add just a touch more milk not even all this i have left just about half of it okay that looks pretty good there you want it to all pretty much run off of your whisk you don't want to have big lumps left on your whisk that's about what you want right there now you do want to mix up your batter before you dip your apples and your cornstarch and stuff because you want to let this rest for just a minute before you actually add the apples into it and certainly before you start frying it um we've kind of talked about that before letting your pancake batter and um johnny cake batter and all that stuff any kind of batter you're gonna fry you want to let it rest before you start frying it i'm just going to mix these spices in this cornstarch here a little bit now if you have any cornstarch left after you've tossed your apples in it you can add that to your batter but usually when i make this all the cornstarch sticks to the apples because they're a little bit wet from lemon juice and you can toss them in a bag or bowl just make sure whatever it is it seals up good and tight so you don't end up with cornstarch and apples all over your kitchen okay once you've got your apples coated good with your cornstarch and your little bit of spices we want to get our oil heated while the oil is preheating we can go ahead and dip our apple slices and um our apple rings in our batter and let them sit and rest for just a minute before we put them in the oil once you have your apple pieces all dipped and you've got them sitting and resting you can go ahead and dump your apple chunks in um now when you make these you probably won't do two or three different kinds you'll either cut your apples up in and dice them and just stir them in the batter like what i'm doing right now or you'll slice them all or do slight some slices and some apple rings and dip them but you probably won't do both if you're feeding a whole lot of people though and you want to do them different ways you certainly can because like i said it's the same recipe whether you chop the apples up and dump them in here like i just did or whether you do them like these over here and slice them or ring them and dip them if you're feeding a whole lot of people if you're making these for breakfast and you're going to be feeding a crowd you might want to do some both ways because people like them different ways obviously these are going to have more batter or cake around them and these are going to have more fruit personally i like either the slices or the rings better than the the little diced up apples mixed in the batter i like the apple more than just the batter but what you're gonna get when these are cooked is you're gonna the batter is gonna be it should be light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside and the apples should be about the texture of apples and apple pie so that's kind of what you end up with and to me the slices or the rings they kind of taste like the little fried apple pies that you get you know like an apple hand pie or something and i really like that but you have that whole apple ring in there and i like the texture even better than fried apple pies when you do the rings i'm just going to drop one little chunk of apple in here so i can test the oil now you want to make sure the oil is really hot and bubbling good before you start adding your apples in and i have just a few little bitty bubbles around my piece of apple that i dumped in there so this oil is nowhere near hot enough yet when i was growing up and my granny made these she usually just sliced the apples because it was a little faster than making the apple rings but my aunt dot would always do the apple rings for us and we call them apple doughnuts because they do look like a donut and even the breading is very similar to the texture of a donut on the outside of the apple so that kind of gives you an idea of the taste you're going for the texture you're going for that's what you should get with these okay my low is starting to get hot now it's dancing a little bit more around my apple piece there that i dropped in that looks pretty good that's what you want it to do when you drop an apple in it now you can use just about any oil to fry these in um especially these days because specific oils are kind of hard to find if you can find oil at all i am just using regular vegetable oil there are a lot of healthier choices you could use grapeseed oil or olive oil you could fry them in shortening just about anything that you can fry food in you can fry these in you can even fry them in butter but that would be a little on the pricey side you want to keep an eye on them as they cook as they start to get done they'll actually start to float and you want them to be nice and golden brown kind of like these right here are and they don't take very long at all i mean like three or four minutes per side um it'll kind of depend on your oil temperature and how thick your batter was how long it takes it to fry it'll also depend on how thick your apples are thicker apples of course will take a little longer to cook you don't really want to cut them much thicker than a quarter of an inch because if you cut them thicker than that the apple is not going to be that apple pie texture it's going to be crunchy and it's not going to give you the the right taste if you want the apple to mix kind of with the batter and if you cut them too big it won't do that okay our first one here is done and it was one of our apple rings and you can see why we call them apple doughnuts when we were kids it looks like a donut as you take your apple fritters out you want to add more to the pan um that will help regulate the temperature your oil and keep it from getting too hot and it doesn't matter if you're doing the slices and rings or if you're doing the batter and the apple chunks now if you're doing the batter you want to put it in in about a quarter of a cup of scoops per fritter so just a little quarter cup measuring cup works pretty good just scoop it out and add it to your hot oil and while our fritters are frying let's kind of talk about some of these toppings because my favorite topping has to go on while it's hot and my favorite topping is probably the simplest you just take a quarter of a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon and you mix that together and while your apple fritters are hot you sprinkle the top of them now you do want to do it while it's hot because you want the hot grease to soak up the cinnamon and sugar so it kind of sticks to your fritter otherwise all your cinnamon and sugar will fall off your fritter this time of year keeping some cinnamon and sugar mixed up in a um shaker bottle is really kind of a good idea because it kind of is a a seasonal flavor and when my kids were little i would mix up a great big shaker full of it and have it all through the fall and winter but all you do for this is just sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on the fritter and this is a good topping for the pieces or the little cakes fritters that we're frying up here now the second one that i'm going to show you is just a simple glaze and this is like a donut glaze you want a cup of powdered sugar and about a quarter teaspoon of vanilla and just enough milk water or apple juice or apple cider to make it horrible now if i had apple juice or apple cider i would definitely use that in this instead of milk because it would add to that apple flavor and you can put a little cinnamon in here too if you want to it's probably not going to take more than two tablespoons of milk but it could take up to a quarter of a cup you want to add it slow if you happen to get it too runny just add a little more powdered sugar about two tablespoons you do want to mix it until you get all the lumps out of it but you want it like this where it's runny um definitely not too thick you want to be able to pour this or drizzle it or you can dip your fritters in it and that's generally what's done um while it's still hot and it'll melt the glaze you just dip the fritter in it like that you can coat both sides if you want or just one side um i usually just coat one side because it is kind of pure sugar but now that really looks like a donut and it's okay if you get some little pieces of fritter in your glaze that's not gonna hurt anything now another topping that i've got over here that goes well with anything and i'll link a video to this is just a little caramel sauce apples and caramel just go together and you can drizzle this on them you can coat one side with them or you can serve it and let people dip their fritters in it i said i have a video um that i will link to make your own caramel sauce um and you can buy it too i mean if you're making homemade apple fritters i think you could certainly get away with buying up the caramel but if you want to do it yourself we got you covered now the last topping suggestion that i have over here is just sprinkle it with plain powdered sugar now if you do that you want to wait until your apples are cool or your fritters are cool and i think these here are probably cool enough you alex got me this somewhere it's like a little mini sifter but you can get the little wire strainers and just the real small ones i think they sell them at the dollar tree put a little bit in it and just tap it and sprinkle it over your fritters if you don't wait until they're cool when the grease is still hot it will just absorb all the powdered sugar and you won't even be able to see that you sprinkled it that's actually probably the easiest but like i said my favorite is that cinnamon and sugar it adds just a little bit of texture on the outside and it has a whole lot of flavor because it's got the cinnamon in it and brett probably likes the blaze better and i think the kids all like the caramel better so with a few options you have the ability to feed a lot of different tastes and like i said you can go with more cake or you can go with more fruit to suit the taste of the people that you're feeding and if you happen to have an apple tree this is a very inexpensive way to feed a whole lot of people breakfast or maybe a dessert or something i think this would be a good dessert if you were doing a cookout or something like that maybe take your skillet outside and fry them outside or it would be a fun thing to have at uh some kind of a fall festival at church a harvest festival or something seems to me like the kids went to a harvest festival somewhere where some of the ladies were making apple fritters well you've got the idea you see how this works you just keep adding fritters to your pan and taking them out and as you take one out add one to regulate your oil now when you get down to the last fritter as it gets close to done go ahead and cut your heat off and let it finish frying in the hot oil because if you've just got one fritter in this pan and you leave the heat on it's gonna the oil is gonna get so hot that it's gonna burn your last fritter before you take it out so as you get down to like the last one or two fritters and they're almost done go ahead and cut the heat off and that'll keep those last one or two from burning and as long as you let your batter sit like we did the very first one should be as fluffy as the last one i definitely recommend draining them on a rack not on paper towels or something because if you drain them on paper towels the bottom of them is going to get really soggy apple fritters date back a couple hundred years at least the recipes are probably about as old as apples and flour um i imagine this is probably one of the very first things that was cooked once flour came around because apples were here before flour obviously but give this recipe a try um change the spices a little bit to suit your taste if you like it sweeter make it sweeter if you don't want it as sweet leave some of the sugar out maybe in the comment sections you could leave a special spice that you like or maybe a different topping something that i don't have here already and kind of let me know what your favorite way to eat these is because i know everybody has had these at some point in time and if you haven't you certainly should try because like i said it's a recipe that's been around for several hundred years and it's still loved it's pretty simple like i said i know we had a lot of stuff out here but that was totally from scratch and i had a lot of extra stuff too that you don't have to have thank you so much for joining us in the hillbilly kitchen if you haven't already please don't forget to click like and subscribe before you leave and until next time remember to put dog [Music] first [Music] you", "s32TfmvcE4c": "[Music] what I've got here and we're so excited today this is a bud of something called apple fritter and I've reviewed a couple apple fritters already and the first one I got was in a pill bottle that I got from the doctor green thumbs had no brand on it and then after I tried it I was like wow this one's really good and then we tried others but today what makes this one special is it's from a San Francisco fain cultivator called lumpy and these is Lumpy's apple fritter and I got a couple shoutouts from a couple people but one of them was on the Instagram and this was this guy's favorite flower and he was just so excited he watches the videos and he wanted to give me a heads-up that Lumpy's is out there again and I get that because a lot of people that were in the game in the past now don't have licenses and it's a shame I know a lot of people in this business and I would say that a lot of the old school players haven't been able to get back in yet but slowly but surely they're all finding their way and Lumpy's one of them so we're so excited today we're gonna add a little bit one more scoop of Lumpy's apple fritter into vapor cups strong and this Fowler is very beautiful I hope the picture does it justice so we're gonna tamp and we just tamp enough to not restrict the airflow and make it stay in I'm gonna stick it down into the paper cup I have this cup set to 330 and we're gonna wait about a minute and a half and we're gonna talk about lumpy and in a minute and a half you're gonna see this cup has made a lot of paper at the top and I'm telling you if you haven't tried vapor Cup this item is incredible it's a game changing item there's no reason to smoke anymore this thing is incredible generally Lumpy's comes in this jar and I was very lucky I went down to connected cannabis and Long Beach cherry exit and if you've never been to connect to cannabis this place is right off the 405 freeway if you get off it's right off the exit it's really easy to get into and also they have really good parking in there and I love dispensaries with good parking because a lot of times you go to the dispensaries even dr. green times there's no parking at all you got to drive around till you find because it's construction but with connected in Long Beach cherry it was very good and my bud tender was named Roman and Roman was fantastic he told me what was good he told me what people were buying and he told me what he didn't really like - this guy is good if you go down there in your meat room and you'll like them it's a very handsome gentleman if you're a lady and you need a coach check out Rome and you might like him so anyway we're gonna check out Lumpy's today this cup is ready to go and you could see look at all that vapor in the straw I've got this set to 330 degrees lights green vapor in the straw here we go let's check out Lumpy's apple fritter Wow look at that huh this our faves great this flower really has a powdery weedy taste very light taste one of the things I really look for in flowers excuse me its focus focus is very important to me I don't like being dumb in the real life I have a lot of responsibility so I like to be able to enjoy flower and also enjoy the responsibility of the day together and this flower was clear-headed in high focus and its strong but it had just a little bit of haze so what do we think of Lumpy's we're looking for the best I like this flower I definitely think it's worth the try and this flower gets the 9 it's good it's strong and if you see Lumpy's Alba fritter it's definitely worth the try good job lumpy congratulations welcome back to the game if you want to see paper cup you can see that vapor cup calm and I'm telling you this thing I cannot say enough good things about it everyone that gets to loves it everybody it is incredible and you can see it at vapor Cup calm if you're looking for strains you can see them on wheat entertainment calm thanks for joining in if you like the videos please subscribe I'm the doctor thanks for joining in party on my friends [Music]", "VH5ZnEwZ6EE": "Welcome. It's Deronda with foods 101. Today, I'm showing you how to make these APPLE FRITTERS. Don't let them intimidate you. They're\nsimple to make yet scrumptious to eat. The ingredients\nyou're going to need is one quart of vegetable oil, this is four cups,\none and a half cups of all-purpose flour, three tablespoons of granulated sugar, two large eggs (at room temperature), one teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 2 and a 1/2  teaspoons of baking powder, 2 tablespoons of cubed butter, three large granny smith apples or if you'd\nlike to use the gala apples you be my guest, one large lemon (we're\nlooking for about two tablespoons), two-thirds cups of milk, a pinch of\nnutmeg that I'm gonna grate for these APPLE FRITTERS. You can give it one pinch of regular ground nutmeg, but this fresh nutmeg takes it to another level of flavor, two teaspoons of pure vanilla extract. For the glaze you're going to need\none cup of powdered sugar. We're going to mix this with fresh lemon juice\nor if you don't want to use lemon juice you can use water. Let me show you how\nsimple and easy these are to make. In a 12-inch electric skillet I'm going\nto add our one quart of vegetable oil. If you don't have electric skillet go\nahead and use a heavy bottom saucepan or you can use a large Dutch\noven. I'm turning my heat, over here, to 350 degrees F. It's important to use a thermometer if you're using a saucepan or a Dutch oven.\nYou want to maintain your 350 degree Fahrenheit heat here on your oil. In a\nmedium mixing bowl add all your flour, your salt, cinnamon,\nbaking powder, and sugar. Give these ingredients a\nlovely little whisking until you feel that you have all your\nfive ingredients well incorporated here. Don't forget to add that nutmeg. I've got a microplane and I'm going to give it a few little gratings. You see that? Just a little bit. Incorporate until well blended. Set this off to the side.\nI've been peeling my apples and I'll show you. You can use a paring knife and I like to start at the top and I keep going around and around. My goal is to get all the way to the bottom\nwithout my peel breaking in half, so let's see if I can do that. Keep going\naround and if you don't have a paring knife you\ncan go ahead and use a vegetable peeler. That usually will work, too. Alright, we're getting to the end. Oops...there we go. Almost made it. Looky there I love doing that. You\njust want to cut the outside edges off there until you get all four\nslices. Sometimes in the center you get these little brown spots, but you can just go ahead and remove that. It won't take much to remove. Cut them into half inch squares. I've got my apples in a large mixing bowl. Sit it off to the side. We're going to come back with that lemon. I'm going to use about half my lemon\njuice over the apples. I got this little gadget. If you just want to squeeze your lemon juice here in your apples you can do that, too. Give these a lovely little tossing. This lemon juice will keep your apples from oxidizing. It'll keep them nice and\nbeautiful and light colored like this. Set these off to\nthe side. I've been adding my two eggs here into a\nmedium-sized mixing bowl. Give them a slight whisking.\nAdd your vanilla along with your 2/3 cup of milk. Whisk until well blended. Here comes the fun part.\nAdd your flour mixture to a large bowl. Just irrigate your flour by whisking it\naround and making a little well here into the\ncenter. Pour your egg mixture in with your dry\ningredients. Mix this until the flour is just combined with the egg mixture. Oh and I can smell that cinnamon and I can smell that nutmeg. The idea here is not to over mix it. That looks great. Back with those\nfresh cubed apples. The idea here is to get all your apple pieces coated with your mixture. Now you may think that your dough\nmixture may not be enough for your apples here,\nbut you'll see when they start frying up.\nIt's absolutely just the perfect amount of\nbatter and apples. Looks like we've got every\nlittle piece coated. I haven't forgotten the butter. I'm going to microwave this\n10 seconds at a time until it's melted. That took about 20 seconds. Now you want to make sure not to overheat your butter, because you don't want to start frying\nyour Apple Fritters until you get them in their oil. There's\njust something special this butter does to the outside of your\nApple Fritters while they're frying, so that's why we add our melted\nbutter last and you want to make sure you\nreally incorporate it well with your dough batter and your\napples here. Ready for the frying pan. I'm using a\none-half cup measuring cup. I'm gonna go in here\nfill it with our batter and I'm gonna add it here into the hot oil. With a fork let's pull that back a\nlittle bit. We're gonna make sure we pull it\ntogether there those little stray pieces in there.\nYou don't want to crowd your frying pan. Very important not to\ncrowd your frying pan, so I'll probably go ahead and add three in here. Fry these until they're lovely and golden brown. It can come apart and we'll have two smaller Apple Fritters. I'm going to add one more. Put it right over here. If you could\nsmell how yummy this is. I can see this is starting to get\ngolden brown around the edges. The more you fry them\nthe darker they get the crunchier they're going to get, but\nmaintaining that temperature of 350 degrees F. you want them lovely and\ncrispy. Oh and I can smell those apples. Using two forks give them a lovely little flip and look\nhow golden that is. Oh yeah these are gonna be scrumptious.\nAnd we're gonna let this one fry a little bit more. At this point you want a\ncookie tray lined with paper towels and a cooling rack, because we're gonna\ndrain our Apple Fritters on here. Give this one a turn these usually fry\nabout two minutes on each side. With tongs that are silicone that handle heat higher than 400 degrees F. we're gonna start removing the Apple Fritters. See how lovely and golden\nthey are on the bottom? That's gonna be so lovely and crispy. Add it here onto our cooling rack. I'm gonna go back in here and we're\ngonna add this one. Oh it's gonna be so yummy. And let them cool for at least 15 minutes. I'm going to make the glaze.\nI'm using 1 cup of powdered sugar and a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice.\nDon't put too much in at a time because you can get your glaze\ntoo thin. Add a little bit of water. If you don't have lemon juice you can go ahead and substitute with water or you can use\nall lemon juice. And we need it a little bit thinner. See you don't want to add too much in at once, because you don't want it too thin. You want it this consistency, so that you can drizzle over your Apple Fritters. That's the consistency we're looking for. It streams beautifully and smoothly. With the spoon we're going to start drizzling the glaze over the Apple Fritters. I still have them sitting on top of that cooling rack with the cookie sheet underneath, so it\ncan catch all this excess glaze that's dripping off the\nside of our Apple Fritters. If you want to pass on the glaze you be\nmy guest. If you want to do a sugar and cinnamon\nmixture to roll your Apple Fritters in you may do that, too. I'm going to leave that up to you. If you just want to leave them plain that's fine, too. Oh my yum. Gotta try them and I don't know which\none to pick. Let's go with this one. Oh yeah\nsee how that glaze sets up? Let me show you on the inside. You see that brown\ncrunchy part? See how crunchy that's going to be? Let's\nsee what it looks like on the inside... look at those apples. Wow. I know it's\ngoing to be delicious. Here goes... That lovely crunch I know and you'd\nthink it would have no better at all with as thin as that better was with all\nthose apples but see it surprises you every time. Gotta\ntry it again with that apple nice sweet perfect\nbalance of flavor. That lemon glaze on the top really takes\nit to another level of flavor. Yum. I just got a taste of that nutmeg.\nThat tiny bit of grated nutmeg gives these Apple Fritters a lovely\nlittle surprise of flavor. I'm Deronda with foods 101. Give me\nthumbs up. A perfect way to enjoy your apples during this Fall season.\nLeave me a comment. Hit that notification bell to be the\nfirst to get my new youtube food videos. Thanks a million for watching y'all.\nStay safe and I'll catch you lovely people later...", "NAYBkUoSFpo": "You've heard of apple fritters but, have\nyou ever heard of an apple fritter cake?! That's what I'm making today. I'm Tess\nand welcome to my kitchen. It's apple season here in Pennsylvania and this apple fritter cake sounds yummy on this chilly day. So, let's get started! I have\ntwo Granny Smith apples. You can use any apple that you like. Dicing into\nbite-size pieces and adding to my pan. This is going to be the apple filling\nlayer of the cake. Adding some water, sugar, cinnamon, and cornstarch. I have my heat on low and going to stir and cook the apples for about five minutes or\nuntil they start to soften and the sauce thickens. Then I'm going to remove from\nthe heat and let it cool until I get my other ingredients ready. Now on making the sprinkle topping. I\nhave a half a cup of brown sugar and I'm adding a half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a couple grates of  nutmeg. Be careful,  fresh nutmeg has a powerful, pungent flavor\nand a little goes a long way but, it does give another dimension to the flavor!\nGiving that a good mix around and setting to the side.   Next is the cake batter. I have some\nsoftened butter and adding some sugar. Giving that a whisk with my hand mixer\nuntil incorporated and then I'm adding applesauce and vanilla. Another mix and\nthen adding two eggs adding one at a time and mix in well. The recipe and list of ingredients for this\ndelicious apple fritter cake is in the Information box below. If you like this\nvideo please remember to LIKE, SUBSCRIBE and leave a COMMENT below. Feel free to share this video on your\nfavorite social media site. You can also find me on Facebook and Tess Cooks4u blog. Now I'm going to mix the dry ingredients.\nI have two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking\nsoda, and cinnamon. Giving that a whisk to make sure everything is well combined. Now I'm mixing about a third of the dry\ningredients into the wet and stirring well. I'm adding a cup of Greek yogurt to\nthis recipe but adding a half a cup for now. You can use our cream. Next is\nmore of the dry ingredients. The other half a cup of yogurt and\nfinishing with the rest of the dry. Just mixing until combined. I have my oven preheating to 350 degrees.\nI have a well buttered and floured... 9 by 13 baking dish. You can use a smaller pan if you want. For a  thicker cake just keep an eye on it and adjust your baking time.\nFirst, I am layering out half of my cake batter. Just smooooothing out to make an even layer. And now I'm adding my spiced apples. Just add by spoonfuls and spread evenly, trying not to disturb the cake batter\nbelow. Just take your time there's no rush.   Now I'm sprinkling about two-thirds of\nmy brown sugar cinnamon and nutmeg mixture over the apples. This cake is\nsmelling good already! The rest of the cake batter goes on top! Just\nscooping out in piles and spreading out with my spatula. This is easier with a smaller\npan. Just take your time. It spreads out nicely. No right or wrong here. And now goes on the rest of the brown\nsugar sprinkle. Baking at 350 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick\ninserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. And we're not done yet! In the meantime,\nI'm going to make a yummy glaze that goes on top. I have two cups of powdered\nsugar and I'm adding one teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and some milk. The recipe\ncalls for 6 to 7 tablespoons of milk  and I'm adding the milk slowly to get the\nconsistency that I want making sure that I stir well in between the milk\nadditions.  And this is what i'm looking for! A flowing ribbon consistency. I'm\njust setting that to the side until the cake is done baking. And the kitchen smells wonderful! This is\nthe cake right out of the oven. The toothpick came out clean and now is the time to add the apple fritter cake glaze. Just pour the glaze right over\nthe top and spread out evenly with a spoon or knife. It's important that you do\nthis when the cake comes right out of the oven so the glaze can soak into the\ncake while it cools and makes a nice hard and flaky delicious sugary crust on top. Letting the cake cool and I'm ready for\na slice! And this is what I've been waiting for.... a yummy piece of cake with\nlots of apples, flavored with cinnamon and nutmeg, with the delicious sugary\nglaze... just like an apple fritter! I hope you get this delicious apple fritter\ncake recipe a try. I know you're gonna like it. And until next time, enjoy. Thanks for joining me here at Tess Cooks4u.

with another high quality foodie feature for\u00a0\u00a0 you here on peep this out reviews this time back\u00a0\non over a good old mickey d's to check out another\u00a0\u00a0 one of their all-new mccafe bakery desserts and\u00a0\nwithout further ado guys let's go in on the apple\u00a0\u00a0 fritter and yeah this looks to be a nicely fried\u00a0\nsituation we're about to get into here right\u00a0\u00a0 now guys feast your eyes on what looks to be a\u00a0\nvery nice combination of some doughy goodness\u00a0\u00a0 cinnamon and apples fried up to a crispy golden\u00a0\nbrown before it's covered in sweet glaze icing\u00a0\u00a0 and i gotta say the presentation looks pretty\u00a0\ninviting and the size isn't really too bad for\u00a0\u00a0 the $2.39 that i paid for this right now and if\u00a0\nyou take a look in the very bottom it's kind of\u00a0\u00a0 reminding me of the cinnamon roll that i did\u00a0\nrecently so let's not waste any more time on\u00a0\u00a0 this one guys let's see if the flavor is going\u00a0\nto deliver it's the all-new apple fritter part\u00a0\u00a0 of the new items here at the mccafe bakery here\u00a0\nat mcdonald's let's peep out this flavor well i\u00a0\u00a0 guess in terms of portion control this is actually\u00a0\nnot too bad considering the size it really kind\u00a0\u00a0 of feels like a smaller version of the like the\u00a0\nstandard apple fritters that i'm used to seeing\u00a0\u00a0 especially like at disneyland they're literally\u00a0\nlike three times the size so considering what\u00a0\u00a0 i've got here this is actually not too bad and i'm\u00a0\nreally digging the presentation plenty of icing on\u00a0\u00a0 this one and again the very bottom is really kind\u00a0\nof reminding me of a cinnamon roll for some reason\u00a0\u00a0 i don't know why but i'm getting that vibe maybe\u00a0\nit's just the color and the texture of this one\u00a0\u00a0 it's not nearly as soft as a cinnamon roll\u00a0\na little bit more harder but even still\u00a0\u00a0 looks pretty good okay so before i bite into this\u00a0\none and like always if you guys are fans of high\u00a0\u00a0 quality delicious looking food reviews make\u00a0\nsure to hit that subscribe button down below\u00a0\u00a0 and don't forget to tap that bell icon so you can\u00a0\nbe notified as soon as brand new content drops\u00a0\u00a0 every week all right truth be told i'm not really\u00a0\na super fan of fruit on donuts but i have to admit\u00a0\u00a0 the smell of this is really enticing me and i think\u00a0\nthat has something to do with the glazed icing on\u00a0\u00a0 the top so let's give this a shot it's the apple\u00a0\nfritter brand new here at mcdonald's let's do it soft i may be a fan of fruit\u00a0\non these types of donuts\u00a0\u00a0 yeah that apple is subtle but it goes so\u00a0\namazing with the sweet glazed icing on this\u00a0\u00a0 right there as well and obviously with the doughy\u00a0\ngoodness on the inside take a look at that guys\u00a0\u00a0 that is really nice nice and golden but man the\u00a0\nsweetness it's not really crazy sweet but i'm\u00a0\u00a0 really digging the subtleness of the apple on\u00a0\nthis let's keep goin i really like how soft it is\u00a0\u00a0 yeah i'm digging this right now i don't think\u00a0\nit's going to pull me away from the cinnamon\u00a0\u00a0 roll over here at mickey d's which if you haven't\u00a0\nseen that review take a look at that one popping\u00a0\u00a0 up on your screen right now that was pretty\u00a0\nheavenly this is actually a nice runner up\u00a0\u00a0 and like i said the apple is very subtle so i am\u00a0\nreally digging the fact that the sweetness like\u00a0\u00a0 i said is not really crazy on it but it really\u00a0\nfeels very quality made and that sweet icing\u00a0\u00a0 with the cinnamon goodness is amazing on it guys\u00a0\nreally really tasty let's go for one more bite yeah this is a pretty nice sweet treat and i can\u00a0\nsee why they want you to pair this with some of\u00a0\u00a0 their coffee over here guys i mean if you don't\u00a0\nwant to get anything really crazy with a cinnamon\u00a0\u00a0 roll this is a nice runner up and again the\u00a0\nquality is pretty nice i'm really digging\u00a0\u00a0 the overall just the toastiness of everything here\u00a0\nguys i know it's fried and all but it's got a very\u00a0\u00a0 nice soft feel and as you go into it that glazed\u00a0\nicing is beautiful so just a beautiful situation\u00a0\u00a0 overall and with the subtleness of that apple\u00a0\ncoming up on the back end it really rounds out\u00a0\u00a0 just a very very tasty item over here very glad to\u00a0\nhave checked this one out today well considering\u00a0\u00a0 the quality of that cinnamon roll that i checked\u00a0\nout recently i was really hoping the quality of\u00a0\u00a0 this apple fritter was going to be somewhat\u00a0\nclose to that and guys it actually is i mean\u00a0\u00a0 the cinnamon is very similar on it but naturally\u00a0\nthe sweet icing is just a little bit different and\u00a0\u00a0 overall with the apples being very light on the\u00a0\nback i really love that little accent coming up\u00a0\u00a0 there very very solid so coming from someone who\u00a0\ndoesn't necessarily like fruit on donuts this is\u00a0\u00a0 actually changing my mind to get this one every\u00a0\nonce in a while i'm gonna have to give the all\u00a0\u00a0 new apple fritter as part of the mccafe bakery\u00a0\nhere at mcdonald's a pretty rock solid\u00a0\u00a0 8.5 out of 10 definitely satisfies\u00a0\nthe itch for something sweet very similar\u00a0\u00a0 to a cinnamon roll because of the denseness that\u00a0\nwhen you bite into it you're kind of getting that\u00a0\u00a0 but the subtleness of the apple coming up there\u00a0\nis a beautiful situation and that sweet icing\u00a0\u00a0 is primo okay so now the obvious question did\u00a0\nthis one actually look pretty primo to you\u00a0\u00a0 drop some comments down below are you a fan of\u00a0\napple fritters in general is this like one of your\u00a0\u00a0 go-to items there outside of say normal donuts\u00a0\ni mean naturally everyone's got their preference\u00a0\u00a0 but do you really like apple fritters drop those\u00a0\ncomments down below and definitely let me know and\u00a0\u00a0 with that this is Ian

the next one see ya", "dtKuAxDnHQE": "what is up youtube this is friend of a dude and this is the final update on the three by three flower tent powered by the growers choice 315. um yeah it's been an interesting run you know i like always seem to be too busy with life to really pay attention to this run but you know no excuses uh you can see everything the ice cream cake just never really caught back up to speed and you can see up here these look freaking awesome let's start with the apple printer just looking amazing like always and then we move over here we have the wedding crasher you can see looking beautiful the only thing is uh the weight on the wedding crusher is pretty small but whatever you know moving on the ice cream cake it didn't come out terrible obviously it's not what i wanted but it still looks smokable as far as quality is concerned a lot of the leaves browned out but you can see that it's smokeable and then at the back it's noisy we got the mimosa looking awesome smelling really good so that's the end of this run um you know i'm hoping uh i can do better next run obviously you know it's uh disappointing when something like this happens but it's kind of uh my first time growing that strain so you can see everything else did really well so the strain and it's all unified so the strain is just a little bit more picky maybe but in either case scenario it is what it is i'm not too disappointed obviously the weight the weight of this round is not going to be anywhere where the last round was i already know that but it's all uh you know it's all learning experience and at the end of the day this is for fun so anyone out there who takes this too seriously know that this is literally just for fun this is not me trying to to claim any sort of like status in the growing world obviously this is not something i would brag about but this is definitely something that i'm stoked on just having a head stash a little flavor patch maybe we can work on that ice cream cake for the future and just keep things rolling so yeah i'm going to reset this tent i'm going to harvest here and then reset with more apple fritter more wedding crasher and i think i'm gonna try the ice cream cake again i i'm kind of determined to see where i went wrong and see if i can do it better next time so yeah i'm gonna go ahead and uh get these girls chopped down let them start to dry and just get working on moving forward you know next time i think i'm going to do less plants just to see if i can manage it better with maybe like six to eight plants instead of twelve so other than that everything is you know looking really good i'm just excited to smoke this to be honest with you this is uh what i'm looking forward to so it is what it is uh you know i wish there was more and wait but i'm happy with it so thanks for tuning along sorry for the lack of updates like i said had a lot of crazy [ __ ] going on in my life and this little head stash tent was the least of my worries and concerns so um yeah thanks for following along if you have and uh look out for future updates i'm definitely still going to be posting videos amongst the craziness going on but um just probably not weekly so yeah stay tuned subscribe feel free to like comment all the fun stuff and uh i'll catch you guys soon take care peace", "m8ytLPsef6g": "it's pastry time mother truckers you're watching mel's and chris and yes we got a whole bunch of posters some ooey gooey goodness pasters and you get to see it here first like you do with everything well almost everything most everything okay if it's sweet it's for me okay so mcdonald's is coming out with three new pastries starting on october 28th yes we're doing it now yes so we have the cinnamon roll right here it's loaded with cinnamon layered between buttery flaky pastry dough that is drizzled with a cream cheese icing served warm caution hot yeah so the cinnamon roll is two dollars and fifty nine cents it does smell very buttery yeah like it's it is two dollars this is our receipt right here i don't know if you can see that that fingers in the way and then right here we have the apple fritter is a classic fritter fritter made with cinnamon and apples fried soy golden brown and drizzle with a sweet glazed icing smells good so the apple fritter is 229. i know that uh duncan uh sells apple fritter and it's like 1.99 i know this one's a little bit more and smaller it is a little bit smaller because duncan's a little bit bigger krispy kreme has really really big apple fritters and i believe they're like two dollars and this one's a little so they're all priced about the same but this is a little small so the last cinnamon roll's not cinnamon those good sides the cinnamon the apple or which one is that cinnamon apple whatever the blueberry muffin was 219. and uh it's their new recipe is baked with real blueberries topped with streusel crumb topping on a soft fluffy muffin i know starbucks sells blueberry muffins for like 245. duncan sells bloom berry muffin for 1.99 so this is like in between prices this is available starting october 28th nationwide that's cool it comes with a spoon and a pour yeah i mean a fork and a knife and what's cool about this this is available for breakfast lunch and dinner your snack time this is not just for breakfast all day so all day i'm doing it so i'm guessing it's 24 if there is their mcdonald's open 24 hours and be open like a bid not for anybody craving some sweet sweet i like salmon roll because it has cream cheese awesome yeah um a big cream cheese buttery flakey pastry oh it smells so good we're eating all fancy right here with the knife and no not a mess okay now that's good i gotta get that middle very buttery is it mm-hmm and then you get nice cinnamon aftertaste but that cream cheese is on point i cleaned his eyes and my favorite still nice and warm it's really really good really really really i bet this has like over 400 calories something yeah they didn't have no pictures or nothing in the store but they didn't have a little calories but it would be all right that's good i really like their seminals now do i like it two dollars good it's not bad yeah it's 259 so it's the most expensive out of the three they're all about two dollars and some change look at that muffin top filling goodness that's really good i'll get one more bite just one more little bat okay before it gets cold that's good i like the cinnamon rolls good mm-hmm another blueberry muffin it's not a bad size mug it says it's a new recipe so i'm guessing that have it before i think i've seen it people do it it's all kinds of multi-colored though yeah it's got the streusel crumb topping it's got it's made with real blueberries so i'm gonna need a napkin for this it looks pretty yeah and this was the cheapest out of the three this is two dollars and nineteen cents oh that's magnet that's i know i see that and you can see that blueberry is it good it's crunchy on top yeah that's the streusel i like that i like that texture oh my god a very blueberry flavor very very blueberry there's a lot of blueberry flavor it's so good but that top is crunchy that's what i like that's my favorite part though it's crunchy i wasn't expecting you know that texture difference i'm a big texture person i like it because it's so soft i like the blueberry i should have showed what i considered the muffin top oh they are early we're filling up some muffin top right now that's good i like that one i don't know if i like it better than a cinnamon roll because the cinnamon roll has this is so good and then this bad man my gym right here is the apple fritter yep and this i love me some apple fritters love me some apple fritters it's 229. so this is supposed to be made with cinnamon and apples there's drizzled with a sweet glazed icing oh yeah and it's still warm i gotta cut it it is crispy mm-hmm i need a tissue that's so good oh my goodness it's got a crunchy exterior too about that hint of apple cinnamon in there my icing so sweet i think i like this one the best that's a good apple fritter now i will say this i'm not a fan of how small it is because it's not me at all i wish it was bigger because the prices the taste is definitely right there yeah it's got a really good flavor like it's not overbearing cinnamon not overbearing sweet not overbearing apples just like good like apple pieces but it does have little apple pieces that's good that's really good oh my gosh it just needs to be bigger it does it needs to be bigger it's so good i'm sugared out right now negative so good i couldn't why didn't you eat my blueberry muffin you left it sitting because i was trying to try the aqua further you eat too slow smooth you lose i see that why not this ain't going to be available until the 28th of october so that's another but you guys just watch us eat it and enjoy it my favorite right now um it just depends if you're in a muffin mood apple fritter mood or cinnamony mood well the apple fritter has cinnamon on it too but the i like the cream cheese icing on the cinnamon roll and it's the biggest yeah it is the biggest but it is also the most if it's not like 20 cents more than the apple fritter yeah the cinnamon rolls 259 the apple fritter is 229 and the blueberry muffin is 219. so it's 36 more but it's bigger i like it it is bigger apple fritter is on point yeah that tastes it's good they really got it with the taste the flavor all that stuff they hit that one the nail in the head with that one the only problem is it's kind of small it's on a smaller side but the blueberry is also really really good yeah like i really like it and i like the streusel on top i like the blueberries i mean it's all of it it's just really good they're trying to compete now yeah now they i mean they i would say they have competition like with with starbucks duncan they come out some donuts oh that's mine don't they do i only come out some donuts especially now that's all this competition make up for all their their celebrity collaborations that they keep i guess people really don't like it but it's just a deal it's like a meal deal that's all it is it's not like a like the the j baldwin yeah it's just a deal that's all it is it's a good deal because you get a free mcflurry mm-hmm in my opinion your

top filling greatness greatly really great like all videos like subscribe comment all that fun stuff", "lnyvbkjzGEI": "hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I wanted to share with you what my favorite fall treats these are my apple fritters they are to die for that's how good they are but they're really really easy to make and very impressive and this is the kind of recipe where you kind of don't even have to leave the scene of the crime when you want to eat them because they're just so good when they're piping hot and fresh and it's smell unbelievably good and in Pennsylvania in New Hope every fall there's a there's an apple festival and they serve apple fritter so this is kind of my take on them on those and they're just so good the ingredients you'll need are very few basic kind of ingredients starting off with some cake flour I've got some cake flours I'm bringing it a sugar salt baking powder in cinnamon diced up apple some unsalted butter that I've melted an egg some milk I've got some vanilla extract and I also have some vegetable oil getting really nice and hot because these are going to be fried and they're gonna be you ah so good okay I've got basically all of my dry ingredients in this bowl now I prefer to use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour because I find that it gives me a much lighter fritter it's not as dense and that's just what I prefer but if you can't get your hands on cake flour by all means just use all-purpose flour however I do think you should go the extra mile and try to look for cake flour because it gives you just a much better texture in my opinion okay now I'm going to add in my apples to my mixture and this is just a diced Fuji apple simply because I love Fuji apples they're not too sweet not too do not very tart but you can use whatever Apple your heart desires I'm going to pop that right in there and don't worry if it's not mixed up really well it doesn't matter and now in the bowl I have my apple in I'm going to add pretty much remaining ingredients I'm going to go with my milk my egg a little bit of butter I've melted let it cool a little bit as well and good a splash of vanilla extract you need it I think it makes a difference anyway not the imitation stuff got to be the real deal and now just whisk it really well until combined pour the wet into the dry and I like to mix everything together using my spatula so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to give everything a really good mix to make sure it's all well combined waiting for my oil to color temperature and then we're ready to fry and now you need it I know I amaze myself too this looks perfect exactly the consistency I'm looking for my oil is up to temperature and I'll show you a great way for you to know whether or not your oil is up to temperature without using a thermometer this is how my Nona does it and it works every single time you take a wooden spoon handle down make sure it's clean and if you see any bubbles forming around the base of the wooden spoon your oil is nice and hot it should be around 360 degrees or so no lower because I find that if it's any cooler than that then the apple fritters just become a little bit stir a little bit too oily and then I just use my small ice cream scoop the equivalent about one tablespoon and make little ones rather than really big ones because then I feel like it's just more they're just yeah a lot more of them and they're just easier to eat dump them in only cook a few at a time so the temperature of your oil doesn't drop give them a toss around make sure they're all browned beautifully they'll take a few minutes about four minutes or so and then drain them on a paper towel I'm just going to keep on working last batch is coming out look how gorgeous they are there really is something so I use the word magical but perhaps that's probably the wrong word when you're frying something there's such a for me anyway because I'm not into it very often

fritter bread what yeah I know so there's this there's this group on Facebook that I stumbled on and it's all the rage on this group and I thought you know what I have got to share this with you guys because I know that you're gonna love it I mean apple fritters hello okay so let's get started on this it's gonna be so good and so much fun I will leave the recipe in the description box below with the original author's name and I hope that you guys have a blast with this we have 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar and one teaspoon of cinnamon sex to the side we have 2/3 of a cup of white sugar and 1/2 a cup of soft butter in another bowl we have two eggs and one and a half teaspoons of vanilla in another bowl we have two apples peeled and diced and one another Bowl we have a half a cup of milk in this bowl and in the back Bowl we have one 3/4 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 & A and one and a half cups of flour let's get started the first thing that we're gonna do is we are going to mix in the brown sugar and the cinnamon with the apples and again in my attempt to use every bowl in the house I might have to put this into a bigger bowl but you want to get all of the apples coated in that brown sugar cinnamon mix okay and then they can sit there and wait for you come on lease until it's their turn in the mixing bowl but good stuff okay so now let's go over to the mixing bowl and see what kind of trouble we can start off over there while the apples and the cinnamon and the brown sugar are marinating themselves together we are putting the butter the sugar into the mixture and we're gonna mix it up really well doesn't take but a hot minute to do and then we're going to mix in the baking powder and the flour combination so let's turn the back on you're gonna want to get in there scrape it down from the sides make sure that everything is getting mixed up very nicely together okay so that's all mixed in now we're gonna what we did is we beat to the eggs and the vanilla together so now we're gonna add that mixture in there and the milk and then we're gonna beat it up some more okay so it's all mixed up now we're gonna go back over to the counter now comes the fun part okay so we've got our pan jury is out about whether or not you need to do this but I'm going to hopefully I'm not destroying my pan I just gave it a nice coating I don't want it to stick I want to eat it okay so we're gonna take half of this batter and put it into the pan how do you measure half yeah eyeball it okay so half of that batter goes into the pan kind of spread it out you want to get it into all the corners okay and then you're gonna take half of the apples and you're going to put that into the loaf pan kind of spread it out tamp it down okay okay then poof back to the batter we're gonna put another layer of the batter the rest of the batter is going to go on here scrape it all down from the sides okay and then you're gonna spread that out okay you want to get it all four corners okay and then you're gonna take the last of the apples and the cinnamon and brown sugar and you're going to add it on top of the loaf pin and you're gonna spread it out make it all count in the meantime you've had your oven heating up to 350 years yeah-huh oven heating up to 350 degrees okay just tap it all down unless your oven comes up to temp you are gonna put this in there for sixty to seventy-five minutes depends on your oven keep an eye on it okay so while you're waiting for the oven to come up to temp you're gonna grab a butter knife or a chopstick or whatever you're gonna lightly swirl everything through there okay and then just Pat it down again okay so the oven is up to 350 degrees we're now gonna put it in the oven and it will come out in about sixty to seventy-five minutes depending on your oven 300 in the ovens so now we're gonna prep the glaze it's just a basic glaze half a cup of powdered sugar and one to three tablespoons of milk or heavy whipping cream whichever you prefer and depending on how thick you want it so you're going to mix that up until the glaze is the consistency that you want mm-hmm and then you can pardon me and then you're going to set it to the side and we're gonna wait for that incredible bread okay mm-hmm yep passage estas okay where it's 60 minutes look at that this smells amazing if I ever wanted smellivision for you guys it is now oh my gosh okay so you can make this in bundt pans you can make this in any kind of you know pan that you want and that I think plays more with the oven more than the oven does for temperature you'd make it a little bit longer in different kinds of pans but this is awesome okay I think we are good so I'm going to let's see here oh my foot my mitten back on yeah nope I'm gonna put that back in I'm gonna put that back in for about ten more minutes and then we're gonna let it cool for half an hour that right there is the hardest part about this whole recipe let Nick okay so we're at ten minutes more so a total of 70 minutes oh yeah now she's done now she's done okay so now I'm gonna get her out and let her cool off for half an hour how'd it suddenly become a girl I don't know okay so we're gonna do this look at that beauty is yes it is we've been better if I'd had another rack handy okay so look at that okay so we're gonna let it cool off for 30 of the most difficult minutes of my day always and we'll be back to glaze it oh yeah he'll get the taste test in 30 minutes later give or take pretty much cooled off there's still a little heat in there okay now we're gonna take that glaze and make this irresistible absolutely irresistible I'm just kind of half hazard haphazard haphazard drizzling it over the top and next we will have Phil come and taste test hello okay this is just gonna be there we go okay mr. Sutton are you ready do you want to cut it do you want an M piece or the inside and n piece okay so just oh look at that you guys let me bring you down look at that okay that just looks incredible so

scented to bite doughnuts and I start with two tart apples you could use any variety that you peel and coarsely grate so first add but a teaspoon of lemon zest just right over the grated apple and two tablespoons of lemon juice and along with the lemon juice three tablespoons of sugar helps to dry out all the juices from the Apple and this is what helps make the batter easy to mix give this a little stir and I'll just let this sit to let the sugar dissolve and the apples to soften up and it only takes a couple minutes to sit and into a big mixing bowl add 2/3 of a cup of sour cream along with half a cup of sugar there we go I need two eggs I want to keep the white separates because I'll whip those and add them at the very end and the yolks can go into that sour cream base I'll just give this a little whisper there you go now you can see in just a few short minutes how much liquid comes out of the apples so now I can add this to the sour cream base and whisk that in and now it's time for the dry ingredients I'll start with one in three quarters of a cup of all-purpose flour and a teaspoon of baking powder just a quarter teaspoon of salt and I really like an apple pie flavor in my apple fritters so I had a full teaspoon of cinnamon as well as a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg simple enough I'll just sift this all together and add it to that sour cream face you can really see how the grated Apple has softened up it's easy to stir into the batter and the juices that came out of the Apple really makes it easy to mix and then add just a touch of butter two and a half tablespoons keeps the fritters nice and tender now the batter seems more cake like and I need to lighten it up a bit so I'm going to whisk the two put my hand and add two tablespoons of sugar and then pull that in once you've risked your egg whites until they're foamy that's the best time to add the two tablespoons of sugar the whites just barely have to be in a soft peak so they're still quite fluid but you can see you've got that solid white color so you know you have them well whipped and I add this all at once to the batter all right got our nice light fluffy batter and it's time to fry when I'm frying I like to use a neutral tasting vegetable oil like canola grapeseed sunflower or corn these oils also have a high smoking point that means they're built to take the heat of frying because these are to bite fritters I use an ice cream scoop I bring it to the oil which I've preheated to 350 bring the scoop close to the oil and then gently drop it in I find these fritters take about three minutes on each side to flip your fritters you just give them a little tap on one side so it takes another three minutes on that side before I start frying I get all my tools ready so I have a tray with paper towel and a cooling rack I have tongs and also a spider or strainer or slotted spoon works to pull out the donuts once they're done here they are a beautiful golden brown but the first ones ideas have cooled to room temperature and so I give them a nice generous coating with icing sugar aren't those inviting and appealing and they've got that nice crusty exterior you break into it that cakey cinnamon apple inside of what an absolute treat", "RVkZ2ILcAoo": "hey lettuces Rochelle we're here to do another quick eliquid review this time we're going to be taking a look at a new one from loaded and this is an apple fritter all the links you need to know where you can find it will be down below but this is 120 ml bottle of three milligrams of nicotine I'll be testing this

you get from the grocery store so very very nice I'm hoping it's not cinnamon Ford because that to me is gonna be off-putting but we're gonna go ahead and give it a vape and I'll let you guys know what I'm tasting so to me this is like a chunky inside filling of an apple pie you're not getting a whole lot of like pastry note on there more like the filling but it's so nice because the cinnamon that you can tell there's some mint in it but it's not overpowering at all and that sweet apple really takes um the front of it so I really really like it I've been really impressed with the flavors loaded to come out with lately so this one is not disappointing whatsoever and definitely gets to thumbs up for me so I hoped you liked this quick review if you did please give it a thumbs up leave

morning welcome back to my channel today what I'm gonna be doing today for the recipe I'm gonna be cooking in my Sun Oven we've really got a lot of Sun today and I'm hoping it stays that way but I'm gonna be making apple fritter bread which is delicious and my husband's gonna be the lucky recipient to take it to work for his friends so the first thing that you're going to need is one stick of butter and that's got to be soft room-temperature soft I'm just gonna mix that up you could use a hand mixer longer that way on that grounded out by the sound of it this apple fritter bread is just so good I sold it at the farmers market this past summer and it was one of my biggest sellers okay once you get your butter creamed up then you're gonna add 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 2/3 cup of white sugar to that and I'm just using my whisk so just creamed together and I'll give me a good workout but it's got all that it's got fall flavors or cinnamon and your vanilla I have to I - sure to use my mixer for this part okay bear with me let me get some wet in there it'll be easier next is two large eggs there we go now starting to loosen up a little bit and these eggs are from my chickens so they're they're fresh eggs got them this morning here we go okay once you get all this cream together and we're gonna add in two teaspoons of pure vanilla and I always use pure vanilla whenever I bake if it calls for vanilla because I just has a better flavor than the imitation stuff okay those are vanilla and then to that we're gonna add 1/2 cup of milk I'm using whole milk but you could use 2% if you wanted to and if you really wanted it really really rich you could use cream okay now we're gonna add the dry ingredients so the first thing I'm going to start adding is the flour all-purpose flour so one and a half cups and we'll do it just kind of gradually and it doesn't have to be sifted but you can actually break this recipe down and because I was when I saw at the farmers market I was using small little foil pans and I think I got at least three small foil pans out of this one recipe but today I'm just gonna make a big big loaf in my loaf pan so but I wanted to do the Sun Oven today because they say we're supposed to have a lot of Sun and I've got it preheating outside right now so there's all the all-purpose flour and the next dry ingredient is one and three quarters teaspoon of baking powder okay and then we ready make sure I've got enough to send them in here teaspoon and a half of ground cinnamon all right and now what I got to do is I have to layer this batter let's send them in an apple mixture as it takes to to like medium size apples and I've chopped them up peel them and chop them up and added two teaspoons of granulated sugar and one teaspoon of cinnamon okay let me get the pan ready and I will bring you back so I can layer it okay so now I'm ready - I got my pan sprayed with Joyce Baker Joy's secret or you can just use let's go and flour whichever you prefer I just like the spray and you're going to layer the batter least try to get it you know as even as possible and it's a thicker batter so okay there's one even layer and then the next layer it's going to be your chopped up apples and I try to spread them out a little bit so every bite you get a little bit of apples okay another layer of batter scrape the spoon off basically you're just you're just creating layers is all your doing I think I'm gonna switch to a just a regular spoon because this spoon it's kind of big okay this way I spread it a little bit easier there we go okay another layer of apples oh it smells so good the cinnamon and the brown sugar okay then after I bake this and I will I'm gonna make a glaze to put on the top after its cooled okay so one more layer of the batter I'm just gonna scrape it out like this get all that good stuff out of there okay let's spread this out best we can and it's gonna rise up really pretty scrape all that off of there okay let's do the apples first we'll put some apples I don't know I might keep this for myself so to let Network and then we'll do the rest of the apples spread them out I kind of tamp them down a little bit so they kind of stick on the dough as best you can okay okay that's what it looks like it's all put together so now I'm gonna take it out to the Sun up okay I'm all here at the of a Sun Oven I've got it in there and it's already up to almost 300 degrees so hopefully it will take probably maybe about an hour but we'll see I'm gonna close it up and lock the door ouch that's hot and then I will bring you back when it's all done okay I'm back with the apple fritter bread it turned out really pretty it took about an hour and 15 minutes in the Sun Oven which is it's pretty good it's always gonna take a little bit longer than your regular conventional oven so now I'm going to make the glaze that you put over top and it's really easy it's a half a cup of powdered sugar and I don't level it I just kind of scoop it okay there's that and then one to three tablespoons of I'm using heavy whipping cream you can see that well we'll try one and we'll see what it when it looks like that's we're stirring it to see if I need to F yeah probably need more let's add to this is gonna make it really creamy easy so you don't get powdered sugar everywhere it doesn't take very much okay I think I'm gonna add the three it says one two three so I think the three would be just enough okay let's stir this up probably gonna put it in a smaller Bowl okay see ya you know what I'm gonna put another tablespoon so I'm gonna do four because it I want it to be just a little bit where it'll actually pour out the spoon so if you're using whole milk it would it would be a lot roomier than that it's probably just too there we go that's better okay I'm gonna put this in a smaller bowl and I will bring right back okay now the glaze is all finished and that's the consistency all we're gonna do is start drizzling it over the apple pie fritter bread and you can put as much or I'm gonna put a lot I tell you since I got that Sun Oven I use it as often as I can you want it to go down the sides and and you could take a spatula along the sides if you wanted to and it's so good know one thing it's gonna be happy okay that's about it pick a fork and just kind of drag it along a little bit down the sidewalk okay I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you try this it is delicious for fall for Thanksgiving dinner would be something different she could fix but I will have to bring you back after I cut it just so you can see the what it looks like on the inside so I'll bring you back in a minute okay I've cut a piece is so moist I'm gonna try a bite can't I can't stand myself oh my goodness it's so good as moist the apples is what make it really moist and you have the pecans cinnamon brown sugar delicious well I hope you all liked this video hope you try it give it a thumbs up

have a plate lined with paper towel first what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and get my oil started go ahead and pour it in here you don't need to fill it all the way probably about 1/3 full it's fine and then we will heat it on the stovetop at medium-high okay now while our oil is heating up let's go ahead and make our batter so we'll take our flour our sugar vanilla extract okay and then we're going to go ahead and add our sprite like I say we're gonna use about a half a cup I start with a little bit like that we'll go ahead and mix it and we want the consistency to be like a pancake batter okay that'll work nicely so the consistency is about like pancake batter I'm going to go ahead and set this aside and now I want to prepare my apples so there's two ways that you can do this you can use your knife so we'll go ahead and just cut it in half like that and then now you want to come over here and cut the side it's a little it can be a little slippery cut it down like that nice or what I really like doing is using my mandolin slicer I'll put a link down below where you can pick one of these up on Amazon they're really awesome I really love mine and then I will just put the top line like this just protect my fingers and down like that and as you can see it makes nice perfect rings okay now what we want to do is we want to hollow out the middle where the core is and you can use it a knife to do this just go ahead and cut around it like that or another neat trick you can do I went and got a melon ball where you can just scoop it out with your melon baller like that works great okay I got my apple slices ready you'll notice I didn't peel my apples you can certainly peel yours if you like and then you're going to go ahead and just dip it in there and I'll do this the remainder of these over at the stove and then we're going to just take it out like this and let the excess come off and then go right into the oil oh right and then what we do is we just take our ring put the batter on it and go right in there and these don't take very long to cook just about 30 seconds to a minute on each side and you're just a fry them until they get nice and golden-brown so about like that looks like a little donut and then you just place it on a paper towel and let it let it dry all right to finish these off we just go ahead and get our powdered sugar here and there we go apple fritter rings all right our apple fritter rings are done they look fantastic they smell amazing really easy to do simple ingredients at less than 20 minutes of course the more you make the longer it'll take and if you run out of the batter just mix them up it's super easy I'm Matt Taylor this has been another episode of in the kitchen with Matt thank you for joining me if you have any questions or comments put them down below and I will get back to you as soon as I can thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe to my channel share this video like this video take care time for me to dive into one of these", "SCrVYkNjyhg": "- Hey guys today I'm gonna share with you your new favorite fall treat. (laughs) An apple fritter. These are so delicious\nand easy to put together on a weekend when you're looking for a little baking project. They also take advantage of\nall those beautiful apples that are in season right now. Let me show you how to make 'em. So the first thing we're gonna\ndo is prepare our apples. So I am working with gala apples. I like this variety of apple\nbecause they're really light so they will cook up much\nquicker in a fry setting. And then you can transfer them to a bowl and they you're gonna sprinkle them with a tablespoon of sugar and\n3/4 tablespoon of cinnamon. And give those a toss just\nuntil everything is combined. And then in a large nonstick skillet you wanna melt two tablespoons of butter. And once that butter is melted and foamy you can then add the apples. And at this stage you want\nto cook the apples down just until they're really\ncaramelized and tender. It'll also help all that\nbutter soak into the apples and give them great flavor as well. Then while your apples are cooling we're going to prepare the batter. So the first thing you wanna do is measure out a cup of milk it could be 2%, whole milk,\nwhatever you have is fine. And then you wanna\nsplit a vanilla bean pod down the center and scrape out the seeds. And I like to put the seeds\nand the pod in together because there's great flavor in that pod. And then you just wanna microwave this for about a minute, a minute and a half, just until that milk is nice and warm and just let it steep\nthere on your countertop while you're mixing the\nrest of the ingredients. And this will create a really beautiful vanilla infused milk. Now if you didn't have vanilla bean or if they're too\nexpensive where you live, I know they can be outrageous, you can also skip this step and use maybe two teaspoons\nof vanilla extract instead. Then in a large bowl you're gonna add a cup and 3/4 of all-purpose flour. One and 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder, a 1/2 a teaspoon of salt, and a 1/3 of a cup of sugar. And then you can whisk that\nall together until combined and then you're going to fish\nout your vanilla bean pod and then add your\nvanilla milk and one egg. And that's all there is to it. And then you can just stir that all up until you have a nice batter. And then we're gonna\nadd back in our apples. So before we set out on the frying part, frying can go really really well or go really really wrong (laughs) and usually it comes down\nto a candy thermometer. So it's really important\nanytime you're frying anything to have a consistent temperature. Because if it's too hot\nyour fritters will be burnt and then doughy inside. And if it's not hot enough, you'll end up with a\nreally greasy fritter. So you really want a\ngood candy thermometer that will tell you when\nyour oil is at 375 degrees which I think is a really\ngood temperature for frying. And then you just keep\nyour thermometer in there as you're frying to make sure\nthat that oil is consistent. And you just wanna find the spot. You can go up or down\njust calibrating the heat until you have nice consistency. Then the other thing you wanna do is get everything kind of set up. So get your bowl of batter on one side and then set up your\nlittle draining station. And I like to take a sheet pan, line it with some paper towels and put a cooling rack on the center. That way when my fritters are done I have a place to put them. And then two other things that will help with your frying success\nis a cookie dough scooper that is one inch. Now at first this might look\nlike a very small quantity, but once you put the dough\nin the oil they do puff up and they become really\nnice bite-size pieces. And I find the one inch works really well. And another thing that's helpful to have is a spider strainer which will help you fish out your fritters once their done. So once you have all that of that set up you are ready to go. So you wanna start by frying\nthree fritters at a time. So you can go ahead and scoop it out and drop the batter in the hot oil. And you'll see they'll start to puff up and kind of float around. You'll know that they're done when they're really nice and golden brown and they've been in there for\nat least two to three minutes and place them on your cooling rack. And then you can sprinkle them with a little bit of powdered sugar. Now if you wanted to\nmake these for a party you could certainly make\nthis batter ahead of time and place in your fridge and maybe bring it to room temperature for about 20 minutes or so\nbefore you begin frying. I have done it where I fried them and then kept them at room temperature and then heated them\nup before guests arrive but I don't think they're as good. (laughing) I think there's something about a freshly fried fritter\nthat just can't be beat. So I would go the former route, put it in your fridge and then fry them just quickly before people come. They are the perfect thing\nto just pop in your mouth when you're wanting just\na little taste of fall.

budget is liability barbecue what are we making today is going to beat some Amish aphid fritters I stumble to drop this recipe when I was looking for another recipe I found this recipe on a website called the grateful girl cook calm that was simple enough for me to hook up with my rudimentary quasi baking skills anyway a little good we're going to try come on in take a look at these ingredients I will be having the amounts of these ingredients in the description below so we're just going to kind of name up these ingredients the first thing I need to do is add my lemon juice to my chopped up apples just so it doesn't go around before we get to working with that we're going to go ahead and set this aside our next ingredient we have sugar and flour baking powder cinnamon salt milk and then for our glaze we have some vanilla extract a little bit of warm water and we have some powdered sugar anyway let's get on to our first step first step in this recipe is to get our eggs and our sugar just blended together we're just going to use a little mixer for this and we're going to blend it for about a minute okay now that that's gone a minute we're going to add our baking powder our salt our cinnamon our milk and if there's anything else who we eat in there milk we're good to go let's live and now that that's blended up we're going to go ahead and add our flour all right now that we have all that blended animals I'm going to do is we are going to go ahead and add our apples to this we're just going to fold it in [Music] alright this batter looks good meat I have about eight of an inch of canola oil getting heated up to about 375 degrees in the skillet once that comes up the texture against our dropping these in and making our fritters alright let's go ahead and start adding this batter into our skillet and I should be able to get about three in here we're going to flip these once they start turning golden brown all right they're turning golden brown we're going to go ahead and flip them be careful when you're doing them and should only take about another 30 seconds maybe a minute all right they look golden brown on both sides we're going to go ahead and remove them I'm going to set them on a wire rack so they can drain off and I have some batter left over but my family's not here yet so I'm going to go ahead and throw that in the refrigerator and cook that a little bit later one things I did off-camera when I did cook the couple more of these and a lower temperature 375 make seems a little bit high for me to like cook so it's about 325 degrees so we're going to see how those turn out anyway well they're cool innopolis with it and makes a blade surrounding our powdered sugar or vanilla now my vomit and our warm water we're going to give this a stir that's about it stick is like a nice thing would be and now you have that I'm just going to drizzle it on top you could paint it on top if you want I'm just going to go ahead and drill little warm-up all right we're good to go let's get this tape test out away it's so high I feel like I'm on mission here I've already swept through one t-shirt about to slip through another one so let's hurry up and get down and do this taste test now it is due to your convention it is one back where I cooked with the oil at 375 degrees I did another Bachelor the oil is a little bit lower sometimes kind of taste the difference between those so let's go ahead and try the want to cook this the higher temperature then glaze nice I think some rum would be good in there but I don't think how much people drink from I don't know all right let's try one that cooked at lower temperature for a little bit longer I like a little bit if enjoy the apples that cook down a little bit more the apples is the one that was the higher temperature a little bit more firm but you know what I'm not gonna take those advices one thing that I will do when I make this again I will be making us against is I'll probably cook the apples down just a little bit just kind of lock them up a little bit before I put them in the batter and if you want a real easy like a shortcut on this canned apples Isaac would be perfect almost like a apple pie filling come on my try this anyway thanks it's my no hippie BBQ I appreciate it comment subscribe nunna", "OPeK1CXohlc": "[Music] what's up guys gals vapors youtubers everybody else out there I'm Mike deck vapes I'm back at all you guys again with another ejuice review and today we are taking a look at loaded eliquid this is manufactured by ruthless yeah I'm sure you guys are pretty familiar with loaded e-liquid they had or have one of the more popular donut flavors out there on the market loaded 'he's been around for some time now and like I said it's a pretty popular juice a lot of people know about it so with that being said we got two new flavors actually I'm only reviewing one right now the next one will be coming up soon but I have two new flavors from loaded e-liquid I have the Apple fir which is brand new and I also have a melon milkshake and that was also brand new so we're gonna be taking a look at apple fritter today and that is what we are vaping on and what we're gonna be talking about so let's dive it down into it I'll show you the bottle real quick give you a quick explanation juice profile all that stuff and we'll get to vaping it so we got this big one 20 mil glass bottle it's it's a little change of pace I know loaded and ruthless is always pretty much always manufactured in glass bottles and I do still dig the glass bottle thing it's nice to see these 120 mils in glass bottles as opposed to you know all the 100 and 120 mil chubby gorillas these days downside is you know you still got the dropper top you know that that could be kind of a hassle to have to carry this big bottle around with you you know refill your your RTA or you know even just to read rip you know but I guess that's what they make the little 60 and 30 mil unicorn bottles for fill one of those up and bring it with you and you're good to go but yeah enough about that it's your mirror standard 120 mil glass dropper bottle yeah not much to say really about the bottle these that's the labeling ruthless is one of the companies that does this big nicotine warning on the front not I I know it's it's it's something that has to be done by the manufacturers by these companies you according to the FDA and all that stuff it's just I hate these I really do just this big white label you know ruining their label just to say warning this has nicotine like we didn't know already but you know it's gotta be said for you know everybody else out there so basically this bottle is a just big 120 ml with the loaded label on the front you got apple fritter up here in the corner you also got three mg up on the corner let you know your nicotine that you have or that you purchased and I'm always reviewing and vaping in three mg so you guys should know that 120 ml bottle tells you how big it is right on the side there and you can check out their web site loaded e juice calm yeah pretty standard stuff on the on the bottle it's got all the caution and warnings and you know ingredients and all that stuff on there so you know your standard 120 ml glass dropper bottle but yeah this is a apple fritter and the flavor profile on this one is a long-drawn-out one like all the other ruthless flavor profiles not gonna read the whole entire thing be you guys can get the gist from you know the simple ingredients that are in this this apple fritter consists of soft caramel caramelized apple bits heavenly golden brown crust and a fresh e ground cinnamon so you're getting a little bit of like a like a pie crust type thing or like a you know you know of a crust you're getting a crust flavor as well as you know the cinnamon and a the apple apple fritter part so yeah that's about all I can tell you I can tell you that the nice people over at ejuice plug calm were nice enough to send this one and the melon milkshake by loaded e juice over to me for the purpose of review so thank you guys over there on their website they're selling this for $19.99 for a 120 mil bottle it's available in zero three and six milligrams of nicotine yes it is 120 mil 420 bucks not bad you know I think all they're loaded 120 mils are on sale right now so not a bad deal for a 120 mil of some pretty popular juice that people are pretty well aware of if I would say let's give this a good shake this is supposed to be a 70/30 VG p blend let's take a look and see see the bubbles here I don't know if you can see them all that well it's definitely bubbly and they do take quite a while to rise so it's a good high VG blend so yeah that's apple fritter let's see if we can dive into this and talk about it huh so yeah let's let's vape it first things first sigelei chaos spectrum mod we have the dead rabbit on top this dead rabbit is loaded with some twisted 24 gauge brand new cotton and she's oming out at 0.15 these are the same calls I had for the last review as well they're still rockin still looking good got some fresh cotton in there so we're gonna get to vape in it now enough about that let's think so what I'm picking up from this right away I get that I get that kind of like golden brown crust flavor on the inhale followed with some of the cinnamon and then the Apple comes through kind of on the exhale for me at least let me let me taste this again just to make sure here [Applause] the more you vape it your palate kind of gets used to it and it starts to just kind of blend everything together but mainly I get that I get the crust in the cinnamon on the inhale midway through the inhale and then following the exhale is mainly Apple towards the end it's all really blends you get a little bit of crust and send them in an apple all together towards the end there but the Apple is kind of on the tail end you get a little bit of apple on the inhale a little bit but I think it's it's kind of muted by the the crust and the cinnamon good vapors production flavor is excellent flavor is excellent on this one real consistent this bottle is brand-spanking-new it's barely moved at all I've been dripping it most of this day today but the bottle is barely even dented so it's gonna take me a bit to get through this I would I would assume as far as this goes this juice is a plus in my opinion it is tasty it is definitely an apple fritter I taste that crust I taste the cinnamon I taste the Apple and nothing about it it tastes artificial the flavors very consistent so far I can't say you know base this off of a week-long vaping period or anything but just as of my first impression today it's very consistent it seems to be very clean juice as well cotton hasn't changed colors at all throughout the day coil still look pretty good I'm not seeing me gunk build up or anything so that's always a good sign you know time will tell over a few days of vaping what this will actually do to the coils and you know we'll see how that goes but as far as right now my first impression on this juice [Applause] it's a good apple fritter it's got great vapor production the flavor is outstanding I pick up a little bit of everything out of this I get just that great like golden crust taste mixed with a little sprinkle of cinnamon and then the the fresh like warm apple in there is is just amazing it it's definitely an apple fritter no doubt about it mmm probably one of my favorite apple apple fritter flavors I've tried so far I had one in the past from oh god I don't even know who it was I don't even think I have it up here I don't think it made my cut it was from somewhere motus motifs motifs vapours makes a juice called riot that is like similar to this it's like apple with my crust and like caramel or something like that and it wasn't bad but this one definitely definitely blows that one out of the water the the flavor on this is really good vapor the vapor production is good can't complain about it whatsoever it's smooth on the inhale on the exhale I'm not getting any tingling no scratchy sensation nothing like that it's not harsh in any way just a real smooth consistent flavored juice and it tastes really good mmm it's like you're just biting into a warm apple fritter straight from the bakery it's really really really tasty yeah yeah I like this one these flavors are ones that I don't normally go out and buy but these are ones that I will I'll definitely come back to in the in the in the future this one is one I will definitely come back to it is a very very good tasting juice I highly recommend this if you guys are looking for like an apple fritter some kind of apple cinnamon type vape this one would be the one for you to try and I mean $19.99 for 120 ml bottle not a bad deal they I think they also offer this in 60 ml don't quote me on this I think they do saying ruthless I think offers this in 60 mil as far as I can tell from a juice plug they only have the 120 mils for $19.99 so excuse me with that being said guys the gals if you want a nice apple fritter juice Apple Cinnamon vape something similar to that try out this loaded apple fritter it's brand new it's really good I gave it two thumbs up I think it's a tasty juice definitely an all day vape in my opinion can't say much more about it so with that being said guys and gals I went over the price and went over the the NIC levels you know the bottle size manufacture juice profile we vape that we talked about it I don't think there's

granulated sugar cinnamon 2 apples all-purpose flour with baking powder granulated sugar brown sugar with cinnamon vanilla extract and then you're gonna also want room temperature milk eggs and butter and then we're gonna go ahead and get started so you're gonna start off by preheating your oven to 350 degrees I used 2 9 by 5 inch loaf pan I sprayed it with baking spray and then I also lined it with parchment paper on the bottom so in this bowl I'm just combining flour and baking powder and then we're gonna set this bowl aside and then another bowl we're gonna beat the granulated sugar with the softened butter in the mixer until it's smooth and creamy so here we go you want your butter to be room temperature so if you see I had my fingerprints in there it was soft enough to do that so you'll see here that once it starts mixing it is gonna get a little clumpy but that's okay because once you just keep mixing it everything will smooth out and I'll be perfect so just trust that and go until it becomes smooth and you'll see in the next clip how it turns out so this is how it looks after all the clumps have come out it's nice and smooth and then from here we're gonna go ahead and add our eggs one at a time and in between each a we're gonna mix it so that it's fully incorporated and if you need to just go ahead and scrape down the sides of your bowl so that you make sure that everything is getting incorporated or mix perfectly so now you're gonna add your vanilla and you can mix it in there with the mixer or spatula but now you're gonna go ahead and add the flour and baking powder mixture and they're gonna go ahead and mix that up until it's all combined and they're gonna go ahead and add your milk to liquify it because as you'll see it gets really stiff it's not soft like a cake batter should be [Music] [Music] and you don't have to mix this too much just enough that its core incorporated because you don't want to overmix your flower so here I've already cut up my apples I'm just adding the cinnamon sugar mixture over it I'm just gonna give it a good mix and this is what you're gonna put in between the layers so you're gonna go ahead and add half of your batter into the pan and then you're going to top it with the apples and then you're going to sprinkle some of the brown sugar and a mixture on top of those apples and then you'll put the rest of the batter on top of that and then do the same thing on the top and I did have leftover apples so if you did buy two about the same size apples that I bought you might have extra you can either just add extra apples to your cake or you can eat them on the side like I didn't it was really good so I got a phone call and I didn't record how it was but this is what it look like on the top and how it was in the middle so this is how it was after came out of looks like and then you're gonna go ahead and mix your powdered sugar with a little bit of milk just to make it's late to make a glace re I got cut off yeah so you're just gonna make a glaze you can make more if you need I prefer if we probably should have made more just because I like a lot of please but this is fine I just did a little sprinkle over the top and it came up really good I think the glaze really makes it that extra it just takes it that extra step there you go so you just gonna go ahead and drizzle that icing over the top of it all over and just watch it cascade down um well yeah guys this is it for this cooking video baking video I hope you guys enjoyed watching this I know it's a little short but it's okay short and sweet um yeah if you guys enjoyed this go ahead and give me a thumbs up comment down below if you guys like this or if you tried it or if you want me to try any other recipes um and then also

apple fritter and I have the Boston cream snack pie these were Cygnus from Sarah in California so thank you very much Sarah we don't have a 7-eleven here so this is special to us and it's so funny we were watching some show like in Bangkok or somewhere and they have a 7-eleven over there and it's like water it's like they have 7-elevens in other countries but what you don't even have one close to us and it's an American thing that's just funny this is an apple fritter with diced apples and sweet and glaze it is a three ounce package one fritter 85 grams is 330 calories I know alright then but I don't have the personality to run something like that now what's good some people would probably heat this but it does not have heating instructions on the package so we're just gonna try straight out of the package because I'm assuming that's how most people eat it is ready to go right they've got the wings in these places instead they've got Mike where you throw it in like what do you want I'm not cover in the middle that is so delicious it's very very fresh you get the apple flavor but it's not it's just perfect the glaze on the top is very sweet it is but it's a little it's not like a soft pillowy dum net no it's kind of a puffer yeah it is much like a bear claw yes honey bud that's perfect yeah well I think it's e I think it's tougher than a honey bear is because any time has come it's solved there are apples understood enough I could I saw more stuff on them oh yeah it diced apples yeah there's apples yes Tom so much fun but there are some in there I don't know how much you paid for this but I really do think it's delicious this is absolutely be worth it that's good apple cinnamon compliment yeah and I love how fresh that is I probably I like this apple fritter as much as other apple fritters so we've gotten locally from like program no no very good now this is the Boston cream snack hog once again you can absolutely eat this up it is chocolate and vanilla filling in light legalised flaky crust and when they say a lot of guys that mean it cuz there's not very lightly like that's so like well just look at the difference between the glaze and the apple fritter in the glaze on top which is good this is 1 pound 113 grams or 4 ounces is 410 calories that's not enough going for you I can give you another piece okay so this was 330 this is for 10 and it once again there are not heating instructions on the box so if you heat it up you're doing that on your own that's okay but it's not something I would ever bother no I don't like the ball I don't have to like the linebacker and I don't like the flavor at all it's very sharp it tastes like old grease it does it's very greasy yes it tastes sometimes that's a good thing sometimes we like the / yes sometimes it's like we're at the fair and we don't know funnel cake and this is awesome this doesn't taste like that this is just like you've had old grease in your deep fryer for a long long time and you've used that same grease to make this pie and the whole pie is taking on that flavour so you're not tasting vanilla you're not tasting chocolate no but I do taste that grandma I don't necessarily yeah I do not care about how and so I don't hate it it's not like I would just like it so much that I would put it in my hate pal do you dislike no right it's not we felt like I would spit it out yeah we've had better pots their paws are hitting this they are we've had some good ones and some we just really good boy and I have to say that about a lot of these because most of these most the ones that are putting base like this then had chocolate especially the chocolate ones are like I don't know it doesn't matter what brand it is let's go chocolate yeah it doesn't matter what brand it is the chocolate is usually terrible so it wouldn't be one bad again definitely this is one of those yeah but yeah and I wonder if they have other flavors like cherry or peach or you know whatever so but this one was really really good so thank you very much to Sarah for sending us these I'll have a picture for you pin so you can see all the glaze and stuff and thanks for watching [Music]",

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "KCoPxQ8J5GM": "[Music] hey we're double apple fritters go and [Music] that's how we figured out your sister had the appetite of a full-grown alien", "OS19d5IdSN0": "[Music] hey guys it's Alisha now one of my favorite kind of nano things to eat is apple fritters I absolutely love them and so since it is fall and it is apple season I thought it would be fun to make an apple fritter bundt cake now this bundt cake is so so good it is a rich cake with layers of cinnamon and sugar and apples and it just tastes delicious and very much like an apple fritter so if you want to see how I make this just keep watching okay I'm gonna go ahead and just jump into this I normally show you the ingredients at first but there are a ton of ingredients in this and so I'm gonna just show them as I go and as always or at least I try to always I will have the ingredients and the instructions down in the description box so first thing first is you're gonna need about three apples cored peeled and chopped like I have here and you're gonna put those in a medium sized saucepan you can use whatever type of apple you want I'm using Granny Smith because I like the contrast with the the Tartar apple in the sweet of the cake but you can use whatever type Apple that you want to use and to those apples I'm gonna add a quarter cup of granulated sugar about a half teaspoon cinnamon maybe a little more just about 1/8 teaspoon of clove and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and two tablespoons of water so I'm gonna just stir this up and I've got this on medium heat right now and I'm gonna just let this cook for probably about five minutes or so just until these apples start to soften and then I will be back and while those apples are cooking I'm gonna go ahead and do my topping and for that you're going to need a half cup of brown sugar about a half teaspoon cinnamon and then I'm gonna just add a sprinkle of clove and a sprinkle of nutmeg and then I'm gonna mix this together really well and then I will just set it aside now we're gonna take our dry ingredients and we're going to get them all mixed together really well so I'm gonna start off with my flour what's I just flung everywhere I'm the very messy cook okay so actually before this I always forget to say get your oven preheating at 350 so we're gonna start with two and a quarter cups of flour teaspoon baking soda and a teaspoon baking powder then we're gonna do teaspoon of cinnamon and that's a little rounded over but I like my cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon salt and you're gonna just get this all nice and stirred together and then just set this aside okay my apples are finally starting to look pretty good I wish you could smell this it smells so so good I cut these a little bigger than I normally would so it took a little longer to cook than it normally would probably about ten minutes to get to to get them to where they're starting to soften a little bit but I'm gonna call this good and you definitely don't have to make your Apple pieces as big as this I just like having nice big chunks of Apple in there so I'm going to take this off the heat and just set it aside next up you're gonna want to take your sugar which is 3/4 cup and 1/3 cup of softened butter and you're gonna want to mix this on about medium for a couple minutes or so until you get that butter and sugar real well incorporated together I've got that butter and sugar cream together and now I'm gonna add in about 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and a cup of Greek yogurt and if you don't have Greek yogurt you can absolutely use sour cream I have used both and they both work well then you're gonna add two eggs and about a teaspoon of vanilla and then you're gonna mix this up real well okay I've got that mixed together now I'm going to add in my dry ingredients [Music] and I'm gonna just mix this until it's combined you don't want to over mix it okay I've got that mixed and now it is time to put this cake together so here I've got a very well sprayed bundt pan you definitely want to get a good spray on this because you want the cake to come out without falling apart so I just took a cooking spray spray that real well and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take about half of my brown sugar and spice mixture I'm going to just sprinkle it along the bottom of the pan here [Music] and now that I've got that on there I'm gonna put about half of my batter down on top of the brown sugar and this batter is thick so it's a little difficult to work with but you just want to try to cover that brown sugar about half that batter down now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my apples and I'm going to just spread them on top of this batter is evenly as possible and I'm going to take the remaining brown sugar and spice and I'm gonna just sprinkle that on top of the apples and I'm gonna put the remaining batter on top of this and I'm gonna just kind of spread this out the best I can again this batter is really thick so it's kind of hard to work with but just do the best you can all right now this is ready to go in the oven I'm gonna bake this at 350 for probably about 40 minutes maybe a little longer maybe a little shorter I'm gonna start checking it around 35 minutes but I will be back when it is done I let this bake for just about 40 minutes and I've taken it out because it is done now I'm gonna let this sit for probably about five minutes or so before I try to take it out of that pan you don't want to take it out right away you want to let it to cool just a tiny little bit so after about five minutes I will flip this out I let this cool for just over five minutes and I went ahead and took it out and as you can see it came out pretty good so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just let this sit here and continue to cool a little bit and while that's cooling I'm going to go ahead and make a glaze for it so for the glaze I'm gonna be actually using one that I got from a fellow youtuber on here and that is Parnell from Parnell the chef he gave this to me when I was talking about on another one of my recipes the fact that I don't do glaze a lot so this is how he does his glazed and he says it is one that kind of hardens nicely and I figured that would be perfect for this type of cake because that sounds like more of a doughnut glaze so that's what we're going to be using and it just calls for two things powdered sugar in water and it is a hundred grams of powdered sugar so I'm going to be measuring that out and here on my skill [Music] 101 close nuts and then he says four tablespoons of water you can do less or more depending on your thickness so I'm gonna start out with probably one tablespoon at a time and just see where it gets me with the thickness so that's just one the whisk this all together here and definitely going to need more than one so I'll do you another one and what's that [Music] okay that's looking more like what I'm going for so I'm gonna let that I'm gonna let the cake cool just a little bit longer before I put this on but it is almost ready and when I go to put this on I will show you that and the finished result go ahead and drizzle this glaze on now and it seems to be working pretty good I'll have the link to Parnell's channel up above definitely go check him out he has a great channel and thank you to Bernal for this recipe [Music] so now I'm going to go ahead and cut a piece of this out so that you can see what it looks like inside and here it is with a piece cut out of it I don't know if you can see in there very well it's the inside and here is the piece that I cut out you can see the inside of that a little bit better nice chunks of Apple with brown sugar and cinnamon in a super moist cake just a delicious combination of flavors is so so good and while it may not be an apple fritter it definitely tastes a lot like one I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching and I will see you on the next one [Music] you", "NGgBzna9na4": "[Music] okay to start off this cake recipe i have two granny smith apples that i chopped up pretty small i just diced them up real small like this if you want them a little bigger you can and to this we are going to add the cinnamon half of the cinnamon that we have for the recipe or even a little less than half and then we are going to add brown sugar and we're going to give it a mix and just let them sit here for a few minutes till we get the batter ready okay so they're going to look like that we're going to set this aside for a moment and we're going to start to get our flour ready here i have our flour our baking powder and our salt i'll have the ingredients and the measurements down below okay we're going to give this a mix just to make sure everything's incorporated and the cinnamon give that a mix okay set that aside we're gonna take our butter and we're gonna beat the butter with the sugar to this we're gonna add our granulated sugar and we're gonna give this a mix on medium speed for about two minutes [Applause] [Music] okay now that is nice and creamy we're gonna take our spatula get everything off the side of the bowl okay and we are going to add our eggs we have two eggs and our vanilla okay now we're gonna give this a mix again for another two minutes [Music] okay we're gonna stop it scrape everything down and we're gonna start adding our flour okay we're gonna add in our flour a little bit at a time and mix it on low speed [Music] okay we're gonna stop it knock everything off and we're gonna add in our apples you can just toss these in there and they smell so good with the cinnamon and the sugar and i'll just give it a mix for about 30 seconds get everything incorporated and we're done okay i'm gonna take this off and i'm gonna transfer you over so we can pour it into our pan here i have an eight by eight inch nonstick pan this is a wilton that i got off of amazon i love this pan i am still going to spray it a little bit so that i can ensure it's going to slide out very easily now we're going to pour in our batter we have our oven preheating to 350 degrees [Applause] okay and then just spread it out okay so there it is i'm gonna pop it in the oven and i'm gonna start checking it at 45 minutes it should be okay up until that point but everybody's oven is different so you want to check your oven you know your cake make sure it's not burning or cooking too fast okay guys i'll be back as soon as this is ready now on to the um the glaze that we're going gonna put on top of the cake here i have some powdered sugar we're gonna give it just a little pinch of salt real tiny and i am going to use maple syrup if you don't have maple syrup you can use um vanilla extract i just love the flavor that it gives with the maple syrup just apples and maple syrup just go together okay we have the maple syrup we have some heavy cream and of course we're going to add more if we need it and then just give it a mix add it a little bit at a time so you don't overdo it and there's the consistency you just wanted a little runny consistency just like that maybe a little bit looser okay and that's it this is our glaze and i just put it in a pyrex bowl so that i can cover it and it doesn't get crusty and set it aside while we wait for our cake i'll be back okay the cake is out of the oven it was in there be very careful with this 45 minutes we're gonna do the toothpick test right in the center no batter comes out a few crumbs is okay i'm gonna let this sit up here for about 30 minutes for it to cool and then we'll pour our glaze on it and then we'll cut it so you can look to see what it looks like okay guys the next step for this is let me get this a little closer here we're gonna get a little skewer a little wooden skewer and we're going to poke some holes into the cake [Music] just everywhere and that's so that the glaze can go in take our glaze and then you just pour it all over [Music] okay and it looks just like that look at that delicious [Music] look at that looks delicious now you can wait till this sets or you can cut it right away we're gonna cut it right away let's get a piece out of here put it onto my plate here look at that delicious look at that it's a little denser of a cake but it is delicious guys let's give it a taste okay guys look at this delicious look at that look at all the little pieces of apple i don't know if you could see them this cake is very good guys this is going to conclude the

dude and this is the start of a new series on the 3x3 10 and things are gonna be a little different this round as you can tell we have that AC unit right there in the back which is way overkill but in the sake of having an experiment and just trying to manipulate the tent and environment at whatever temperature I want that's what we're gonna be rockin so you can see I hung the grow light all the way up to the top not taking any chances this round with any plants getting too tall as it is the tray is on cinder blocks because the reservoir underneath so in the future if need be I could just change that setup but for now I'm trying to my best to work with this little setup as you can tell so very excited I got everything cleaned up and a nice hydrogen peroxide hot water mix took out the old intake components and working forward to getting this environment dialed in moving forward I'm hooking up all of the water lines and getting everything set up so I can give my plants in here but before that happens I still need to test the environment a little bit so turn on the light get everything rocking start seeing what the air conditioner can do with the light turned on as you can tell I got an environmental sensor there hooked up to a controller and that is actually more accurate I found than the actual air conditioning unit so yeah everything is ready to go very excited like I said that air conditioning unit is overkill but I'm kind of just going for more of control and experimenting so moving outside I'm using the outdoor space to transplant and as you can see here I'm messing around with the two-port mix I believe it's called to purr but yeah it's good stuff it's cocoa mixed with perlite I'm really excited to try it out exactly what I was trying to go for last time I use a little great white mycorrhizae to complement the soil right before transplant and I'll give you guys a quick look and the clones I'm working with man this round of clones that I took they just came out amazing very excited with how those came out good health is a good start and we got our nutrient water there and it's a nice little setup outdoors for transplanting now everything's ready to go I'm very excited the plants are rocking in the very back row we have four mimosas in the middle we have four ice cream cakes and on the right we got two wedding crashers on the left complemented by two apple fritters so this round is gonna be awesome I cannot wait for the flavors I went ahead and turned down the light just for the first couple days and then quickly I'm going to turn the light right back up to 3:15 so thanks for watching make sure you subscribe and check out all the future updates I'm going to do on this tent I have a it's going to be pretty pretty cool", "NUtNyj8W5HU": "[Music] welcome back to the channel so as everybody is kind of stuck in their house so are we so we've been doing a bunch of baking my wife has actually got fresh homemade bread baking which was really good and what I'm gonna be making today is something that hopefully turns out really good because I love these are the donut shop so so yeah washing hands wash hands I finish this you guys go wash hands cuz very important always notice now that always so when we go to the donut shop we all love apple fritters so I found a recipe which is an apple fritter low so that is what we're going to be making today it sounds like she's pretty simple and [Music] [Music] they're producing all right so the recipe seems simple so it should be pretty quick I've already got all my ingredients measured out just have the apples here to dice up and then we're gonna go ahead and get bacon all right first thing we want to do is we've got a loaf pan lined with parchment paper got our oven preheating and now what we want to do is we want to take these two apples here we've washed them already and now we need to core them peel them and dice them into small cubes so we're gonna make this really quick and simple okay okay one two three all right that was quick and easy and now we're gonna move on to start mixing the ingredients okay first thing we've done is we want to add and combine our brown sugar and some cinnamon in a bowl I'm gonna put that to the side okay so now we're gonna take our baking powder and put it into our flour and and carefully just kind of stir that together that's all right Stu this should have used a bigger bowl that mommy stole all the bowls to make bread let's put that aside okay so now Hope is going to put our granulated sugar into the mixing bowl and butter in okay and we are going to beat that until it's smooth and creamy it's locked all right it's already locked that's the lock good we're gonna add our eggs one at a time OOP can mix this one [Music] anyway all crackly you control the brother get ever started once a slop over the edge and then [Music] [Music] [Music] we want to make sure we cover this one I bet you even with the cover it slops over the side slow slow go just one [Music] we're gonna take our apples a little bit of the our cinnamon and sugar and just sprinkle those over the apples mix that in the coat put this onto the into the mix so I need I need one person to sprinkle the brown sugar and the cinnamon and I need somebody else to put the apples Oh be ready the apples we're gonna take half of our batter and put that in okay and now we're going to add your half of this sprinkle half of that evenly over well not until you use half of it good so over here whoever's having that parts gonna be happy alright this is brown sugar this recipe actually said light brown sugar I have dark brown sugar stories and dark brown sugar and cinnamon half of this you want to sprinkle half it so gonna make sure you get all over okay oh yeah because [Music] the corners in that corner over there do one more yeah okay yes down in this way okay perfect that's good now we're going to take the rest of our batter now we're going to top with the remaining apples I was it I wasn't sitting a little bit I was standing on the edge then why did you say you're standing on the edge of it because you didn't say it right [Music] [Music] swirl the brown sugar for about an hour okay we're all baked we've taken out of the pan it's cool to room temperature so now we're gonna do is we're gonna make our our glaze all we have is our complexion shooter I'll be a trick we're gonna have some milk [Music] let that dry and come back we might do one more layer you made another glaze this one's thicker so we have this much milk at and we're going to just drizzle this one now we'll do we know it's doing I didn't mean to do it [Music] I'm joking all right we are all done drizzled it we are going to slice into this [Music] [Music] good thing you don't wait all right I hope you enjoyed this video please support us hit that subscribe button hit that like button and we will see you in the next video subscribe [Music]", "ItKwrsa8ReE": "this freakin hair this hair is driving me crazy okay anyways hi again I'm Emily from the Quito twins and I thought it would be a funny little thing to do to try to trick my husband into eating a foe or a mock apple pie or it's actually gonna be more of like an apple fried fritter because I don't have a pie crust but I do have look at this but I do have these cuts of carb flatbreads so that's what I'm going to be using anyway I can't find my selfie stick either so we're really we're running on empty here anyway the basis for this pie it's going to be something called chhote which I saw on Daniela Diaries video and apparently this is a type of squash and when you cook it in a certain way it kind of tastes or it has a texture of an apple and bread hates squash but he's very playful and like he would never be mad at me trying to trick him but he really likes apple pie so I thought I wonder if he'd like could tell if I'm you know like if this is gonna be an apple pie or if he's he's gonna tell it's squash which he hates he Brad hates eggplant he hates spaghetti squash he hates pretty much the whole squash family zucchini he doesn't like that much pumpkin so he's very worried about texture anyway I figure if I can trick him into eating thinking that's just apple pie that it would be a funny little video so and if it works that hey you know it Kido Kido apple pie you know no one would be complaining about that okay he's coming down like he's coming out of the shower now so honey hi honey I'm gonna be making a keto apple apple fried fritter today like a fried apple tartlet well the thing is like there's like this way that you can cook them apples to like get the sugar out and so that you can make them into a keto apple pie okay I get better get started doing that now then so gathered all the ingredients to make our apple fritters and I'll show you what they are so you will need for the filling it's butter your three tall lemon juice this is um cinnamon and nutmeg this is cream of tartar which I suppose is gonna make it taste like the tartness of an apple this is the chayote I'm gonna chop these very small because I'm gonna want to fit them inside here to make little little fritters that I'm gonna deep fry so let me get all these ingredients together I have a pan going here that is going to be we're all this gonna go and it's gonna cook down so let me get that done all right so I've roughly chopped the chayote and it pretty much looks like a ball now I don't even think if he if he came in here and looked at it he would know the difference honestly so let's uh get this all put into the pot and see how it looks all right we have our apple I'm just going to add this into the mixture and let this cook down for I don't know how long until it all kind of comes together let's try here about 30 minutes so so the apple pie mixture has been cooking for about 5 minutes on high see it's like like that and we are just gonna continue cooking this down until it's a really nice consistency it should be like thick and like an apple pie oh hi it smells pretty good yeah can't wait for you to try it okay so this has been cooking for a while it's thickening up I actually added some xantham gum because I don't know I just didn't feel like it was thick enough the filling to hold into the cut to carb and in fact I think I'm switching up the recipe right now I think that I am going to be also putting them in these cute little ramekins and putting kind of like a almond wait a minute yeah almond like crumble on top to see which one works best because this is kind of like an experiment I've never made this recipe before without apple apples Akito apple pie so one's gonna be a crumble and one is gonna be I'm gonna try to fry them in the cut to carve so I have those here I just I'm trying to like wait to see if it's thickens up any because it's still pretty it's pretty viscous and I don't know how well it's gonna like hold up inside the cut the carb so we'll see how it turns out if not then we have the backup which is the in the crumble with these little cute little ramekins so let me just go ahead and do that okay so Brad has held up my friend well then put me in the frame hi okay so Brad is helping I don't care okay so Brad is helping me film making this part of the Apple crumbles because I can't do this with two hands so I made this come closer with just almond flour and some butter and I'm just gonna I just drew this together just gonna put this on top and that's gonna be our crumble for kitto apple pot pies and um I wonder if I could make this like flatten it out would that be better or you think and I just don't know I'm like just making this up as I go along I read the directions to make a crumble and it was kind of crumbling it so there you go on top Abbie's alright we're gonna go into the oven at 350 and we'll see how they for now shut the park fun I mean keep frying some kind of concerns at the apple pie filling so here are the Apple crumbles and they were pretty good actually yummy but my cut to carb apple pie fritter is there a different story I mean they look okay but they're they look like they're like exploding so I don't know what I'm gonna do about that alright so here it is the Apple deep fried apple fritter I am going to in just dust it with some powder in your throat all it's time to see what my husband thinks of my um apple pie recipe this is the apple pie recipe that I took all of the carbs out of the apples there you go oh my gosh you wrapped it up yeah the cute little thingy Penner is even interested my god is really good I really like it it's really like um cinnamony really I guess what there's no apples in there where am i barking then squash called Tok I know you hate squash so what do you think tastes like an apple it has like the caramelized sort of sweetness of an apple and with the cinnamon and then wrapped up in affright awesome thingy I thought maybe it would taste like the McDonald's apple pie that you got it tastes just like that really so would you recommend it to yours day as apple pie filling yeah so there you have it folks the husband who hates squash thought it tasted like Apple so maybe if you can get your hands on some chayote um you should try it for yourself I will leave all the ingredients the link to all the ingredients below and if you don't have that you know you can always try it with the crumble on top just beat apple pie filling maybe with some ice cream on top some key to ice cream anyways I thought this was a pretty fun experiment so I will see you next time I'm Emily from the keto trend signing out", "H00WRbX1d3k": "oh man yes yeah fresh fresh fresh straight [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm so excited alright

night I was absolutely gagging for something sweet now I don't keep any biscuits or any cookies or anything sweet in the house because otherwise I'll just eat the whole in one sitting so I thought ah that's what mum used to make these really delicious apple fritters they are healthy because I got an apple in and now it's super simple and easy to make as well so how about we whip something up because I'm still gagging for something sweet so I'm only using one two three four five six seven things and you should have them all in your cupboard I'll leave a list down below of what I'm using and of course I'm sagging along the way let's start making them okay first things first I need some cooking oil and I'll start heating that up now the only thing we need to cut up is an apple so we need about a cups worth instead of dicing this up I'm just going to grate it up that'll make it a whole lot easier and by the magic of YouTube that's done right let's start making this back so first thing we need is 1 cups worth of plain flour oh you have got to be kidding me lucky I always keep a spare pack in the cupboard yes both next we add quarter of a cup of sugar one and a half teaspoons of baking powder one teaspoon of cinnamon hmm you know it's gonna be good now and we need about 3/4 of a teaspoon of just salt salt makes sweet things taste even sweeter or doesn't I'll just give that a quick mix now I need 1/3 of a cup of milk and we need 1 egg as well so what is crap that in there with the milk give it a quick whisk in here and we add that to the mixture and we'll blend this together so you'll get a nice thick paste out of that which is fantastic now we just add our apples or apple only used one and when you grade it it really gives it some volume and we now we just fold this all through together now when you grate the Apple it releases a lot of apple juice so you sort of need to squeeze out a lot of the apple juice before you add it in so now it's time to cook these things well let's see if this oil is hot yet yeah let's fry nicely so now we just grab spoons worth and plonk those in try and keep them as flat as possible so the insides all cook evenly through and we just need to fry these up maybe two minutes on one side flip them and maybe another minute or two on the other side until they're crispy golden brown all right so those over so now I'll just transfer them onto a plate with some paper to drain the excess oil off and I just can't continue finishing this batch of batter off baby batter all righty well there's no apple fritters I made I actually got 11 out of the back so I'm gonna be in heaven 11 times now sure they look great like that and you could eat them like that but I'm not going to I'm gonna dress mine up by adding a delicious frosting to pour all over the top so I'll just grab my powdered sugar or icing sugar and I'll add some to the ball and I'll just add a splash of milk oh look at that although you're waiting for the one-liner but I'm not gonna say it and now all I need to do is drizzle this delicious frosting icing sugar mix over the top mm-hmm I won't tell you what that looks like all righty sighs well guys I hope you do a little apple fritters they taste like little mini doughnuts and they really aren't I see I hope you enjoyed them if you did give my garden ah deny yours too now you enjoyed this video please show me some farming laughs or if you didn't enjoy you would have made it this far in the video so haha tough luck to you you missed out remember to click on my head if you're not already

these apple\u00a0\u00a0 fritter donut things so of course I had to try\u00a0\none out and wow they were amazing. So that dessert\u00a0\u00a0 actually inspired the dessert that I'm making\u00a0\ntoday. If you're new here my name is Jasmine Lee,\u00a0\u00a0 I'm a pastry chef based here in Montreal and I\u00a0\nrelease new baking tutorials here every single\u00a0\u00a0 friday for you guys so if you're into that type of\u00a0\nthing you can go ahead and subscribe down below.\u00a0\u00a0 But yeah so these apple fritters\u00a0\nare super crisp on the outside,\u00a0\u00a0 soft and moist on the inside and they're smothered\u00a0\nin the best glaze I have literally ever tasted,\u00a0\u00a0 so let's just get right into the video.\u00a0\u00a0 So you're going to set aside the apples and start\u00a0\nout with the dough. In a measuring cup measure\u00a0\u00a0 1 1/2 tablespoons instant yeast. So to bloom it\u00a0\nadd \u00bd cup of warm water and 2 teaspoons of sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 Give it a little mix with a fork and\u00a0\nwait around 5 minutes for it to froth up.\u00a0\u00a0 This step is basically a test\u00a0\nto make sure the yeast is alive.\u00a0\u00a0 While that's blooming, measure in 2 cups of flour\u00a0\nin a mixing bowl along with 1/4 cup of sugar,\u00a0\u00a0 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 tsp baking powder and\u00a0\nyou can grate in some nutmeg with a microplane.\u00a0\u00a0 Now check back in the yeast mixture it should be\u00a0\nvery foamy and be more than doubled in size. Add\u00a0\u00a0 that into the dry ingredients with 2 tablespoon\u00a0\nof butter, 1 large egg and a splash of vanilla\u00a0\u00a0 extract. Let all of those ingredients incorporate\u00a0\non low speed it should take a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 After all the dry ingredients are incorporated\u00a0\nI always check the humidity of the dough.\u00a0\u00a0 This seems a little bit on the wet side so I\u2019m\u00a0\ngoing to add a couple extra tablespoon of flour.\u00a0\u00a0 The humidity of the dough can really vary\u00a0\ndepending on where you live or your ingredients\u00a0\u00a0 so here I\u2019m going to add 2 tablespoons but\u00a0\nyou might need to add 4 or maybe none at all.\u00a0\u00a0 Now let that knead on medium speed for around 3\u00a0\nminutes. Whenever I\u2019m making a dough I think it\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 super important to knead it a bit by hand, for a\u00a0\ncouple minutes and then shape that into a ball.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m just going to put some oil in the same bowl,\u00a0\nmove that around with your fingers and place the\u00a0\u00a0 dough inside. Let this proof for at least an hour\u00a0\ncovered by a damp cloth or plastic wrap. While\u00a0\u00a0 that\u2019s rising let\u2019s get started on the apples.\u00a0\nWhen I go apple picking I always get a bunch from\u00a0\u00a0 different varieties but for this recipe it's best\u00a0\nto use cortland because I find they\u2019re very good\u00a0\u00a0 baking apples. So this recipe actually only calls\u00a0\nfor 2 apples so it looks like I\u2019m going to have to\u00a0\u00a0 make more apple recipes to use up all of these.\u00a0\nSo I\u2019m going to peel, core and chop them into\u00a0\u00a0 \u00bd inch cubes. Place all of the apple into a\u00a0\nsmall saucepan along with 1.4 cup of sugar and\u00a0\u00a0 2 teaspoons or so of lemon juice. I\u2019m also going\u00a0\nto sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top and stir it\u00a0\u00a0 over medium low heat. This step is to essentially\u00a0\nget as much of the liquid out of the apples\u00a0\u00a0 because it will mess with the humidity of the\u00a0\ndough. So let that simmer until pretty much all\u00a0\u00a0 of the liquid has evaporated and it\u2019s mostly just\u00a0\napple cubes. The last thing we need to prepare for\u00a0\u00a0 the fritters is the glaze. So I\u2019m going to make\u00a0\nit beforehand because the actual fritters need to\u00a0\u00a0 be dunked in this glaze while they're still hot.\u00a0\nSo here I\u2019m measuring out 2 cups of icing sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m also adding around a tablespoon of clear\u00a0\ncorn syrup and a splash of vanilla extract. And\u00a0\u00a0 of course the most essential ingredients to any\u00a0\nglaze is salt. Now in a small saucepan I'm going\u00a0\u00a0 to add \u2153 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of sugar.\u00a0\nOnce the water is hot and the sugar has dissolved\u00a0\u00a0 add it to the icing sugar bowl. Whisk it all\u00a0\ntogether until there are no more lumps left\u00a0\u00a0 and you are good to go. I really recommend giving\u00a0\nit a taste yourself and adjusting with the salt\u00a0\u00a0 because it balances the sweetness really well. So\u00a0\nnow the dough has been rising for a little over an\u00a0\u00a0 hour and has doubled in size, I\u2019m going to place\u00a0\nit on the floured work surface. I usually start\u00a0\u00a0 by pressing it out with my hands and then use a\u00a0\nrolling pin to flatten it out into a square that\u00a0\u00a0 measures around 10 by 10 inches. The dimensions\u00a0\ndon't really matter since this is really just to\u00a0\u00a0 incorporate the apple. So on half of the dough\u00a0\nI'm going to spread out the cooled apple mix\u00a0\u00a0 we made earlier and move the pieces all the way\u00a0\nto the edge. You can also sprinkle some cinnamon\u00a0\u00a0 and around a tablespoon of flour to help soak\u00a0\nup any extra moisture. Fold the top of the dough\u00a0\u00a0 over the apple to cover them and press down the\u00a0\nedges. Once it's sealed I'm using my bench scraper\u00a0\u00a0 to cut the dough into stripes. Essentially we\u00a0\nwant to mix in the apples without overmixing the\u00a0\u00a0 dough so I find this the best way to get the job\u00a0\ndone. The dough will look pretty ragged at first\u00a0\u00a0 but just keep on working those apple cubes in and\u00a0\ntry to form the dough into a long log shape. You\u00a0\u00a0 can add a bit of extra flour if you need and then\u00a0\ncut the log into 9 pieces. I made these little\u00a0\u00a0 rectangular parchment papers so i can easily\u00a0\ntransfer the dough to the fryer but of course\u00a0\u00a0 it\u2019s optional you can also just place these on to\u00a0\na floured cookies sheet to rise as well. I usually\u00a0\u00a0 press it down into a kind of rectangular oval\u00a0\nshape, like I said these are rustic donuts so the\u00a0\u00a0 shape doesn't matter too much. Once you're happy\u00a0\nwith the shape, let the dough proof for a second\u00a0\u00a0 time in a warm spot in your kitchen for around\u00a0\nan hour. Now that they have had a chance to rest,\u00a0\u00a0 it\u2019s time to start frying them up. Now there are\u00a0\ntwo key points when frying these apple fritters.\u00a0\u00a0 First, the fritters need to fry until they have\u00a0\na dark golden brown colour. If they are too light\u00a0\u00a0 they will not be cooked inside the center. And\u00a0\ntwo, keep a thermometer in your oil to track\u00a0\u00a0 the temperature while your frying. It can really\u00a0\nvary while you cook but try to keep it around 375\u00a0\u00a0 degrees F. When I take these fritters out of the\u00a0\noil, I place them on to a wire rack to drip for a\u00a0\u00a0 few seconds then I immediately dunk them in the\u00a0\nglaze from earlier. It\u2019s important to dunk them\u00a0\u00a0 when they are hot so there is a very thin glaze\u00a0\nthat will almost melt off all around the fritter.\u00a0\u00a0 The glaze should always be pretty liquidy so if\u00a0\nyou see it start to stiffen up you can always add\u00a0\u00a0 1 or 2 tablespoons of water. And that's it,\u00a0\nthat is how you make fruity apple fritters.\u00a0\u00a0 So that's it, we made apple fritters. It was\u00a0\nfairly easy to make and they turned out so so\u00a0\u00a0 delicious. They were all finished within like\u00a0\na day at my house but I managed to set one\u00a0\u00a0 aside for the tasting. So I'm just\u00a0\ngoing to go ahead and give it a try.\u00a0\u00a0 This apple fritter is so incredibly delicious.\u00a0\nIt's perfect for people who don't like desserts\u00a0\u00a0 that are overly sweet because it's super super\u00a0\nwell balanced. It's definitely one of my all\u00a0\u00a0 time favourite desserts that I have ever made.\u00a0\nSo I highly recommend giving it a try at home.\u00a0\u00a0 If you do decide to recreate it at home, don't\u00a0\nforget to tag me on instagram and let me know\u00a0\u00a0 because I love to see what you guys are creating\u00a0\nat home.

Okay, bye till next time.", "Yxdih0zgPTE": "[Music] you went a little overboard during apple picking season no worries because our next guest is here to show us exactly what to do with all those leftover apples we are going to deep fry them of course welcome back the creator of the very popular just to taste food blog which by the way you can never have just a taste of her food chef kelly senior welcome back thank you so much to be here it is fantastic to see you we're deep frying after i can't believe it i'm very there's nothing better everyone's been picking apples it's been it's apple season we're going to go to town here not only we're going to fry them but then we're going to dip them in a caramel sauce cinnamon sugar caramel sauce i mean the options are endless with this one all right so what do we do first so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to do our dry ingredients okay we've just got a little bit of flour here and then we always want to season our flour so to this we're going to add some sugar and then we're going to add some baking powder i think you've got yours i have all of mine pre-mixed here a little bit of nutmeg which really gives us that kind of you know amazing fall flavor some cinnamon of course cinnamon and apples is a great combo then a little bit of salt whisk that all together and the great thing about this recipe is you're just making a really basic batter so that smells fantastic it's like a funnel cake already exactly it's kind of similar to a funnel cake all right wet ingredients are up next oh we've got an egg and some buttermilk which i have here yours are already down there i'm just going to add this in here give it a quick whisk and then we are going to get to the star of the show which apples the apples all right so wet into the dry give yours a quick mix there okay and what kind of apples work best any kind works that's a great thing about this recipe you could use a honey crisp you could use a gala a fuji honestly whatever you've picked whatever you have left in your fridge a lot of times i like to do this recipe if i just have a spare apple on hand you know i have three little kids three boys under age five i know i don't even know how you're here it's a little bit of a miracle but you know we'll take it i'll take it um okay so we've got our batter now we're to do our apples so this is the fun part where you're going to get the kids involved if they're in the kitchen with you you've got apple slices here and then we're just going to use a little cookie cutter such a great idea it just makes them like a donut shape and by the way even if you're not deep frying the apples cutting an apple this way slicing it and putting it on your kid's plate just makes it that much more exactly exactly i always like to say sometimes kids will eat something if it's presented in a different way so something as simple as just punching out the whole of the apple you get this adorable little you know donut-shaped apple which we're gonna then dredge in our batter and get into the deep fryer here but it just presents it to them in a new way they may be more intrigued by it possibly want to eat it and it's a healthy fruit so we'll take it that's a mom win exactly all right so i'm going to get my last two here and then all we're going to do is dip these into the quick little batter that we made and the great thing about this batter is you can actually use any other sort of fruit with this you could use pineapple rings and do pineapple fritters so the options are really endless so just give these a dip and then the key here is our oil temp we've got this at 350 to 360. that's the prime temperature for deep frying so just drop those guys in there you want to let them bubble and then just kind of give them a turn as they kind of start to get golden brown you're doing perfect that's great dredge them on all sides as we do this and dredge them and pop them in you are a bit of a fried dough aficionado i am i want to see like a donut crawl it's called the donathon the just a taste donathon i lived in new york for six years i went to nine bakeries i walked five miles or three bakeries five miles nine donuts the numbers were whatever it was i ate all of them you ate every single donut every single one and this is like my shortcut version of my favorite donut which is an apple fritter so this is just a really easy way we don't have yeast we don't have proofing we don't have rolling this is just kind of a quick fix i'm a mom i've got 13 seconds to make breakfast and this is my fried dough option exactly this is so impressive yeah so just get them into the fryer there you want to give them a turn as they get a little bit more golden brown you can wipe your fingers off the kids can do this as long as they're staying far enough back from the oil but it's just a really quick fix recipe talk to me about that caramel sauce yes so caramel sauce is a great dipper for this obviously instead of making a caramel apple you can make your own or you can just use store bought either works we also have some cinnamon and sugar here which we are going to put our already fried ones into toss them together it's kind of like a funnel cake meets an apple fritter it all comes together together beautifully wow this is gorgeous now in addition to um having a six-week-old baby yes you honestly so you had two under five i did and you just had your little six week one i did yes little dean i know so i yes so now i have a four-year-old a two-year-old and a six week old i know you remember that baby face they smell so good they're really nothing better than a baby them so much so you kind of have that baby high i don't really know outdoors we have the baby high going yes and the lack of sleep well lack of sleep which leads me to my next question what on earth made you think that you also wanted to birth a podcast i know i've been birthing a lot of things in the last couple of weeks or months yeah so we launched the just a taste podcast it's been fantastic we've had celebrity chef interviews i've had other mompreneurs on there people who have just started really great small businesses who have been really successful in the food and media and tech space so it's been a blast it's a great way to really highlight people who have been successful you know kind of dreaming up either products or different you know media inventions so it's been a blast and you can record a podcast at any time so it can be two o'clock in the morning debbie and you could be recording a podcast i'm with you kelly but i just sort of feel like you might need a little bit of sleep i know i know you know that'll come later that'll come later in life right there you go got our gorgeous fritters all done here oh my gosh these does that smell so good how long did you say we leave them in there just a couple of minutes you want to go based off the color so the temperature of the oil is key you want to just give them a flip as they're getting more golden brown you see the bubbles going the key when you're deep frying is you want that oil to be hot enough so that when you put the food item in there it doesn't soak it all up you want it to start to you know really start frying quickly so our oil looks perfect i can hear yours it looks fantastic doesn't that smell good fantastic i know you want to like turn it into potpourri or a candle oh my gosh that would be perfect this would be a perfect autumnal candle exactly so while they're still warm debbie get them into the caramel sauce or give them a quick little dredge in the cinnamon sugar this is where my little guys julian and evan go crazy they love dipping them in here and they're little like finger foods which is great you can get them on the plate here dip them in the caramel sauce and kelly i mean it is an apple so it's healthy it is it's yeah it will just ignore the fried part it's the it wasn't an apple a day keeps the doctor away i these are the apples they were talking about cheers kelly congratulations on everything thank you so much give that little baby a hug i will endless baby snuggles oh my goodness pardon me for the full recipe visit hallmarkchannel.com and you can connect with kelly on her website just to taste", "yMOwW-oJtNw": "[Music] here's a recipe that I have had in my binder for a long time it's I don't even remember where I got it but it's a good recipe so I thought I'd share it with you in a frying pan or a pot or whatever you want to use I have two granny smith apples which I have peeled cored and cut into small cubes to that I'm going to add 1/3 of a cup of sugar half a teaspoon of cinnamon 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 teaspoons of water and I'm going to put this on my burner and I'm going to cook this now for about five or six minutes maybe more maybe less I don't know until the apples get a little bit softer and the sauce gets thick this is like almost like making a little bit of an apple pie filling so like I said this is going to take about five or six minutes well this has been cooking now for about four or five minutes it's getting thicker I'm shutting off the heat and what I'm going to do now is remove this from the heat put it off to the side and let it cool down now in this dish I put 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a half a teaspoon excuse me 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and just mix them up together and that's gonna be part of our topping and filling so now what I need to do is put everything away get my mixer out and we'll proceed to make the cake now I'm going to make the batter for the apple fritter cake we need a 9 by 13 inch pan I'm going to be using a 9 by 13 inch springform but normally this cake is made in one of those glass 9 by 13 pans that I think everybody in the United States has one of those so we're going to put this aside for the time being I'm going to spray it with cooking spray before I put the batter in I'm gonna put that down while I make the cake batter in my mixer I'm going to start off with 5 and 1/3 tablespoons of room softened butter then I'm going to put it on my mixer and mix it with 3/4 of a cup of sugar [Music] [Music] that's good now what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in two eggs a teaspoon of vanilla and I'm going to add in a half a cup of applesauce just plain applesauce later on I have in my bowl two and a quarter cups of flour that's been mixed with one teaspoon of baking powder one teaspoon of baking soda and a half a teaspoon of salt and then I also have one cup of sour cream so these two will go in last you know dry wet dry so we're going to start with the eggs Vennela [Music] okay that looks good when you give it a little scrape down and then I'm going to add into here my applesauce that's here [Music] [Music] [Applause] turn it up a little bit just get it well blended [Applause] I'm going to scrape down the sides a little bit add the rest of my flour and blend it well [Music] that was close that was the end of the camp cooking spray [Music] [Music] okay now remember we had our cooked apples and our brown sugar and cinnamon mixture this out of the way my oven is on at 350 degrees the famous 350 okay now we're going to take half of this batter and put it in a pan it's about half and now I'm gonna spread it out to cover the bottom if you don't have sour cream handy you might have container of yogurt you want to use the plain yogurt Greek style is better probably because it's thicker more like sour cream okay now all of our apples gonna go on kind of spread them out in retrospect I think and I said this last time I made it is I probably would put another apple in there because there's not a lot of apple in here but this is the old recipe that I have I'm making it the way they said to kind of spread them out okay now half of the brown sugar cinnamon mixture over the top rest of the batter this cake will bake in the 350 degree oven for about 35 to 45 minutes and then when it comes out of the oven we're going to make a glaze that's going to go on the cake while it's still right out of the other and back to spreading this out you don't worry about you don't have to cover everything you know speaking through some apples peeking through and stuff is not a bad thing and now the rest of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture all over the top there you go into the oven 35 to 45 minutes the apple fritter cake is almost done so while it's still in the oven and just before it comes out I'm going to make the glaze that goes on top because we have to put the glaze on when the apple cake is still very hot so in my bowl I have two cups of confectioner's sugar I'm gonna put in 1/3 cup of whole milk teaspoon of my vanilla and give it a good mix yes it's watery don't worry about it okay let me get the cake here's our beautiful cake and now with a flat knife I'm going to make holes 35 that's what I counted anyway all right so on the glaze goes and now what we need to do is I'm going to throw on some pecans too you don't have to put on pecans if you don't want to totally up to you I just like pecans and I thought a few of them on there would be kind of nice can't cut it for 20 minutes I've got to let this glaze set so we're just gonna let it set and then we'll come back and serve it later well our apple fritter cake has been sitting well over 15 minutes a little more like 25 it smells amazing so I'm going to take the sides off if you had a regular 9 by 13 of course you can't take the sides off but that's one of the reasons why I love these pans there we go looking good now let's cut a piece there you go you can see the apples in there the smell is amazing there we go there's our apple fritter cake [Music] you [Music]", "zcAQU3oFLn8": "hi guys welcome back to my channel i have a fun fall recipe for you i am going to be making some keto quote apple fritter muffins now i took a recipe that uses zucchini in the in a bread and i've made it into muffins using the coyote or chayote squash i'm not sure how you say that so let's get into the video and i'll show you everything that goes into it and i will have everything down in the description box so first off for the muffin base recipe you're going to need some sort of flour i'm using macadamia nut flour but you are welcome to use almond flour if you cannot find the macadamia nut flour i found it at grocery outlet i just wanted to try it so i'm trying it out in this recipe you're also going to need a half of a cup of coconut flour you are going to need one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice a half of a cup of some sort of sweetener i'm using the lacanto monk fruit sweetener you will need a half of a cup of softened butter three eggs two teaspoons of apple extract and i found this on amazon so i will have a link for it down below you'll need two teaspoons of baking powder a half of a teaspoon of xanthan gum and a half of a cup of some sort of almond milk i just happen to have this coconut almond milk in my refrigerator so that's what i'm using so that's what you're going to need for just the base muffin part of the recipe for the glaze you're going to need a quarter cup of some sort of powdered sweetener i'm using this one from sweet leaf i got this at grocery outlet also and then you will need two to three tablespoons of heavy cream or you could use almond milk either one whichever one you'd like to use and then for the apple filling you're going to need some lemon juice and you'll need some golden sweetener or any kind of sweetener you want to use some pumpkin pumpkin pie spice and then two of the chayote squash or you can use one whole zucchini for this either one will work if you cannot find the squash the zucchini will work just fine in this recipe if you are using the squash then i highly recommend that you go ahead and boil it so you're going to want to cut and peel the squash cord out there's just a little bit of a core in this and then you're going to put it into some boiling water and just boil it for about 10 minutes just until it's softened a little bit if you're using zucchini you don't need to do this step because zucchini will soften up but the squash is just a little bit harder so i do recommend doing that so i'm going to do this step first so it gets nice and soft before we move on to the next step the next step is our topping so i'm taking some of the golden sweetener a quarter cup of it and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice mixing it together then we're going to set this aside because we'll be adding this to the top of our muffins and then the muffin recipe so i told you guys we're using coconut flour macadamia flour baking powder i'm using some pumpkin pie spice and some xanthan gum and all that is going to go into a bowl we're going to mix it all together and set that aside and we'll go and work on our like wet ingredients next in my bowl here i have a half of a cup of monk fruit sweetener from la canto and a half of a cup of butter that i softened i'm gonna whip that together till it is nice and creamy add in your three eggs we're gonna beat that and then we will be adding in the apple extract and we would we'll be doing two teaspoons of the apple flavor extract okay now that the eggs and the apple extract are all mixed in we're going to add in our dry ingredients so this is what we did earlier the flowers baking powder xanthan gum so all this is going to go in to there next up we are going to add in our half of a cup of almond milk this for me happens to be the almond um the almond coconut milk combined so i'm going to add that in there and then i'm going to also add in half of this cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice sweetener mix i'm going to do half of it in here and then the other half will sprinkle on top of our muffins my squash is all done so i'm going to go ahead and let some cold water run over it that way it gets nice and cool i don't want it to be really super hot when we put in it put it in the muffin mixture so i'm just going to let it just sit here with some cold water for a while and then i'll show you what i'm going to do with this mixture next so this is all ready for the apple filling so we'll go ahead as soon as that is ready to be done we will add it and fold it into this in the meantime i will start getting that ready and i'll show you what i'm going to do with the um with the squash we are going to go ahead and make the glaze for the top of the muffins so when they come out we can put the glaze on there when they're still a little bit warm so i have a quarter cup of this sweet leaf better than sugar powdered sweetener and i'm gonna do three to four tablespoons of the heavy cream i already put three tablespoons in there we'll see how that i think that'll be probably just fine actually maybe three tablespoons was too much no i think it'll be okay because if we want it to be kind of a thin glaze that we just drizzle over um the muffin so i think i think we'll be good with this so we're going to make this set it aside until the muffins are all ready our oven is preheated to 350. i have my muffin tins ready the squash is ready i'm just going to add in just a squirt of lemon juice i don't know this is what i always do with like apple pie so i'm kind of you know treating it kind of the same i think it's just i don't know if squash browns or not i have no idea so we'll just see what happens we'll go with it i'm gonna put in some more pumpkin pie spice just because and then i am going to add in just a little bit of i think i'm just going to do like two tablespoons of the golden monk fruit sweetener just to add just a little bit more sweetness but you probably it's really up to you how sweet you like your muffins and we'll just mix that up and then this is just gonna go right into that muffin make sure we're gonna fold it into there i just tasted the mixture and i feel like it needs just a little bit more apple flavor so i went ahead and added in a half of a teaspoon of the apple extract in there and i think this will make it just a little bit more appley flavor now because this has coconut flour i highly recommend you let this mixture sit just to let it absorb all the liquid and everything because coconut flour just takes a little bit to absorb all that but because my mixture has been sitting here while i was getting the uh the squash ready it's nice and thick and you'll notice you'll know right away because it just starts to get really super fluffy once that coconut flour starts to activate so i'm gonna go ahead and scoop this out into my muffin tin now i'm going to take the rest of this cinnamon sugar sweetener and i'm going to just sprinkle it on top here like i said this was originally a bread recipe and you just kind of swirled this in there like you put half of it in when you layered the different layers in the bread um but obviously i'm not doing that one main reason why is because i want to go buy a loaf pan this weekend and walmart was completely sold out of loaf pans it was absolutely crazy and i don't have a good one so anyway i'm going to finish doing that and this is going to go into a 350 degree oven i'm going to start it off with 30 minutes see how it goes but i have a feeling they might take just a little bit longer okay after 30 minutes i checked them i think they still need probably five more minutes just to make sure they're completely done in the middle i checked them with a knife and it didn't come out clean so i think i'm gonna do five more minutes so that'll be 35 minutes total your oven may totally vary but this is what it is so far with mine so they took 35 minutes and they came out perfect i drizzled some of the icing on there i'm gonna let the icing set up and then i'm gonna let them cool completely and i will try them and i will be sure to let you know what i think of these [Music] you", "hvn9BSDJEHE": "hey guys it is megan welcome back to another video it's been since last week since i posted a video but i seen a video of a couple taste testing mcdonald's new cinnamon

super close okay oh that's where the mobile order app thing was okay i'm going to catch you guys in a second when i first oh brendan they have a blueberry muffin and he's like oh that sounds good and i love apple fritters and this apple fritter actually looks really good the cinnamon roll it's not really melted but we'll get into that when we try that but you know i love the topping of muffins so i'm just gonna i'm just gonna try these i'm not gonna like force feed myself and eat all of this but um yeah so this is what it looks like it's in it's anything really like nice paper like it's really cute like i think it's really cute but i don't know why i got this for it for the cinnamon roll but i'm gonna try it oh it looks really good okay okay oh my gosh oh my gosh y'all this is good this is really like if i was to come to mcdonald's i would get this again this is really good i would get this again this is like a probably like a nine and a half out of ten that is so good i'm gonna wrap it back up because i like it but i have other things to try so is it in this pad y'all when i open the bag it's like they put all all of the uh the bakery like the apple fritter and stuff in one bag and so i thought and i was like oh no they forgot the cinnamon roll because all i seen was the apple fritter and the the blueberry muffin muppet muffin and i was like no i don't want to go back through that line because you can't go in here but anyways what i was talking about about the the cinnamon roll you know how like when you make them at home and then you put the glaze on there the icing and it just like just like melts i wish it was like that but i'm gonna try this i'm excited to try the apple filler i'm gonna save that for last um i'm gonna try to take about the inside because you guys know the inside of the cinnamon roll is the best oh it's warm y'all oh it's sweet though the icing because it's got so much acid on it i'm trying to get another bag because that was kind of a small lot i just want the whole center like the whole little you know the little swirl you know that's good it's sweet though but it's good oh man that's good okay okay next i was so excited i know brendan wanted this so i'm just going to tear it open in front of you guys like half it so you can see the ooey gooeyness so yeah some people uh like dunkin donuts like sometimes that you go to dunkin donuts and they'll have apple apple filling in it and then and then other times there won't be any apple filling in it well i and you know there's top there's people that like their apple fritter just cinnamony and there's people who like their apple fritters with apple in it and me personally i like my apple fritter just to taste like cinnamon like with appley taste if that makes sense like if i like if i wanted apples in it i would eat apple pie but if that makes sense but no shade to people who like it filled but i'm just saying i prefer mine just tastes like cinnamon now getting back to the taste test because none of you asked for that but i gave it to you anyway let's tear this open so let's see if it's filled or not that's good oh my goodness this is good like it has apple if you like apple stuffing this is perfect this is perfect i like this because like sometimes duncan like over does it and i just don't like that but i do like a little bit even though i just said i didn't but i do like a little bit but like if you can see there's like little bitty apple pieces in there so it's not like overpowering the whole thing and it is super soft like you know how like some are hard it's super soft oh my goodness y'all oh my god this gets a 10 out of 10. [Music] oh my gosh i don't want to eat it all because i got food and i want to eat food y'all that oh my gosh brendan doesn't like apple fritters so that's all mom but that's good like i'll snack on that i'm gonna eat that like everything was delicious so here's my opinion my review we're gonna be fancy sticky we're gonna try first the blueberry muffin the blueberry muffin was good the cinnamon roll was good it was warm so it was good um the apple fritter was my favorite and then it was probably the blueberry muffin and then the cinnamon roll just because like the cinnamon roll like you know they're sweet but i'm not like i like sweet but i don't like overly sweet things if that makes sense like too much makes me sick but i like some sweets but the apple fritter was good i just realized i got like a mustard shirt on and i did it because i fall but it kind of i kind of looked like the uh the honey mustard packet from mcdonald's i should have got some or the logo i love the logo oh my gosh anyways i don't know where that came from back on subject um yeah please don't forget to like and subscribe and if you want to see something else or new foods come out that i haven't been

everybody and welcome to another episode of excel cooking corner today we are going to be making cinnamon swirl apple fritter bread and to show you how easy it is for a kid to make i have my very special friend emma hi guys say hi emma hi all right emma so first we gotta start by preheating the oven okay you know how to do it i know okay three fifty three mm-hmm okay bake bag egg hit start it's already set at 350. all right that was really fast okay next we need to start by peeling are apples what kind of apples do we have today all right so these are granny smith apples they are green and they're very sour all right do you know how to put an apple or do i need pillowy apples i don't know how to peel off all right i'll peel an apple real fast oh look at that i already filled that apple magic all right we got both of the apples peeled for you magic okay all right now i'm gonna make it really easy on you", "TewPBiPMgHM": "[Music] okay so today we're gonna be making some apple fritters and we're not gonna be making any of those baked gluten free no sugar garbage ones we're gonna go full out deep fried glazed apple fritters pour into your bowl half a cup of warm water look at all this yeast mmm 1.5 tablespoons of instant yeast two teaspoons of sugar and then whisk it together until it's fully combined and just let that sit for five minutes mix 1/4 cup of sugar 2 cups of flour quarter teaspoon of baking powder quarter teaspoon of nutmeg 1 teaspoon of salt and then mix that all together until fully combined to the wet mix add 2 tablespoons of shortening well 1 egg or egg replacer mix that until it's smooth and there's no lumps of margarine oh there we go so we're back from my dog's bathroom break so we're gonna start to incorporate the flour mixture into this kind of tea mixture add your flour mixture to your wet mixture in thirds then you're gonna knead the dough until smooth for about 2 minutes once your dough is all kneaded and smooth place it in an oil Bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let sit for an hour [Music] next we're gonna work on the filling so peel two apples these are not the right type of apples here so as these Granny Smith but I didn't want to buy some more because apples are expensive okay I'm gonna actually try to get this one in a continual circle spiral whatever it is I feel like I'm doing this left handed but I'm doing it with my right hand why am I so bad at peeling well just like speed it up so it looks like I do it really quickly [Music] the peeler sucks it's so dull I got a cramp crap I'm like raising an iron and then dice them up into small chunks as much as you can without cutting off your fingers okay so into the skillet it goes like that add 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and yes so you just cook this for a bit until it gets nice and soft subscribers now the epic if I got a sponsorship of soapy milk my mom would be so happy because she doesn't like these it cost like five dollars to make the glaze add two cups of icing sugar and two to three tablespoons of milk mix it around until well combined if your mixture is too runny add more icing sugar and if it's too dry just add more milk roll your dough out on a floured surface until it is ten inches by 10 inches then add the cooked apple to one half of the dough and spread it out adding one teaspoon of cinnamon and one teaspoon of flour fold the dough over the cut apple chunks and cut into 1-inch chunks then struggle to squish all the dough chunks into a loaf shape this doesn't even stick together really kind of like this and just make it into like a long chunk slice the dough into 1-inch thick rounds and then place them onto floured parchment and let them rise for half an hour once your oil is at 350 you can start deep frying dooblydoo there we go deep fried the apple fritters for one minute on each side until golden brown place on a cooling rack and glaze the apple fritters before they cool down once your apple fritters are done eat way too many of them and feel really sick about it all these are really good [Music] [Music]", "tiIPs6BNthM": "you can use whatever apples you want that's right how do you like them apples what's up it's kat dev from two marker girls and welcome back to another vegan recipe and today we are doing another challenge video because we have to because catherine says so devin are you so happy no and for this one i mean you didn't have to but like it was easier to bake for this one yes which is like a loaded statement because no it wasn't why didn't you try a savory recipe then i couldn't think of any could have made like a stuffing that's a nice thought now isn't it okay devin what's the challenge it's the apple challenge it's apple season yes i i consider it apple season apples are in season yes it's apple season so why could how could we not do an apple challenge yeah and because we've already done the pumpkin challenge so we had to do apples yeah another fall fruit exactly um devin what did you make i made an apple fritter loaf which sounds delicious i hope so what did you make i made apple turnovers also delicious and so easy to make that's much better just do that just puff pastry and apples basically that speaks to me okay before we get into these recipes be sure to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss future vegan recipes every sunday and whatever wednesdays every other wednesday and what without further ado how do you like these apples wow wow just thought of that that's that's great to make your apple turnovers we're going to start off by preheating our oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit then in a medium pot we're going to melt down some vegan butter over medium heat add in some diced granny smith apples all purpose flour maple syrup cinnamon nutmeg and stir to combine then we're going to cook that stirring occasionally until the apples just start to get soft about five or so minutes next up we're going to prep our puff pastry sheets first you're going to want to roll out your puff pastry into about a quarter of an inch thick alternatively you can also just buy puff pastry and sheets which is what i prefer to do just couldn't find it this time once you roll out your puff pastry you're going to cut it into four equal sized squares then you're going to place the cooled apple mixture in the middle of each of those squares leaving at least a half inch border all around we're going to brush some water on the edges and then we're going to bring the edges together and crimp them so that it's nice and sealed and we're going to repeat that for the second sheet of puff pastry as well then we're going to place those on a parchment lined baking sheet and using a sharp knife we're going to cut a little we're going to cut a little slit on the top of them i just did little x's on top so we can make sure that the seam has some place to escape then we're going to bake it for about 20 to 23 minutes you may need to flip them part way through it kind of depends on how your oven bakes them but keep an eye on them you don't want the bottom to burn while the turnovers are still warm we're going to stir together some powdered sugar non-dairy milk and vanilla extract until we get our desired consistency you should be able to make a figure eight with drawing with the icing before it disappears and then you're going to drizzle the glaze over the turnovers [Music] to make my apple fritter loaf you're going to start off by making your flax egg so combine water and ground flax seed in a little bowl mix it together and let it set aside to thicken then you're going to peel and chop your apples i cut them into pretty small pieces because that's just my personal preference for the loaf if you want bigger pieces of apple in the loaf you can go with a bigger piece but i cut them pretty small to your chopped apples you're going to add some sugar and cinnamon and then mix that all together and set that aside then in another small bowl you're going to combine brown sugar and cinnamon just mix that together and again set it aside and then we're going to work on the batter so we're going to start by combining some vegan butter and sugar and whip that all together until it's nice and fluffy then you're going to add in the flax eggs and some vanilla extract and again mix that all together until it's well combined and in a separate bowl you're going to mix together the flour baking powder and a little bit of salt and then you're going to add that to the rest of the mixture and blend it all together and then finally add in some non-dairy milk and mix it until it's all combined then you're going to grease your loaf pan and line it with some parchment paper and we're going to add half the batter and then half the amount of chopped apples and then generously sprinkle that with the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture then you're going to add the other half of the batter and you're going to top that with the rest of the apples and again generously sprinkle on that brown sugar and cinnamon topping i put a lot on there because i really really like those flavors but it's kind of to your personal preference if you use up all the brown sugar and cinnamon or not and then you're gonna bake that in an oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit for about an hour at the one hour mark check it do the toothpick test and if it comes out clean it's done but if not give it a few more minutes and check it again i ended up doing about an hour and 10 minutes for mine once that's done you're gonna just let it cool and set it aside but while it's cooling we can make the glaze so you're gonna combine icing sugar vanilla extract non-dairy milk and maple syrup and just whisk that all together until it's well combined and then once your loaf is cooled you can pour over the glaze and you're done [Music] here's my turnover look oh it's so cute they almost all of them exploded i think i filled them a little too much i mean i get it i i don't know this this loaf really uh emotional roller coaster for me tastes delicious up in there catherine i will admit i was fully prepared to make something with puff pastry because i was like that'll be easy and then when you said you were using puff pastry i was like never mind i mean you still could have i don't know but i feel like any idea i had was going to be too similar to yours anyway so i was like i'll just try something different it's not the end of the world if it's you know a challenge i mean it looks like a challenge video it looks delicious

something called apple fritter and today we're going to do a multi-cultivator review of which cultivators have the best apple fritter strain and it's funny because i tried apple fritter and it was really good so as i went to different dispensaries all of a sudden it started to show up in another brand and another brand and i liked it so i kept buying them so so far i've collected up four different apple fritters this one right here is the winner but we're going to talk about all four of them and then i'm going to enjoy the winner right out of this vapor cup right here so coming in at my fourth favorite apple fritter strain is an unknown strain and you can see this was the first apple fritter i ever tried and i got this at dr green thumbs and the blood tender recommended it and it just said apple fritter and this wasn't that long ago this was during the period where licensed flour was out this just came in this jar like this and i don't know if people can remember the pop tops but it just pops open and it's funny as you look at like old school strange someone asked a question today what happened to the planets there used to be a jupiter og there was a mars og there was a saturn og and i actually have stash buds of those flowers but those flowers all went away because they keep changing names and the new one people copy it and copy and that's the real market so right now one of the hot names is apple fritter and for me it all started with this i got this and i tried and i'm saying wow that's really good so more came so we're going to talk about the ones that are known uh right after this one so coming in fourth is dr green thumbs unknown apple fritter but it was good for me and it got me trying other apple fritters so we're going to put this down coming in at number three is something called fresh baked apple fritter and this flour has 27 thc and i'm going to put this down for a second so we can just load a little bit of the winter apple fritter into vapor cup and we tamper and this is about the same amount as a bong hit then we're going to stick this down into the vapor cup and i've got this cup set to 3 30 and we're going to let it heat for about a minute and a half while i talk about these other apple fritters and then i'm going to enjoy the winner with of the best apple fritter so fresh baked this was i went down to buds and roses to get this flower and instead they gave me cherry fritter and i came home and cherry fritter was really good if you happen to see fresh baked cherry fritter to me that was better than the apple fritter and but this is not a bad flour it was very good this flower got an 875 which you know it's a really good score and all these things kind of have a powdery weedy taste and this review is more about if you see apple fritter which of the brands do you want to buy so this was my third favorite of the apple fritters is fresh baked apple fritter and if you see this and if you see cherry fretter i'm picking the cherry fritter but we're moving on up and coming in as my second favorite apple fritter is lumpy's apple fritter and this flour has 23 percent thc and again it's a powdery weedy taste but this flower got the nine and one thing about apple fritter why would it get the nine all these were good strains all of them because they're clear strong they're euphoric and they i would say they made me smile because none of these really grin me out but they're all really good and worth the try so the second favorite of the apple fritters so far has been lumpy's and the winner is kind of surprising the best of the apple fritters in the apple fruit of war is synergy apple fritter and this flower was super good this flower has 31 percent thc again it's got a weedy uh powdery wheaty taste and i would say this one was the one that came the closest to green me out and if you're looking for apple fritter the winner of the apple fruit award so far for me is synergy apple fritter i think this flower was fantastic i bought maybe 10 different of the synergy flowers and the best so one so far is synergy apple fritter so congratulations synergy you've got the best apple fruit that i've tried and today we're going to take you out with a little bit of apple fritter you can see i've got this cup like i said set to 330 degrees you can see the vapor in the straw right there and this is gives like an incense experience after i do this it's just so pleasure and i would say after about two three straws of this i'm dysfunctional but here we go let's check it out apple fritter at a vapor cup at 330 degrees so this flower is a little bit og and with vapor cup you have to be careful with the ogs it gives you the pungent power what's an og it's a certain type of flour that when people try it they make out of apricot especially you might not even think it's weed it doesn't taste weedy it's like ammonius something like that but this week this flower is sweet and enjoyable and i liked it and if you're looking to try applefrender the best one i tried so far is synergy thanks for joining in i'm the doctor if you want to see vapor cup this item right here you can see the vaporcup.com and i'm telling you if you get this item your life's better it really is if you're looking for strains go to wheat entertainment.com i put all my favorite picks up there if you like the videos please subscribe i'm telling you we will get better right away i'm the doctor thanks for joining in party on my friends [Music] you", "sL4Gr3y8ChA": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to share with you how to make an apple crisp bread we're also known as an apple fritter bread I think it's just a fancy name for like coffee cake style loaf bread if you get what I'm saying I might name it a recipe similar to this a long time ago but it's time for a refresher this is so good and it's so easy but you are going to love it let me run you through the list of ingredients you'll need all-purpose flour baking powder salt you'll need brown sugar cinnamon granular sugar in this little boy I've got some more brown sugar flour and some more cinnamon you'll need a couple of eggs some milk some vanilla I'm actually using vanilla bean paste but I mean rinoa extract is fine and some unsalted butter softened at room temperature and some apple this is a really big Honey Crisp apple so I'm only gonna use one but if yours are smaller just used to use whatever Apple you like I'm not want to tell you to go buy something separate for a recipe if I can help it the only thing I don't love to bake with it's like a Red Delicious apple I don't love to bake with that but in it anything that you got will work I've got my oven preheated to 350 a nine by five inch loaf pan lined with nonstick spray spray the line with parchment and sprayed with a little bit of nonstick spray in this bowl I'm gonna add the butter and sugar this is like half the for the batter it's like my Nona's Italian apple cake it's that batter I love that batter it's so wonderful so foolproof and works with a lot of different things and in fact I came up with the most intensely delicious vanilla cake using that recipe that I will share with you near the holiday season that it is so good oh my goodness so fantastic so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just cream these two together really well I'm using my handheld electric whisk and then we move on that's great to just kind of take my eggs these are our fresh eggs oh look at double yolk don't you love that I love it I love having my own fresh eggs there's just nothing like it they're so rich look at that color my chickies out there are so happy it's just the best I'm gonna add just a little tiny bit of vanilla bean paste but like I said good vanilla extract will do the job just as well and I'm just going to whisk all of this together until really well combined I'm actually just gonna do this really quickly make sure it all gets combined we go there we go look at that color okay ah gorgeous I can't wait to share that vanilla cake with you it is so I think just a slice of plain vanilla cake is so underrated I know it's a different recipe than this but you know how I do so underrated and you're gonna just love that recipe I know it now what I'm going to do is add the dry I just do this all in one go because no patience what can I say and the milk and I'm going to mix this up until nice and creamy and then I'm gonna set it aside to work on my apples I just diced up to my Apple and I'm just tossing it with that brown sugar mixture with the cinnamon in the brown sugar beautiful you know it doesn't have to be super super perfect just make sure that you you dice it not too big not too small just right okay your batter your batter is going to be quite thick and I don't want this to alarm you and I don't want you to feel the need to add more milk because you got to keep in mind this is a really dense bread number one and number two you're gonna get some moisture from the Apple right so you gotta just work with it and it will be perfect and so oh just just you wait until you smell your house that's all I'm gonna say about that okay half the batter in put scatter half the apples in there like I said does not at all have to be perfect just trust me other half on top just try to even out the top layer of your batter again you really can be quite relaxed about this type of cooking because it's a very rustic looking bread my mouth is watering and it's gonna taste absolutely phenomenal and doesn't matter that it doesn't look like a masterpiece it will be a masterpiece it will taste like a masterpiece you're just gonna have to trust me the remaining apples and what I do is I just take the remaining apples and you see I'm just sort of nestling them in the batter and I take this mixture which is just more cinnamon sugar and a little bit of of the flour and I'd like to cover the top of that with this mixture and I'm gonna pop it into my oven at 350 for about an hour so if you feel sometimes it happens to me mentioned this many many many times I've got two ovens this one and one upstairs they cook very differently my one upstairs is much cooler this one I don't know what it is but it's very very hot so if you feel like halfway through the baking process your top is getting just too dark lower the temperature to 325 you want it to be a deep golden-brown but you want to make sure that you don't burn the top of it so I'm gonna pop it in there about 15 minutes to an hour and then when it come when the toothpick comes out clean from the center of the bed of the bread you know it's done and let it cool a bit my bread was in the oven for about an hour and let it just cool pretty much completely it's just slightly warm you can see what the flour does along with the sugar you don't have to add the flour if you don't want to but what I find it I said it gives you this lovely doubly bit just like you would on an apple crisp and I love that but if you know one thing you want more of a sunken in like golden bronze topping leave out the tablespoon of flour and just use the brown sugar and you'll be golden we're gonna make a quick little glaze very very quick very very simple milk powder sugar a little bit of it goes a long way and I'm just doing this because now that it needs any more sweetness but just a little bit drizzled on top will be perfect just like so beautiful and running look at that that took us what 15 seconds time now tell me down below how long that took okay and I just like to drizzle that and a little bit of sweetness just kind of goes into little crevices and little nooks and crannies there oh it's just phenomenal just fantastic you're gonna love this if you got a potluck a dinner a holiday you going to mouth is watering look at that let me get you another slice so you can see real good you know when I say the first slice is always the cooks treat very look at that look at that tender interior oh my goodness I'm gonna need this right here I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do this cuz you know how I do you know how I do with the metal pieces oh shut it down shut down the APUs after room beyond so good so good tender magnificent I really have no words it's just magnificent Laura Anika Chicken Little

is the second video i'm doing at prunedale donuts the first one uh i reviewed a couple of their donuts a glazed and a chocolate frosted um and uh they also have an apple fritter if they got an apple fritter i gotta try it right i'm on the search for the best apple fritter so we'll see and i asked the owner there i said does it have apples and he said yeah it's an apple fritter so no but is that apples in it yeah it has apples in it so we'll see i mean i've been told that before and it hasn't been true uh but we'll see so uh just kind of quick review what i'm looking for personally number one it's gotta not be too dry number two it's gotta have spice you know some some cinnamon or whatever spices you wanna put into it but three most important it's gotta have apples and that last the first two a lot of places do that last one a lot of places miss or they have you know couple little pieces of apple in the entire freighter and that's a letdown that's a that's an apple spice fritter not an apple fritter um if there's a fourth thing i would add this is not an absolute requirement but something i do kind of like personally is if it's uh if it's kind of crunchy on the outside uh while it's also kind of soft in the middle but to be honest with you even the ones that are a little bit softer more donut-like uh throughout even on the outside that's fine with me but um you know this is this is fried and it is glazed and normally you know they'll be they'll be glazed a bit more than a donut so i kind of like when that contributes to that kind of crunchy exterior uh and then you still have the soft interior so that would be kind of optional number four all right so let's have a look at the inside so so far i'm seeing some i'm seeing some apple i've seen some apple going on in there the apple does seem to be right up at the top it's a part real nice mmm i'm pleasantly surprised um because not not that this has anything necessarily to do with it but sometimes when i see one and it's just like so flat i feel like ah you know it just it looks like a letdown right it looks like a deflated balloon uh it looks like my expectations uh deflated um but this this is nice a little bit crispy definitely the closer you get to the edges or you know if you get a bite of the edges definitely uh more crispiness there so um where you're getting a lot more of that on a hard edge uh crispy not crazy crispy you know like like to this part but a little bit and then and then a lot more uh out here but i will say uh it's definitely not too dry and this is one hour before closing time it's four o'clock and they close at five o'clock so these are probably made in the morning and it hasn't dried out um i'd be curious to come in the morning and see if you know see if it's even more moist than this but uh this is definitely holding up nicely so even if it was like this at opening time it'd be perfectly fine so it's not too dry now if you look at it you don't see a ton you don't see like cinnamon and you know the swirls and stuff that you'll see in some of them and try before i spoke you can see little specks of it through the dough but i wonder it seems like maybe the apples and there are apples in there it's small chunks and it's almost like a chunky or chunkier than applesauce but it seems like it's got like christie's donuts did where there's a little bit of like apple sauce in there this seems to have some something like that so maybe like an apple paste just you know kind of some kind of sauce or something but there's chunks of apple in it uh which is nice so that kind of takes the christie's thing and uh and add some apples to it not big old apple chunks but definitely you know consistent apple chunks throughout so that's that's that's that's nice and um there's some spice and some extra flavors in the apple bit um maybe not as much in the dough at least you know from sight but that is really nice if anything uh if you want to make it really have like a kick uh maybe like you know some nutmeg or cinnamon to really give it that like that bite but i mean that's completely personal taste um this this this is good i mean this is this is uh this is as close as i've come so far at least in the uh the ones that i have reviewed on video this is as close as i've come to the ultimate apple fritter it's not too dry it's got some spice in it could use more uh there's definitely places i've gone that have had more even mcdonald's and had more spice in it but it didn't have apples in it so it was an apple spice fritter um but where this one stands apart is it does have a consistent bit of apples in there so um this is this is this is a winner so far definitely the closest i've gotten i'm still going to keep looking right i'm still going to keep looking for that holy grail and see how how good we can get but uh so far this one is numero uno so that's prunedale donuts apple fritter go ahead and check it out till next time see ya", "bIRlGNtyrKQ": "hi welcome to lunch recipes today I wanted to make some country apple fritter bread this would be really good for breakfast you could have it for snack or even a dessert the amounts of the ingredients you're going to need to make this bread will be found in the information box below you can find it on the website or the roku channel these are the ingredients that you're going to need two apples we are going to core these peel them and chop them up some cinnamon and sugar some brown sugar some more cinnamon all-purpose flour vanilla granulated sugar baking powder and eggs butter milk and for the glaze you'll need confectioner sugar and a little cream or milk you'll need to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and you'll need a nun by 5 loaf pin that you've sprayed with cooking spray I have my apples all chopped in this bowl and so the next step is to add the sugar and the cinnamon and stir it real well so I'm going to do that I'm just going to start stirring it to coat the apples with the mixture this is all mixed nicely so I'm going to set it aside and then we're going to work on the batter I've put my butter in this bowl and what I'm going to do start beating it and adding my sugar so I'm just going to beat this until it's smooth and creamy I'm going to add my eggs one at a time beating after each addition and I'm going to add my vanilla I'm gonna scrape this down just to make sure it gets all incorporated and just feed it for another minute okay this is looking good so I'm going to set this aside for a minute and now we're gonna move on to the next step I'm gonna put my flour in this bowl along with my baking powder and I'm just going to whisk this together to incorporate okay so now that this is all mixed together I'm going to add it into the butter in the sugar mixture and I'm just going to stir this together until it's nicely mixed this is mixed together so now I'm going to stir in my milk until that's all mixed in nicely okay the batter looks good so now I have one more thing to do before I put it all in the loaf pan I'm going to take my brown sugar and the cinnamon and I'm just going to stir this together now that I have my batter my apples and my topping all ready and prepared I'm going to start layering it into my live dish so I'm going to start by putting half of my batter in the bottom of the loaf dish it's gonna spread this out and now I want to put half of my apples on top of the batter okay so that looks pretty good and now I'm going to sprinkle half of my topping on this okay and I'm just gonna take my hand and I'm going to press to make sure that the topping and the Apple azar push down into the batter a little bit now I'm going to continue layering by putting the rest of my batter on top of the apples and the topping have the second layer of my batter spread out evenly so I'm going to put the rest of the apples on spread them out evenly and then I'm going to sprinkle the rest of the topping on and again I'm going to take my hand and I'm just going to press lightly then I have a knife here and I'm just going to start kind of swirling it down into the batter to make a nice design you could do this with a spoon this is ready to go into the oven it's going to go into a preheated 350 degree oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean my bread cooked for an hour I just took it out of the oven and put it on this cooling rack and I tested it with my cake tester and it came out clean I'm going to leave my bread in the pan and leave it on a cooling rack for 15 minutes to cool before we turn it out my breads been cooling for 15 minutes and now I'm ready to take it out of the pan so I'm just going to do this I had this turned out on a platter and so now I'm ready to make the glaze I have my powdered sugar in this little pitcher and I'm going to add the cream and start whisking together now put it in here so I can pour it on easily to the bread the glaze is ready so now I'm ready to put it on the bread so we're just going to start putting it on this is all clay so now we're ready to cut a piece and show you what it looks like on the inside I'm going to slice a piece of this and put it on a plate to show you what it looks like this is country apple fritter bread I hope you enjoy it you", "loyKbAX5ZP8": "[Music] Oh what's up guys not buying toko back here again and welcome to another video guys in today's video we got a string review with a little twist and today string review we'll be reviewing some apple fritter diamonds that's right guys instead of reviewing flour we're going to be using some concentrates up in this video so hopefully you guys enjoy today's video I'm going to be taking two badass tabs so let's get on with today's video in today's string review guys we'll be revealing apple fritter that indica if you don't know what apple fritter is it's an indica that doesn't have too much info a pod I went on with Leafly and a couple of other weed websites to kind of read up on it because usually before string reviews I read up on the string so I don't look like a [ __ ] dick [ __ ] you know what I mean and on Leafly there wasn't really too much info besides like oh this is like a really nice relaxing type of high this is like a good nighttime like high and this drain actually was put on high time strongest can of the strings list back in 2016 and I didn't hear about the string till like late 2018 early 2019 that's what I heard like a lot of buzz about it so kind of reading that I was like it was shits been around 6 2016 oh [ __ ] so it's a pretty good straight it has to be a really constraint like I've had it before flowers I haven't had the diamonds but just reading up on it lumpy flowers was the creator of the string so shout out Lumpy's flowers for creating out the fritter but yeah so that's all I really know on the string you guys decide it did indica and it just gets you really [ __ ] up so the whole point of the video is to kind of give you guys my like opinion on what I think about the taste and the high like this is my first reaction like having even tried any of this apple fritter diamonds I grabbed it was waiting for this riff to come in the mail this brand-new rainbow bar lyrics and the hippy Butler unboxing live stream that I did a couple of days ago so I guess we have nothing else to do except for heating up the rig so I think I'm going to cut out the heat ups in this video so to make it make the video a little less shorter alright cheers y'all [Music] yeah oh holy [ __ ] y'all I hit that on the right him that was a really good temperature to hit that I wasn't too hot too cold it was kind of a little bit on the corner but that was a nice little chunk yeah holy [ __ ] I was able to get all the [ __ ] flavor out of that you know so did that first [ __ ] dab holy [ __ ] that's really good quality that's super good why so with the flour so with the flour when I had the flour a month ago it would get me super stone super quick this got me super stone super quick as well but I'm just kind of interesting to see if it's going to make me into like the couch potato in which I can't really talk about the high because like I'm I right now but I can't really like talk about like after effect so I can only tell you guys like how I'm feeling right now but I can let you guys know with the flour I became a [ __ ] couch potato and then falling asleep within like 10 15 minutes of after smoking like a bowl of it so if I end up sleeping really good [ __ ] like that be like a six out of five for me alright but with the taste getting to hit it at the right temp was super good it had a really nice just like a woody like a sweet woody taste that's the taste that I kind of got off it and I didn't really go off without smell which I guess I'll like go off like talk about smell - in this and I kind of get like a little bit of a like what do you like like a little bit of like a woody sweet perfume II like a sweet perfume you like woody smell like ramen if I did it smells pretty good it tastes pretty good it's making my body like I can totally feel it it's a total [ __ ] body high so let's take one last step and then I guess I'm going to dip out over all y'all I'm going to dip this get the Diamonds a 5 out of 5 this is a really good string so let's take another rib or another gap so be right back all right y'all Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] y'all I'm kind of sweating right now I took that probably a little bit too hot I

"cFM0IJ-9KD4": "okay so today's recipe because uh i helped a few of you fall off the bandwagon for your new year's resolution we're gonna make something with fruit in it yay fruit it's an apple fritter loaf now because i just don't have random apples in the house we're going to use apple pie filling for a substitute it's still fruit so this recipe is a third cup of brown sugar teaspoon of cinnamon 2 3 cup of white sugar half a cup of butter 2 eggs vanilla extract a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract a cup and a half of flour a teaspoon and three quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder half a cup of milk and it says two apples peeled chopped and mixed with two tablespoons of sugar and one tablespoon of cinnamon so we got the pre-mix and that's what we're going to use all right let's get started so to preheat the oven for 350 that's done use a 9x5 loaf pan but we're going to use a 7 by 11 glass pan so the cook time is going to be shorter and that's prepped and ready to go while i was prepping this i mixed the brown sugar with the white sugar and that's not what you're supposed to do in recipe so i separated it so you got a little bit of white sugar in the brown sugar and a little bit of brown sugar and a white sugar it'll still work so you mix the brown sugar in a cinnamon and a separate bowl together and set aside so i have the brown sugar and a teaspoon oh that didn't have my measuring stones teaspoon of cinnamon white sugar in the brown sugar so that's the cinnamon we'll mix that together [Music] and of course dark brown all sugar so we set that to the side and we mix everything else together so we have sugar there's a little bit of brown sugar in there let's see here uh where am i so this two-thirds cup of white sugar this is a cup and a half of flour that's a hot mess [Music] butter just gonna pour it right on in there and one of the things i love about these little glass bowls is that when you crack your eggs into them you can look underneath to see if you got any eggshell bits you look all around and not have to worry about that i'm going to stick this in the blender i'm going to start on low and then start just pouring stuff in there butter so we have baking powder teaspoon that's kind of cinnamon on it do you think i'd get another one but no well teaspoon and three quarters of teaspoon so basically three of these i don't mind doing the vanilla over the blender because i don't mind a little extra teaspoon teaspoon and a half of vanilla two eggs all right so we beat that white sugar butter together and the mixer with the eggs vanilla extract [Applause] baking powder milk all that stuff so you pour half the batter into the pan you want to mix up a little bit more you mix half the batter into the pan layer it with the apples put some sugar on top put the rest of the batter in apple's recipe sugar turbo all right let's see what kind of mess we can make [Music] now this point is where i prep my apples done and there's a glaze that goes on top of this but we'll make that after this cooks and cools and then drizzle it on top but it has fruit yay makes it healthy the batter is dripping over there all right layer of apples so trying to get them evenly spread out these look like they're green apples because that's just some of the peel on all right so now the sugar and cinnamon mix gonna do this part by hand because uh the brown sugar is a little stiff i probably should have warmed it up so oh messy messy messy messy mess save some for the tap all right layer one cookie [Music] it's ew easy that's just a mess all over see how it turns out when this is done finger painting for bakers [Music] [Music] my fingers are already in it so and the recipe says to use any kind of apple so i assume it does not exclude canned apples i don't know how applesauce would work with this but use the non icky hand all right now next step like oh it's supposed to lightly pat the batter down into well whatever it's in there it's not like it's going complain put it in the oven uh for approximately 60 to 75 minutes glass pan thinner layers so we're going to go with 30 to start off with and see where we're at from there and if we smell anything burning then we know it's done all right because i use the apple pie filling i wonder if it's closer to apple cobbler than it is to an apple fritter loaf so she's gonna dig into it i'm gonna dig into the corner oh okay so it is slow flake definitely loaf like and hot that's good hot definitely hot now i'm gonna let it actually cool and then do the glaze and go from there oh this is really good and a cup of milk this might not make it to the cooling phase okay now this is cooled uh we mix the glaze which is a half a cup of powdered sugar and one to three tablespoons of milk so we're going to start with two tablespoons of milk and make it and it says uh more milk if you want it thinner less milk if you want it thicker depending on your consistency this is as good as it's gonna get just tastes like uh hmm it's like beating it and that is the apple fritter loaf now this turned out really really good and i really want to just plow through this so i'm going to do that first i'm going to sign off say thank you for watching god bless stay safe and see you next time [Music] you", "kv8Rk7xae34": "hey everyone chrysalis and vapes here for the vape trailer calm and today we're gonna knock out two of the new loaded flavours in one video [Music] all right so the Jews we're testing today are brought to us by our friends at a juice plug calm shout

it out in the tank and see we find out [Music] all right so this is definitely sort of an all day vape kind of vape in that you get nice sweet mix of melons on the inhale with just a little touch of that honey I'm coming in on the inhale I get the honey it almost tastes coconutty but it's mostly honey either way nice melons on the inhale honey on the tail end of the inhale and on the exhale we get sweet milk we get more of those melons I get a very strong honeydew from the mix of melons they have in here and that honey again is an undertone it's very smooth very very smooth very nice fruity Melanie flavor in the tank so next step as you know rebuildable step over there and see we get Schuester [Music] yeah baby [Music] it's good so out of the rebuildable what I'm getting on the inhale again is those melons um I get a lot of the honeydew honeydew is really what I taste out of this I'm prone to liking honeydew flavors honeydew melons so the melon vape itself is really good for me I enjoy the mix of melons that they've got in this juice the honey is again nice little undertone and on the exhale that sweet milk milkshake flavor comes in on the exhale still getting that honeydew overtone so it's a nice mixture and then again that honey smoothing it out sort of making for a very rich very very nice easy vape easy all day vape on this guy for sure so that's the milkshake next we got apple fritter for the apple fritter rigs we've got again my trusty UL crown 3 in my rainbow color which I really dig I've got stock point two five one Cola head in that and then it's being

with a little bit of cinnamon on the very top on the exhale you get more apples you get more cinnamon you get a little bit of bakery sort of doughy flavor on the exhale rounding it out making it super super rich making it really sweet and really delicious I dig this so so hard right let me stop talking about the tank let's move on to the RDA juice it up and let's go [Music] it's fireman alright let's go ahead baby [Music] hmm okay so out of the RDA the apples are more Apple II if you could imagine what that means they're a little tartar almost tastes a little juicier they're very very very sweet very nice cinnamon comes in sort of almost herbally on the very inhale like it's not a cinnamon like a cinnamon candy it's very much like actual cinnamon the the spice it's very nice on the inhale on the exhale you get that bakery comes in sort of like a bear craw bear claw excuse me like a glazed doughnut kind of flavor with the apples and with the cinnamon and with the oh it's so good I love this flavor this is my speed I super super dig this a lot everybody knows I'm really into the very sweet and very rich sort of flavors but this guy for real if you're into fall flavors if you're into apples and cinnamon and things like that this is so so killer I'd have to say give it a shot so overall we've got melon milkshake and we've got apple fritter both from loaded courtesy of

video and I will talk to you guys in the next one deuces [ __ ] [Music] [Music]", "ylgSIceCWpY": "today we're gonna make some low-carb apple fritters and I'm super excited about it so you're gonna start with one cup of chopped apples I wasn't sure how much a cup was so I just cut up two apples and went with it so as you know apples are definitely not keto so this is more of like a low-carb friendly recipe but you're just gonna chop these up really really small you're gonna throw these in a pan with some coconut oil and then you're also gonna add some vanilla and then a dash of cinnamon and just saute these up until they're really really soft almost like they're supposed to go in an apple pie you want them to be really soft and squishy so to help soften them I'm gonna add this top over so that steam will get them nice and soft just like this then in a separate Bowl you're gonna do a half a cup of almond flour two tablespoons of coconut flour one tablespoon of chia seeds I used black chia seeds the recipe called so white you're gonna do a quarter cup of coconut milk 3 tablespoons of maple syrup I used sugar-free maple syrup you're gonna add one egg some cinnamon some vanilla 1/2 tablespoon of baking soda one teaspoon of cream of tartar and a pinch of salt the recipe didn't call for this but I'm gonna add this in because I got this on Amazon this is just apple flavoring so I added it about in total I think I added about one teaspoon of this smells really good and I think it just added a nice extra apple flavor then you're gonna mix all these ingredients together until it's nice and combined and after you do that you're gonna actually add in your Apple pieces and mix that all together and this is going to complete your apple fritter batter [Music] so in total this battery makes about seven apple fritters so we're gonna do is you're going to warm up some coconut oil in a pan spoon some batter into the pan don't worry too much about the shape and then you're gonna fry them on each side for two minutes until it has that little golden look to them when you're flipping them it's kind of hard but you don't have to worry about the shape too much because when you think of apple fritters they're lumpy and bumpy and totally not perfect at all so don't worry too much about it [Music] have your oven preheated 350 degrees and you're gonna put the apple fritters on some parchment paper and bake these for 10 to 15 minutes until they're done after they're done cooking I'm just icing them really quick with a sugar-free icing that I made I will leave both of these recipes below both the apple fritter and the icing recipes that I used this is not my recipe so I don't want to take credit for it it's just a recipe that I tried out so I'll have them linked below for you guys to check out and let me know if you guys do in the comments below and how you like them my favorite way to eat them was to refrigerate them and eat them cold so if you guys enjoyed this recipe please thumbs up and subscribe and I hope to see you guys in my next video [Music]", "uDc-2v7LP54": "yeah it's prolific TV here today I got some Lumpy's apple fritter and watching interview on the background real quick I got some Lumpy's apple fritter I want you guys to check out super bomb and let's get into it all right so here we go it's apple fritter I already smoked like a bowl or two of it obviously to try it out oh this [ __ ] came out so purple I know you guys saw that that we it's crystally as hell too look at that and I was telling you guys the other day whenever I had the chance to get this and I had the chance to get my shirt blotto and I had the chance to get my box geo cookies the bacio cookies the apple fritter wasn't in stock at the time but the bacio cookies was more crystally and had more of a gassy taste it wasn't on the crazy purple side like the sure blotto in this this rubato had more of a purple than even this it still had a green mix in it but the purple is just more purple is what I'm saying you know brighter violet but you see this is crazy still got a nugget to left and that bacio cookies just for a comparison real quick that's that bossy Oh cookies right there so as you can see it's pretty damn good and I showed you the other day it didn't have purp in at hello Ella but then you look at some of the nugs and yeah they came out purple as [ __ ] it's just really depends though this is nugs like is that big eyes no you know more on the lighter on the green side but if you bust it open they'll be a little bit of purp in there well it is the [ __ ] nose you know how cold it got it and stuff like that really what part of the plant it was on but yeah that bashi I've already showed you guys that I just want to show you the difference in a couple of mugs versus that that's crazy that pot show is pretty crystal DUP but yeah I know this apple fritter it's so crazy you only see a perp like this there so long and bumpy's Lumpy's has like Lumpy's all their stuffs he'll a dark purple like this but they do nothing but like fruity strains you know they got apple fritter they got cherry meringue they got like another like a berry type one they got all sorts of stuff but they're more on the fruity they want your stuff to taste better and stuff like that they're more on a little bit of the lower side of the THC so this bacio is like 28 and then this is probably like 22 not always Lumpy's is more around 20% I don't know if they just don't like if they truly grade their stuff you know how some people whenever they're grading it they want it to be a little bit better so obviously they're probably gonna inflate there's a little bit I think Lumpy's just gives you the straight cut you know like if it's 20 then it's probably 25 but if we're saying it's 20 then it's probably 20 but other people that are saying is 25 it's probably 20 you know as all million I know I said it backwards and confusing but whatever anyways though that's that apple fritter man I was trying to tell you guys in the comments how amped up I was about it it's so a purple man [Music] oh you guys I'm out prolific TV apple fritters", "8T2xsf6mpfc": "hi welcome back i'm kathy and if you're new to my channel i do food and product reviews and i went to mcdonald's today you know it's my favorite place to try three new items we have a new blueberry muffin apple fritter and a cinnamon roll so let's see what do we have first we have the apple fritter it looks pretty good i was thinking it was going to be warm but it is not so if you're not familiar with an apple fritter it is it's like a donut with um apples and cinnamon and this has a glaze on top i don't know if you can really see the glaze a little bit there all right so the apple fritter was 219. next we have the blueberry muffin [Music] cute little wrapper this is not warm either i'm sure you could ask them to heat it if you wanted it heated um yeah i think they've had a blueberry muffin in the past but i think it's been a long time i don't think i ever had it but i think i remember it being on the menu and last but not least one of my favorites it's yummy i cinnamon roll and this is warm and this has a cream cheese icing on it so yum so forget to mention the blueberry muffin was 1.99 and the cinnamon roll was 249. all right they did give me a fork so i don't make them up okay i think i'll start with the apple fritter i guess i can just take a bite of it i wish it was warm uh it's pretty good um i didn't get an apple i do like the cinnamon it does taste like an apple fritter i thought the first bite tastes a little dry but in the middle it seems to be a little more moist yeah it definitely has a good flavor it tastes it does taste like a um apple fritter i'm not gonna lie i haven't had a lot of apple fritters but um to me it does taste a little like a cinnamon roll with with apples i mean it is good you see all the cinnamon in there which you know i love my cinnamon i would give it a three and a half out of five it's good um for me i'm more of a fan of the cinnamon roll well i don't know about this one but in general i think it's good um but it's just for me personally it's probably not something i would get again but if you'd like apple fritters i think you would really enjoy it all right blueberry muffin time the uh streusel on on top but you can see it looks like a lot of it went to the side here like that all right once again sometimes i like my muffins heated but see we will see all right i think there might be a little sugar on top because i'm getting a i don't know if you could hear that crunch or not but it looks like with the strudel there is some um of the more coarse sugar on top uh the muffin the muffins moist it's it's it's a decent muffin uh it's really not it doesn't have a lot of blueberries in it unless i just gotta see yeah uh there's some so overall i think it's a decent muffin uh for me personally i don't eat a lot of muffins out if i'm gonna eat them up and i would make them at home no not from scratch you know one of the boxes or whatever which are really good um but i think i like my muffins warm so maybe that makes a difference but you know it is a muffin it's it's really a cupcake right am i wrong because if you look at the calories in one of these and the sugar um it's basically desserts so it's it's cake so i'll be calling a muffin and people think it's for breakfast but anyway so oh i didn't give a rating um i would give that one a three and a half out of five too it's a good muffin i think a three and a half is fair it's not oh my goodness it's amazing and it's not the worst thing in the world so it's it's in the middle it's kind of what you would expect from i guess a fast food restaurant even though you know even some bakeries have tasted just as good at some bakery so i shouldn't really say that i need a knife for my cinnamon roll oh you know i made they'll sit if you haven't seen my my cinnabon copycat cinnamon roll recipe um you should check that out because those are really good so and i'm not going in with those expectations of it tasting you know like a homemade cinnamon roll or even cinnabon but but even the rolls that you can get at the store now are really good so and that was the center so i'm well disappointed in the cinnamon roll do you remember the uh what are they called cinny minis they used to have it was all that gooey cinnamon on there those are really good cinnamon rolls so i went for the center of it thinking it was going to be the most moist um that makes sense because sometimes the outside of these can get a little dry so i went for the center i mean the cinnamon is there but i almost get more of a cinnamon flavor in the apple fritter than i do the cinnamon roll which i don't think should be the case you know i feel like an ad for mcdonald's here because you know i love mcdonald's uh but i think they need to hire me for their test kitchen so i'm a little disappointed here yeah i really had high hopes for the cinnamon roll it's just it's just okay like i said i think actually the canned ones at the store are better there's more of a cinnamon flavor um and the icing on this is a cream cheese icing and it's okay i get i get the cream cheese flavor a little bit but i mean you can see you know the cinnamon's there it's just not a lot of it and it's just not very strong and i love cinnamon so when i have a cinnamon roll i want to know i want to taste the cinnamon i really wanted to like this and to be honest it's a little dry even though it's it's warm and sometimes when you heat things up they're not as dry but this is um yeah it's right mcdonald's you let me down on this one i want to give it a two i hate to do that because you know i love mcdonald's but i gotta keep it real and um i would never eat this again and i would not recommend it just to recap the apple fritter if you like apple fritters i think you would enjoy it um probably not the best apple fruit you've ever had but i think it's decent uh the blueberry muffin same thing if you enjoy blueberry muffins i think you would like this one it was moist it probably could use a few more blueberries but it was overall decent like i said 3.5 in my book is decent cinnamon roll on the other hand what did i give it a two so that's yeah i wouldn't waste my calories on it or money so just my two cents you may love it when we give it a try i think they just came out this week um not sure how long they're gonna be around if it's a permanent thing or just a trial basis i don't know and i'm pretty sure they are available all day don't hold me to that but i'm pretty sure so if you've tried any of these i would love to hear your two cents in the comments below so that brings me to the question of the day what is your favorite pastry it could be a donut cinnamon roll muffins you know eclairs cream puffs um for me you know i know some people like love like eclairs or jelly donuts or whatever i've just never been a fan of that just biting into it and it just like oozes into your mouth i'm not not a fan of that um so for me i do love a good cinnamon roll and i love a good doughnut i would probably go for a donut before a cinnamon roll i think i think i don't know let me know what do you like muffin donut apple fritter eclair what is it let me know in the comments below if you like the video hit that thumbs up and if you haven't subscribed please think about hitting that red subscribe and the bell for notifications

little cold press to it i'm not one for blueberry muffins it's really going to be hard for me to even review it because i will honestly uh it's going to come back up basically blueberries and i do not get along whatsoever if we did i would say that this one actually looks half decent but i really need somebody in the foodie fam who rocks heavy with blueberries to let me know how this jammy is if you've had it already please in the comment section below talk to the foodie fam about it because i can't honestly give this an official review simply because i do not mess with blueberries and it wouldn't be fair to mcdonald's for me to go ahead and do that thing i just wanted to show it to y'all i do however get down with apple fritters so bang bang this one feels it feels a little hard all right not a very extreme fresh pressed feeling but it might have nice flavor into it i mean it is an apple fritter at the end of the day heavily glazed up with all the bumps the clumps and the lumps that are expected of an apple fritter right let's go ahead and get a bite and see what it's hitting on all right hmm for fast food apple fritter listen this isn't half bad nice apple flavor into it an extreme sugary glazed coating on top providing additional sweetness but the apple flavoring does come through right kind of reminds me i mean not as fresh as a dunkin donuts apple fritter but decent enough on the bike right decent enough on the bike i'd mess around and give this one a three an apple for the game family hold up y'all know i need a fork for this right here it's cinnamon roll though this cinnamon roll looks stupid gooey this cinnamon roll look like it's about to put me into some type of diabetic shock hold on oh look at you look at you do you have a nice press yes you do yes you

playing with your boy get a nibble stop playing with your boy not bad they're decent not about mcdonald's that's all right mean you know it ain't cinnabon but is i overall mcdonald's new little dessert bites for fast food they're fairly decent i'm gonna just give it a straight across three piece three on the apple fritter uh three on the cinnamon roll i didn't do the blueberry muffin if i did um but decent mcdonald's nice little attempt at adding something to your menu that's what's most important going outside the box and hold on hold on going outside the box and definitely add it to your menu i'll see what you guys are doing 45 in the comment section below let me know your thoughts on mcdonald's new little dessert bites up over here if you tried them if you had them let's talk

them down into the batter and half of our cinnamon brown sugar mixture just going to sprinkle that on top [Music] and then we are going to repeat with the second half of our ingredients [Music] batter apples press it down and top with brown sugar and cinnamon so you want to make sure your oven is preheated to 350 degrees so this is going to go into a preheated oven [Music] for about an hour we're going to check it in 15 minutes when it's in the oven i'm going to clean my workspace you want to clean as you go to keep the clean kitchen and these dishes are going to the dishwasher [Music] so our bread came out of the oven i went ahead and put it on a cookie cutting board for you i made a simple glaze this is half a cup of powdered sugar and one tablespoon of milk and i'm just to go ahead and

some milk that's good though you", "g90i0R9aZQY": "hi guys this is chica from bara delights and from this episode I'm going to share with you how to make my apple fritter cake this tastes exactly like apple fritters except it's not deep fried super easy to make and delicious so I have your some apples that I've just diced into small pieces and I'm using this Gala apples we also going to need some softened butter additionally you're going to need some brown sugar cinnamon flour and a pinch of nutmeg some vanilla extract some flour sugar salt and baking powder some melted butter some milk and two eggs so I'm going to begin by adding all of my dry ingredients to the bowl in my stand mixer and on the lowest setting which is going to stir these ingredients together to fully incorporate them so once that's mixed together you're going to add in your milk eggs and vanilla extract and you're going to stir this until it's nicely combined of course as always you guys can just use a wire whisk in a bowl to make this recipe of course you're going to want to take a minute to scrape down the bottom and sides of your bowl and then you can turn the mixer back on for a few seconds to mix everything together and then lastly you're going to add in your melted butter and on the lowest setting of your mixer you're going to stir this in and of course you guys can find the written recipe on my blog below delights calm I'll also link to my website in the description box below so I'm just using my spatula now just to give everything one final stir together and to give my bowl one final scrape down along the bottom and sides and then I want to pour my batter into my greased baking dish and smooth out the top so the cake is nice and even before the Apple popping I'm going to add my brown sugar cinnamon flour nutmeg and my softened or melted butter to my apples I'm just going to stir this together until your apples are fully coated with the brown sugar cinnamon and butter mixture and it's going to look really kind of pasty just like this is exactly what you want to look like and if you have any chunks of brown sugar you can even just use your hand or your spoon to just break up those chunks of brown sugar now you're going to spoon in your apple topping over your cake and you just want to get this in a nice even layer next you're going to use a knife and you're just going to swirl your apples through your cake batter and you can even push some of the apples and the brown sugar butter mixture into your batter a bit but it's not fully just so some of your apples kind of really get into the batter itself and this is going to bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 40 to 50 minutes once this is done you'll want to let it cool for about 10 minutes and then you can go ahead and make your glaze for this and all your glaze consists of is some powdered sugar and milk and you're just going to stir this together until you have a nice smooth lump free mixture so you're just going to take your glaze and drizzle it over top of the apple fritter cake now you can let this sit so that the glaze can harden or you can serve it right away which is what I did and absolutely delicious the cake is so light and fluffy and moist and the apple cinnamon brown sugar on top is just amazing like this case exactly like an apple fritter you can have this on its own or what if scoop of salted caramel ice cream and I do have a recipe for that and I will link to in the description box below so I really hope that you guys enjoyed this recipe to have authority done so please be sure to subscribe to my channel so that you can stay up to date on all Molly's recipes and of course give this video a thumbs up and share it on all of your social media networks until next time thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you in the next video", "YgD2kLpmI98": "[Music] look what I've got here I was down at dr. green thumbs again since Omar so wonderful than being a able to go to a flower store that really has great flowers and with a budtender recommended one called apple fritter and as someone who really loves apple pie or apple crumble I wanted to try this flower not because I thought it would taste like an apple but I'm sure would have some similarity and the budtender said oh the flavor is so good so good and for me flavors kind of overrated I like flavor but it's really about two something something but if you have a flower that has something something in the flavor of course it's gonna be a winner so this came in this flip-top jar I'm not sure who the grower is all these guys should be in airtight jars that you can keep and you can see it says apple fritter and we're gonna try it today out of the vapor cup you can see it said it 335 or all got paper in the straw so let's check it out apple fritter out of the vapor Cup so the guy really convinced me the flavor is through the roof and smooth and it is really smooth this thing's like 1/8 so that's really smooth and it really has a light taste I don't want to say it really is heavy taste in any way do I taste apple fritters I don't think so but if you did a little bit this maybe you convinced yourself that it did it's a very nice baked dough so I ran back down to get it and invite the first time and when I ran back then I actually went down to get this because I thought of you know watching some good TV and trying some apple fritters just sounded really good to me so whatever you think what do I give apple fritter on the one-to-ten scale smoothness it's great flavor it's just ok do I think it tastes like apple fritters telling you with a little bit of imagination maybe you can get something somewhere in that vicinity but I'm gonna give the flavor of 7 5 maybe it's good it's not great what about the something-something it's all about the something something in this apple fritter the best I don't think so it's good I'm gonna give it a 7 I think it's something maybe if you really want to try something it's got a little bit of a gimmick maybe you can see the Apple in it would I buy it again no where I pass it around for people to try yes so I like it it's ok this is the doctor for weed entertainment you're looking for the best this ain't the best party on my friends [Music] you [Music]", "9uxiSKEGvi4": "ah hi I know that the steel rangers aren't bad ponies at heart I really do but it's times like this that really stressed me out you see a few days ago I walked in front of the hey burger shop you know the ones that did ring our owns it reactivated an old world of salt Ron and we managed to stop it but the reason why it was pissed off dead-ringer started talking about killing steel rangers in front of it apparently there's a contingent now here that's been working with advanced technology I haven't come in contact with them at all yet but apparently greased lightning had found this v-8 unit and they wanted to repair it well they overrode the command structure while they were repairing it greased explain to me that this bot was something that was unusual it was scouting the area and it almost found the town but when the Rangers couldn't recall the bot they decided to start transmitting a death threat to anyone who was holding on to the technology you know threatening death because that helps our image with the public its Rangers like this that makes me so angry for everyone good ranger who truly wants to preserve the technology and better ponykind there's one jackoff that believes that all the ones outside are tribals that they should just for the technology for years on end and I also understand that it is our duty to try and protect the public from themselves and handling dangerous technology but they also live in a world where they have super mutants pegasi that closed off the sky and kill anything xenophobic Lee and Rader is in slavery to contend with any smart ranger would not take a gun away from somebody who needs it especially when they may be covering their back later on which leads me back to that fight if the townsfolk didn't have a way to defend themselves almost everybody would have died that'ss Ultron was brought back to the reclaimer base so that gree lightning can go over it she was already recognized as the primary administrator so hopefully she'll be able to get some answers about where it came from and what we can do with it as for the b8 unit she allowed me to look it over and I was able to download some maps by rewinding it scanner data I was able to find out where its point of origin is I do know where the ranger base is and I plan to go check I plan on talking to them first hopefully they may recognize my status as an elder and listen to reason I did have another plan that I discussed what the reclaimers about posing as steel rangers for the time being the idea is that they would have temporarily acted as them and pretended to be them about the town I mean if things went south and we weren't able to stop them from getting to the town then at least they might be able to see that there was a ranger presence in control then they could avoid fighting altogether or at least buy some time to figure out something else there were actually a few ponies who liked the idea but the securitron known as orc derivative does not I know that greased lightning trust this robot but I don't it didn't like the fact that I was talking about diplomacy they kept trying to twist my words make things sound like I wanted them to come to town playing back only portions of what I was saying trying to make it sound as if I was the bad guy fork solution was to say the following why should we bother trying to protect things that may attack the town my job is to protect things that are here we should just go and meet them outside of town and kill them all my response to him was tactically they don't have to send just one reconnaissance group they can send multiple so even if we meet one group multiple can still find the town I also try to explain to it that every intelligent creature has value in their life artificial or otherwise some of these ponies just might be acting from orders one bad apple he didn't want to hear it he kept playing back different portions of my conversation while leading things out I don't know what kind of subroutines this thing is on but it's majorly paranoid and yeah I get it it's a protectron it's supposed to protect but it's also being a buttface the flaw of artificial intelligence lies within the intelligence itself in an AI you may spark the semblance of a personality but it's also limited by the fact that it's a machine and yeah ponies are flawed - but ponies grow up with wisdom experience and emotions brand-new a eyes start off as smart as they are and they have no experience and even some robots if there's hundreds of years old they don't have social experience so a lot of them fall back on their subroutines and they jump to the most efficient way of doing something possible mostly because it's the logical solution I told Forks what is easy is not always what is right I have no doubt that Fork wants to protect the town perhaps whatever is important to him but he also has a rigid thinking and for us intelligent as he might be from his CPU he does not have the experience or understanding of what loss could be maybe I'm wrong maybe it has experienced loss maybe it's being overprotective because of that regardless he's still a  and any rate I should probably just change the topic I saw that they had a Pegasus there I think his name was Zubin he looks like add a kite he had these big purple eyes huh what oh right I'm still recording Greece was there too I brought her some apple fritters she's still mending her leg after that robot attack she joked saying that her butt was gonna get big I'm glad that she enjoyed them I have all the ponies in town she's the nicest one I've met I like spending time

fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive when i'm with you i start to lose sight of the identity i've created for myself i'm blurring becoming

you guys this but i just haven't tried it yet but um it's called apple fritter so it has 77 thc it is a hybrid guys it's a hybrid um and it's only a half gram so [Music] only a little half gram um just because i didn't see any full grams sorry gotta switch up the hands but um i didn't see any full gram guys so i just got a half gram um it has thc v cbn and cbg in it um and then you know obviously the thc uh delta nine and it's a live resin apparently triple refined cannabis oil and the the thing that i question about this and i hope legion of bloom can even tell me is this a real live resin because it does say live resin vape cartridge but under it it says california sauce so is it a distillate with you know cannabis derived herbs but this isn't even the cannabis derived terp line i don't think this isn't the monarch line so i'm not sure but hopefully someone can explain it to me and let me know if this is just derived herbs to make it taste like live resin or is this just a sauce cart it's not necessarily a live resin car let me know down in the comments down below guys shout out to everybody um for always watching the vlogs um it means so much that you guys check me

super big tastes like a straight up like live resin um it's just super dang guys and uh this time i got the apple fritter but it is legion of bloom but off the back the first hit it tastes slightly sweeter it definitely has a earthly taste to it you know what i'm saying but obvi it definitely has a little bit of a sweeter taste to it like it's not necessarily that that full earthiness you know what i mean but it tastes like it tastes pretty good let me see let me try one more time but it's definitely dank though definitely dank and it still has a little bit of the earthy taste but it definitely has a little bit of sweetness in there i don't know if they use you know uh what terps they use actually i do know it's on the box but i put it in the uh put it in my pocket so i'll put the terps on the screen right now hopefully right now you guys see it if you guys don't see it sorry your boy got lazy with the editing but um shout out to everyone in the uh in the video that's watching so far it's just a beautiful day and we're chilling um but i do like the um friendly farms apple pie a little bit better than this one i just like that thickness more but this one is definitely a good one it's not too bad the only reason why i won't buy this one probably again it's just um the fact that it's a half gram and your boy needs four grams like uh hopefully they get these in full grain

with three new pastries that they're certain they're selling to people all day long so you can get them at breakfast [Music] lunch dinner whatever by the way i got the mystery guest behind the camera help me out what's up mystery guests all right here's some napkins for you so we're gonna try so i got in here i got a freighter [Music] okay so we're gonna try all three and i'll let you guys know what i think so first thing they came out with is a an apple fritter that's what the fritter looks like looks pretty much like any other apple fritter i've ever i've ever eaten the next thing i'm going to show you guys is there all new didn't they have blueberry muffins before i know this is a new formula so they had a blueberry muffin before supposedly this is their new newly formulated blueberry muffin right okay okay and you are a mess maker i'll clean it up don't worry mystery guest last but not least oh is there awesome looking do you remember when they had the cinna bites or yeah cinnabites or something this is their new it's called cinnamon roll that looks really good all right so what i'm going to do is just cut these up give you a little you can try them i will try them we will see what's the price point on these things okay oh i left that oh slacker it's in my coat i left it in my coat um but i think they're like can you can you go grab it it's in my right hand pocket in my coat while you're doing that i'll cut these up can you see what it says on there um the apple fritter was 229 the cinnamon roll was 259 all right blueberry muffin was 190. okay so under three dollars for each item okay so mystery gus have yourself a half a fritter there you go so i think i'm gonna try the fritter first so that's what it looks like on the inside that's what that look was oh it's good um i don't find it to be very appley well but it's good yeah i mean i like that so maybe maybe it's just that's the thing i didn't get a chunk but i like the texture um one thing i like a lot about this is the glaze they use on here is not overdone a lot of times you get a fritter and they put so much glaze on it that all you taste is glaze and your hands are sticky and this is a little sticky but it's not crazy with sweetness and glaze i can actually taste the the cinnamon in here and you can taste the the the pastry itself and not just glaze so i like that a lot that's very very very good very tasty i would definitely buy that again all right here help yourself to a half of blueberry muffin all right there you go so here's the inside a lot of mine are at the top looks like so here we go there's a blueberry muffin you can really smell the blueberries that's good too again not over the top super sickly sweet very soft very fresh it has good flavor you can taste the blueberries that's awesome that's definitely something i buy again too all right now this one i don't know if you want to handle this one or if you just really have a piece yeah i'll cut cut up a a piece for you that looks quite messy did you want to just uh try a bite got you a big piece there you go stuff it right in the pie hole don't choke falls apart nice so this is show you that up close they warm that one eat it all right that's some good flavor it's warmed which is nice not too much it's got a little bit warm it's got this nice gooey frosting on it everything you'd expect uh as far as these the goo the goo factor everything you would expect you turn around you can get a shot of the inside of a cinnamon roll really really good let me give you the nice little pastry box make cafe all right so what do you think what do you think on the fritter the apple fritter one to five no i thought it was pretty good yeah um i'm gonna give it before okay i'm going 4.5 on that i i really really enjoyed that fritter i think it's awesome what about the blueberry muffin i'll give it a four and a half 4.5 i'm going four on that one that was good needs a little more blueberries in my opinion but maybe it's just what i got you know i don't know yours might have more blueberries and how about the cinnamon roll you give it a five give it a five mm-hmm okay i'm giving it a five as well i think the cinnamon roll is outrageous it's awesome for the price was it 259 i mean this is like not quite as bit not as big nearly but cinnabon almost you know it's it's really really good i mean it's way better than i expected from a cinnamon roll from mcdonald's right you know it's really really good so there you go you got let's see uh four to four and a half on the fritter four to four and a half on the muffin and a five out of five big daddy certified on the cinnamon roll well that's pretty much it and i got something stuck to my arm crumps all right that's pretty much it guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up hit subscribe tap that notifier bell so you know when the next video comes out and remember before you take the first bite you got to stuff it in your pile that's tasty", "J7ZXO4DPyg4": "hi everyone I'm marina and welcome to my kitchen and another installment of the holidays are coming we are at the beginning of December and I knew I absolutely had to share this one with you what you see before you is a loaf of apple fritter bread yes I said apple fritter bread I was inspired to make this by a loaf of apple fritter bread that I actually bought the grocery store and I knew that I could do it better so let's go see how this all goes together [Music] okay we're going to show you how to make a really easy but so delicious apple fritter bread I came up with this technique a few months ago when we were having a bake sale for my church and I wanted to see if this would work I kind of had it in my head if you know how apple fritters are made then you know that they take the risen yeast dough they chopped it up with apples and then they deep-fry it and then they you know they glaze them I came up with this particular way of making a loaf of apple fritter bread inspired by a loaf of apple fritter bread that I purchased at a local grocery store and I love that bread and it's really tasty and I'm trying to think how can I make this myself and this is how I make it and it's a great way to give a holiday gift and you're going to love it when you find out how simple it is we're going to use I have a 1 and a 1/2 pound ball of my perfect sandwich loaf I have a can whatever your favorite brand is of apple pie filling and I have 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar blended together with a tablespoon of my homemade apple pie spice I will leave a link down below where you can find that recipe but what I when I make bread I do a double batch of my perfect sandwich loaf and then I divide it in three because I do not like the size that I get when I divide it in half it's just too large of a loaf so when I end up with 3 lobes I make two into sandwich bread for the week and I make one of these into the apple fritter bread or I'll make it into cinnamon rolls or something like that so this is so easy you're going to take your portion of dough and what you're going to do is you're just going to kind of break up your dough this isn't gonna make any sense until you see it so just break it up okay so if the pieces stick together don't don't worry because we're going to be chopping this up even more now take this apple pie filling now you're going to use about two-thirds of the can a whole can is just too much you want to get in here with your bench scraper and you just want to start chopping these things together you see how the dough is starting to look like little dumplings that's what you want yes now when it gets to this point right about there what I want you to do use your hands take some of this cinnamon sugar and after you get your sugar sprinkled on there I didn't use all of it yet you just want to mix that in as well and you see I'm just kind of folding and chopping at the same time get yourself a regular loaf pan all ready to go I have it sprayed with a cooking oil spray and you're just going to want to get that in the pan just like that now the only other thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take some more of this sugar and apple pie spice blend and I'm going to liberally cover the top with it and that's it I didn't use all of that there was a half a cup of sugar so you can use that for something else all right now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to cover this and I'm going to allow it to rise until it crests just over the rim of the pan then I'll bring you back and I'll show you what it looks like our bread has been rising for about a half an hour while my other bread baked so you can see how it's just gently crusted over the top of the pan like that I've placed my bread pan on a corner sheet pan that's I've lined with a parchment paper this may or may not boil over a little bit but I've never had that happen before my oven is preheated to 350 degrees this is going to go in there and bake for 45 to 15 minutes all right this just came out of the oven and I ran a sharp knife around the outside you're going to want to let this cool in the pan for at least 10 to 15 minutes because this is a very fragile bread when it's still warm and it's it'll get a little bit more structure once it cools off a bit but you don't want to take it out of pan right away it does look like an apple fritter it's going to taste like an apple fritter too but I'll come back when it's time to take this out of the pan so you can see what it looks like we're going to get ready to try and take this out of the pan without it breaking so what I've done is I have another quarter sheet pan that I lined with little parchment paper and I'm just going to set this on top take my potholders let's get this out of the way and then let's say a prayer ah and then we're going to come back very nice yes then we're going to come back with this one and we're going to flip it over again and there is your apple fritter bread that you shouldn't slice ha but we probably will and many of you are looking for a bread knife this rate of bread knife is the best bread knife I have ever used in my life that was just a little plug for raita because you know how much I love raita let's see this is hot you probably shouldn't slice this up hot but we're gonna take our chances as it cools it will stay together she or she says look at that beautiful looks like a half piece like looks like an apple fritter absolutely gorgeous don't eat this right away because it's gonna be too hot and you're gonna burn your mouth but my husband is going to burn his mouth after he puts this camera down I guarantee you he'll chance it it's that risk that you take in life um again up to you you can glaze it or not I think with the amount of cinnamon sugar I put on here we're just going to enjoy it this way as it cools it's going to stay together and make nice uniform slices and you're gonna love this you don't want to put this in the toaster because it's going to burn but you can warm it in the microwave if you like or you can just you don't need to put anything else on this bread it's absolutely delicious so that's how you make a really wonderful loaf of apple fritter bread and I think this is perfect for giftgiving for the holidays I think that anybody who receives this is going to love it they're going to think how unique and different it is and here let me just hold this up so you can see it's full of apples and sweetness and it's going to be delicious so I want to thank you for joining me today and seeing how I make apple fritter bread inspired by a loaf I bought at the store but I know I think mine is like way better the one in the store didn't taste nearly as delicious as mine if I

up a piping hot loaf apple fritter bread oh I can't wait to get started let's go well hello and welcome to the season finale yep that's right after this episode I'm taking a short break from food idiot but I'll continue hosting weekly video recipe while I finish preparing a whole new entertainment series for you so let's finish off this season with something I can really think my teeth into being the apple of someone's eye would probably make you feel very important and it should after all the pupil in our eye is a very important part of our Anatomy that's right the pupil at one time was referred to as the Apple so the apple of your eye was literally the dark part in the center of your eye the idiomatic usage of the term is also very old and can be traced back to the ninth century where King Alfred the Great used it in his translation of pastoral care in 890 later Shakespeare used it in a Midsummer Night's Dream in 1595 and it's used several times in the King James version of the Bible which was translated in 1602 day it produces over 31 million search results on the web so it's as popular as ever and we use it to refer to someone or something that is very precious to us much like the pupil of our eye Wow that one is an oldie all that history really left me craving apples let's go get that bread in the oven [Music] now that's a sweet finish to this first season and it's a hubby pic he requested this idiom and recipe after the first episode so I think he's waited long enough I have so much more fun plan for us so if you like playing with your food tap that

with this with the larger on get your mcd on i don't know that's what came to my mind not sure what marketing was going for for that anyways i don't know if you can hear it's raining it's been pouring all morning and it's getting ready to to switch over to snow i don't know what the latest is maybe two to four inches but i thought it would be a good idea to go head on over to mcdonald's since i found out that the mcrib sandwich went national i know i have seen past reviews every part of the week for the mcrib but it wasn't available in in new england in massachusetts i thought that was odd i thought that was the whole idea of a franchise is uh you have the same product no matter where you go i don't know why it must have been maybe a supply chain thing or something but limit limited time offer so i headed on over to mcdonald's picked up the mcrib sandwich and i know there was something else that i wanted to try and that is their new apple fritter so i picked up one of those so let's take a look i got a large fry i asked for a large fry they do have a mcrib meal but i don't think you get a large fry with it so there's the fries and there's the mcrib sandwich let's take a look there it is mcrib sandwich oh this is the bun so there's a couple of pickles a couple of shredded pieces of or slices of onion white onion it looks like it's toasted the buns toasted it's the top one yeah so that's toasted also so basically i think it's just pork but it's been molded to look like it has bones in it but it doesn't that's my understanding so get my fries [Applause] it might make rib that's not going to stand i just put them on the side so there's the mcrib sandwich with fries and a coke on the carousel so there it is let's give it a try yeah there's no it's just shaped to look like there's going to be a bone but there's no bones and it's a nice sweet barbecue sauce that's good i wonder why it has to be a limited time offer get some ketchup on these fries [Applause] so yeah so yesterday i do it every year i scrambled to see if the snow blower was gonna start up and it wouldn't start up so i had to troubleshoot it i have a shut off switch a shutoff valve and then i have a um a gas filter so this is a whole section of a small tubing a gas line but it's that there's too much pressure on that angle so during the course of the summer the tube collapsed sort of kinked so there wasn't any gas getting to the carburetor so lucky luckily i had some extra hose in the cellar and i put in a longer section with a big loop in it so it wouldn't kink and that fixed it i was pretty sure i changed the oil before the end of the season and i went to check the oil and to my surprise it was white so water got into the to the engine so i don't know how that happened we had a lot of rain here and the cover that i had for the snow blower blew away on this windy day i don't know where it went but uh i'm wondering maybe the spark plug got loose i don't know how else water would get in unless it can get in through the exhaust to the muffler it's gonna be a heavy wet snow and my snow blower doesn't doesn't do well with heavy wet snow so that was the mcdonald's famous mcdonald's mcrib sandwich it's okay i wasn't sure they were gonna have it or not when i went online they have like a mcrib locator and it was just showing places in new york city and nothing available in massachusetts and then i found an article about the re-release of the mcrib and it said it was for limited time it was available at all the stores i think the article said there were like 4 000 locations can you hear them i don't know if you're picking up the rain hitting the window well i want to take a look at this apple fritter there it is i can't tell because the lights are in my eyes pieces of apple in there i think i like that so that's good i think it just has apple flavoring there are actually pieces of apple but it's got like that deep fried dough consistency of texture and this nice glaze on it wow the wind if we had got snow from the beginning we would have had two feet of snow already some people are gonna get over a foot of snow like worcester and i think up like the middle of massachusetts up into new hampshire i wonder if the uh if that could allow the ski resorts to open up that would be that would be terrible if they had a really good if we had a really good ski season and they weren't able to open up i don't remember what the ski season was like last year well thanks everyone for stopping by that was the mcdonald's mcrib sandwich first time having that and it's available at all locations for a limited time and i also had their brand new apple fritter which i liked i prefer that over the apple pie apple pie isn't what it used to be i think the last time i had it they nuked it so much it took all the moisture out of it and uh i think they used to deep fry those because i know those things used to put you in the hospital if you bit into it too early because they would they were steaming hot yeah i remember those things would take off like the roof of your mouth if you didn't let them cool cool off first so thanks again everyone for stopping by thanks for your continued support thank you for your comments thanks for using the amazon affiliate link in the description i appreciate that thanks to all my paypal contributors and again thanks for your continued support till next video everyone thanks for watching bye i'm going to be shuffling shoveling some snow tonight you", "Ypu8L8-m2ow": "what's up y'all it's your boy shelton with

call because it came out smooth like when it went in my lungs expanded so mildly that i could be able to hold the smoke at least i thought i could whoo but that [ __ ] tastes like gosh that flavor is so awesome that's why i can't remember the flavor that was just in my mouth i know that it was super sweet i've never really tasted a weed this sweet that was really sweet almost like it almost like it was apple fritter like the cake like the dessert [Music] wow i taste of hino like it tastes like a sour apple but sweet it tastes like a sweet sour apple you've had a sweet sour apple with like cinnamon and sugar on top of it that's [ __ ] weird the last apple fruit i did like three months ago please go back and look at that last apple fritter video it wasn't dispensary grade this is dispensary grade and it's like i mean as soon as you pick it up your fingertips are immediately dusted with with the trichomes i don't know if you guys yeah you can see it see how my fingers just got dusted with all those trichomes my finger immediately got dusted as soon as i touched that it's crazy and it tastes so sweet good lord that is a nice flavor i hope the high matches it wow maybe i should stop taking such fat ants you guys please don't take this as a color thing what i'm about to say because i'm not prejudice at all at all so when you see when you see um caucasian people or white people smoke out of a bone man all my white homies man they smoke out of a bong they man they can have like a bone the four foot bone man and clear the chamber and sit there be like oh and blood all that smoke my my black homies i've never seen a black person be able to hit the bomb like the white boys do and i've never seen it i mean i guess we just don't have lung capacity so it's just weird i've i mean i've i got about the same the equal amount of friends you know what i'm saying black white spanish quarterback it's about equal so i don't even know how many numbers are it is i'm just saying but i've never seen a brother be able to hit a bomb without coughing it's almost funny when you see brother hit a ball for the first time y'all ever seen that that should look crazy i got a slight burn at the back bottom of my throat it's definitely not due to the weed i can automatically tell that i i'm starting to feel a buzz right behind my eyes it's it's like my oh my forehead right behind my eyes it's like both of them it's like you can tell that it's a hybrid um the buzz is starting to come on i can feel my eyes getting lower what was that about four hits so i started feeling it on the second hit but about the fourth hit is like it's really starting to kick in i'm feeling quite lovely indeed and that flavor lasts throughout the whole bowl that fritter flavor throughout the whole bowl you know usually when you smoke a bowl probably about the middle of the bowl you start losing the flavor of the weed that's why everybody likes that green hit you know that green is where it's at so this feels like a green hit on every hit like i can taste it every hit when i breathe out my nose i taste that [ __ ] that for the apple fritter the dessert it's really it's kind of strong it's not really strong where it's overpowering it's like but it's strong enough to where it tastes like you're actually eating the dessert excuse me i've had a lot of weeds with with good flavor to them this has got to be right at the top of the weeds with a good flavor this this flavor is just i can't stop talking about it enough y'all it's so delicious can you say delicioso [ __ ] it's quite nice you know i'm hurting get over here so i can get this uh flavor critique for you guys it breaks up really nicely i don't know if you can see that too good but it's like it definitely dusts your fingers always every time so it's a it's kind of a nice aroma coming off of when you bust it open it's the sweet that sweet smell it's like a sweet earthy smell like you guys know what i'm talking about you smelled a really sweet weed but it smelled earthy you guys know what i'm talking about everybody that smokes i mean you know that's one of the big things man is the smell of the wheat when you go to buy some weed man if you're not getting it from the dispensary what's the first thing you really do at it man you first thing you really pop the bag open you know get that smell this will give you that smell bro shhh most definitely of the flavor critique of this apple fritters i have to give it a nine you know what i i can't even you know i'm fake i'm fooling myself the flavor of this particular apple fritter from this strain this one right here i have to give it a 10. the flavor absolutely has to be a 10. i can't even play you guys the flavor is just it's overwhelming overwhelmingly delicious is what it is it's not overwhelming like oh god i can't stand a lot i gotta smoke this [ __ ] it's overwhelmingly delicious like i could actually see you smoking your whole sack man if you got a half ounce of this [ __ ] man and you roll the first blunt smoke that [ __ ] i guarantee you'll roll another one right after that flavor just wants to be in your mouth all up in your grill they should add this flavor to the m m lineup sheesh can you imagine that apple fritter flavored m m's hell yeah hey that might be something right there i've never made edibles out of apple fritter that would be nice let's see apple fritter fruity pebble treats that sounds delicious that is so delicious wow one second please i can't even hold i can't make it hold on for a second because that flavor is just all up in my grill it deserves every bit of that tin you guys see our pottery but it only deserves a 10 if it's dispensary grade you got to remember that where i come from the dispensary always has the best weed so except for florida however i've told you guys this a million times but in florida's defense i haven't been to the dispensary here in florida in i want to say four or five months i've been to the dispensary this year but it was like at the beginning of the year and so i haven't been since because i don't like to buy flour from them i sorry you guys i don't like to buy buds from them i don't know why they call it flour i can't stand it um okay okay [Laughter] starting to feel silly i'm starting to feel wavy you know what i mean you know that's got to be the best part of the morning even though it's already kicked in but not this portion of the bus when the bus first kicks in when you first wake your bait and that bus first kicking it's like hello friend yeah there you are but then as you pass buzz and head on up the stones once you get the stone it's like oh [ __ ] i feel really good and then when you get debate that's the name of the channel y'all that's what we trying to get to bait you know what i'm trying to wake up and get baked in the morning you don't wake up and get high waking high awaken buzz [ __ ] don't even sound right it's waking bait [ __ ] wake and get baked so i'm feeling smoking so i'm bank i'm big brother oh my nose he knows it's running my nose isn't running sorry y'all excuse me excuse my man thank you very much sorry about that we're back i'm just playing [Laughter] now that cough was so good i tasted all the desserts oh my god good lord you guys oh that was the one there you see that [ __ ] sat me back in my seat good lord have mercy lord take the wheel i'm back that is really delicious now i can say one more so um one of the family y'all one of the subscribers y'all know we family but one of the family is tired of seeing me use this lighter tired of seeing me sucking butane so i got to give a quick shout out to my boy scott thank you scott um i'll have that p.o box number for

member anyway you guys let's get back up in here and i'm really really feeling fake it feels like it's coming like this you guys like to my eyes like right behind i can't explain it feels weird it just feels like it's like right on the corner of my eyes like i don't it's it's unexplainable please don't try to sing no more now let's see how tasty that is did he clear the bone while he had a hit in his mouth let's show you how weak that it was huh that's the type his i'm supposed to be taking those type like that you know enough to get a nice high but not enough to choke your head off but i love choking my head off y'all know that i can't wait till i get up enough money so i can get a new bomb you guys although this bong is properly seasoned believe me this bong is properly seasoned um i it's time for a new one it's time to bring a new glass to the channel i understand a couple of you guys are getting tired of seeing me smoke bombs and he asked if i smoked raws before him there they go right there i smoked the raw blacks before um but i prefer you know bongs and bowls you already understand man you know so because although it's nice to to sit back and smoke a j i me personally i cannot taste the weed through a j man i don't care if it is raw blacks you can taste through these i i cannot taste the weed man i i don't know what it is like i said maybe i damaged my taste buds from smoking cigarettes for 40 some odd years but um i can only taste it through a bowl or through a bone man i can't even really taste it through a vaporizer through a vaporizer all weed tastes the same to me it's weird you may get a different variation maybe every fifth or tenth weed but i mean if it's like some super weed like this [ __ ] you might get a different taste but it's all all you're smoking is a thc there's really not too much flavor in that to me to me i know everybody else would disagree with that but to me it's not too much flavor and i know that's what gives it the flavor try helps whatever you want to call it y'all i already know all this y'all thank you though oh yeah another weekend oh that wasn't so weak wait a minute wait a minute ain't no coughing i said ain't no coughing ain't no coughing here we go okay thank you very much on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] 10 be that good [ __ ] of the high critique of this apple fritter spring mmm that tastes really nice if i can give it 11 on the flavor i would now the high this is really really a nice intense high and i'm really fighting from giving it a 10. but i'm pretty high but for some reason i feel like it's the light that's intensifying my high i don't know i'm pretty baked let's go in for further analysis okay it's continuing with headlocker you guys [Music] well well you guys i'm just as shocked as you are i'm fighting not to give this a 10. because there's only been one other strain that's had a 10 out of 10. but you guys i think we found another unicorn i really think we found another unicorn i am pleasantly baked i have an excellent taste in my mouth my buzz makes me feel like [ __ ] going surfboarding on the on the bayou [ __ ] you know what i'm saying make me feel like going going roller skiing or some [ __ ] you know what i'm saying [ __ ] this [ __ ] made me feel like [ __ ] just getting in the himalayas can you just get him anyway y'all this [ __ ] i can't oh ladies and gentlemen ding ding ding ding ding ding ding we have another contender the only other one that has ever gotten a 10 for flavor and a 10 for high has been head knocker that was uh six seven eight i don't know how many months ago go back and check out the videos we have another one you guys apple fritter dispensary grade has gotten a 10 out of 10. this hat absolutely deserves a 10 out of

first thing in the morning when i come in here that's one of the first things i do is open up the blinds i think jonah's asking me something jonah's birthday's coming up y'all so he's checking out some stuff here that he can get with his birthday money i just took off home so he does to get some child stuff okay hey type in 12 but so he's been wanting to look at stuff the past few days figure out what he wants to spend his birthday money on i've got to get all his birthday stuff added to the grocery pickup order his birthday is this weekend so he's really excited i've got to get all his birthday stuff added and i forgot to tell you all about this i'm changing my pickup order day y'all know i've been doing it on saturdays since school started back i got a little off for a little while and had to go on different days but i've been doing it on saturday mornings as soon as possible that they had one available on saturdays it's not working out it's not working saturdays are obviously the busiest day at our walmart for grocery pickup it's probably like that at a lot of walmarts and we have to wait like the past two saturdays i think the past two times that i've done it on a saturday we have had to wait 45 minutes before we got our groceries and i mean that's after they've already sent the email letting me know it's ready and all of that 45 minutes so yeah switching it back to a weekday but i'm gonna have to do it in the afternoons i don't like going to get groceries in the afternoons i like to get that over with in the mornings but since school is going on i don't want to push school till later in the day because it just doesn't work out we like to be done by two o'clock so the kids can have the rest of the day to play and do all their stuff and i can do all my stuff yes sir what flavor is this one this strawberry cheesecake you want one you can have it we just finished with lunch and everything this afternoon and i have some dishes over here that i need to wash all just sleeping i went in there to get manly to sleep sometimes during the day he goes to sleep better if i take him into my room and sit with him in there in our little it's not a rocking chair it's like a little swivel desk chair because if the kids are in here doing stuff it just keeps him distracted and he doesn't go to sleep so i went in there to get him to sleep and aldr went in there with me and she fell asleep she must be going through a growing growth spurt because she's been taking naps here lately and she normally doesn't take naps so they are in my room asleep she's on my bed and he's in his baby bed and all the boys are outside doing all their stuff is the baby up i thought i heard him but it wasn't him is tyler out there doing bird calls that's what i heard i knew i heard something that was sounding like oh i thought it was a baby it's tyler out here trying to call to this heron there it is i've never seen him up in trees before but there he is they're usually always landing down here at the pond he's up there looking at the pond probably trying to see where he can find a fish to swoop down here and get watch out jonah he might think you're a fish and try to swoop down here and get you i love your bird calls they're wonderful but you're gonna wake the baby i'd go calm him down with them bird calls titus is on his way home he's gonna be finishing up the grout in here today this is not on here yet he was just putting it on here we were trying to make sure this was the color that we wanted titus hates it i loved it on the little piece of paper but when you get it on the wall it's a different story we were going to have to do a second coat because there you can't really see it with the camera i'm sorry it's echoing in here you can't really see it too good with the camera but there are certain spots where we were definitely going to have to go back over it so we were just going to do a second coat titus was all i mean he kept coming in here y'all he kept coming in here he would look at the wall he would come through this way and then like when he left the other morning he told me to come and unlock this door that he was going to come in here and look at it from this way anyway you just come in and look at it and he was like i don't like it i don't like it and he was wanting to do it the color of jacob's room jacob's room it looks good in jacob's room i'll go show y'all what color his room is in a minute it's like a really pale yellow color but i was like please no i don't want it to be yellow there's nothing wrong with yellow nothing at all i just didn't i wanted to be gray in here so titus is the one who picked out this color and i told him i wanted a gray well he picked this color because if you look closely you can see that that color is actually in the tile on the floor and so it it matched you know but he absolutely hates it i mean i could live with it i'm fine i can live with this color but he is stressing out about this color and i'm like i'm the one who goes in there the most anyway it's not a big deal but he doesn't like it he got some more paint y'all he's like nope i'm not and so i told him to get gray and so where's it at i don't know where he put it i think this is it oh yes this is it right here he got this color academy gray so we're gonna repaint it's this one right here this lightest light gray right here so that is the update of what's going on in here so the reason i wanted gray in here is because if y'all remember i bought lots of laundry room stuff that i wanted to put in here that would match gray like this picture here i have a few other things they're put up but gray is going to look good with the things that i did buy a long time ago when we were going to be doing this in here so i had to stop him from the yellow situation now like i said there's nothing wrong with yellow i just didn't want yellow in there there's jake i'm gonna go show them the color of your room as your bed made yeah okay here's the color in jacob's room so it's a really nice color it looks really good in his room i just didn't want the laundry room to be yellow what i'm about to do while manly is sleeping is make some apple fritter bread that apple fritter why is that hard for me to say fritter apple fritter fritter why can i not say fritter fritter fritter i'm about to make some apple bread

tablespoons of sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon we're just gonna coat the apples in that cinnamon and sugar all right now we sit these over to the side in this bowl we need one and a half cups of

the side we have three side bowls going on now we're putting in half a cup of softened butter and two-thirds of a cup of sugar we're gonna put in two eggs one at a time because i'm gonna follow directions today he has to come check out what's going on over here yay you wanna do it yay oh he wants to keep on doing it now we're going to mix in one and a half teaspoons of vanilla now we're going to add in the dry ingredients from bowl number three now we mix in half a cup of milk and here comes my helper you want to pour in the milk yeah does it have to be spoiled again yes got to be mixed good job all right i'm back here getting the loaf pan greased and floured real quick what are you making uh apple fritter bread now we move this over to the side and scoot our loaf pan up there cece well we don't have to move it to the side we need it right now we're gonna put half of the mixture that we just made into the loaf pan i'll do this part and i'll let you do the next part okay since this bowl is pretty heavy okay so we're gonna spread this half in here time for the apples only put half of these all on top of here okay we gotta save half of them for the top then we sprinkle half of this brown sugar mixture all over the top you're gonna do this with your hands okay okay there we go okay she's gotta wash her hands now we're gonna repeat the layers [Music] [Applause] [Music] that is it now this goes in the oven for about one hour i'm gonna start checking it at around 45 minutes though and see what we got going on what do you got [Music] snack time all right y'all so the apple bread is in the oven i'm about to brush my teeth i brush my teeth after lunch do y'all roast your teeth after lunch most of the times i don't do it every day after lunch but a lot of days i do we're getting ready to rearrange in here i mean not today i'm not doing it today but we are going to rearrange in here because it's just too too much so the desk is in here mainly because this is where the computer used to be you know before we ended up moving the computer to the living room i would really like to put the desk in my closet and it'd be like a little bitty tiny baby desk room in there we would have to take down this shelf though this is where all my homeschool stuff is i don't know if it would fit though this is kind of a i'm seeing if maybe the desk would fit in this closet what do you think the desk yeah i'm joking no that would be weird but it'd be like i'm trying to figure out what we could do what we could do about well what you can do is keep that for your clothes we'll keep that right there anyway you're talking about that no i was really for a minute i was serious but now let's pretend like i was joking about it we just need a little more room in here we need to that other room over there is bigger the room type but the problem is i don't know why whoever did this house made the carpet i don't like that it doesn't have the bathroom in it see our bathrooms right there that room doesn't have i mean tyler would be in here with the with the better bathroom that's not fair it really is weird that this is the smaller bedroom but it's the one with the bathroom so if you don't care i'm gonna go in here and study a minute i was just serious for a minute it was a joke it was a joke now are you trying to get the oh oven's beeping i mean microwave's beeping let's check the bread and see what it's looking like it's looking pretty i think it's done here it is so it doesn't look like the picture like i said but it still it smells good we're going to let it cool a little bit and then i'll flip it out and once it cools all the way we're going to make a little icing to drizzle over the top of it  no mommy eating acorns no mommy are you sure yes mommy open your mouth  is sneaking the acorns y'all manly loves that little song and sometimes we can get him to go ha ha ha like he's trying to do it doesn't sound that good but oh did y'all do it again say ha ha ha do it open your mouth you're silly all right y'all i took it out of the pan i had a little hiccup back there stuck to the pan just a tad but it's okay i i fixed it i tasted a little bit of what stuck to the pan it is really good and we haven't even put the icing on top yet we just need half a cup of powdered sugar and a little bit of milk or cream one of y'all mentioned using cream to make the icing like this the other day i think i'm going to try a little cream just a little yeah you can stir it let me put a little more cream in there just a little there you go all right y'all got the icing made i put it into this little sandwich baggie so that i could you know drizzle it on really good but it's still pretty warm so i need to let it cool down just a little bit more before i put that on there i mean look at that icing i can't handle it that is beautiful making the icing with cream instead of milk i definitely like that better y'all see how i mean it ran a little bit but now it's it's not runny and it tastes a lot better with the cream i mean i know there's a lot more calories involved but it's worth it all right so that's done and it's going to be waiting for us after supper this gets 20 stars i'm just saying make this it looks fancy too because the apples are inside but we know all we had to do was layer that 20 stars i changed to 100 stuff 100 stars now y'all know it's got to be good cece's giving it 100 stars it really is so good good night she all tomorrow baby's day out baby's day out where are you going houston we have a problem [Music]", "l58fPmCnq68": "what is up guys Tony come back again with another review so today I'm gonna be reviewing a bakery item from Publix and if you don't know public says it's a local grocery chain in the south it's primarily in Georgia Florida and I think it may be in like Alabama and Mississippi I don't know how far north it goes but uh it's primarily in Georgia Florida and Alabama and so today I'm gonna be trying there apple fritter and ran off the bat this thing is pretty sizable I mean look at it in comparison to my hand it's and I have pretty big hands so this is a pretty pretty sizable so let's like give it a try and it's still hot so just bodes well so let's give it a try mm-hmm so the outside is nice and crispy like a good friend or should be at the inside it's pillowy soft and loaded with cinnamon and you can see right there there's a big chunk of Apple mmm still crispy too this is a good apple fritter man guys if you have a Publix in your area don't sleep on their bakery items this apple fritter is phenomenal it's not I wouldn't say it's quite as good as qt which sounds kind of weird considering that the gas station but that thing was like the size of this plate I mean it's literally that big and this one is slightly smaller but the flavor is still there it's definitely right up there with the one from cutie man it's all gooey in the middle yeah it has a really good apple fritter so for the Publix bakery apple fritter I'm gonna give it a four out of five like I said it's not quite as good as the one from cutie but there's something in a grocery store bakery that is very good I definitely recommend you try it and if you have tried to let me know what you thought of it in the comments below give this video like if you enjoyed it share it so someone else

of town in quite some time but I've I came to realize that of all of the pastries I've had from there I've never had their apple fritter I've reviewed their cinnamon roll I've reviewed their iced chocolate donut I think there was one other one that I reviewed but I never I'd never even tried their apple fritter and I love apple fritters it's like apple pie til night and this thing smells and looks amazing and if you can see this behold like this that is half my dad loves apple fritters - so he got one and he said they were so huge that eating whole would just be nuts and I mean this he was right as suckers I mean imagine something twice this so that is huge I mean their cinnamon roll was huge but this is almost about 3/4 the size of one of their cinnamon rolls so something twice this size would just be insane to try and in one sitting but enough talking let's get to eatin okay there's a little bit of Apple there I hate how some apple fritters say they're apple fritters and they just taste like cinnamon and there's no actual Apple in it mmm this is really good it's really sweet though they're sorry if you can hear my brother he's tuning his bass downstairs so may her a little bit of a buzzing noise and that's what that is hmm man I just glaze on here I love it I don't know if it's special to Qt I've never had a glaze like this anywhere else and I don't know what it is I just love it mmm oh yeah which is kind of like their cinnamon roll but with an apple flavor to it hmm so this is definitely a good cinnamon roll or I mean apple fritter and it's definitely a good apple fritter but honestly I've had better but I mean this came from a gas station so but having said that I'd still give it a four and a half out of five it is a really good apple fritter and it's huge I don't remember exactly how much it was but it was like somewhere between 2 and 3 bucks which for something that big that's a good deal in my opinion but if you've had the Cutie apple fritter

me give you guys a close-up i love that they put a ton of frosting on it that's what i wanted i didn't want it to be too dry i like when my cinnamon rolls are like drenched with that icing i also brought some milk with me and i did order an iced coffee a sugar-free vanilla one cheers very doughy it's kind of dry it could be a little bit more moist look at the bread really dry actually i feel like it has the right amount of cinnamon though everything anymore would be too overpowering so the best cinnamon rolls for me are from cinnabon they're perfect you know what i feel like it's kind of hard because it's cooled down a little bit i'm sure if you pop this in the microwave for like 15 seconds it'd be perfect hmm that was a good bite not bad i'll give that one like a hmm seven out of ten there's our iced coffee i think the one i'm gonna go in for next is this blueberry muffin when i unwrapped it i was pretty excited because it looks similar to starbucks blueberry muffins which i love like it has the crumbly topping on it yum i think this one's gonna be good you guys i'm actually not a fan of their topping but the blueberry muffin itself is really good i feel like they can use a little bit more blueberries in there get like a few or you might get even one per bite i think i'm also gonna give this like a seven all right let's dig into this apple fritter it looks very very sweet it's like completely covered in a glaze it's a hefty little thing right here all right cheers first bite was all dough actually hoping that they put in actual chunks of apple in it it might just be like apple flavored like most apple fritters you know they just kind of break off in pieces i feel like the base is just like all cinnamon okay there's like a little little itty itty-bitty piece of apple in there you see it right there it's so small i wish the chunks were bigger for sure tastes like most apple fritters i don't have much to say other than i wish that they were bigger apple chunks in there i'll give that one like a six out of ten all right this might be the shortest review in the history of reviews but i would say their pastry line at mcdonald's is pretty average if i had to choose my favorite would be this cinnamon roll my only complaint with it is that it could be a little softer i feel like again that could easily be fixed if i had like a microwave with me um and then i know i gave this muffin a seven and then the apple fritter or six but that's just because i'm more of a fan of muffins than i am fritters however however in this particular case if it was like a life or death situation and i had to choose between one or the other i'm actually going to go with the apple fritter in this case you know what killed it for me in the muffin was the outer topping i didn't like how it was like crystal when you bit down into it not my jam but the inside of the blueberry muffin tasted so good it was nice and moist you know it was like a good batter um mama yeah so i'm gonna rate it it's gonna go cinnamon roll apple fritter then blueberry muffin all right i hope you guys enjoyed again don't forget to like comment and subscribe if you want to see this face again keep it yummy", "6EoiKo6OnQw": "hi guys this is dawn with furtastic friends and today i'm coming to you with another recipe uh please forgive me i am still um not feeling good um so if you hear some sniffling or a sneeze or a cough um there i go so please forgive me but i'm still trying to pump out the videos for you today we are making apple fritter bread or you could also call it a cake and it's going to be made in a loaf pan and the first thing you need to do is go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees and the ingredients will be a third of a cup of brown sugar and one teaspoon of cinnamon mixed together then a half a cup of butter two thirds of a cup of sugar two room temperature eggs one and a half teaspoons of vanilla one and a half cups of all purpose flour with one and three quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder whisked together a half a cup of milk which i have sitting in the refrigerator you will also need two apples peeled and chopped and then two tablespoons of sugar and a tablespoon of cinnamon mixed in with the apples okay guys let's get started making an apple fritter loaf cake slash bread okay guys now the first thing you're going to want to do is you're going to want to put your softened butter into a bowl along with the 2 3 of a cup of sugar and we're going to mix that until they're combined and then move on to the next step [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] [Music] so [Music] okay that's combined now we're going to add our eggs one at a time and as you can see i have a little glass bowl here i like to crack my eggs into that first so to make sure i don't get any shells into the mixture and now the next egg so and now the one and a half teaspoons of vanilla and i'm using a half teaspoon measurement so that means i'm going to need three of these to equal one and a half teaspoons but i'm going to leave this out because i'm probably going to use some vanilla in the glaze that we make with powdered sugar once it's done baking and you'll need a half a cup of powdered sugar for that glaze and now let me just scrape down [Music] uh where's my spatula ah there we go scrape down the sides and now we're going to add in our flour mixture that has the baking powder already mixed in [Music] and now our milk goes in and just beat this until it's well combined okay that's it now you need a loaf pan that has been sprayed with nonstick spray let me go ahead and remove my mixer and i'm going to show you how to layer this in your loaf pan okay guys now what you want to do is you want to pour half of your batter into the pan smooth that out and then put half of the apples on top of that and the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture that you put together in the beginning sprinkle let me get a little and sprinkle that over the top of the apples but only half keep the other half for the top and then take your knife and swirl this into the batter and kind of pat everything down now we're going to pour the rest of the batter right on top and do the same thing spread the batter and then sprinkle the rest of the apples spread those out and sprinkle the rest of your brown sugar cinnamon mixture on top i probably could have put a little bit more of this on that other layer but that's all right and then now press this layer into the batter because you want some of these apples to go into the batter some to stay on top okay and that's it guys now we're gonna stick this in the oven for approximately one hour everybody's oven is different so my suggestion would be to start checking it at maybe the 50 minute mark because especially if your oven cooks faster than a normal oven i will be checking mine at 50 and then keep checking it from there to make sure it's not overcooked so when it's done we'll be back okay guys just took it out of the oven and my house smells delicious but i need to let it cool in the pan for about 10 to 15 minutes and then i'll take it out of the pan and let it cool completely before we cover it in the yummy glaze so when that happens we'll be back to finish up this gorgeous apple fritter cake loaf bread whatever you want to call it but i can promise you that this thing smells and it's going to be delicious okay guys my apple fritter bread cake is cooled and so now i made a glaze from half a cup of powdered sugar a tablespoon of milk and a quarter teaspoon of vanilla and we're gonna put this over the apple fritter loaf now if you wanted to be more like a real apple fritter you can thin out this glaze with another tablespoon or two of milk and then just pour it over the loaf for um a much thinner glaze like the real apple fritters are at the the bakery but i'm just going for a drizzle on mine and mine baked for about 56 minutes so mine did not go the full hour mine went for a few minutes less than an hour because when i checked it at 50 minutes it was not completely done and so i let it go for about five or six more minutes and then it was done okay guys i'm gonna let that glaze sit and then when it's time for oh yummy when it's time to cut into this for dessert we'll be back to give it a taste okay guys i've cut into the apple fritter bread and i cannot wait to have a taste oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness that is so good oh my oh this would be delicious with a cup of coffee oh yeah that that is so good i am making this again oh yeah and i'm probably gonna freeze a few slices so whenever i'm in the mood for this for this apple i can take it right out of the freezer and defrost it oh my goodness the texture is amazing but one thing i can warn you about don't use a small loaf pan i used my smallest loaf pan and luckily i put it on a sheet pan while it was in the oven and so the sheet pan caught the tiny bit of overflow so make sure you use a decent sized loaf pan when you're making this but oh my goodness guys oh i need to go sit down so i can finish this this piece of um apple fritter bread if you're new to my channel i hope you'll subscribe and hit the bell so you'll be notified every time we upload a new video and so you can see more tasty desserts and dishes like this and as always love hugs and kitty kisses bye guys you",

"what's good guys we're back with another video today and today we're smoking a little bit of apple fritter so you already know what time it is get your bowls your bugs your bloods your papers whatever you smoking out of today let's get it roll up pack up the smoke spark up so like i said smoking a little bit of apple fritter so yeah it's not much about this strain it's not a very common strain whatsoever so i thought i might as well do a review on it so what i decided to do is i'm gonna i'm not gonna do a review on every strain i come across every strain i get i'm gonna do more so of the strange that's not really covered not really talked about or stuff like that you know what i'm saying so this is what i'm doing i'm doing apple fritter today so yeah i've actually had this before in the past but this one this time around oh no this time around man listen it packs a punch like i said there's not too much information about this it is a hybrid i don't know the percentage of what is it 50 50 60 40 70 30. i don't know the percentage i could honestly i think it's leaning more towards the indica because it does give you that very relaxed very calm very like want to just sit down and watch movies type a high makes you just want to vibe you know what i'm saying and then and if you're too kind you're just gonna fall asleep so apple fritter it does live up to his name it does live up to his name trust me it tastes just like apples it does if you get a good batch it tastes just like apples it does the flower itself of course i'll show video clips of it you know to the right to the left whatever which side it's on there's there so yeah whatever side i put it on is there so it's purpley it's nice and purpley because it's nice it has like a earthy aroma to it along with the apple taste it's like if you ever had an apple fritter or had any type of apple pastry you're gonna get like that sweet apple taste off of this drink you are you're gonna get that sweet taste i'm surprised it's not in the cookies family of how sweet it is or anything like it is but i am gonna keep it is that one of the high punching strange if you're looking for like a strain that's gonna um put you to sleep that's gonna just straight knock you out put you on your ass you're just gonna be slumped this is not the train this is the strength to be relaxed but this is also the strain to like to like you know keep you nice and calm mellow go for anxiety i'm tired it's beautiful fans idea i'll go through anxiety problems especially like being around large crowds and numerous people that i don't know personally and stuff like that that's what i'm saying so this is perfect for anxiety this has a perfect taste to it too uh wood i kind of would recommend this for beginners because you're

beach resort down in love Leah Sawyer's BC and today we're working with ambrosia apples so today I'm gonna do one of my favorite recipes and Brigitte apple fritters first thing we're going to show you is how to make the fritter batter for the ambrosia apple fritters so the mixing bowl 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 a cup of white sugar 1 tablespoon of baking powder and I just have half a teaspoon of regular salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg take a whisk and just mix those ingredients together now everything is mixed up nicely you're gonna add 1 and 3/4 cups of regular milk 2% works just fine you might have to whisk this a little bit to get some lumps out until it's like a thin pancake batter that's the consistency we're looking for and then I have a 2 eggs I'm just gonna add those right in mix those in nice so this fritter batter will make quite a few fritters so if you don't eat 20 fritters today the batter will stay in the fridge good for a few days so that's the batter that's a nice consistency we're looking for so I'm just gonna set this fritter batter inside while we close up our ambrosia apples so I have two lovely ambrosia apples you don't have to worry about and brodes your apples browning if you do these a little bit of ahead of time to the nice thing about ambrosia apples is they don't oxidize as fast as some other apples so they won't go Brown on you well I can smell the Ambo to apples already so the next thing we're gonna do is core the apples now I have a apple corer if you don't have one of these you can use any little round cookie cutter you like we're gonna cut the apples about a quarter of an inch thick if we cut them too thin when we cook the apples they're gonna go a little bit too soft on us we want to keep them a little bit thicker so once we slice the apples we're gonna take your little cutter you're just cutting off the core and do two at once if you want and then if you do have one of these cars you can go all the way through it and then just do your slices from there so now that we have our Apple sliced we're going to set those aside cuz here comes the fun part of the recipe we're gonna make a salted caramel to go with these ambrosia apple fritters I have a small sauce pot medium low heat and I have one cup regular white sugar so this is what I want to be very careful because that sugar can burn very quickly now I'm just taking a little bit of regular water on my pastry brush and I'm just brushing down edges of my pan you can see where the sugar starts changing color on the edges we don't want burnt sugar in our caramel sauce a little bit of water gets into your sugar that's okay you can take a whisk just to stir it around a little bit you can start to smell the sweetness come out as the sugar starts taking a little bit of color it clumps together a bit in the bottom of the pan that's okay it will slowly dissolve should take about three to five minutes so when you're looking for color when you start seeing a very light amber is a good indicator of when it's going to be the right color because as soon as it starts to take some color it'll take color very fast there we got a nice amber coming gorgeous color that's what we're looking for so now we're going to add a half a cup of heavy cream and when you do this be very careful because it's going to foam up on you whisk that in about a minute after that cream is incorporated I have six tablespoons of cold salted butter cut into cubes only two cubes at a time the sauce takes a little bit of patience again gonna add a little pinch of regular salt whisk that in once it's where we want it just to any heat proof serving dish that you want to pour it into we're just gonna set that aside while we fry our Ambrose apple fritters so we have our apples that we sliced earlier we have a batter that we made earlier we're just gonna drop these into the batter I like using my hands and now they're nicely coated now very carefully you can use a spoon to drop these in tongs if you want I'm just gonna use my fingers I've done this a couple times right now with oil sitting at about 350 degrees just stir your fritters around then they'll only take about a minute give a little flip and what I have is a bowl which is sugar a little bit of cinnamon I like to talk to me right when they come out it's important that you do this right when they come out so they're hot and that beautiful cinnamon sugar sticks to the and blows out the fritters these four are done you just toss them all this beautiful cinnamon sugar we have a plate here we're just going to stack these another one on top we have the caramel sauce just gonna drizzle smooth that over the top I have a little bit of just whipped cream that I did before I like it a little bit on top and some little fresh mint I picked from the garden this morning and there you go and road.you apple fritters one of my favorite recipes made here at beautiful watermark beach resort please try this recipe out if you like it [Music]", "RfRiUi8OU7w": "well hello there it's me again joey lee the commander in keith gi mary jane coming to you this time from sunny el centro california i've got the camera awful close here it's it's really hard to find an angle where where the sun's not crazy in our way but we're gonna do our best here here we are once again strain of the week civil disobedience edition from el centro california and i am in a hotel right now it's a non-smoking hotel so where i can't smoke my cannabis inside i am in a legal state so smoking cannabis in public is only punishable by a small fine extortion fee if you will but i'm not in public right now i'm at the hotel so it's actually up to the discretion of the owners no i didn't ask them it's my freedom it's my body if they have a problem they can talk to me about it later on this week's strain of the week is coming to you from march and ash in el centro california um it's expensive here i mean pricey a f which is crazy considering it's california which is like one of the motherlands if it's not colorado or cannabis so many so many farms around here there's so much excellent climate for growing weed and yet 20 gram can't make this stuff up by the way guys hashtag platoon420 if you ever want to help me out with these strains [ __ ] let me know in the donation what strain you want me to try out and i'll make sure to do my best to find it and we can uh feature it on one of our episodes anyway this time i got apple fritter i've been doing some strains of the week from vegas which is great because they have terpene content listed on the containers in vegas they do not in california which is kind of kind of concerning to me i like to know what i'm putting in my body but this time we got apple fritter from march and ash and it came in at 29.42 thc there's a big old government warning on the back you know because cannabis is bad and california's oh so famous cannabis stamps that one always makes for a fun t-shirt hey speaking of t-shirts when you're done here head on over to platoon420.com scroll on down to the shop tab and it'll take you over to the platoon 420px over there you'll find all sorts of awesome rally swag including t-shirts tank tops hoodies masks there's even weed pouches guys so that's without further ado crack this open and run it through the old leafly rating system that goes off appearance aroma cure flavor and effect so first things first appearance we're gonna take this safety seal off of here that's so difficult to remove way to go government that makes it better um oh jesus maybe we should just start with aroma i mean this thing just kicked me in the face when i opened the container holy crap oh my okay so let's let's start with uh let's let's not start with aroma you guys can wait for that um appearance just wow these are some flaky beautiful incredible awesome buds i mean look at the trichomes on this thing it's incredible it's shiny it's sparkly it's glittery it wants me to smoke it's so so very bad wow i mean you guys that is incredible i wish you could put this under a microscope you know that's something to invest in one of those usb microscopes so we can actually get a deeper look into our cannabis at the strains of the week yeah somebody's base is thumping back there um so appearance it's beautiful it's fluffy um but it's not like incredible i don't hear you know swarms of angels singing when i look at this so for appearance i'm gonna go ahead and give this a 15. it's it's it's really not that incredible i gotta be completely honest look scratch that let's go back and we're gonna make it 16. i did give the orange cookies 18 and this is right on par with it so i'm gonna go with 16 for appearance for smell 20. i wish i wish i could let you guys know what i was going here oh my goodness it's it's got that like cake cookie kind of smell i can smell the pineapple but it's it's it's very it's very faint it's very light so oh wow it is skunky as hell though um yeah smell 20 right away this smells incredible the cure the cure what's the cure more cowbell no more cannabis so let's break this up and see it's kind of it's kind of [Music] kind of dry ish the other thing that uh california neglects that nevada and say maryland i think michigan's included in that do not neglect is the harvest and packaging date so be really cool if that was on here california i don't know how much you're paying for how many thousand pages of bills and what have you but you missed a spot um the cure is great on this this is super sticky in my hands i don't even think i'd be able to roll a joint out of this right away which isn't necessarily a bad thing i've left it out in the nightstand for a night it'd be good to go but but when that happens when it dries out the organoleptic compounds inside your cannabis start to break down so that's why the cure is so important i'll have more on that later this year um this cure is solid though it's hard for me to give a 20 on a cure because i have seen ugh i have seen weed that was cured to perfection i mean perfection um that i only saw unfortunately in a testing situation this stuff never hit the market um and considering i've seen that and i know how good a cure can be 20 is really hard for me to reach um it's really good man i keep you see me doing this because my fingers are sticking together which is great that's what you want um yeah so for cure we'll go ahead and give this a solid 19. um only because i know i've seen better but so far in terms of strains of the week this this here takes the cake um next category is flavor my favorite part wow it tastes really piney oh my it's very good i don't like how harsh it is just girdle it around in there let it hit the palette i can't wait till there's like weed connoisseurs like there are pop connoisseurs i know you guys are out there i know because i talked to you guys i smoked with you guys and i can't wait till that that culture comes to the surface um this stuff tastes great it's very piney and it leaves like this lingering flavor in your mouth which i'm really impressed with it's funny it's called apple fritter i i don't know where they're getting the apple from it it's a bit sour um that goes along with the skunky smell that i'm smelling um coming through in the taste wow look at this this is the camera zooms in on it the the weeds still stuck to my fingers here can you see it it's still stuck there awesome cure i gotta say that much which makes me believe that the effects gonna be great because the better the cure the more potent the terpenes are and you guys government's got it all wrong you know they're the experts on cannabis but generally it's the terpenes that give you that high feeling that relaxed feeling that you know that that energetic feeling that euphoric feeling it's all coming from different terpenes meanwhile the government's regulating the thc levels and enough of the thc is not helpful but it doesn't give you those body highs and those head highs it just gives you sort of like pain relief um you can't make this [ __ ] up and these people are making the rules for taste i'm not that impressed i've got to be honest this is beautiful it's cured good it's flavorful um but that's it it's pretty unremarkable otherwise um so if zero sucks and 20 is the best that puts 10 at average [Music] and that's where i'm liable to go with this is 10 so time out for a minute i will spare you the awkward time lapse footage because all i'm gonna do is go kick it in the hotel room for a minute and then i'll come back and let you guys know how i feel so it's been about 20 minutes and i am totally locked to this bed my eyes are oh they're real squinty um definitely a in the colleen hybrid because it says hybrid on the bottle look i'm so high i'm looking at there's there's no bottle over there but i looked for it anyway in terms of effect man i'm so zoned and chill um so effect we're gonna go ahead and say 18. it's it's a good stoney chill relaxing weed um i feel very just centered and calm and ready to end this video i'm not even gonna do the math now i'm just i'm not i'm gonna do it later there's this thing called post-production and uh we'll add it in there um yeah i like it definitely not on the extraordinary level um lost points on that taste you that was just ugh i don't know you know it didn't suck but it definitely didn't taste uh the way the way i would have liked it to touch too harsh too [Music] but worth it for this nice feeling so i'm gonna zone out for the rest of uh well for the rest of the night here we'll catch you guys on the flip side and right now we're going to move on to this fun little video of cats [Music] i'm the commander in keith and i approve this message visit platoon420.com today and take the pledge i will stand tall in the face of tyranny for the best interest of myself and my community i denounced the archaic drug laws that have made victims of people they were written to protect and i will not support any legislation that regulates what a person puts in their body", "lJiPy5klbRY": "cooking with kids and we're gonna do apple fritter love today we have first of all we mixed two um a third cup of brown sugar and one teaspoon of cinnamon into this mixture and it's going to be in between the layers of the loaf i already turned my oven on to 350 so it's preheating i've taken my two pans i am going to use two pans that are three inches by six and three-fourths and then at the bottom of them after i've sprayed them with an oil i put a parchment paper paper on the bottom because that helps it come out even easier you could also use a four inch by eight inch look too but that would make one this one makes two she's going to take the granny smith apples that we like to use they're kind of tart and use our apple master to slice the apple it slices and peels at the same time um if you don't want to have if you want to have the skin you can just take this part off and it will still core it and then slice it this is a great way for kids to have a snack of apples in the afternoon see how it's coming out kind of like a spiral like that very good and then she's going to take the core off push that in the back and right in there in the middle kids love to eat these slices okay what she's my helper's going to do is she's going to cut these in small bits like this not just a half of it but so it's small bits because it'll bake better in the loaf pan like that this recipe came from casey burgess inside the bowl is one tablespoon sugar with one teaspoon of cinnamon and she's gonna put this these apples into the air and kind of mix it up the next step which is adding the one stick of butter which is a half cup with two thirds cup of sugar make sure you pull it apart no shells get in there there you go the next step is you want to combine this is one and a half cups of flour wait a minute and you want to add this which is the one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and you want to whisk it up a little bit before you add it to the batter that to the batter now you want to add the milk as it's moving mix the sides of the bowl so everything goes down and incorporates we're going to take the batter and what i like to do is i know that this is going to be done for two of them and half and half so you're going to go kind of go half and then half so she's going to take and put that at the bottom now half of that just half of that there you go good next we have these two apples and it's going to put a fourth of the apples on one layer fourth cup it seems to work out and a fourth on the other layer and then you want to take the spatula and push them down so they're nice and flat i'll do one and she can do the other and kind of make sure they're evenly spread then on this one i'm going to show you i'm going to take a fourth of it and pull it out over it about three teaspoons full this is layering and so the more layers you do the more flavor it will have next it's the batter again so you're going to take half of this and for each one i'll hold it up for her i think i think we should do a little bit more on this side do you think second time we're going to add another batch of apples to the top and we'll just use all the rest of the apples kind of evenly and then of course the cinnamon sugar goes on top of that and then we'll bake it in our 350 degree oven for anywhere from 50 to 55 minutes it for these size pans it seemed like they were done at 50 minutes those look good yeah can't wait to try this now we're going we have two that are done with you can tell the brown sugar and cinnamons on top we have half a cup of powdered sugar with about two to three tablespoons you can use cream or you can use milk or even half and half so we're going to pour this the couple tablespoons or three into this powdered sugar and this is going to make the glaze for the top of this next she's going to take these and she's going to put a knife all around the outside very carefully so that it will come back on my board and we're going to take it out of the pan and as you can see it just comes out so beautifully with that parchment paper underneath and there's the first one you can do the next one wow that smells really good [Music] there's our two loaves and we're gonna drizzle this uh wonderful glaze on top it looks delicious slice it and try it would you like to try one yes okay it's perfect and i like how the outside crest part is crispy a little bit and the cinnamon and sugar and the apples i think that part was delicious it's delicious very moist and the cream and the cream it's delicious the apples in the middle is what makes it and i love their", "neqZ7JoA65g": "let's make apple fritters for the fritters you'll need 1 cup of all-purpose flour 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder 3 tablespoons of granulated

see which is the apple fritter or in other words a cake okay people here's your extreme close up of these three awesome doughnuts here's your cherry sprinkle lots of sprinkles I guess it's the cherry icing on a regular donut that looks fantastic then we've got our normal glazed donut look at all that icing it's just crystallized perfectly on there and then we've got this meteor right let's call it of a apple fritter wow I bet to have a whole Apple in there let's find out okay I'm going to go for the glazed doughnut first because it is still warm right out of the VAT I guess oh my gosh super sauce just squashed right down Wow look at that holy schnike e that is like perfect Oh check it out oh I'm sorry but this is a fantastic fresh made doughnut and I need to enjoy it let's have another bite mmm I got you the whole thing screw the speedup part so a bunch of people told me got to come the Shipley's because they make great doughnuts and they weren't lying these are great doughnuts I'm going to do this special bite before even getting to the other doughnuts I need to finish this one off right now this one goes out to all my 12 o'clock in the afternoon people watch just a 12 o'clock in the afternoon and want a doughnut come over to Shipley's and check out especially the plain one so far huh just wrap the car I don't care let's do a little review of their coffee I put a little sugar in it and they have like I'm one of those coffee make cream things and I put that in there so it's okay nothing crazy special about the coffee but it's good all right let's go into this she I said oh give me the red one just because it's a red doughnut and it looks like a lot of fun to eat and asks you put it in the bag she's like you wanted the cherry one right and I'm like oh it's cherry but she already put in the bag so it's my fault I should have asked her what kind is that the red doughnut I just figured it is this a normal normal doughnut with just right icing on just to attract the children and me apparently okay let's take a bite super fresh but look at that ma'am it is like perfect do I taste the cherry really really slight which is good I was kind of worried about it being overpowering cherry so that is a fine doughnut they should called the Bearpaw look at it mm-hmm all right let's go and hopefully get Apple on the first bite mm-hmm mm-hmm Stan mm apple sugar doughnut holy cow I'm gonna need an insulin shot where's my EpiPen get me that be bad you make a fantastic doughnut if you're in Galveston come on down to Shelly's doughnuts I'm gonna polish these off just for you all right hang on scratch sniff the rest is mine there you go ladies and gentlemen not done Wow I started getting a head rush we started feeling a little woozy because it's like sugar sugar sugar coffee okay guys I apologize there's no way I can finish this without suffering some type of a cardiac arrest all right on my rating scale I'm gonna give Shipley's donuts or Shipley doughnuts uh I'm going to give their plain glazed doughnut I go out and get it now obviously nice freshly made warm glazed doughnuts are the bomb the cherry I guess that would be the cherry sprinkled donut I would give that a recommend again I probably wouldn't buy that one again over the other one so it's a recommend tasted grade-a taste I had that little tiny slight hint of cherry perfect and the apple fritter if you buy that it is definitely a would recommend but you know share it with a friend that maybe isn't diabetic all right guy and the coffee was uh if I was to come here for a donut

"ulG8yrWG8KU": "hi again so now we are ready to go on to our next dessert basically I chose today to make videos because they're in this quarantine there's nothing else to do so I figured my brothers on this thing now's the time to start making video so I'm like okay so let me make a video so now I have another tum sweet it's a little dessert video this one is also a freezer friendly I'm trying to make videos that are freezer friendly because everybody's home and trying to help other mothers try and do something that they can prepare ahead of time put in the store in their freezer and when they're ready for a quick snack or something you know they it's the process of being in the kitchen because let's be room sometimes we get it's hard of being in the kitchen I love the kitchen but there are moments that I get tired of being in the kitchen so I try to prepare things ahead of time so um this one is like the other video the other one was the fried cheesecake this one we're using the same you see behind me the same pastry it's gonna be like spring rolls but well the same pastry of it but inside I'm filling it with homemade apple pie filling now I'm not going to go through all the steps of making the homemade apple pie filling because I already have a video on it now if you go to my video where it shows apple pie homemade apple pie I'm using that same recipe for the filling that I'm putting here the only thing that I would tell you to do is maybe add a little bit more cornstarch to make the consistency of the syrup to be thicker so that when you put it inside here it's not as a liquidy you don't want it as liquidy because since you're filling this up you don't it's gonna be a mess when you try to fry it so don't do that okay before I'm using spring roll pastry this is the ones that you use for egg rolls spring rolls and looks like cheese they stuff cheese cheese wraps and stuff so yeah I'm using them this is this is the large size but they have the mini ones I'm using the large size and here I have it like I told you this is my apple pie you see I'm gonna try to you see here cuz I still had it in the fridge so it's thick so I'm gonna try to use the parts that don't have too much sauce okay so here I have two it's the same concept you're gonna put it at an angle in front of you okay then you're going to take it you fill this up as much as you want see my husband he loves apple pie so make him some happen - that's what we're doing right now apple pie fritters okay you're gonna take this now this you have to make sure that you seal this really good okay he's already going to then you're gonna wrap this over same thing with this side bring this part over wrap this here okay let's eat egg wash and put the egg wash here here's the only difference with this the difference with this one and the Cheesecake is the Cheesecake you can you could put it in the deep fryer and a fryer right away this one I don't recommend that you fry right away why because they had that liquid and since the liquid was at room temperature because I had it in my food as you go I'm going to I wanted to freeze solid before I put it to fry because I do not want any of the apple pie mixture to come out it's already it's already soft and a little mushy okay because and not not not mushy it's already you see the pastry here it's already wet I want this to be solid before I put it to fry so again I'm gonna take it put it here see like that one has enough so I'm gonna meet with more apple slices I don't recommend for you to use just a can of apple pie fully known go through the hard work and just do it yourself it's always better when you make it yourself besides the one in the can is more liquidy for what you need it for KBR again wrap this over remember it was at an angle wrap this side here over flip this over can you see is nice and wet that's why we want to freeze it okay gonna take this what we're gonna do we're gonna put it over remember okay now this here you don't have to really worry about it because since we are gonna deep freeze it I'm pretty sure if you feel like some juice can come out of here then definitely see today that's what I'm doing right here sealing it seal it aside so for this container here I would say I'm gonna make a good 12 okay so I'm gonna put in the D freezer for like I just I like to have your food frozen solid so just do it the day before I guess put me in a freezer and then fry it so I'm gonna say later on tonight I'll fry it also I want to show you another idea because these are very thin but if you want that extra crisp to it this is the first wrap that I'm doing I'm gonna double wrap this one so I'm gonna wrap it here use my egg so silly take it wrap it again then see anything down the seam side down I'm gonna do the same thing only difference is that I'm gonna use some egg here so thank you mini the wrapkin green you're here to it you see how you see how I just I'm here to it okay these things they stick to each other well they come like that but I promise you it seems like they're so fragile they're definitely gonna break but it's not gonna break it here we go so now I'm gonna wrap this over actually sorry flip it over one more time no matter bring this over here bring this one over here this is a double wrap actually for these they will be better in a double wrap would be better instead of a single wrap so you see the ones the two that I did before I'm gonna go ahead and double wrap them okay okay guys so it's been a few hours I have my pot here on your frying pan here and I have my fried apple my apple fritter okay apple pie swimming okay so um you need a paper towel wanna paint on the side also grab some spinner man and some sugar mix it around you gotta get you all your to be really really hot I remember what I told you try to have your um your look sorry okay so now when I you do not want anything to be sticking I'm also gonna be using some whipping cream you can also have some ice cream it would taste so good with ice cream so basically we're gonna do you just want this to be really really hot and then I'm recording go you want this to be really high you see I put a little piece there just to test it to make sure it's very hot I'm putting it in you're just frying it okay that's holding right now leave it there I'm gonna take out okay so now I'm ready to flip it over check the other side and again your fire has to be high but this has to be high Z my fire is pretty high fry until golden okay so now is nice and crispy see nothing spilled out so it's definitely best to double wrap it change it off put it on the side took our naughty cooldown Steven I can make it now I'm gonna take my cinnamon sugar sprinkle it C like so you could do one side both sides as matter you can also just take this and put it in the bowl now if you have vanilla ice cream mmm it's like warm apple pie but we don't have that we have whipped cream so this is what a minute to whipped cream hey you hear that that's how crispy is okay so let's break it so my whipped cream cool let's take a bite so good take a warm apple pie and then that nice whipped cream on top tastes really good so don't forget to hit like and subscribe and stay tuned", "95NLDR566EU": "[Music] back to my cup of flour so this is one half of sugar so i use the brown sugar um you can use also the

it's been uh quite a long time since uh i made a video so i wanted to do a little update on this round of the 3x310 um i know i did a video way back of getting this whole thing set up but um you know i've been honestly very busy in life and uh this has been on the back burner once again but this time obviously it's not going to get hot and i'm liking the separation on the space here we got the only issue i'm dealing with is a little lack of nutrients you know i've been feeding them a little too light as you can see i've been keeping it right at like 900 so obviously they're hungry gals they do need some nutrients so yeah i'm gonna get their their flower regimen all squared away but they're at about almost three weeks um you know obviously we got a lot of strains if you remember everything is kind of uh looking a little different because of all the variety of strains you know what i mean but i mean everything's looking really good some of the hairs are even turning purple this early on um it's been very cool in here 77 up here um and then at night time i dropped the temp quite a bit so yeah it's uh it's going pretty well i just you know i wanted to fill everyone in and you know kind of uh apologize for the lack of updates but um you know i'm about to delete everything so i'm gonna give you guys a before and after and then you'll see how we do it so everything in here is never i actually like i said got really busy everything got on the back burner and you leaving was one thing that i was not able to do but you know there's always new techniques and different techniques and one technique uh that i have tried before is not touching any foliage until three weeks into flower and then completely cleaning them up that's what i usually like to do but usually i'll clean up a little bit prior on the very very bottom so yeah i'm going to go in this is the before and i'll show you guys the after when i'm done all right see you soon all right so you can see did quite a bit of do leafing cleaned up the bottoms very nicely and went in pretty hard on the top as you can see i have gone harder but this is probably just about what we're looking for so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to throw another level of trellis on here and uh i like to wait until the daily thing is a little easier to get my hands in there so i'll just drop it right on and kind of get all these ready but everything's looking really good i'll get a nice uh nutrient batch mixed up of uh probably something more in the 1200 1300 ppm range but um yeah everything's going really well so yeah i'm gonna wrap it up and uh i'll definitely be doing an update i won't leave you guys hanging completely on this whole series but um i definitely i'm not gonna be doing the weekly updates like the last round so i'll probably do another one in a few weeks um but uh yeah feel free to give it a thumbs up subscribe comment let me know uh any advice any questions uh yeah just i'm open to anything anyone has as far as questions and suggestions advice you know i'm not not gonna deny uh an open year so anyways uh that's it for now thanks for paying attention and uh checking with you soon

"e8XSjWqXOLc": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome back to the channel today is video number 16 and we are going to be looking at will tennyson's original recipe for an apple fritter doughnut i'll link his video down below i made a couple tweaks to make it a little bit lower in calorie and it still tastes absolutely phenomenal so i can't wait to share this with you guys for those who are new my name is jake and i love to provide content related to financials physical and mental health to help students and or individuals progress along their journey so without further ado let's hop into this amazing recipe and i'll see you in the dorm kitchen peace welcome back to the kitchen everybody let's hop right into this donut so the first ingredient you're going to need is some flour you're just going to use a fifth of a cup and or 30 grams of this normal all-white all-purpose flour so i set my trusty food scale and weigh out 30 grams the next ingredient you're going to need is 30 grams of protein powder and this can be any flavor of your choice but preferably go with a vanilla or a cinnamon variation if you have any i am using this quest cinnamon crunch and it works perfect for this recipe so if you have that a cinnamon option available to you definitely go with it if not vanilla works just fine 24 grams of the swerve brown sugar me personally i've done research and found that there's just as much evidence showing that there are no unhealthy side effects of consuming these types of sugars so i'm comfortable using them but it is against your will i guess use brown sugar but that would change the total calories by doing this recipe so 24 grams of brown sugar the next ingredient is going to be a tablespoon of butter and this is where i make a micro change in the original recipe they just used normal butter which you can totally do but what i'm doing instead is using the light butter made with canola oil and you're going to use one tablespoon and or 14 grams teaspoon of salt be one teaspoon of baking powder so go ahead and throw that we're going to add some cinnamon and to be honest i don't really weigh this out i just kind of added them out to the desired flavor i want i would just kind of go like one two three and if you want a little bit more add a little bit more um i don't measure that just making that obvious now it is time to cut up a apple and throw your apple in so we've now added our dry ingredients to the bowl and you can go ahead and mix this up it's going to be a very dry consistency it's not going to be into a dough yet but just kind of basically coat the apples mix up the ingredients and just kind of get it to where i don't even know will describes it as a dry sand and i guess it's the best analogy i'll show you when mine's done it's kind of you kind of see what we're working with definitely not a doe but it is the foundation to what we're going to be using so now that we have our dry appley sand mixed go ahead and take some fat free greek yogurt and add 42 grams this is where it will kind of turn into a little bit more of a doughy fashion but what can be a little tricky about this and what you'll probably need to do is if you just use a spatula you're going to see you're still going to have all this dry oops sorry you can see you're still going to have all this dry sand consistency so the best thing is to get your hands dirty and just literally i know i know you don't want to do this but start really incorporating the ingredients together it's kind of dry and squeeze almost if you keep doing this after a couple of minutes they'll come into a dough and i'll show you when we're at that point now after a couple of minutes of just mixing it with your hand you can see we we now have a much more dough-like consistency wall so this is kind of what you want kind of squeeze it it's nice ball and your hand's gonna be a mess and at this point taste the batter see how it is it's delicious well the dough sorry it's delicious and now we're gonna turn these into two uh shapes of donuts and throw them on a cooking tray and i'll see you when we're there so hit it with some nonstick and then i usually just rub it around make sure we're good get paint cover with nonstick and then you're going to take your apple fritter you're just going to kind of shape it into the donut so i just kind of push it down a little bit kind of like form the edges so you just get a nice little donut shape like this and then place it down in the pan and then take the other remaining half and rinse and repeat now take your donuts and bake at 375 for five to ten minutes depending on how strong your oven is apple fritters are done um again bake at 375 and the time really depends i would just watch until they get a nice golden brown on the top for me it took around eight and a half minutes but mine kind of cooks a little bit faster my ninja foodie we're going to top them off with icing and there are multiple ways you can do this for me i'm going to use that same protein powder that i already showed you guys that cinnamon quest protein put a little bit like literally maybe a gram of it inside of a little bowl and then just add a little bit of water so you get like a nice i'll show you the consistency but you just want a nice glaze consistency and then with that glaze you can just pour it on top and voila those are two apple fritter donuts done finish ready to go with the glaze you can do what i did with a protein powder you can use um the swerve confectioner's sugar if you have that it's more like a powdered sugar taste you could do anything you want you could do pb2 with a little bit of water and drizzle some peanut butter on the top get creative have fun with it make the donuts your own but without further ado let's have a little taste test [Music] we're now into the part that i'm most excited about which would be the taste test and just to give you a little bit of reference that whole entire batch those two donuts it's 375 calories total much lower in fat much higher in protein i'll put the macros on the screen right here so you can see please share this recipe with your friends give it a go leave a comment down below how you liked it i'm going to give my first bite right now so cheers to the apple fritter the healthy version so good you have to try this for yourself it is literally so good but that was today's video i look forward to seeing you next week let me know what you think and have a great week happy sunday peace out y'all", "bicPOnfprmI": "yo what's up friend of a dude here doing an update on the 3x3 we are at I believe the end now of day 20 right around 8:20 to day 21 so we're about three weeks in you can see everything's looking really good give you the full view so I'm really happy with the color that is looking you can tell that they're really stacking really nicely you know it's really good stacking and spacing going on really good progress honestly everything looks really good the only thing I got the light as high as I can go quite literally with that setup but I could engineer something to probably raise this up just a little bit higher you see I have a couple of inches right there so I'm trying to go a little bit higher because I measure I believe I'm at about 10 inches from the top of the canopy to the light so you can see it's pretty close it's very close actually you know it's only 2 2 hand lengths don't mind my broken hands but just to handlings basically to the top so it's pretty hot under here I even have this thermostat you can see it's the top of the canopy is pretty hot around 86 degrees but it seems to do alright obviously everything is still healthy really bushy so I'm gonna come in here actually and do you leave a lot it's around the time where I do leave right around three weeks in so probably tonight indoor tomorrow morning I'm gonna maybe even right after I make this video come in and dilip everything this time I'm not gonna go as hard is the last round but I do to leave quite a bit and then I'll also clean up the bottoms a lot of this stuff you know some ugly-looking growth that's not getting any light you can see I got that one LED still going so I figured it works I took the other one out so if it works then cool you know see how it goes everything's going good down here it is on automated watering and it's watering twice a day once the lights come on at 9:00 and then it waters at 10:00 and then I have it water again at 4:00 a.m. so trying to space it out I'm actually about to do three waterings because when the lights are about to turn off the plants are you know pretty light they are definitely soaking in all the water so back to the game plan we're gonna come in here and do leap everything and then I'm gonna put another layer of trellis which I haven't done yet just so it would be easier to do leaf put another layer of trellis slide it down on top because they're not going to stretch any more and yeah support for this round everything's looking really good though like I said I haven't seen any bugs haven't seen any nutrient problems haven't even seen any issues from the light being too close I was kind of concerned but oh yeah one thing I did want to mention too I ended up changing up like I said in the last video I changed the tent so it's on positive pressure instead of negative pressure so I had this powerful pin right there I had it originally up top and then I had this light computer fan style thing that was down here so I swapped them so now the big fan is sucking in air into the bottom which you know might not be the best design because it goes straight to the reservoir but either way pushes in the cooled air which eventually rises up with the hot air I think it sucked in through that vent right there which pushes into the carbon filter so that's the new setup it's creating a positive pressure I like it more from a positive pressure standpoint you know I I'm not sure the temps still are pretty hot like I said 86 but everything looks really good so I'm not really too concerned about it and that is just right underneath the light if you go over here I'm sure it would drop significantly so anyway it's gonna do leave everything to spread out that like everything's going good we're still probably only had a thousand PBMs on the nutrients but yeah this tent is rocking I mean I had someone asked me the other day they sold this tent as a kid but I know this is not a kid this is just what my setup has looked like after multiple runs and dialing it in figuring out what works for a small setup so yeah that's basically it for the week this is the apple fritter all of it 3x3 with the growers choice CMH set to super lumen right now but it is the 3:15 and yeah that's it so I'll be back to do another update here very shortly but I'm very excited this round looks like it's gonna be way better than the last round as far as quantity is concerned but also health to these plants are looking way healthier than the last round of plants and if I don't over strip them like I did last time then I think they'll be a-okay so that's it for me signing out with the broken hand hope has a good day and stick around for the future videos", "JCHnclO36Fg": "yo what's going on guys intro bringing you a new youtube video if you guys give me a huge favorite like comment subscribe to this video comment down below what you're smoking on make sure you turn on post notifications so you would never miss a video once we hit 1k supporters we're going to be giving away 50 dollars so make sure you guys stay tuned for that let's get right into the video but today you guys we are going to be doing some push cards we are going to be doing the apple flitter i do want to say a couple of things about these cards i have smoked a couple of them and i have tried a couple of them and i do want to tell you guys the downside to these cards and what i do not like and what i like about them but tell you the downsides and what i do not like you know because these cards have a lot of things that i do not like and review the flavor from one to ten i have smoked different push carts before and i want to tell you guys down things that i do not like about and what is it about the cart that i do not like so i'm just gonna open this up right here like i said you guys if you guys want to verify that and know if it's real you guys can scan it right there but as you guys can see i'm gonna peel this off and once you peel it off the sticker should stick on like this i pulled it all the way off but the sticker should stick on to like right there like that the lettering and we're gonna open this up and i do want to tell you guys a couple of things about these cards and say what i'd not like about one that the oil of the wax moves quite fast you know you guys i'm gonna say that right off the bat as you guys can see look at the oil it moves quite fast a little faster than the krtz you know but the characters don't even move or the mohammed's don't even move but these you can tell when they move especially when you hit them it gets really hot and yeah you guys the wack starts moving like crazy but that's one thing i do not like about these cards when you're taking many hits and you're doing consistent hits you know of course the wax is going to come out of the freaking circle where you inhale right but once you stop you know smoking it some of the wax stays stuck onto like the cart of the tip and you can see right through it as you guys can see you guys this is like see-through you can see right through it but you can see the wax later on when you're emptying the cart you can see the wax stuck onto the edge of the tips of right here like everything around where my finger is as you guys can see everything around this whole part you can see and i'm gonna show you guys what i mean in a little bit but as always yeah we're gonna review the flavor from one to ten high white flavor-wise and i like how the wax moves fast you know and i do not like how the center inside the wax stay stuck onto the tip you know the wax um smoke it reflects and turns into a wax on the tip see but i'm gonna take a couple hits you guys let's just get right into it this is a apple flare review let's get it it tastes kind of weird hey guys it tastes [ __ ] weird i'm not like it does not taste like apple but see what i mean by the wax moving fast like let me show you guys that's what i mean by the wax moving fast the wax is running quite fast we're gonna take another hit but the waxes went quite fast i could see it in my screen i might i don't know if you guys can tell on camera i'm gonna take another hit it does not taste like apple flare i'm already telling you the flavor is disgusting is zero out of ten i do not like it tastes like nothing near apple flavor normally it tastes like a tropical you know and just tastes awfully disgusting you guys and i don't like it but now the high is like whatever i guess it could be a 6 out of 10 but the flavor is really disgusting i don't know i like it this is the downside to these cards and i like these pushcarts are not okay you know i don't know like um so far i smoked a couple of them and i like i have reviews on those i will be uploading those sometime soon but i'm not sure when but i want to show you guys this one in particular because i've already smoked a lot of them and i want to you know give my honest opinions about these and these are not going good for me you guys i'm being real with y'all and i like them much but we're gonna take another hair you guys make sure you guys have that wax out and yeah just know i'm not enjoying this hit [ __ ] it yep kind of does taste this [ __ ] raw apple not gonna [ __ ] lie you guys but this was the apple flare review guys i do not like it and the high is six out of ten like i said and the flavor is zero out of ten i don't know i like it this [ __ ] is wack i'm not gonna lie these push cards i'm not liking them you guys i'm just being real with y'all i have smoked a couple of them there's only one that i kind of did like but overall it's still [ __ ] i do want to say that it's been a couple hours since i last said that word yeah [ __ ] the last one you guys heard me say was [ __ ] from the last clip that cut off but it's been a couple hours like i'll say five out of four hours i'm not sure like to say six max no more but as you guys can see i smoked a lot of it not really i've been normally [ __ ] around with it i do not like this car i like the way apple flair tastes it tastes really disgusting you guys literally look at this you guys so did you get remember i told you guys earlier in the video that the wax stays stuck onto the the cart into the tip right here yeah you guys right there look at the cart on the tip i do want to show you guys the q-tip right there but look i'll put the q-tip and you can tell and there's wax right there like see look it's just and another thing to look i'm gonna show you guys that i'm just gonna press the button and you guys gonna see it preheat hopefully you guys could see that as you guys can see that right you see that preheats and but overall i'm not [ __ ] with this or these cards really you know i don't like them the wax moves fast i'm gonna do a time lapse and see how fast it moves even though i'm talking right now it's gonna be moving quite fast i'm not gonna lie i do not like these kind of cards but as you guys can tell these cards are practically most likely fake when they move fast like this you guys get the melody you guys the [ __ ] wax moves fast as hell i do not [ __ ] with these cards overall letting you guys know i do not like them i don't know like it's hard practically with smoking them i've just been pressing it and letting the wax freaking hit like that you know as you guys can see look at it the smoke is coming out as i'm pressing the button right but i'm not inhaling that or nothing not hypothetically i was smoking it i was smoking a little bit of it just to get slightly a little high but as you guys can see there's a bunch of wax stuck onto the tip inside the cart and that wax stays stuck into your mouth when you're inhaling you guys and i'm not like that [ __ ] i don't [ __ ] with these cards i don't like them i would say let's do one more blinky when i end this video but we're not going to take any more blinkers because i do not want to feel that [ __ ] nasty taste in my mouth but just for the video i guess i'll do blinker you know [ __ ] it it is most likely a fake heart it is a counterfeit and i like these cards this is the first time i've ever tried them if this brand if you ever smoked this brand let me know if you guys ran into this kind of counterfeit or do you guys have this kind of problem you know in the comment section below if you smoke this kind of cart or this you know whatever you want to call it you know push carts you know it's just yeah prophetic i don't [ __ ] like them this is my first time ever trying them and i don't like them [ __ ] that let's just do the blinker i guess [ __ ] it there's no it's not bad you know you guys as i'm taking it but it's just i don't like [ __ ] smoking cards that wax moves fast because the oil is not thick it is not good if it's not good i don't want to smoke it but we're just gonna do it [ __ ] it let's get it i peed my lungs it takes nasty you guys spit in the toilet right there you guys but i hope you guys have a safe and amazing day stay blessed don't stress as always peace the [ __ ] out subscribe notifications on", "MZK_Ek-fVXU": "hey roadiefootyfam we back with another video

out of its shell till shy come here and i believe that that's just i believe they're like you know what this needs guys there's somebody in a mcdonald's corporate office you know what that needs it needs sugar on top all right okay here we go and boom i don't know if that's a lot of blueberries or not enough blueberries maybe the blueberries are just on the outskirts i don't know again i'm not a muffin guy here we go everybody knows the rules right down the hatch that's some extra sugar on top not a bad consistency though i'm a dipper guys if i had a cup of milk right now or some hot chocolate oh god and some of you guys are probably like dude it's snowing out why are you drinking ice coffee guys it's a new england thing i can't explain it i thought it was weird here too when i

you are okay i was afraid this was my fear that it was gonna be dry this is not dry they actually okay well let's see how it tastes first before we get before we start popping the champagne skis see it's always an internal battle with these fast food places guys where am i coming in with such a not a low bar but like you know don't get your expectations up so that when it's actually pretty decent it gives it a higher hold on let me take another bite oh my god i i do i do wreck oh my god look at this guys look at that look at all that just straight up going this the outside of it is a little harder that's what i'm trying to like i'm gonna take this bite right here that's that seems to be that seems to be its own little money bite here we go don't hatch guys for a fast food for a fast food mcdonald's cinnamon roll it's not bad it's not bad and i like that when this came out it actually came out warm so i don't know if they have them warm or they just throw them in the quit in the mikey real quick i don't know what they do this is actually not bad all right let's do the money bite and then the review over for the folks that are here for just for the review this will be it for you and then i can just talk to my foodie fam my roadie foodie fam here we go wow oh my god i thought they were gonna skimp i'm not gonna lie to you guys i thought they were gonna skimp they did it all right muffin baby boat a little piece of this frit i call this the roadie foodie pastry breakfast here we go a little bit of everything get get all the mcdonald's pastry in your mouth everybody here may the next two months of this 2020 crazy freaking year be positive and it makes up for the last 10. cheers as a sugary bite the crazy thing is that i can taste every individual thing in there which is pretty cool all right so if you're here for the review hopefully you liked it thumbs up uh subscribe if you want to join all the fun we do daily videos up in here sometimes we do two videos a day sometimes it's either two videos or a video and a live like i think i'm gonna do a live later on today uh maybe a live tomorrow also there's some new uh new cocktails that i want to try with the roadie foodie family uh with you guys so uh make sure you tune on that here we go down the hatch also a new snack crate just came out they just sent me a new snack crate so we have to figure out what country that is also comment down below guys if you if you like those live or if you want me to do a video video style wow super struggling that's just where it's at that's what's up hmm all right thank you so much for coming now to my ready footy fam this is for the subscribers for the folks that are the day ones the ones that sticking with us um it's it's snowing here like i said at the beginning of the video so i'm gonna have to kind of judge how because this will be our first winter uh doing roadie foodie youtube uh right now it's not bad i got a jacket on it's not too cold before i turn turned off the car to do the video i did see that it was about um it was like in the 30s it was like low 30s like 32 31 30 degrees so not too bad and people like people are probably like dude what do you talk like people from other parts of the country like that's freezing it is but like when you live in uh where it snows a lot especially in the northeast in the new england area um it's not cold cold until it gets cold cold so right now this isn't too bad i actually just a t-shirt and a super light jacket but it's lined though so i don't feel too bad in here i do have sneakers on but i'm starting to feel like it's starting to hit my toes a little bit so we'll have to figure out guys uh if the reason i like doing the the car videos too is because i can get the food park somewhere and like just do a super fast video uh more importantly because the food is nice and warm and it's you know just coming out so that's perfectionation um for um and you know if i was to bring all the way home it might lose some of its integrity but we'll figure it out i think i can still do this as long as i probably wear boots and you know if it starts getting chillier i might have to wear like a flannel underneath the jacket uh but yeah it's getting a little chilly in here right now um but i i do know that we had talked about a little bit uh earlier that i want to start doing some cooking at home so i i got a couple cookbooks again if you guys have any really cool cookbooks uh message down below uh there's some uh i already have a couple from like what's gabby cooking uh chrissy teigen um which i had a couple people hate on her they're like not her book and i'm like the recipes look bomb i don't know here's the thing about life guys do it yourself you have to experience things yourself if someone would have told me a long time ago not to try sushi i probably would have never tried it and i would have never found my love of sushi so whatever in this world try it i always give everything three tries if i hate something i try it again sometimes i hate it a little bit more sometimes i hate a little less third time i know definitively by then no go and then it's basically my three times three rolls i'll wait like three years because your taste buds change every seven years so i'll wait three years before trying it again uh one thing that i still can't get used to is like black licorice taste stuff there's just something with it um and then like sambuca and uh all my colombian friends who love aguadente i just i can't do that black licorice stuff and even the candy i just can't do it so i'll wait another three years i think my three years is coming up next year on uh on those type of things but again i don't know if it's gonna happen um so yeah guys we'll do some more lives uh definitely uh we had a lot of fun last tuesday i think we did uh uh thirsty tuesdays maybe we'll do a thirsty thursdays i don't know we'll figure it out um we try to do the lives at different times of the day so maybe one in the morning afternoon one late night one after dinner time or after work time just to try to catch everybody but i really like doing those so that's it let's kind of myself and the foodie fam connect with you guys and i think that we have uh doing a video with camilla this weekend one with margarita lindsay's been completely busy so if you guys don't know who lindsay is lindsay is one of the foodie fan members but she's also a local tv personality so with everything going on with the election and she's just going crazy as now now that we have like inclement weather she's out doing that stuff all um so reporting on all that stuff so um but we'll get her more in in tune but um we love you guys we're on our way to 2700 um i think we're like 50 away or something like that so we'll get there and i hope that you guys are all safe if you're in the new england area just drive slow everyone forgets always how to drive and snow for like the first two weeks and then everyone gets their bearings it's like i wish everyone would just start from the top the top but until next time guys uh be well eat well and take care of each other ciao", "cGb114zonSU": "what's up everybody review time with tim today i'm bringing a fast food review the mcdonald's apple fritter subscribe to my channel smash the likes okay comments always welcome let's get into today's review [Music] all right so uh mcdonald's apple fritter breakfast menu mcdonald's is always expanding their breakfast menus and now they have the apple fritter wrong with the black blueberry muffin and the cinnamon roll today i decided to test out the apple fritter i've had many different other apple fritters over time uh you know like gas station ones you know quick easy grab-and-go some of them have actually been pretty good um you know dunkin or dunkin donuts uh i've had other ones before that have been pretty decent probably the best apple fritter that i can compare it to is uh cognin's donuts in wells maine oh it is the holy grail probably of donuts so if you're ever in wells maine check out cognins donuts oh my god they're donuts all handmade amazing amazing toppings but anyway their apple fritters are delicious best they've ever had so here it is the mcdonald's apple fritter it was about 250 for it so not overly expensive uh it's not super super big either it has that classic fried taste and the the smell of the glazing is on it the only thing is i'm not really seeing is i'm not really seeing chunks not seeing any chunks of apple so hopefully maybe they're inside all right so uh all right let's take a couple bites and give it a score [Music] right there see a piece of apple right there it's pretty comparable to your basic mass-produced apple fritter that you get um i'm gonna compare this apple fritter taste to the one you might get i don't know if anybody has this gas station but like a cumberland farms gas station or even maybe a 7-eleven gas station apple fritter you know it's that quick grab-and-go you know you're going to be hungry in an hour after you're done eating it um you know it's got all the taste it's got it's got the apple flavor it's got the obviously the frosting and you can taste uh the cinnamon and um it's well done there could be a little bit better apple chunks the apples that are in this are the same apples that they put it tastes like the same apples they put in their uh little apple pies that you get so it kind of has that apple pie mcdonald's apple pie taste to it to the apple i could taste that apple pie piece so for today and you know it cost two dollars and fifty cents [Music] um so what am i gonna give it for a score today uh today it is gonna get a 5 out of 10. so 5 out of 10 uh kind of generic basic simple nothing over the top to rave about but it's not not awful but you know straight dab in the middle 5 out of 10. all right take care everybody", "_DCc9X8zv7Y": "today why why is that Frank of why why's that review of another edition of C Mon Jean machina we're gonna eat in the car now when I friend I'm just gonna call him out mr. Elio who's been a auto hauling specialist for the past 25 years recommend something any driver recommends something you should go because you got to remember these men and women live on the streets

from a bakery in Maple by the name of maple bakery you have to try it the first thing I gotta give is this thing is massive wow it is huge compliments to maple bakery for making like okay it was expensive it was 350 but listen don't get me wrong look at the size of this thing it's probably two doughnuts in one like it's a size of my hand it's a mini football you could play football with it

Park today was the release of the new Saratoga National Park Service Quarter and they're doing a live event in Scarborough where the National Park is and we can't attend it but they have it online for free so we are watching that as part of our near state history for school today I was calling my hair and look like I found in my hair it's a white hair the kids are making me old do you see any more in there Pete or was there only just that one anymore no mr. jokester yeah I hear he woodpecker a tower suet cedar I've seen I don't think I've ever seen a herring in our house today was our the start of our bird count we've had three chickadees one downy woodpecker one Hospital in Blue Jays three tip mice one hairy woodpecker one nut hatch and tooth goldfinches so far it actually has been really warm yesterday and today which usually the birds don't come in to the feeders nearly as much when it's warm out as when it's cold so I don't expect that fabulous Bird Count tonight but at least we got started and we'll be able to submit the data into Cornell Mary and Lydia and myself are all doing school work my mommy's on the computer I don't know what she's doing I don't know if she's doing what are you doing my mommy is talking to all of you guys but what are you doing on the cookie yeah reading your comments are you take the washcloth and wash the apples with the washcloth the price so keep it in okay let's not make a mess yeah yes not messes aren't really helpful okay keep it in the pot put the Apple in how do we roll up your sleeves first so they don't get all right love you sleaze all right there we go now we won't get wet these we don't like why why are we doing what why are we watching the Apple oh oh we don't understand we're watching the apples to get them clean so then we can cook with them right cook with them no we're not making apple sauce as you just heard mary has discovered a new word why mom it's funny how when all the kids hit this stage it suddenly everything is why but it's good because it's just a sign of developmental growth anyways to answer the question why why are we watching the apples he's what didn't you guys had you guys had done a video on apple fritter bread and then looked fabulous so I went found the recipe and I'm gonna try it out after a robic exercising of patience and trying to get this bread done it's finally ready to go in the oven

or apple turnover in sort of um english terms so let's give it a go bit messy though okay so those apples they're like granny apples or smith apples or something when they cook it it comes all battered and then they let it dry out and then the apple starts um getting a bit softer that is good it's like the um the dough is like a donut you get sort of like a fairground ride or something you know those sort of donut places that you that you go to and it's just got apple inside of it and because it's apple flat season you've got to get involved yeah so fake big bits are happening i'm not a huge apple fan myself like i don't know apple pie can be good when i was a kid i used to fear apples now i don't fear apples anymore so [Music] i'm over it i don't know what it was uh this big hard

strange who parked me if you'd like through truthers it's not dairy or food product review three people we have a Kroger apple fritter I got it for 65 pennies so we picked up our breakfast today people we got herself a 65 cent apple fritter and we got herself a 79 penny Kroger water we spent a dollar forty four cents altogether and we're ready to start today weather or breakfast now paper I've had apple fritters in the past but it's been three to four years ago so I thought why not get an apple fritter from my local Kroger here in Corbin Kentucky and see what it's all about so we've got herself an apple fritter here people and we're pretty pumped to see if it's any good so as always guys remember for everything like read the box and of course select review gotta leave a comment below if we like that color we're gonna picking out review your request next time now it looks like a cow patty people before we get started we got a bus Oh Oh Malcolm burst it inside my Hershey huh Malcolm oh that's what the ex-wife said that now she's like best it deep inside me Oh God that's what she said she said bust it they busted it may fill her up with a pack of Malcolm juice well here we go that's pretty big pretty big apple fritter I hear 7-eleven has amazing apple fritters the safe Kroger's has amazing Apple fears well I'm not gonna lie I think I'm a little bit disappointed here people you know I hate to say it I hope I'm wrong but I don't think this was baked fresh this morning I think this may be I left over apple fritter I think it might just be or maybe it's just not that good now is it horrible is it unedible know this this item doesn't make the Death Note people you know it's pretty close though I mean that is disappointing because I love Kroger's Donuts they have some good donuts never had one of their apple fritters before Oh if just just not a lot of flavor here people not a lot of that magic that I expect from a Kroger product it's passable it's not amazing it's still you know still sugaring and good stuff like that but not what it should be so it is disappointing now maybe it's just from this Kroger as I was always saying I'm sure every Kroger they probably have the same recipe I don't know how that works but I wonder if they actually make the donuts in the store anymore I wonder that too don't know if they do or not now I remember I guess it's mint I never I don't think I ever reviewed it or if I did review the item I forgot to report it or something I don't know but I mean I remember I bought I want it I bought an apple fritter from Walmart and it was absolutely amazing I was like oh my goodness this is nowhere near that and I hate to compare Walmart Kroger but that was the last time I had an apple fritter and that was I say it's been three or four years ago maybe even longer I don't know but this fall short it definitely falls short now I might go to say another Kroger tomorrow like say Barbourville or Barbara don't have a Kroger but say Middlesboro London or whatever a different one in the location it may be amazing I may buy one here again later on it may be amazing but this falls short it's still pretty good but it's not great 2.5 stars there we got people I think it's this right here here's what it is the apples don't have no flavor either that's pretty much it ain't much to say about it oh well croaker can always be amazing you know every store has their bad items the thing that bothers you most about this of course is this is the item that I think you know Kroger made yourselves and it fell short class the official review people as always thank you so much for watching it is what it is it is what it is just summed at this point about I really am I was looking forward to this you know but the water for progress good that's gonna be the official review people as always thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it remember to give the video a thumbs up because it helps the channel grow just like Michaels 12-inch BBC is probably going and growing right now inside the ex-wife's mouth give it a thumbs up we'll get right back to it tomorrow because we do it 365 days a year people until YouTube says otherwise we're gonna do it every day and the reason why I say that in some videos people is because I've seen channels disappear for no reason people I've watched in the past I've seen people lose monetization you just never know what can happen you never know what can happen even if you're a hundred percent perfect clean channel I've seen them disappear so it's just a strange

amount of ice that we've got in the reservoir we'll see if we need to top it off i'm pretty sure we're going to go ahead and top it off with some more ice probably two more 20 gallon reservoirs full of ice which is i don't know i haven't waited i'm guessing when i fill up that trash can it's approximately 60 to 80 pounds of ice based on like when i have 20 pound bags of ice i'm just guessing you know probably about 60 to 80 pounds so i'm gonna add another 150 or so pounds of ice and then yeah we'll go ahead and get the bud and the bags and finish prepping the rest of that [ __ ] san bueno [Music] what's up cv [Music] [Music] ready to wake yeah [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i fill this thing up almost all the way right and i do this i put about four to five of these

the ac at 62. ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] looking at the movies [Music] [Music] we pray to god [Applause] got that all the way open we got the booster pump on i think yeah the booster pump is plugged

seal with a little bit of iso sometimes when you collect the uh the higher micron stuff that's fluffier and you go up the uh the freeze dryer you'll get a little bit of um almost like backdraft sort of it's basically just a lighter fluffier ash and it wants to go towards the uh the vacuum the vacuum cloth and so it'll cause a little bit of the hash to stir up and so every once in a while if that happens you gotta wipe out the hatch from wherever it flies onto most of the time it just goes to the seal so you just wipe it off the inner part of the seal a little bit of alcohol every once in a while you'll get some that builds up in the shelves you can take the whole seal off the door wipe it down you can pull the shelving unit out of the whole pretty much freeze dryer chamber if you want and you can vacuum it out you can wipe it out [Music] i'll be doing a uh a little bit of a maintenance video on the freeze dryer um here in about a month [Music] during that time i'll show you guys how to disassemble the freeze dryer and inspect it in certain areas for certain things and then how to clean it and put it back together [Music] so i'm just hitting my seal that the door forms a really good seal and you make sure that you get into one vacuum [Music] and there we go [Music] take my cover off we'll put the cover back on a little bit [Music] come on [ __ ] get on there right

so day 42 a flower we're at six weeks and let's do a little update so right off the bat let me show you guys what everything is looking like it's probably the best example so where are we right now well last time you remember I was dealing with the light getting too close and also too much heat in the tent and basically you can still see it's affected these colas that are right underneath where the light was so for instance like this one you see all those white hairs and some of these awkward looking leaves that's all a heat stress right there so you can see the heat stress though and these nugs up here but then everything behind it it's kind of hard to tell and then everything in front of it is fine you know these they are a little of each stress that's why these little leaves started growing out and that was my bad I just let the temperatures getting too hot in here for too long they were in the 90s for about a week before I decided to do anything about it and it really just comes down to to laziness lack of motivation not carrying as much as I should so those are my my bad you know those are things I should have done but at the end of the day it's interesting to see how they're gonna turn out you know these nugs are just they're really not that frosty which is interesting so the ones that got affected are like this one this one half of this one and like this one and then some of these around it like these kind of like got half affected this one and then everything around that area seems to be doing okay so besides the heat damage you know everything else looks pretty good we go over here you can see everything looks like you can see that frost coming in again I think the heat damage affected all of the plants not just these couple right here these are just the ones that got the most of the damage and then everything else is you know kind of dealing with it definitely a bummer I've learned my lesson even though I have this to go KCU that him here now and I've learned my lesson I'm not a big fan of the positive pressure but I'm not trying to go back in here and do all this stuff right when I'm at the stage of flower so I'm just gonna rock it keeping the air conditioner cold you know we've been rocking 82 degrees so I'm okay with that so besides the issues that I dealt with a few weeks ago that I'm seeing the results of now one thing I'm thoroughly impressed with is the weight of this round I mean these dogs are just massive compared to my last round I mean this dog is chunky and this one's the one that's actually good quality you know so smells awesome that fritter is one of my favorites so yeah everything is really chunky but I guess that's what happens when you water three times a day so yeah everything's looking really good as far as wheat like I said all this in the back are fine give you a better idea and then they're here run doing half okay so the only thing is these middle ones which are the biggest but you know I'm just curious to see how they're gonna end up turnout because as of now they're just covered in white hairs not really in frost but they're still sticky I mean they got a little frost but nothing compared to these so that is the update for the week you know much of a lot to report you know the heat damage that was my bad I could have I could have avoided that by first of all I'm not letting it be 90 degrees in the tent for a week that was just laziness to be honest and also I could have raised the light sooner and you know there's a lot of things I could have done but at the end of the day this borough is just for fun I try not to take these growths too seriously anymore trying to take it serious enough so that I can get the product I want out of it so you know I like this tent because it's kind of like I set it forget it which is what I'm aiming for and this whole grow is trying to obtain a system that I can set up and they really not think about so you know we're working through some of the kinks here obviously a lot of people were saying I just get a bigger tent well you know that's an option but I'm just kind of working with what I got I'm not overthinking it too much and I know what I did wrong but yeah I just hope that this can help some other people know you know take it seriously otherwise you know you could have [ __ ] like this happen where you got these nugs that are not what you're looking for so I mean take it seriously and you'll get what you want out of it and if you don't take it seriously then quality will show so this is all going to be my personal hedge - that's why get extremely seriously but again you know you definitely should take it serious if if you want good quality it comes down to that so you know that was my bad I slipped up but you know everything looks like it'll come out okay in the surrounding areas so I'm excited for the next round because I'm really stoked on how the weight came out here and then also I'm excited to work on that quality without having the heat damaged so if I can get this kind of weight with the quality that I got in the last round I'm gonna be stoked so yeah that's it just doing a quick update and hope everyone has a good day we'll start flushing soon so I'll do another update in a couple of weeks or maybe about ten more days all right he saw", "hXX_ZQBqPqI": "good morning sunshine y'all that sounded kind of fake look i got i'm not a morning person but i got my coffee here and i'm trying to be peppy and yeah so really good morning if uh this is your first time seeing me hello i'm paisley welcome to my kitchen um i'm always kind of weird about these introductions and stumble a little bit but uh today i'm bringing you some breakfast inspiration in the form of waffles i got this really cool mini waffle maker for christmas and i've been having so much fun playing with it so i came up with like three kind of newish twists on waffles that's not just you know ordinary waffles this video is part of a small collaboration that's hosted by bethany from budget bethany and there are two other ladies joining us today um andrea and megan i will have all three of their channels linked down below y'all i'm really excited to see what breakfasts they've come up with and what they're bringing to the table today so when you're done here make sure you check my description box and go watch their videos give them some love and support thanks so much so what i've got going on here is my take on just an apple fritter which is my favorite kind of donut but anyways so we've got like an a basic pancake mix going on here with a couple other ingredients i will list the recipe down below in the description box [Music] this is a mini one it's heated up and ready to go give it a little spray i don't want to fill this completely up because you know how i was just usually i hear a little bit of a sizzle that's why i got quiet i'm like it's heated anyways i don't want to fill this completely up because i do want it to be a little more on the crunchy side like a an apple fritter is that's my favorite part are like the crunchy bits so we'll just play with this and see what happens that smells really good i was wafting that steam this way it smells really really good looks really good nice and kind of crispy another small spray i'll try this in just a minute for y'all so i could see how it turned out i like to help it out a little bit to spread i might have done a little bit too many apples but that's okay i really wanted to know that there was apples in here so i used like three fourths of a granny smith apple but because this is just half of a batch uh you might want to only use half of an apple y'all could see that super hot um gosh wow this really does taste very similar to an apple fritter it smells so good um if you would want to to make it even more like apple fritter you could just do like a glaze like a powdered sugar glaze oh this would be really good with that hmm i think i want to cook a little bit longer so maybe i could get some crispier edges but wow that's really really good you see the chunks of apple there hmm for the rest of the batch i did let them cook a little bit longer so they got that nice deep brown color and they were really crispy and so good oh this was this was my favorite out of all three of these waffles real quick easy mama breakfast mama's gonna win for the day because everyone's gonna love this uh you just use some cinnamon rolls any any brand any kind i just uh do the basic let's let that heat up for a minute i just do the uh basic store brand ones um already had breakfast but he was uh definitely excited about having some of this as like a brunch in just a few minutes will you meet him uh we're gonna do some cinnamon roll waffles ooh jimmy triathlon we've had this before they're really good just spray it and i just give my waffle iron a little help just by kind of flattening this out and also because it'll make it a little bit more crisp and it's so good there you go put it in the middle close it and it takes just a couple minutes to heat up on here so here we go here's the first one it's going to pop off of there that took about four minutes let's get this next one on i'll flatten it out even a little bit more than that what i did and i'm not usually personally a fan of these canned cinnamon rolls like this but y'all this just changes the whole thing the flatter you get it the crispier it's going to be so i do like these because they um i don't know maybe just because the texture is different and it's actually crisp they're so good oh this is a cream cheese icing which is my favorite i don't like i don't care for the buttercream run away roll all right oh come on now i wish i was going to go ahead and flatten all these which i will i think i'll just put them on this other side of my plate here make this a little bit quicker to go by there we go what i do i'm trying to find i'm going to set this right here on this other side because the heat from this will just heat this little icing packet all up our second one give it another little just a tiny spritz put this one down and it is best to go ahead and add the icing while the cinnamon roll is still a little warm that way it spreads and looks really yummy and gooey good morning bub what'd you say what you think thumbs up or thumbs down what what one down and one up why no not everybody's supposed to do that what is your opinion do you like it or you don't like it if you like it you give it a thumbs up if you don't like it thumbs down up way up let me see the thumb way up you guys all right this is a win [Laughter] hey y'all so i just threw everything into my mixing bowl um that's two cups of shredded uh like the hash brown potatoes at the bottom 3 4 cup of monterey jack cheese 3 4 cup of ham 2 eggs and just some salt pepper and garlic powder hello kitties hello [Music] [Music] here [Music] it's like steaming hot but so these turned out really well dave and i ate that first one and these next ones i did cook them a little bit longer just so they would crisp up a little bit more and kind of be a little bit more firm um and the spatula worked the best to get them off of there next time i may add um a third egg just to kind of make it combine and be just more uh what's the word i'm looking for just uh kind of more together but again these turned out fine um i did cook these ahead of time so we ate on these a couple mornings and y'all thanks for hanging out i really appreciate you so much make sure you check out the other breakfast videos that i have linked below and i also have the recipes that i kind of concocted all that'll be down below y'all thanks again um and i will talk to you real soon bye", "qQTv9wL00ZE": "[Music] he just massive critters that literally besides overheads somebody give up the idea why don't they try to record maybe you have a large river so we didn't know so we want a line at me actually set the submission and Edison said what it takes like they came back to us and give us the dimensions actually said there is no existing record that I think they soon will further with Grail outlet so that was our category so so let's do it make it space philosophy because the album fritter is our flagship product it's what everybody coming here you know every time someone comes down it is okay to quit ready to eat what is a heart I know that it's always don't for it's what every single review is laughter we've got so making the biggest one is a really good way

say what he'll do we actually took him about three bucks to get to us to actually improve us to attempt to do several records now we have photos we have videos we had to follow a long list of requirements so it had to be they with certain ingredients there were certain things I couldn't put in which I guess work performance enhancers for critters I don't really know but we do follow the rules we documented it that we send it in and wait so hopefully that is [Music]", "Cr79Peunaas": "what's going on world it's your neighborhood we smoke a joint Master Nate right back at you again with

everybody wait is it officially on it's officially of them oh oh I mean it was 95 degrees here in Los Angeles yesterday didn't feel like fall yes we were sort of sweating but in spirit and spirit its bottom of like fall in here in your heart out there any arc Josh I don't know you seem to like to bake even more when it's the fall that's true I'm actually bringing back the mini loaf pan I did a whole mini loaf series last year you might remember our mini life remember our video series [Music] all right Josh lover of autumn what are we making today all right today we are making apple fritter mini loaves so here are the ingredients you'll need all right so what do we do first first we need to make the apple filling or topping because these are mini loaves and not just like a traditional like full loaf of bread you want to cook the apples a little bit to soften them up before we put them in the mini loaves in a medium saucepan at the apples lemon juice sugar cinnamon nutmeg ginger and allspice heat over medium for 5 to 7 minutes stirring occasionally until the apples begin to soften and then we'll have our apple filling this smells like autumn that's right next we'll prepare the other topping which is just brown sugar and cinnamon so I went ahead and mix that together the next step we're going to combine all the dry ingredients flour cornstarch baking powder baking soda and the salt question yes what is that that is sour cream my looks gross buttermilk that's butter okay what do I add yeah so we're gonna set the flour mixture aside for now the cool thing about this recipe too is that you don't need an electric mixer for this rest you just need a whisk and mussels and some mussels yeah do you just want to flex yeah I did next we're going to add the oil the sugar the eggs and the vanilla once this is combined we're going to add half of our flour mixture to our wet mixture I'm just trying to stay away from your elbow I'm just like worried I'm gonna get like whacked in the face all right so now it's time to add the gross stuff oh yeah like that it's just it's just the sour cream and butter it just looks a little gross like sitting here on the counter plop that and wall why do you have to make the noise hurry and here's the colonel no sorry much but enough is Wow you can actually make your own butter mouth really easily oh let's do that whoa whisk this together now I'm gonna add the rest of the flour and whisk the flour together until it's all incorporated and then we are ready to fill our mini loaves can I do that you can tell that means I get to start and then Josh is gonna take over so they're pretty no I'll start I'll show you how then you can do if you see so I transferred the batter into a piping bag you just uses you can use a spoon to just might get it all over the place or not you might so now we're going to add the batter into the mini loaf pan and you just want to like a thin layer just covering the bottom to start with okay just so you're covering all the bottoms so that should be about half of your batter now what we're going to do is just add one teaspoon of apple to all the mini loaves and then we're going to add the brown sugar cinnamon to all that many loaves okay I'm going to repeat the whole process okay I'll do this part do all those okay yeah just like that that's great Josh types me in the kitchen the way he talks to the kids yeah you're doing yet okay how did I do you did great really great and you saved enough which I appreciate for the topping on the end hey don't add too much apple in the middle and not have enough for the end all right brown sugar cinnamon we're just going to take another a teaspoon and just sprinkle that over top in the middle reserved about half at this for the topping after and then are we gonna come back around this like more we're gonna do the whole thing over again okay batter the apples and the brown sugar cinnamon alright and put them in the oven I will Joshua alright what if I dropped out right now drop it bake those for about 22 to 24 minutes and remove them from the oven and let them cool in the pan for about five minutes before releasing then let the Loews finish cooling on a wire rack okay so these apple fritter mini loaves are so good on their own but if you want to go the extra mile you can do a simple glaze and drizzle it on after the loads have cooled all right we're ready to try the apple fritter mini lows looks so and it smells so good all right let's get a shot that's so good it's so good it's so like fresh and moist and delicious

black label extract bro these holes are more [ __ ] uh uh cheaper well i don't know if they're gonna make the foreground pods which i don't think they are well i think they are they're just not right now you know just coming out with these bro i know i can taste i know i can i can taste something similar of a stizzy that i had once bro hit it again foreign i can't remember this this guy but yeah i know that i taste like i know that that that taste i can taste right now is very similar to a stizzy i had before bro i'm not [ __ ] kidding i swear to god bro i can taste a little bit of that stizzy that that i had before in this [ __ ] but this [ __ ] don't even got the [ __ ] like like i don't know bro these these the big chief big chief company really killed it with these bro you got this also the ca sticker right here and also right here on front as well but yeah man finally king caught my hands on one of these [ __ ] bro also says establish 2013 here big cheese restaurants 2013. if your big chiefs say established 2019 like the distilled carts big chief the mohawk fake even if it's wrapped around if it's established 2019 if it's a thc distillate cartridge instead of premium distillate cartridge that [ __ ] is fake as hell bro even if it's rap like i said you got to watch out for them counterfeits at least i know how to get my big sheets where they get my big cheese bro no cbd man uh here but yeah this this this live resin here is 500 milligrams and the distillate big chief is 1000 milligrams i guess it makes sense because the live resin is much more stronger than distillate so yeah this [ __ ] will oh this [ __ ] will [ __ ] me up right now i don't know whether apple fritter is a indica or sativa it does not say in the box here but i can tell you right now i'm taking right here [ __ ] start feeling something man i feel um oh no i think this is a hybrid i think this is a hybrid sativa um indica dominant because it's hitting me more it's setting me more of an indica than the sativa feeling but i think but i'm not as tired so i think this is a hybrid apple fritter no i think apple phrase is sativa i don't know bro let me know down in the comments which i think apple freighter is um i gotta take a little bit more hitch i can hit it until i can feel it and [ __ ] only took like three hits and small too i won't take a blinker bro but i don't know if y'all can see the light here oh [ __ ] i ain't taking no blinker bro these hoes are strong look bro this is a fire ass video right here bro i'm gone i think i think this is a hybrid i'm too [ __ ] up right now bro well i can feel some indica but i think this is definitely a hybrid uh sativa dominant hybrid god damn bro i feel [ __ ] amazing god if y'all had big chief black label extract this is definitely a cop bro definitely a hundred percent a cop imagine though the [ __ ] distillate cards getting me high as [ __ ] they gave me [ __ ] slump but this [ __ ] right here is just on bro live resin liquid diamond live resin isn't another it's on another level bro it's liquid diamonds bro lit literally see that big-ass big cheetah the box looks like and [ __ ] all around there's nothing on top there's gold on the bottom little thing right here this thing right here you press this thing so you can open the box like that yeah guys that's gonna be the review on the first black label big chief liquid diamond live resin pod the very first one apple threaded and this [ __ ] was off the hook the high percentage is gonna be a ten percent bro put that down in the comments which i think if i think apple freight is ten percent all right boy all right guys i think that's going to be it for this video like always stay for uh stay [ __ ] late and lit and stay [ __ ] safe for getting my memo peace",

someone gave me a coupon for a free doughnut normally I am not overly excited about free all I had to do was fill out a little survey online and they would send me a code that would guarantee me a free doughnut in my daily diary diet I have a whole section devoted to the subject that when a forbidden food is free it cancels out all calories when I first told the gracious mistress of the parsonage she looked at me rather strangely and said who said that I know we are both getting old but we are not that old I got close to her waved my hand so she could see me and said it's me I just said it can you hear me now that is not funny you know exactly what I meant Migron drained from my face and I said to her well I said it did she said inquisitively anybody ever say that before you said it my wife has many talents skills and gifts it would be difficult for me to say which is her best gift but at the moment her greatest skill is backing me into a corner and in a corner I was thus backed I then had to explain to her in detail how this was an observation I worked through with much research this is an original with me and I am quite proud to be the author all she said was hot that is exactly what I thought I will go to my grave believing when a donut is free it means it is free of calories call it what you will but free by any other name is still free in my personal dictionary getting back to my free donut I was anxious to get to the donut shop cash in the coupon and enjoy a donut I do not know when the best time to eat a donut is so I just started at my convenience I got at the donut shop and walked in and the smell was overpowering nothing like the smell of donuts baking in the oven with a hint of coffee brewing in the background I just stood there for a few seconds absorbing the luxury of this marvelous atmosphere it is not often I can enjoy such luxuries especially if my wife knows where I am when I became adjusted to the ambience I walked up to the counter and presented my coupon for a free doughnut it was at that moment I saw them I know I am NOT the most observant person at the circus many things get by me without noticing them sometimes I am just in deep thought and not aware of my surroundings I can relate to Walter Mitty in many ways there they were freshly baked apple fritters I was stunned it just never crossed my mind that a donut shop would have this kind of delicious tidbit but there they were freshly baked and staring at me with alluring eyes of desire I do not know how much better a day can get than this when I got up this morning I did not realize this would be a wonderful day there they were staring at me and I stared back and immediately there was a connection standing in line I could hardly wait for my turn to order I presented my coupon for a free donut and the young woman behind the counter said which donut can I get for you sir I savor the moment licked my drying lips and said I'll have an apple fritter with that said I sighed a deep sigh of true contentment I'm sorry sir the young woman said there is no need to be sorry young lady I said as cheerfully as I possibly could no sir I'm sorry but an apple fritter is not a donut I can take a joke as well as anybody else in fact I have put forth my share of jokes however an apple fritter is no joking matter excuse me I said almost breathlessly an apple fritter is not a donut so what donut would you like me to get for you the thought began unfolding in my mind at this point that she was not joking she sincerely believed an apple fritter was not a donut I know an apple fritter is among the Cadillac of donuts but in my mind it is still a donut I did not have much opportunity to set this young woman straight with one of the great fundamental of life I had to take one of her free donuts along with my coffee go to a corner and think about these things what good is free if it is not really what you want sometimes people use the word free as a device to get you to a place where they can sell you something else the Bible is the only place I will accept a free offer one particular verse sets this forth quite nicely and he shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free John chapter 8 verse 32 KJV this is often used out of context the truth that makes us free indeed as none other than the truth about Jesus Christ he is the only one capable of delivering something absolutely free thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe like and share", "Uhlheriu2KM": "what is up guys tony tone back again with another review so today i will be trying one of the brand new mccafe dessert items from mcdonald's they have a blueberry muffin a cinnamon roll and what i'll be trying today is the apple fritter so i decided to go with the apple fritter because well i love apple fritters and uh yeah and i wasn't really feeling a cinnamon roll today and blueberry muffins really aren't my thing i i may try both of them here in the future but uh today i'll be trying the apple fritter so uh at first glance it's a little small for like 250 i don't know you can go to walmart and get one that's like three times as big for just the for even cheaper than that i think there's they sell them for like four for like just over four dollars so it's like just over a buck a piece so 250 for this i believe is what the prices i don't have the receipt they didn't give me one but uh yeah so but you know it comes down to taste does it taste good so let's try it out more quiet still really warm i believe this was made fresh it's definitely not it's definitely not stale but i believe this was like made within the last hour like for sure it's a little soft i usually like the the exterior to be a little bit crunchier but it's not bad so the uh the inside i it might be filled i i taste a lot of cinnamon not tasting like much if any apple to begin with or to be honest so i mean you can see little chunks there but i think that's all just like cinnamon cinnamon oh no that is apple it's just in the very center it's actually pretty good you can actually get the texture of the apple it's not just apple flavor not bad is it worth 250 and but you know price aside i would give that a solid three out of five i've definitely had worse i mean i've definitely had stale ones and ones with no apple in it whatsoever but for that yeah it's pretty good price is a little iffy though if you brought it down to 199 it would be even for fast food prices that would be you know decent but uh you know that's just nitpicking but uh if you've had the apple fritter from mcdonald's let me know your thoughts on it in the comments below give this video a like if you enjoyed it share it someone else can see it subscribe to the channel if you haven't already see you guys in the next review peace", "qIlenaQ1jIc": "oh la gang and welcome again to old nerd reviews i'm tony i'm your old nerd of the day i am and i try things so you don't have to i am at mcdonald's to try all three of their brand new bakery items they have a cinnamon roll a blueberry muffin and an apple fritter no need for the clipboard fluff i mean that's it's what it is what i said is what it is i guess i can take my seat belt off all right handy dandy steering wheel tray there and i'll lay them all out we'll take a look to see what we have what they gave us oh first before i do i want to show you the groovy little sacks that is what they come in and then they and then they cover them a little paper right there little tissue paper and the cinnamon roll comes in this little container there and it's very nice and warm man it's cold out today so this this feels good i think i'll just sit here for like an hour and warm my hands okay i've already laid them all out but that is the bag it came in because if you really care right now a little after the fact got the napkins got the damage and they gave me a fork and knife which is cool because i'm sure you will want to be cutting into some of these at least probably the cinnamon roll so there it is there is the cinnamon roll looks nice and big and i love the presentation on the blueberry muffin looks very deli like sit down coffee place like and there is the apple fritter alrighty first let's try that blueberry muffin like i said i love the presentation of it and uh yeah nice big blueberry muffin there give it a shot there's a look inside you can see the blueberries hanging out being groovy in there let's do it again trying to make sure i get a blueberry next i'm going to try the apple fritter apple fritter right there pretty good size let's give it a shot there's a look at the inner workings of that thing do it again all right let's try the cinnamon roll i'm trying to cut into this i'm actually going to need the knife on it is look at a piece of that cinnamon roll that is nice and hot it smells real good it's got frosting dripping all over it and it's not as gooey as i thought it would be i thought it'd just be all melty but it's not so let's give it a try do it again with the outer portion now for the cleanup okay let's take this by the numbers the blueberry muffin it's not it's a good size i like the presentation um it tastes pretty good it's moist it's not dry it's got plentiful and fairly good size blueberries in it and i think it has it it it's some streusel stuff some streusel crystals on top so you get a little bit of a crunch when you bite into it initially it's semi warm i tried to get these as soon as possible because i wanted them if they were warm in the first place i wanted them to stay as warm as possible next is the apple fritter good size it's also not dry it has an a decent apple flavor to it um but it was cold it was like it was not like taken out of a a fridge or anything but it's it was just like it came out of a bag or or something it wasn't warm put it that way it wasn't warm this a roundabout way of saying it wasn't warm at all and i would have liked it to be but it had some nice nice sweet sweet stuff all over on the outside i think a little bit of cinnamon to it i believe because i mainly got the apple flavor of it and finally the cinnamon roll good size cinnamon frosting all over uh nice and warm nice and warm fresh tasting moist um tasted as a cinnamon roll should all right the damage on all three items i i actually use the app because right now you may want to check yours you can buy one of the bakery items and get the second one free so one of these is zeroed out but the damage on the blueberry muffin was 1.99 all right the damage on the apple fritter uh that's the one zeroed out and if i recall correctly that is about the same price so i'm going to say that's 1.99 also you you check your app see what it says and uh finally the cinnamon roll the damage on that is two dollars and 59 cents so it's more expensive than the other two on the neurometer um just take these individually i am going to give the blueberry muffin i'm gonna give this a i'm going to give this a middle of the road i like it [Music] moist blueberries nice little crunch of the streusel stuff on top pretty good on the nerdo meter i'm going to give the apple fritter i'm gonna give that a low i like it and the reason is because it's just cold it was just cold it wasn't warmed at all in in when you get bakery items in the morning for for you know your coffee and you're just waking up you want something nice and warm not warm at all but i mean the flavor was decent i it would have been better if it had been warm and it's a good size but the the cold the the the lack of warmness just took took a lot out of it okay so i didn't finish everything and brought it all home with me took the apple fritter and shoved it in the microwave and heated it up and it was like a night and day difference just a total 180 it it brought all the flavors out the the just the the cinnamon and the the glaze on top of it and the the small bits small chunks of apple had a nice crunch to it and it was sweet and it was just wonderful it was just crazy just between just like night and day difference and i think even better is if i had shoved some butter and melted a little bit of butter over it but regardless i'm going to change that rating the apple fritter from mcdonald's is a best ever if it's warm if it's hot best ever cold it's like nothing the flavors don't come through the it's hard and it's not good keep that thing up so if if you get it at mcdonald's and it's not hot in the first place um wherever you're headed wherever your destination is find a microwave and and heat it up you're gonna like it and then the cinnamon roll the cinnamon roll to me was the best of all three i would give the cinnamon roll a high i like it [Music] [Applause] just just a good size nice and warm and just the cinnamon and the frosting and the freshness of it um just it's really good really good over all three that is the best i wouldn't say any of them are stupendous just mind-blowing i've got to run out and get these things i wouldn't say that but for for uh fast food bakery items um yeah they're they're pretty good but of course i

i'm clark neal today we're going to show you how to make the tasty recipe for our apple fritter breakfast sandwich this takes your average breakfast sandwich to a whole new level and by using laura lynn and other ingredients from your local ingles you know it's going to be good so let's get started we're going to take some breakfast sausage this comes in a tube like this you can find this in the uh section of your ingles store where your bacon is i'd roll them into little balls we're gonna make these smash burger style if you don't know what that is basically it is a ball of meat that you put on the grill you take your spatula and you push down this is going to help you make a really good crust it will stick to your spatula just a little bit so all right clark that's looking good looking good and what we're going to do we're going to let this cook for about six minutes aside you want to make sure you got good contact on there that's going to get that nice beautiful golden brown crust after six minutes we're going to flip it over cook a little bit and put a piece of cheese on top of it when we come back we'll show you what it looks like after we flip it okay the timer just went off we're getting ready to flip this over i'm going to show you how nice and brown this crust is from being on this flat top ah that's beautiful that's what we're looking for i'm gonna press this down i'm gonna cook these for a couple more minutes then i'm gonna put a piece of cheese on top of it meanwhile sushi's gonna get started on the egg okay so what i'm doing i'm cracking my egg on a flat surface that makes it much easier and you notice i didn't put them right on the grill i notice a lot of times in the morning you're still trying to get awake you get that little piece of shell in there and then you're trying to pick it off a hot grill well this little cup saves the day every time so i just crack the egg on a flat surface and then in there put them in the cup no shell in your eggs also allows you to form a little more gently on the grill so you don't break that yolk so we've got these beautiful and delicious apple fritters from the ingles bakery clark oh thank you for splitting those open so i'm going to put our eggs on here you notice i put some rings on there they're not any kind of fancy uni-tasker these are my canning lids that i use and i want to get a pretty egg for on top of our breakfast sandwich so i'm going to very carefully pour the egg in the ring to make a round egg patty okay these are starting to look pretty good i'm going to try very gently oh look at that it's magic all right they look good i like my study side up how do you like yours clark sunny side up for this sandwich is my way that i like it so this is gonna be beautiful apple fritters that we got from the ingles bakery i like to put these in the oven for just a little bit to warm them up a bit they're split in half so the sausage and the cheese are going to go on top of that the egg's going to go on top of that then you're going to put that top on there and when you bite into it that yolk's going to break and you're going to make just gooey gooey mess all over your plate it's great for pulling off little pieces of that fritter and dipping in that egg that sounds like something you get at a food truck or one of those high-end diners i know all this goodness from angles so i'm gonna go ahead and put this cheese on here and let it get melting while this sausage continues to cook oh that looks like pepper jack you like a little spice in the morning yeah it gives you a little bit of heat to go with the sweet from the apple fritter it takes a really nice subtle background heat and so the sweet doesn't overwhelm your palate all right looks like the eggs are done looks like our sausage is done i just checked the temperature and they're at 160 degrees so we're gonna build these sandwiches okay so these apple fritters you can find at your ingles bakery they come in a box already on the shelf ready to go and like i said i just split these in half with a bread knife so i've got those put down there susie you want to put those eggs on top of that okay i'm going to do this one first i'm going to very carefully get it off the griddle all right i'm going to put these tops on top of these sandwiches very gently don't break the yolks try not to break those beautiful yolks all right and there you have it apple fritter breakfast sandwich i want to thank you for joining us here at the ingles table be sure and check out the website for more tips tricks and recipes we'll see you next time you", "CLeU9E9_Qfo": "hey everybody and welcome back to another episode of getting snacky with daryl now this is gonna be a special one because i'm feeling a little nostalgic i'm rocking my windy city bulls gear and as your in-game host i want to reach out to my windy city bulls fans and i'm feeling a little snacky so i went out to my local bear family restaurants at mcdonald's to get a big mac because remember those times when we would get three big macs after 100 point wins at the winning city bulls games oh yeah now while i was getting my big mac i also realized that they are offering all day breakfast of their new mccafe bakery line so it's not just during breakfast time you can get these things it's all day and now if you haven't noticed that they have this new three new items it's a cinnamon roll an apple fritter and a blueberry muffin now we're going to start off with the cinnamon roll dessert first today we're going to start off with the cinnamon roll because it's nice and warm but we get a good angle on there and it's a little bit of a white out there but it is a cinnamon roll it's a good size cinnamon roll and i used the app the mcdonald's app to get this because i pulled in there was a long line at the drive-thru so i pulled in ordered on the app super easy punch it in and they brought it out to my car so i got some curbside pickup on top of that so it's a nice little cinnamon roll sorry back to the cinnamon roll and whoo and it's supposed to be a cream cheese filling or excuse me not filling cream cheese icing and you could definitely smell the cinnamon and you could definitely tell this is going to be sweet and it's a good portion they actually put a lot of the cream cheese icing on there which is great for me i love that now they did offer a fork and a knife to make yourself uh to help it feel classy but you know what i'm kind of hungry i'm really snacky so let's go right in for a bite cheers oh [Laughter] hope you guys get to see the good angles on there you definitely tell that is a cream cheese icing there's a little bit of that tang to it and once it's warm you can see it melting through the different layers i don't know if we can see that the pastry pretty decent pretty decent uh considering this is more like lunchtime but oh man that was a good i used to just dig out the middle so because i knew that would be the most gooey part but since there's a lot of icing and a good amount of cinnamon this the whole thing is really good and i used to curl around just go layer by there let me know in the comments below if you are just a bite right through it or you just unwind it unwind that cinnamon roll so if you're not a big fan of like icing or the cream cheese icing this might not be for you because they do put a good amount and for me i love that especially at this price point uh this is for at my location it's about three dollars for that so it it's a good it's a good size it is on the higher end of the price point but thinking about it if you're already here for breakfast and you're getting and you know we all know mcdonald's has great breakfast um and you want to end your meal with something sweet this is a pretty good option when it comes down to it not too many good um fast food joints that have a a good breakfast or a good pastry selection when i uh when you did sorry i let me get my there you go so i i really dig this now i got two more to go with but cinnamon roll definitely a thumbs up you get this and you can get it while it's still warm oh man that's going down now let's go to the apple fritter and i like their you know nice little packaging there go to the upper i am a big fan of the apple fritter so i'm hoping this works out you see all the nice little like i guess grooves and bumps and this is like you would think this is at any other uh bakery you know first glance this is a good looking apple fritter and it's a good size now the apple fritter is coming in like a 270 here in my location so obviously prices will vary across the nation but look at that i'm digging this you can smell and this also has a little bit of icing i think it's just a plain icing uh sweet icing and it's not too much i can feel it on my fingers and this is going to be a great finger licking at the end i'm looking for some apples there's a couple of chunks of apple again hopefully you guys can see that okay oh i got a piece of apple there let me put this down so i got some apple now with the light uh glaze of the icing there this is just sweet enough and the pastry nice and soft for mcdonald's and the fast food industry this is pretty good i do wish there was more apples though but there is just enough there is just enough for those who maybe are not used to getting an apple fritter um this might be a good segue for you to try it i do wish there was a little bit more apple uh so other than that this is not bad it's just sweet enough um and it's just soft and doughy enough for you also there's a good amount of cinnamon as well so it's a nice balance i do wish again do wish there was more apples and this would definitely elevate this even more but i do not hate it not gonna lie do not hate it not gonna that's definitely still gonna get finished later on all right let's move on to the blueberry muffin now this guy is coming in at 263 and it's a good-sized muffin i i was i was honestly going to expect it to be a little bit smaller but this isn't you know i kind of expected this this is i think on par on par for all your other places like maybe like a starbucks or or something like that dunkin donuts i do like this it's a good size it has like a supposed to have like a streusel topping on here you can see the the sugar granules on top there i'm digging that and you can definitely see the blueberries let's let's uh let's get a nice little break this open oh it's crumbly oh it's crumbly sorry car look at that they did not skimp on the blueberries all right all right mcdonald's it's definitely on that cakey but moist muffin uh side of it oh yeah oh yeah this is my kind of muffin i know some people like just the muffin tops this is definitely gonna be one giant muffin top because it's the same consistency all the way through out so i got a good amount of uh blueberry in here there's a good amount of sweetness on this and it's good size again it's not it's not the cheapest thing but i think it's just right on par with everything out there and if you're already here for mcdonald's for their their great coffee i i understand that they're it's a hundred percent colombian uh coffee uh so like a medium roast i believe let me know in the comments below if you're a mcdonald's coffee fan so if you're ready here for some coffee or for some breakfast getting a muffin or that cinnamon roll oh man definitely a win-win over over here so i'm actually gonna go in for one more bite oh yeah i am not disappointed with that at all all right there's my review of the cinnamon roll the blueberry muffin and the apple fritter cinnamon roll uh definitely uh double thumbs up the blueberry muffin double thumbs up the apple fritter i'm just giving it a thumbs up it wasn't bad not not at all it just wasn't on the same level as the blueberry muffin and the cinnamon roll now again also you can get this all day all day i'm here actually here for lunch for a big mac big mac but i could not resist getting the new bakery items on their mccafe line alright guys have a great one have a snacktastic day and as always go bulls", "0SjewzZg_S4": "all right welcome back to another apple fritter review but she didn't think you'd get another one of these but there's always going to be more so today i have an apple further from a local place called glaze donuts and they sell other food as well but with a name like well it's actually not glazed doughnuts it's just glazed but obviously that implies doughnuts so got an apple further from there i'm going to show you all what it looks like and kind of step you through what i think of it so pardon the uh rustling right now all right so if you remember from the whole foods apple fritter review the size of that one this one is quite a bit bigger uh so it's the size of like the standard paper bag pretty much so this is a huge apple fritter uh i think it was like four dollars three four dollars so it's it's about twice the size of the whole foods one uh but also twice the amount so it's i guess proportionally the same cost uh this one only has one type of kind of sugar coating on the outside so this one just has a glaze it doesn't have an icing but this one is much more uh it's everywhere the coverage is more total compared to the whole foods apple fritter uh it's not much more to say about the surface besides the fact that so this one this might be hard to see so i'll bring it closer you can see that there's like this kind of pale line so it's like brown pale then brown again so that's an indication that this was fried compared to bait because it goes into the fryer one side then you have to flip it over and there's just going to be a slight kind of ring around it where it doesn't get fried the same so this is fried uh doesn't feel really dense so it has a light like lightness to it uh and the surface itself it's like once again kind of smooth and in some ways it kind of looks like a hamburger bun because of the shape of it but it does have like these kind of irregular spots and the bottom is kind of the same way so break it open it's actually very very sticky so this one uh breaks open really well has like a donut texture on the inside but uh doesn't have as much of that cinnamon swirl kind of action going on inside you see a little bit of it but it's mostly just kind of white so it makes me a little nervous about how apple frittery it's actually going to taste and i should mention that on the surface there are a few apple pieces but i don't see any apple pieces on the inside which is like a nice feature that the whole foods one had there are some apple pieces on the inside actually so i'm gonna take my first bite it was a big bite so overall i'd say this is definitely even though like it doesn't have as much as the cinnamon swirl actually going on the inside the flavor is still there definitely prefer this compared to the whole foods one uh this one just reminds me more of an apple fritter and that might be for several reasons one the fact that it's fried may get more of that feeling that i'm looking for uh and also just the texture of it uh is more similar to what i'm used to compared to the whole foods one which was a little more dense compared to this one and i think once again that is because it was baked uh when you bake it it doesn't like get the same aeration and rise that you would get from using the same type of dough in a fryer so overall i'll say this amplifier is pretty good it's one that i would definitely seek out so this is like something that i would get again not just out of convenience but because i actually want to get it there's not much else to say about also interestingly this apple further is vegan i don't know if apple fritters come vegan by default or not like and more than by that i mean like if you just looked up a random apple for the recipe will it be vegan by default or do you have to make it vegan i don't know and this place actually has uh most of the donuts they sell are vegan so maybe uh in a future video i'll get like several donuts and kind of give you my feedback on them like what the flavors are like they have some really interesting flavors uh some of them i feel like won't appeal to me but i'll let you know anyway so uh thanks for watching this further fun my further fun uh fancy further fun i'm a fancy further fanatic i'm just trying to think of alliteration on the spot and i'm not doing very great but uh yeah stick around and uh watch some other videos peace", "wHSskT6Xatg": "[Music] all right this time sort of a donut review but uh this is gonna be probably you know volume one one and a half of the search for the best apple fritter okay i have in my mind uh ones a couple couple that i hold up as uh you know the best i've had and at least it's kind of informed in my mind what i think is the best things to look for now if you check out my review of missing whole donut shop i tried a couple of their donuts including their monstrous apple fritter and it was pretty good um but that that apple fritter i think was was pretty on par with a a good tasting uh but i think common apple fritter you'll find it a lot of at a lot of places uh what i'm looking for and i admit maybe this is a little pie in the sky this is not the common apple fritter but to my mind it is the best right i was gonna be looking for the best and so uh today i got two different ones one from an unnamed donut shop because i've already tried it before it does not quite measure up to what i'm looking for so i got it just to show you comparison all right and then one is from a place called christie's donuts so here is the unnamed donut shop right there now this one let's have a look crack into it and see what we can find okay what you're finding there is dough right a lot of dough a little bit of cinnamon going on definitely uh you know the nice glaze on the outside probably going to taste pretty good that's pretty good glaze is nice dough is pretty good all right so let's get to the three things before i go to the next one three things i think you need for the ultimate apple fritter one shouldn't be too dry right if it's too dry which is a dry dough bomb that's no fun nobody wants that right second thing you gotta have the cinnamon in there if it's apple what goes with apple cinnamon nutmeg all spice whatever it is you use get the spice in there but like i said in the missing whole donut shop review this is this should not be an apple spice fritter you know like pumpkin spice versus pumpkin you know all that this is not an apple spice fritter and so many of them i have are apple spice fritters apple flavored apple spice fritters they're not apple fritters in my mind so you need it to not be super dry you need it to have the spice but that's not it right you also need the third thing you need apples in there it's an apple fritter for crying out loud so you need apples in there and that is where so many places fall short now this one this is the christie's donuts apple fritter i can tell even just by picking it up it's a lot softer it is still i'm sure you know it's fried just like the other one but picking it up is just soft and i think i have an idea why you can also look right here chunks of apple on the back chunk of apple chunk of apple chunk of apple all right i've i've tried this one once before and in fact i would have done the review then but it was at night it was too dark to do a review so back at it again but hey we'll test we'll test the consistency of the shop and see if they you know produce a good one over and over again all right look at that just chunks of apple in there nice little chunk of apple lots of chunks of apple in there that's what we're talking about so right away it at least has the big chunks of apple which most places miss um now i think i can tell now why it's why it does feel a lot softer even softer to the touch definitely softer uh you know eating it too now i asked them i'm always asking the questions how you make this or that or what's their favorite thing or whatever so i was told that this has the spice in it which you taste to some extent i think that could be dialed up but that's just personal taste but they have that the apples and then they have i couldn't get a clear answer either like an apple jelly of some sort or applesauce is also in there and i think that definitely comes across and it's it's uh it's soft if anything i wouldn't say mushy but but uh but it is softer than what you're used to with fred or being a little bit you know hardened kind of by the uh by the frying and buy just you know loads of that that glaze on there which some people may not like but it's an apple fritter that that's what you do this uh isn't as thick with the glaze on it um so it's not quite as hard in that respect um and i think also the the sauce apple sauce or apple jam whatever it is in there is definitely making this more moist now i'm getting this uh just before six and at night um this job is one twenty four seven so who knows how recently it was was made but what i can say is i've gone before at like ten o'clock at night and it was it was still a really nice consistency it was it was still really soft and uh and that i think is credit to the jam the sauce whatever it is that they're putting in that that third thing that they're putting in there oh that's really nice and i don't think that's even necessarily a requirement right it wasn't on my list of three things um but it's a but it's a good idea and i don't know how many places do that you know if they do do it it's not really coming through but you know definitely top marks for having those big chunks of apple in here so nice i'm gonna go to the very edge and definitely get a little bit more of that um crispy kind of chewiness that maybe you're used to in apple fritter definitely nice um so i got high marks on that and on having probably a lot more more lasting to it without drying out because it does have that that extra thing in there now have i found the ultimate apple fritter in this no right not ultimate but i will say you compare this versus this you're talking night and day right this is just this is a doe bomb this is at best an apple spice fritter um this this is an apple fritter i'm still on the hunt for the ultimate apple fritter but this is an apple fritter and and it's a dawn good one so christy's donut shop and doing a nice job on that and i appreciate it uh if you know of the best apple fritter somewhere you think um i don't care if it's a grocery store preferred whatever it is right you tell me put in the comments and uh you know i'm certainly going to seek it out and i'm going to keep on doing this any donut shop i go to try their donuts if they have an apple fritter i'm going to see how it measures up so the ultimate search for apple fritter one step closer not quite there but christie's donut shop you're doing a nice job you", "mNWo01unJPk": "(upbeat music) (cheerful music) - Hi, I'm Laura, and\ntoday I'm gonna show you how to remake the classic apple fritter into a healthier baked version. I can only think of a few better things than the classic apple\nfritter inside of a muffin. While I love apple fritters, the truth is that I'm not that great at making fried recipes. Plus, I wouldn't trust me in a kitchen early in the morning frying anything when I haven't had enough coffee. Baking? That I can do. I love this recipe because\nI have all the ingredients in the pantry and in my\nfridge at any given time, plus I can prepare the\nbatter the night before, put it in the fridge and in the\nmorning, pop it in the oven. When I bake, I like to have all my\ningredients ready on the counter, so I don't get sidetracked\nwhile I go fetch something else. First, we're gonna preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit\nand line a muffin pan. We're also going to combine\nthe brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. I want to have my apple pieces ready because one of the things\nI love about apple fritters are those delicious\nchunks of apples inside. In a large bowl or the\nbowl of our stand mixer, we're going to beat the sugar and butter until smooth and creamy. Next we add in the eggs one\nat a time until incorporated. And finally, we add the vanilla and give it a quick final mix. In a separate bowl, we're going to combine the\nflour and baking powder. By the way, these apple\nfritter muffins also work with most all-purpose\ngluten-free flour mixes. When that's done, we're going to gradually add the flour to the creamed mixture and\nthe milk into the batter and mix until smooth. We're going to fill the muffin cups with about two tablespoons\nof batter, halfway full, and distribute the apple\npieces evenly in all the cups. Top with additional batter, about another two tablespoons\nor so, covering the apples. The final step is to top each muffin with a brown sugar mixture and using the back of a fork,\ngently swirl the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture\ninto the muffin batter. Bake in the preheated\noven for about 22 minutes or until golden brown and the toothpick inserted\nin center comes out clean. The house is going to smell amazing, and once they've cooled, they're ready. For the recipe, make sure\nyou click on the link below.

they're cheap too for their size they're like 275 each i'm definitely going to sugar coma after i eat all these for sure ah okay it was a good first start oh man that was good like guys just like look at the size of these donuts they're practically the size of my head seriously like holy cow like don't they say like your stomach's the size of your fist or like that's all you're supposed to eat or something like those are like definitely bigger than my fist for sure go with the chocolate one there we go look at that oh that's so good i've been like i've been craving jonas for a long time now like since the middle of the summer but like donuts and pastries and baked items for me it was definitely like a fall thing so i was holding off just to like savor it do what would have made this perfect would have been bitten to have some coffee with this but it's already basically supper time so i don't want to drink any more coffee to keep me up all night and yes this is practically my supper but some coffee would have gone really well with these that was chocolatey [Applause] for any other coffee and donut coffee drinkers and donut eaters what camp are you in do you like to dip your donuts your note is dipping unallowed i'm definitely not a dipper myself the sprinkly balloon the classic sprinkle i would see like dipping like an old-fashioned donut or sour cream doughnut or whatever like those ones that don't like having any toppings or like any glaze on the top because they're just so plain probably like made for dipping but when you get the ones with like sprinkles and like chocolate and sugar on top you go to dip those in your coffee it's just gonna all go in your coffee um the sprinkly donut was always my favorite as a kid that's actually what i always call it too i almost technically called like a vanilla dip or whatever but to me it's a sprinkle you don't so i don't know what i want to leave last well because i'm definitely torn between the boston cream and apple freighter those are my two favorite favorites from this bakery so maybe i'll eat my second jelly doughnut i believe this one is cherry probably oh no that's raspberry that was a pleasant surprise i love raspberry that's my favorite fruit sorry strawberry people all right raspberries are way better um raspberry jam in there just what was that that's how we're a donut should be they do not skimp on the fillings and at this bakery so sugary too i'm getting sugar everywhere all over myself even after the game oh the two very best ones right here i don't know which one to choose save for last i'm gonna save the boston cream for last but i almost think it's like a dead even tie it's so hard to choose for me it's really really close i'm just randomly choosing the apple fritter first that is so heavy i'm feeling oh my god oh my god that's good [Music] so ice cream and bakery items right there are my two like achilles heels those are what i love the most for sure i come fall you want to get into pastry mood i gain so much weight but like i don't even care it's gotta fatten up for the winter right oh and there we go the boston cream all that's left of those donuts man each of those donuts were definitely worth like at least two or three donuts at a regular place not quite as much filling as i hoped compared to the jelly filled ones but maybe i just got a dud because i've definitely had them like their boston creams a lot in the past and definitely don't skin still very good though um um oh my god guys that was a lot of sugar a lot of sugar holy cow we'll probably go pass out now for a couple hours and then be up all night after that i probably won't even sleep all moving it was an insane amount of sugar but i hope you guys enjoyed this video and as usual if you

you're new to my channel hi my name is alice and please don't forget to subscribe and ring the bell to get notified every time i upload a new video if you're not new welcome back to my channel so for today's recipe i decide to share with you one of my favorite things to eat during this time of the year and the reason why because it's pretty soon we're gonna be approaching a very important holidays in italy which is called carnevale it's kind of similar to halloween but it's not as scary we like to dress up but as like here they do it for halloween and also we love but to eat some delicious dessert that are mostly fried so for today's recipe i want to share with you one of the many recipes that i'm gonna try to share like during this the two weeks prior this holidays i believe this holiday is gonna be around the second week of february so i think i have in mind like two to three recipes to share with you so for today's i'm going to show you how to make italian apple fritter or as you know in in italian it's called frittell those apple fritters are super fluffy super delicious nothing they're not like similar to the one that you guys know in the united states or canada or other part of the world this is a very old recipe from my family i we make it every year during this time and also when we crave something sweet and fried we make it even if it's not around january or february so enough friendly let's get to the ingredients for this recipe you're gonna need a flour baking powder vanilla powder again it's red vanilla powder you can use vanilla extract butter then we have some lemon zest raisin sugar eggs apples and water that's like oh and also oil that's all you need oil of course is to fry the apple fritter that's all you need for the ingredients it's a little like the steps that i'm gonna show you they're a little different from the one that you probably already know but let me tell you if you follow those steps you're going to have the lightest and fluffiest apple fritter of your life and again if you don't like raisin you can avoid cream raisin but this raisin and apple i don't know it's a combo that it works and also i'm going to soak the raisin in a little bit of ram if you don't want to alcohol like it you can put water so let's move to the stove and let's put this stuff together shall we so first things you got to do you're going to put your pot on your stove on high heat and you're going to pour the water then you're going to add the butter and you want to wait until the butter is melted and the water is starting to boil okay once the water is starting to boil you're gonna add your flour all at once and you're gonna start whisking it all together then you're gonna lower the heat on medium and you're gonna cook it for like one to two minutes okay once you're done cooking your flour butter and water on the stove for a couple minutes you're gonna put it in a bowl glass bowl plastic bowl whatever you have and you're gonna let it cool down for a couple minutes in the meantime you're gonna crack your two eggs right here you're gonna grab your hand mixer and you're gonna start to whisk it to cool it down a little bit more and then you're gonna add one egg at a time and you're gonna wait to add the following eggs until it's well absorbed once you're done whisking the eggs with the other ingredients you're gonna add your vanilla powder then you're gonna uh the baking powder the sugar and the lemon zest again all the ingredients the measurement are going to be listed in the description box it down below and now you want to whisk again until it's well combined after all your ingredients are well combined together it's time to add your apples all at once and your raisins and you just gonna mix it all together until well combined so here we are back on the stove it's time to fry our apple fritter so i have the peanut oil but you can use any other type of oil that you like it except for olive oil because the flavor is way too strong and what i'm gonna do i'm gonna use um two teaspoons like this one and i'm just gonna drop some of the um batter of the apple fritter into the hot oil like so and you're gonna cook it until it's nice and golden brown [Music] [Music] [Music] do once you're done frying your apple fritter you're gonna put it on the paper towel to absorb the excess oil and here i have some granulated sugar and we can roll the apple fritter into the granulated sugar or you can also if you don't like granulated sugar you can use icing sugar but let me tell you the crunch that gives the granulated sugar it's something else so you're gonna grab your apple fritter and you're just gonna simply roll it you can also add a little bit of cinnamon to your sugar and then you're gonna place it in your plate and you're gonna do this for the rest of the apple fritter [Music] [Applause] [Music] do all right you guys my apple fritter actually italian apple fritter i already look how beautiful and delicious they look they're so light and fluffy and crunchy on the outside but super melting your mouth in the inside and of course on all my videos i have to do the taste test because why not

[Music]", "FdFi1myibIQ": "all right the apple fritter is up next brand new from mccafe mcdonald's this is the apple fritter review cue the intro what is up everyone it is the endorsement and it is time for another review this is where i try something and tell you if you should like it or not i can be very persuasive all right so uh mccafe mcdonald's has released three brand new uh bakery items uh they released the uh blueberry muffin i've already reviewed that if you missed that it will be linked at the end of this video hopefully um and they also came out with a cinnamon roll you will be seeing that sooner than later this video is going to concentrate on the apple fritter one of my father's favorite uh desserts check this bad boy out did i say dessert pastry this is one of his favorite pastries i never gravitated to it as a child because i thought it looked like a brain it looks like a brain i'm sorry it looks like a brain but it's an apple fritter and let's check the undercarriage we always kind of forget about the undercarriage i see possible chunks of apple right there this i believe was two dollars and 49 cents i'll have to double check that uh the blueberry muffin was a buck 99 i thought for the size that was a little overpriced this right here seems a little small too and i'm just going on comparison to other apple fritters i've seen i've purchased and i have eaten uh in the past and there's been a lot of them at least that i've purchased because i would treat my dad to a bunch of these over the years so um all right here we go wish me luck the brand new apple fritter from mccafe you know mcdonald's the clown let's go okay all right so this one is cakey too uh the blueberry muffin was cakey spoiler alert if you haven't seen that video already but this definitely is very dense has a very uh cakey texture and i was getting more cinnamon than apple in that first bite so let's go in for a second bite i'm hoping for more apple it is in fact an apple fritter not a cinnamon fritter an apple fritter check it out all right so i'm gonna say after two bites um it needs more apple i mean it is an apple fritter you can see one up in this corner if you look uh right up there that is an apple but the majority of this it's almost like a glorified uh cinnamon roll without the roll um it just needs more apple definitely needs more apple you could see two apple or two or three apple pieces on the bottom right there but this definitely needs more apple the cinnamon is on point and the texture is just a little too dense for me i would like it a little more airy a little more fluffy but again it's an apple fritter last bite all right nothing left to do but give this a rating on a scale of 1 to 100 with one meaning don't even waste your money and 100 being the promised land of i'm going to give the apple fritter brand new from mcdonald's mccafe a rating of seventy nine i'm gonna give that a 79 i think it would be uh in the 80s if it did come correct with more uh apple uh and the uh consistency was a little more uh airy for me but uh that's just my preference if you like a little more uh dense uh pastry then that will probably be right up your alley so uh there you go another review in the books please like comment share and subscribe also please do not forget to check me out on instagram and twitter that is social media getting the word of my channel out to the masses all right two down one to go another town and one more show name that song all right but i'm gonna give you a sneak peek or should i wait to the

the behind the scenes stuff takes a while so we'll see but stay tuned bonus footage you'll see it all right bonus footage there it is that's the cinnamon roll you'll be seeing that soon click that notification bell smash that like button all right just just do youtube just do youtube [Music] oh bye", "TS6hE2w0Syw": "[Music] all right search for the best apple fritter time next one this one is from prunedale um california it's from a place called sunshine donut sunshine donuts and bagel um so here we go i went in there to try out their donuts of course they had apple fritters not of course but a lot of places do uh when i was looking at it i didn't even really interrogate it too much because i was like i don't know i don't you know i don't know if i want to try the apple fritter right now but without me even asking the lady says oh there's apples in it and i said all right she wants to read my mind that's that's that's what i would have asked if anything is there apples in it so there's apples in it looking in the back there's actually one little hole in it and it happens to have an apple in it so that's a good sign got nice uh nice glaze not on the back when it's glazed in the front um feels you know pretty relatively hard on it so you're gonna have probably that nice uh crunchiness so already a few things going for it right there you can see little little bits of apple little bits so what i'm what am i looking for don't be too dry bring the spice you can see a little bit of the spice uh happening throughout here have apples in it biggest thing and that's a lot of people miss have apples in it and then you know maybe a bonus for my taste at least is to have kind of that that soft texture inside and the crunchiness on the outside so with that in mind let's see how they do hmm the apple flavor is there um in that bite i got a couple little pieces of apple so they you know they do check that box i could definitely go for a lot more of the apple um i think about for another bike this is good but also research right you deserve you deserve the honest research and i'm doing it for you um so it's got that uh not i'm looking though not a ton of apple there are little chunks in it but not a ton okay so definitely beating out the people who just aren't putting it in there or putting like one little speck of donut or one little speck of apple in the whole thing uh which is super let down that's most places um it does have the spice that's nice it's not too dry it's not super moist like say christie's donuts that they're putting apple but almost like an apple jam in there too um it's not super moist like in that in that respect but uh but but it isn't too dry either so it's you know some somewhere in between it does have a nice crunch on it and then i think my bet is if you go for the outsides mm-hmm yep definitely the exterior already has that little bit of crunch to it no matter where you are even from the middle you know the top and bottom a little bit of crunch but you know it's it's crunch land out on the on on the edges on the far edges really oh that's great just like just crunchy and sweet um because that glaze is really nice and it is well glazed um so really nice in that respect so it's got it's got one it's got two it's got four uh it's got a little bit of three it's got the apples in there um so definitely i can't take any marks away from it for that except not enough apples they are present they're there there's a little guy right here they are present um so definitely good marks for that but more please big old chunks of it i'm not sure why a lot of donut shops don't do it if you run a donut shop or whatever if you made them say in the comments tell me what why are places not putting big old chunks of apples substantial chunks of apple in there who knows i mean it's more expensive than you know flour i'm sure but uh but i don't know that can't be it that can't be just it but i'm going back and back i'm going for it so it is nice and and and it does take all the boxes it does take every box um the only thing i would ask for more of because it has enough of everything except more apples please so anyways that's sunshine donuts in prunedale california um i would say it is uh it it is up there in the rankings um uh but is it the ultimate no i think the ultimate for me right now is um prunedale donuts which is actually uh not far from here and that was one of the last videos i did for me they're the ultimate so far not the ultimate ultimate i mean maybe we'll see but ultimate so far i'm still looking um but this this is a i would say a close second uh to them so until next time hope you're searching too let me know what you find see ya", "Bx_bpY8CSf4": "hey guys it's sarah from never tasted better i hope you're having a great day today i wanted to show you how to make some delicious apple fritter bread now the reason i decided to come up with this recipe is because i have family that live in amish country and every time we go down to see them we have to go to the dutch farmers market if you haven't been to a dutch farmers market you guys you're missing out they have everything in their baked goods section they have homemade donuts whoopie pies any type of pie you can think of quick breads i tried their apple fritter quick bread it was so delicious it was jam packed full of fresh apples had a brown sugary cinnamon thing going on it was so delicious and moist i wanted to share with you today my take on that apple fritter bread this gourmet apple fritter bread really is so easy to make it came out very moist as you can see in the middle it's got a nice section of fresh apples and brown sugar cinnamon on the top is a delicious vanilla glaze let's go ahead and run through a quick list of the ingredients we're going to need for this recipe our ingredients include one and a half cups all-purpose flour one and a half teaspoons baking powder plus one teaspoon cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon salt our sugars are half cup white sugar a third cup dark brown sugar half cup milk at room temperature one stick unsalted butter room temperature two large eggs also at room temperature one and a half teaspoons vanilla and two fresh apples i use cortland and honey crisp i like a mixture of both that's all of our ingredients guys let's go ahead and get started our loaf pan is going to be a 8 by 4 inch loaf pan which we're going to heavily grease with butter get all of those corners making sure it's well coated our next step is prepping our apples you're going to peel them get the core out of there and roughly chop them up you can dice them but i like them a good size so you get a nice bite of fresh apple in a small bowl add your dark brown sugar it should really be packed in there i like quite a bit of dark brown sugar in my apples also add your cinnamon which i should have kept separate from my baking powder stir it together using a very tiny whisk make sure to break up those large clumps of brown sugar and we're going to set this aside with our apples in a very large bowl add your butter and your white sugar we are going to cream them together until light and very fluffy add in both of your eggs your milk and your vanilla cream it on a high speed until thoroughly combined this recipe is called a quick bread for a reason you pretty much just throw all of your ingredients into a large bowl and mix it together sift in your all-purpose flour your baking powder and salt [Music] to avoid over mixing get rid of your mixer and trade it in for a spatula try to fold it in as best you can until there are no more streaks of flour left go over to your loaf pan and layer just half of the batter that you made into the bottom of the pan spread it out as evenly as possible i love layering things so i found this part to be a lot of fun and very satisfying once your first layer of batter is on go over to your apples and grab just half of those freshly chopped apples layer them very evenly onto the batter sprinkle just half of the brown sugar cinnamon mixture on top once that is done get the rest of your batter place it in dollops on top of the brown sugar apple mixture spread it out as evenly as possible sealing up those corners last but not least layer the rest of those fresh apples on top of the batter also don't forget the rest of your brown sugar cinnamon mixture sprinkle it over very evenly and this guy is ready to bake your oven should be preheated to 350 degrees place it in the center rack bake for 50 to 55 minutes while that bakes let's make our vanilla glaze sift in half a cup powdered sugar drizzle in one to two tablespoons of heavy cream guys you can kind of figure it out and whatever consistency you want your glaze to be just go for it i did about one to two tablespoons of heavy cream and it came out delicious so my kitchen smells amazing right now let it cool off completely before you remove it from the pan once it's cooled off and you removed it go ahead and be very generous with that vanilla glaze have fun and drizzle it over i know i will be making this loaf over and over again it just came out so delicious my whole family enjoyed it very much i hope yours will too if you decide to make this recipe please tag me on instagram at never tasted better i would love to see your version of this loaf thank you guys so much for watching i hope you have a great day don't forget to like and subscribe and i'll say bye for now have a great day guys bye", "aOxwR_QjwU8": "oh nana finally gets

is look at all the apple fritter pastry deliciousness [Music] bottoms up not too bad i've had i've had apple fritters that are a lot worse than this i've had some that are quite a bit better or i

coffee it's a nice little pastry to have along the side until the next bite", "WvJTC7WCTho": "what is up YouTube this is an update video here on the 3x3 row tent with the first choice CMH I just wanted to do a little update here we're at about week 4 of veg now for 4 weeks we're actually probably leaning more into the fifth on going week of veg it's been around 30 days since transplanting and yeah so just to do a quick update I have been for the last two weeks since I did the last update I really pushed these plants to their limit and I think it's safe to say that I put them through quote-unquote hell so what happened was I had a little bug that I had never seen before you know I was seeing them on the tops of these leaves little little little brown guys not spider mites I know spider mites was not spider - turns out from you know doing research I'm pretty sure it was thrips so I ended up in the process of trying to take care of the thrips I hit it the hope all the plants the whole garden with take down that did not work so then I went to as a max which I had left over from a while ago which I know it's a lot heavier not as quote-unquote organic so I did the aza max that didn't work then I went to a third product that have lying around that has a different meaning greedy n't that didn't work now granted I was I was doing this I was spraying the plants and I was seeing you know ten minutes after I would spray it the bugs were still happily living walking around so normally you would want to give your plants time in between sprained but for the sake of me trying to get rid of these bugs ASAP it wasn't until the fourth spray that I tried that I actually killed them and let's see if I show you real quick the one that actually worked was this one what do you know it says it right there thrips but along the process we use take down like I said this adds the max which I really would rather not use and then this guy right here so yeah finally got it taken care of but by the time I hit them with a fourth spray I honestly I went back-to-back because I didn't want to let a lot of time path so you know like I said you really don't want to spray these plants with those kinds of sprays back to back to back because I'll tell you about these plants even though by the fourth spray I killed the bugs these plants look like [ __ ] I mean they were really hurting their health everything I could really visibly tell the difference in spraying them back-to-back with all these pesticides so yes I finally got rid of the thrips and now I finally know which one works I've never had thrifts so this was a learning experience so as you can see now everything looks really good I'd say it was about a week ago that they looked like [ __ ] so within a week they bounced back just giving them some good nutrient waterings and you know I'm really thankful that they bounced back because you know I really like I said I went really hard with spraying these plants trying to kill these drips and in the process you know I definitely probably stunted or delayed myself here and just grow so at this point I've been bending everything over that you can see we're starting to really fill out a good amount of this space and I'm actually at the point where I'm gonna call it and I'm gonna flip the flower I honestly wanted it to be a little bit more bushy before flipping the flower you know I wanted to fill out a lot of this corner space and you know I mean they're still just spots like right here you know could have another you know a couple nodes in here but it is what it is once we flip the flower everything will push out so as of right now this is the last day of bed and temps are still rocking pretty good without a humidifier so we're gonna go ahead and flip the flower I'm not gonna do leave or I'm not going to touch anything for a couple of weeks you can see I've cleaned up maybe about a week ago the bottoms here so yeah that's not what's going on here you sides the bug issue and the going to war with thrips and then hurting my plants issue everything's going really good I'm excited to get these rocking these have not been turned on yet so I'm gonna drop these down and turn them on really strike in that side light going but yeah other than that stay posted for the updates for flower I definitely will be doing probably a weekly updates just you know for my own personal reference as well as keeping you guys in the loop whoever is interested in these videos so with that being said that's the end of this update and if any questions or anything at all comments suggestions I'm open to anything so ask your questions leave your comments tell me what you think I'm doing them wrong tell me what you think I'm doing right all the above you know I'm not gonna disapprove of any sort of type of comments even the negative ones where I get people talking about all the [ __ ] I you know I do wrong I appreciate that and even though by the time they comments on it its way in the past you still get comments on videos I mean four years ago it still helps me in the learning process so with that being said hope everyone has a good day and I will see you in the next updates", "eQRm5iSBnWk": "happy fall y'all i have today i'm gonna make you guys some homemade apple fritter bread and the reason being is because in fall apples

family but they give me nothing to do with reviews the donuts are good i've been eating their donuts for a while all right peace out fam", "aU2LB1gizN4": "yo what is up youtube it is another update here on the 3x3 growers choice 315 grow so just a quick update it is almost a full weekend of flower this is about uh i think day six or something like that so i gotta double check but around day six almost at the full week it is 8 a.m the lights turn off at 9 a.m so soon it will be the end of the day they're getting ready to sleep so here you can see everything after the first week starting to look pretty healthy once again they were always looking healthy minus that time a couple weeks ago when i sprayed them harsh so everything's looking really good it's doing really good it's filling out the trellis um no complaints haven't seen any major issues um the nutrients and everything seems to be on point i'm not too concerned so i ended up uc i only have one led um i went to go turn on the leds and one of them didn't work pretty upset about that got it on amazon and i actually couldn't return it because my return window closed so i just threw it away honestly i was going to mess with it but it's like a 25 amazon light so i have this one uh i was going to put it in the back i still might do that but at the end of the day it doesn't really matter we'll see what one can do i was going to go buy another one but kind of feeling cheap so this is what it is everything's going really well though um i had one situation where i was messing with the power i flipped the breaker while these they were sleeping so it didn't really matter but i flipped the breaker um and then when i flipped it back on the pump turned on and then i remembered probably uh i think i remembered about two minutes after i turned it back on i was like oh [ __ ] my pump turns on for power you know the pump will turn on nicely because of that feature that's how you can set it up with the automatic timer here which i'm not using yet i'm actually believe it or not i'm still watering everything myself just by pushing the button but i've been trying to baby these plants in the first week and basically after i accidentally flooded them by turning on the breaker i had to deal with that because once again i flooded them and uh had a good amount of water in the tray uh that was probably the only issue that i ran into it was not ideal because it was nighttime and i watered them um enough for there to be a small little you know level of water in this tray and um i didn't water them now for a full day or two i believe it's actually been two days since i watered them since that um they're still pretty heavy but i can feel that they're definitely drier than they were they were fully soaked so just got to be careful of little things like that um you know if you kind of throw everything off track but yeah i just wanted to really just show give a good idea of how they're filling up the space i need to put another trellis in here um you know everything filled in kind of how i wanted it to i bet i could have done a little bit better job filling in spots you know it seems like this area there's a good amount of space but at the end of the day i'm pretty happy with how it's looking everything's looking healthy so that's all i can ask for nutrients and everything is still going really good um the only thing is i have considered switching up my setup right now i have it on a negative pressure so the exhaust fan sucking out air then i have this little little fan down here way down there that's not strong enough to keep up with the top one so i have a negative pressure i was thinking about reversing it to a positive pressure um i don't know i was just going over the scenarios where i think that that might be a more positive thing to do see what i did there all right well uh let me know what you think if you have any opinion on that and that's really it for the week just doing a quick little update on the three by three so everything's going really good super stoked and [ __ ] for a three by three you can really knock out a good little grow all right that's it for me have a good day peace", "EbQ3rZdN4Fo": "hey guys go backs here you might know me from yoga in the park for the reviews I'm out here today came out of my  town down on the other side of Los Angeles so

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what's up YouTube welcome back to Kiwanis kitchen I'm Kiana today I'm gonna share a video with you guys showing you how I make apple fritters cinnamon rolls these cinnamon rolls are so good guys they are man they are so good so I'm gonna go ahead and get you guys set up and we're gonna start on these cinnamon rolls and I am putting in two teaspoons of yeast and this is instant yeast so you don't have to worry about proofing this you can get everything mixed up all together right here and be good to go so you definitely do not have to proof it okay and that was a thick and a half of melted butter that I put in there this is a half a cup of buttermilk and a half a cup of half-and-half in with and because these are apple fritters cinnamon rolls I have some shredded up apples here that I'm gonna get right on in here as well and that is basically 1 cup of shredded apples granny smith apples getting that in there dad the best news to share with you guys I got my labels done they are too cute guys how do I have them within the next week or so hopefully keeping my fingers crossed cuz the person that's doing them for me he do work um have a full-time job and he's just a big help and when he offered to help with these labels I was just like so yeah so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna start getting in some of our dry ingredients and again this is my cinnamon baking powder salt in the flour and just gonna get that mix that bid and then I'm going to switch over to my dog I will put the full recipe down below for you guys on how much of everything that I'm using here okay you're just getting that mixed up and I made a double batch here but again I will put this full recipe down below for you guys to go and get again this is a double batch of cinnamon roll dough I know you guys are kind of wondering why is all that liquid why does all this I forgot to mention that I'm making a double batch of cinnamon roll dough okay okay guys so we're gonna go ahead we're gonna get our flour onto the counter I'm gonna do briefly neat I'm not gonna need it too much okay so I'm just going on the counter here with just some flour and this is just to keep it from sticking okay you don't want to make this big batch like I said you can just pretty much cut the recipe that I put in the description box in half and just kind of you know you wanna do this dough is super soft guys okay super soft so not only are we gonna have apples on the inside of the dough but it's gonna be in between in the filling awesome and you can see all the little specks of Apple figure out my bill here as well not sure many of you had apple fritters or know what I'm talking about but it's pretty much just a donut that has Apple pieces all throughout it and then it's like dipped in some kind of icing or coated with some type of icing okay and that's pretty much all an apple fritter is so that's what we're doing right here with our cinnamon rolls cinnamon apple butter who's complaining right here guys I'm just going ahead normally I would spray my bowl here which I'm cooking spray but I'm just going on top of it now in on my hand with a little bit of oil and this is pretty much just gonna keep help your dough rise if your dough is dry it's not gonna rise okay so you definitely want to make sure it's evenly coated with some type of oil so now we're going to go ahead we're going to let this rise for about an hour and a half and once it's risen you guys back and we'll go ahead and start cutting our cinnamon rolls together alrighty guys so I went on ahead I put my sugar mixture together I actually made a big batch of it and when I make this cinnamon roll dough you know what the apples incorporated I like to use 2 to 3 tablespoons of brown sugar in my mixture and then I go in with the rest sugar and also some cinnamon and again I made a big batch of it as you guys can see right here but I did separate it also because I am again I made a double batch so I'm gonna get some of my shredded apples incorporate it in here as well what I'm gonna do now I have my little grater here earlier okay so I'm just gonna scrape my I bought a total of four really really large granny smith apples okay and I'm just going around just gonna get all of that yummyness shredded right on into my bowl here you guys should see my dough oh my god watch you guys so I'm gonna go ahead and just start getting my apples like incorporate it right on in here okay and again you can go ahead you can cut this recipe in half and put the dough into the freezer or you can go ahead and just make them all up and just individually wrap them into like freezer paper and get them into a freezer bag put them in the freezer and you could just take one out as you need it my bowl is warm and look at that guys my dough has risen beautifully so I'm gonna go ahead get all of that air out and look you can see the little pieces of Apple all throughout here Oh feels so good yes so gonna get this a little flour on my counter here just start rolling out my dog see all the specks of the Apple all throughout your dough here guys these cinnamon rolls gonna be off the chain I guarantee you that I take my butter and I'll just go over the dough with it and if you want to melt your butter when you do this you definitely can but I'm just going on I let my butter come to room temperature and this will be just good right here okay and I want to send out my condolences to the teacher in California and also to the child who lost his life that got caught in the crossfire of what happened in that classroom and I want to say that is just too sad and I send my condolences to both those families okay into all of the other students who had the witness that teacher getting killed and I also want to say that right there makes me real more and more each day of why I'm single they got married the guy who went in there and shot that lady just cold blood like that they got married in January they just got married guys January 8th okay for some reason or whatever no one really knows they separated in March and he did this to her right now in April yesterday this happened yesterday how sad is that I'm just like that is just too freakin said like you think you know somebody and you don't know nobody and look what happens because like I said if things just don't work between people why can't people just go their own separate way I'm just saying why do you have to kill that person why would they have to kill you or whatever the case may be or why why would you want to just cause bodily harm to someone anyway if it don't work it don't work everybody is not for everybody and a lot of people just don't get that and it's just really sad that then lady had to lose her life like that so I got my mixture here and I'm just going over my cinnamon roll dough here the butter part with the apples and this is a brown sugar the apples and the sugar then I got mixed up oh and I also put in a little bit of vanilla extract okay so again you guys know I'll put this recipe down below for you guys and you see the little green specks or whatever that came from when I shred up the Apple it's all good because as you guys know the nutrition is in the skin so it oh no it days in regards to relationships you just never really know that person that you're involved with because lately what I've been seeing is just that these people have been together for years or either months or whatever the case may be and once you get married or once you really get attached with that person or you get close with that person or you've been in a relationship with them for a really long time you start to see sides of them and you find yourself trying to figure out like well who the hell did I just you know am i involved with or who is this person or who is this because they don't show you those sides up front you got the after year together a long time you start to see this net and it's like oh that what's the hell like I know not me so and look at my situation I thought I knew this person and look what look what's going on with me right now that's a clean clear example of why you just don't know how people are they put on the side a good side for you to you know see it if things don't go their way and you know they start or you just don't give in to what they want or need though you just break it off because it's not working look what happened it is just really really sad in regards to that situation and like I said I thought I knew this person that's doing this to me now here on my channel but it's clear I did not and it I just thanked myself every day that I ended that friendship with just ticking time bombs I'm so serious they are really just ticking time bombs and you don't know when that time bomb is gonna go off or what's gonna happen on when is that little button gonna click in the head and they just snap that's why I'm snatch single so just rolling it really tight [Applause] so now I'm just putting my cinnamon rolls and getting them into my pan here and I am gonna have to and I am gonna have to get two pans okay all right so here are my cinnamon rolls I got my other ones into another pan so we got to let these rise again for about another 45 minutes or so and then we're going to get them into the oven and I took out my cream cheese headed in the freezer so that's room temperature and um I got my icing sugar and everything goes for the icing so um we're gonna let these rise and then we're gonna start on our icing and here they are guys I had my cinnamon rolls rising for a total of 45 minutes so we're gonna get these into the oven I have my oven preheated to 350 so we're gonna get these into the oven and we are gonna start on our icing don't they look yummy they have written beautifully look at that swirl in the middle I don't just like it ah sorry guys I said okay just having a moment but we're gonna get these into the oven and here they are guys I had these in the oven for about the same time and I did them for the second rise which is about 45 minutes or so maybe a little under but it was right around that time and as you guys can see they turned out beautiful so I'm just gonna go ahead and let these sit here and we are gonna start on the hair so I went on ahead I started on my icing here I have one package of my cream cheese Philadelphia Cream Cheese here this is like they don't yeah eight ounce package I got that in here and I got some sugar so I'm going to go in and put more in I just wanted to get this mixed up but we're going to use a total of two cups of icing sugar so I got that in there and that's again two cups of icing sugar and 1 package of my cream cheese and I went in with about 2 tablespoons of half-and-half okay and I think that about do it so now we're gonna go ahead and move over to our cinnamon rolls and get them coated all righty so now we're gonna go ahead and get our icing on and I'm not going to use all of this on my cinnamon rolls okay just get it on there and what I like to do is just kind of spread it over my cinnamon rolls to make sure that all of them are coated [Music] I'm gonna go ahead and take one of the cinnamon rolls out so you guys could see how they look on the inside I'm gonna get a bigger little spatula here I try to use the rubber one but that wouldn't work in look at that see how yummy that is how fluffy and moist and look at that brown crust at the bottom turned out perfect and here it is guys my cinnamon rolls turned out perfect you can see how fluffy they are how moist they are so good and you definitely can taste that Apple do you see how that mmm so go get you some coffee these things you are good to go and you see

and then i just fold it over all right now what we're going to need also is half of this can of apple pie filling so what we're going to do is just mix it in that's all we're doing is mixing both ingredients together so you can kind of just toss it in there and add some apple pie filling or you can mix it in a bowl and then dump whichever you whichever you want and dump it right in there i say less dishes right so that's what we're doing here and it's going to expand so you will see that it expands so you can just press it in there and then i want a little bit more pie filling okay i think that's good oh that last piece okay all right then i'll add a couple more pieces on top let me move my spoon you guys look at how easy okay that's what we have so far okay so halfway filled in this small little pen now i'm gonna take some of the cinnamon sugar and sprinkle that on top you don't have to use all of it you can use just a little bit of it and now we can get our ninja footy grill out all right to preheat we're going to want to go ahead and turn on our grill select the bake function at 325 degrees for 15 minutes and we'll be back all right we'll be back at the 10 minute mark just to check up on it and we'll be back oops kind of forgot all right so let's check on them all right needs a little bit more time so give it a few more minutes all right so there's about a minute left but i'll show you guys it's done there oh you can see nice and fluffy we're gonna go ahead and bring it out uh and then add our icing all right so while it is still warm you're going to want to add your icing all around because it's going to melt with that heat so just add it everywhere get the last of it all right we'll go ahead and allow it to cool off and we'll be back just a close-up of the cinnamon bake here all right now we'll do a taste test all right so here we have it you can see and you got the apple let's see if i can focus there we have the apple pie filling right there so good let's try let's do the taste test i already know it's good but so top has a crunch so good you guys and you can basically pull it apart use a fork split it however you want to do it but you guys are just so good it has a crunch on top but it's so soft and fluffy and then you can taste the apple pie mixture in there so good and very easy so you guys make sure you hit that like button hit that

coming back to watch today's video so there are some newer items at mcdonald's and i wanted to give one of them a try i'm gonna be trying the mcdonald's apple fritter when i saw a commercial for him like no way but anyway it's i've never tried this so it is gonna be a first impressions but uh let's see if it's gonna be any good so if you'd like to see if the two dollar apple fritter at mcdonald's is worth it then please keep on watching just so you know i do upload a daily video all about budget food so make sure you subscribe and hit that notification bell you can also bookmark the page if you would like to i'd appreciate it but anyway okay so we have we're finally getting an in-n-out burger here where i live in northern utah and mcdonald's is like we've got like four mcdonald's and like maybe a 10 mile span okay anyway but i i like mcdonald's i love their big macs i like their french fries but when i saw the apple fritter i'm like okay that's weird but they came out with apple fritters blueberry muffins and cinnamon rolls so we're gonna try the apple fritter today like i said it is two dollars which does seem a little bit high to me but you know i don't know i guess like you can go to like your grocery store and get an apple fritter for like 89 cents you know if they're fancy sometimes you can get them even cheaper than that and the paper stuck to it awesome i don't know yeah like this wax paper stuff so okay let's try it okay it smells like an apple fritter i have to be honest it does not look great [Music] okay [Music] it's got good flavor it's really really dense i'm used to like apple fritters from like the grocery store or if you have like a favorite coffee place i'm used to apple fritters being a little bit fluffier i mean yeah they're they're not like a they're not like a raised donut but i don't know this is just really bready which some people probably prefer that but it does have good flavor it tastes um does taste like apple there's no apple pieces in it so it's like apple cinnamon so it is tasty i'm sorry like two bucks for this i mean i'm used to being able to get like apple fritters that are like this big at my local grocery store for less than a dollar so i don't know i think that the mcdonald's apple fritter i think it's overpriced i think that it is too dense in my opinion and uh i mean i guess i understand if you're going there to get coffee like for a dollar then fine but i don't know i just i feel like you can get better for cheaper other places i don't know let me know down below in the comments if you tried the apple fritter from mcdonald's what did you think of it because yeah maybe i just got one that wasn't super great but it's okay like it's not gross um if someone bought me one i would eat it but i don't think i've repurchased this um but yeah also let me know down below if you'd like for me to try the cinnamon roll and the blueberry muffin because i'm totally up for it but yeah it's not bad not the best but it's pretty pricey so anyway but there we go um i hope you enjoyed this short and sweet video if you did please go and give the video a thumbs up and share it let me know down below in

i'd love for you to stick around and hit that subscribe button so you don't miss any of my upcoming what's for dinner videos okay guys let's get into this first one this one is an apple fritter cinnamon roll bake it is super simple and delicious you won't regret making this one so the first thing we're gonna do is chop up these cinnamon rolls set the icing aside set your oven to 350 degrees and we'll get started [Music] okay so now that that's done i'm gonna be adding in about half of this can of apple pie filling and i am going to chop it up into smaller pieces and layer over the top [Music] okay now it's time to take a half a stick of butter 1 3 cup of brown sugar you're gonna melt the butter add the brown sugar mixture don't be like me get a bigger bowl so that way you can actually stir this this was very interesting for me to try to keep this all in this tiny little dish but i successfully managed to do it and once that is all mixed together you are going to just get that all over the top of this dish [Music] this is going to go in the oven for about 30 minutes and when it comes out it will be smelling so delish now you're just gonna whip up the icing and get that on top and enjoy i'll follow you here [Music] [Music] okay let's get right into the second one this one is a low carb pumpkin cheesecake bar recipe these actually turned out really really good so i'll kind of walk you through and as always i will leave the link to this recipe down below in the description box but we started off with two cups of almond flour two teaspoons of cinnamon a third cup of sweetener okay i'm just gonna go ahead and mix this all together and i'm gonna line my baking dish which was an eight by eight with wax paper i'm gonna put it in there melt six tablespoons of butter mix it all together and press it firmly into the pan you can say i lost my mind i will keep on holding my head high even if the sky is falling down [Music] okay once again don't be like me get out your mixer right now um i didn't want to dirty my mixer and have to wash it so i thought i was going to be a tough guy and mix this in this dish that ended very quickly and i busted out my mixer anyways this is the cheesecake layer one package of cream cheese a half a cup of the sweetener and one third cup of a whipped topping i am using the canned stuff because i forgot to defrost my cool whip so i'm making it work falling down i will keep on searching for my eyes okay for the third final layer this is the pumpkin layer one can of pumpkin puree one box of sugar free vanilla pudding mix one third cup of milk and then two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice one teaspoon of vanilla once this is all in here you mix it all together and we're going to layer that on top [Music] [Music] all right you guys it was that simple go ahead and stick this in the freezer for a couple hours when you take it out it'll be nice and firm and you'll be able to cut it and serve it [Music] okay guys i want to thank you so much for watching today's video as always you will be seeing two videos each week for me just remember the best compliment you can give me is a thumbs up on this video and hitting the subscribe button before you go and i'll see you in the next one", "-NjL78M2OYA": "[Music] hi i'm tanya eby and i'm back where i belong in the kitchen drinking wine and complaining okay not really it's 11 a.m so i'm drinking gin hey all right today i'm making something that um i wanted to say i wanted to make either a dessert or i wanted to make breakfast and then caitlyn sent me a recipe that is both it's both breakfast and dessert and man that just blows my mind it's an apple wait cinnamon swirl apple fritter bread oh my gosh i'm so excited now i gotta mix stuff do stuff i'm gonna do that and then i'm gonna eat it yes so i have chopped my apples to little chunks that's really tart all right brown sugar come on out of there okay cinnamon oh that smells good already mix that up so you may be wondering at 11 am why i am still in my pajamas that's the wrong question i actually just put these pajamas on in preparation for tonight when i go to bed at eight so just i'm just looking forward always planning smells delicious now i'm gonna cream some butter and sugar and that takes like five minutes and you really don't want to just watch me um stare at the mixer for that one or maybe you do maybe that could be my next holiday yule log for five minutes i'm gonna do that i'm gonna try this that's not bad all right so i've creamed my butter and i'm gonna add in the eggs one at a time and i uh reread the recipe and i've already made a serious error so really don't watch these for how to do it like follow the recipe on your own because that's probably smarter so i mixed the brown sugar with the apples and i supposed to mix the brown sugar with the cinnamon so uh now i'm gonna have to do that so this might be really sweet we undo you move forward always move forward now i add the dry stuff that i mix together into the wet stuff and i mix that i know this is easy but i'm feeling a lot of pressure and stress it's because i'm not actually drinking gin maybe that maybe that's the problem then okay it's looking bread like almost mixed now i add in the milk it's very handy okay oh it looks good now it's done i think now you get to layer all right all right it looks distinctly batter-like i'm gonna taste it um trying to think if i eat this while i get sick because this is really good now they told me i'm supposed to line this with parchment paper but that's really it's hard to do i didn't really know how to do that so i just tucked that stuff in okay now i do it again oh my gosh i don't know if you can see but it looks pretty good and now just cook the out of it and i'm good at that so see you in an hour you ready to try it pepper okay um oh it looks pretty great smells pretty great got the apples bread do you want to come up you want to come join me richie okay we're going to try it ready close okay it is absolutely perfect for breakfast a little bit apple cinnamon it's actually not too sweet which i was afraid of but you could also have it for dessert because you can do a scoop of ice cream and then it's like apple pie cake ala mode oh [Music] good with a cup of coffee hmm i'm just gonna sit here and eat this um next time more comfort food because i think cause that's what i need okay all right", "0HR93DyWnZI": "come over here and this is the cinnamon roll man make sure if you all get this one that is warm [Music] what's going on

to take a bite out of a Krispy Kreme apple fritter", "XrVr1geWVxE": "good morning and welcome started right before 20. bringing you guys another strain appreciation video now i'm gonna put this down i got a new pipe i'll show you guys that in a second but first off hopefully you guys are all having a blessed day um i definitely am i'm actually in texas right now um at my mom's crib um for the holiday and [ __ ] me and my lady been having a good ass holiday out here had the most christmassy christmas ever if that's like a word um but all in all i've been definitely enjoying my time back home we're probably gonna cut out here tomorrow um yeah either tomorrow or the next day one of them but right now i've got some uh wedding cake flour but the strain appreciation that we're doing today is on apple fritter uh wax so apple fritter solvent free wax um so if you guys are familiar with uh solvents or solvent list solvent list just means that it was extracted not using any salt any like i don't want to say cutting agent because that makes it sound really really you know bad but that's basically what it is um so solventless uh if it's a solvent normally it's like used uh with bho like butane hash are not not that the uh it's usually butane i a [ __ ] morning man but okay here on the front of the apple fritter as you can see the alex jones nice little case for it um it's probably backwards but yeah uh 87.5 for the thc on this one and uh 0.9 of yeah cbd um i honestly like the waxes that are mixed with cbd because i feel like they do a little bit more for you especially if um you're a person that smokes uh for pain mostly uh as i do uh but this is what i did today and let me show you guys this awesome awesome new pipe that i got while i was out here as well sick it's like the eyes of a snake and then this goes all the way around all the way to the front i've almost smoked enough for it to be completely you know light blue right there but let me show you the guy the bowl that we're gonna be smoking on right there you see the piece of wax on top of the bud right there man you know what that's how i've been smoking it when i when i've been out here because i don't have a rig right now um but putting it on here and let it get melt over the bud it actually is [ __ ] phenomenal to me i know a lot of people are like oh that's how you waste it or whatever but i try to take pretty big hits of it and um that particular grab of wax has lasted me um i want to say about four days now like four or five days so hey shout out to the homies uh out here you know without further ado uh a d without further ado hopefully you guys have got your bongs papers edibles blunts whatever you use to adjust your medicine go ahead and take a nice fat rib with me cheers should taste phenomenal i showed you guys that fire holy [ __ ] all right hopefully you guys are stunned by now because i thoroughly am all right also i feel like you get a little bit different uh there we go but the high that you get is a little bit different with its flower and concentrate i feel like it enhances the flower hot does it really uh give you like a complete dab type of experience but definitely takes you up a level um that's not going to chit like that uh but i would say only use the wax when you're like well you're a lot of paid or we need to conserve medicine so that's my next point um i probably got i've been here since the 22nd and yeah better assistant 22nd and i bought a quarter the first day i got here and then a couple days after that i bought another quarter and a couple grams of the apple fritter wax i still have about two grams left to that wedding cake because i literally will put a piece of you know a little piece of wax on top sometimes and that'll like i won't finish the bowl so like this even this bowl like a small bowl i won't finish it so yeah i'll literally have to uh like conserve it it doesn't make you it doesn't make you wasted you know because it just sits there like in your bowl and you can just come back to it but uh it it's the wax you know here isn't that expensive either i don't know where you live at like uh if you live up north i know your shit's [ __ ] 80 100 the [ __ ] grab because the weed up in like philly and new york and [ __ ] like that is too much for the pride for like for the price that they ask it's like not nearly as good as quality is even here in uh texas but i can get my wax for like 30 grand like easily in texas anywhere but that's my spill on if you want to have uh wax with your bud because i do feel like it helps you conserve more if you need to say as if you're on vacation or if you're uh just needed to save you know but as as always appreciate y'all watching uh i'm high as [ __ ] but under it before 20. merry christmas happy new year peace", "kU6IIYdAZuE": "good day why why is that Frank of why where's that review for another edition of C Mon G machina we're gonna eat in the car what do you prefer the apples or blueberry fritters unfortunately Apple is the dominant so I'm gonna have to go with apple fritter as they're widely available everywhere and whatnot but we'll always take a blueberry fritter anyway so on the hunt for the best fritter in the YYZ area and this is probably the last stop obviously if I find any along the way I'll try them sample them and give it to you my fellow subscribers followers and fans so the number one suggested place will even or not comments texts whatsapp's messengers is salami you have to try said animals apple fritter so obviously came down to sell them now so the animals looks like it's a big ball look like it's an apple compared to some of the other ones I had but anyways apple fritter blueberry fritter which do you prefer there we're gonna do this apple fritter from Sodom Oh bakery they're located in Royal York Etobicoke curbside pickup in full effect this was actually an instant order I'd like to thank the team I screwed up I thought you could pick a time for the in-store tour but the instant order is instant and you have to pick it up right away and I had to delay the pickup but anyways besides that let's do that which do you prefer apple fritter mmm you can actually see the chunks of Apple in the fritter listen it's very very good there are two different styles of fritters obviously the best one I found up north is maple the best one I found in Toronto is sabe mo know if you're into size because that's what everything is now everything is bigger go big or go home maple bakery maple bakery also has a better taste and whatnot compliments to Serenno so if it's about taste I'm gonna make it straight and simple now remember I'm not sponsored by normal bakery norsu Rama bakery this is what I'm gonna say both two fantastic family-run bakeries both have great products so what I'm gonna say is between the two pick which one is closer and go there if you're definitely emphasize it's worth the drive to maple as it's two times if not three times bigger than that taste they both taste excellent so leave that up to you why was that Frank of why wise I'd review which do you prefer apple or blueberry for another edition of C managing machina we eat in the car apple fritter edition thanks for watching", "3trOd_Qg4EQ": "this thing on alright it's time we have this talk it's been a while since I've done a report since the last time we've actually had several missions our first one led to us getting our long-range communications antenna it also served as a test for some of our new recruits we had received a distress signal which led us to an old collapse transport tunnel now it became evident that the area was filled with Raiders only one member of the squad that we were sent to rescue survived night orange soda is currently recovering however he will be serving as the base layers on however that mission is not the one that I want to sit her around our last mission was horrible oh the whole day started out ok we did an inspection talk to the troops even recruited a few new people that wanted to come in the first was bullseye a cybernetically augmented earth pony that had to replace one of his limbs he joined up because he had actually found an old set of power armor and wanted to actually serve and then we have scribe ficus he is a senior scribe that came to another faction he reported to us that there's currently been a split in the ranks of the Rangers up north I can't say that we're doing much better down south but at least we're still all Rangers we also had a few other members join up before that but I'm going to hold off on introductions for them because it would take all day to actually go through the ranks I'm sure we'll talk about them at some point for now I'm just talking about the timeline of the mission that day we got our inspections done we managed to get out to the old airbase we had planned to salvage the area hearing that we might be able to obtain a vehicle for transport we weren't the only ones there though the military installation was being maintained by robots there was a sentry bot along with other robots some of which carrying bombs now a paladin sprinkles did his job and led the formation he even gave a proper order to hold off on any attacks until they show that they're hostile and as soon as we approached the robot said surrender for execution and armed their weapons so what our troops do they've refrained from firing and when they do none of them focus fire and since I actually shot first I got targeted first by the robots I got hit with 14 bullets six of which had to be pulled out of me my left eye is also now made of glass now I'm not gonna put the blame on just one pony what I'm gonna put the blame on is insufficient training and discipline because after I was knocked out of the ranks they decided to start using those bombs we had to retreat and I get that sometimes that might happen but the circumstances leading up to it are unacceptable at this time these are my orders paladin blueberry sprinkles senior night rocky road the two of you are going to be responsible for holding training sessions Proctor Tenderheart you're gonna be responsible for the next salvage operation if we're gonna go back to that airfield we're gonna do it right I want our troops to be able to focus fire on the same target and I want them to be able to do so with some cover in the field even if we have to build it ourselves this is apple fritter signing out you", "CpDY4gR2byg": "I so there's Liana getting our apples all we're stuck it's gonna be awesome thank you so much it's all about teamwork waters getting there sorry waiting on and I'm boiling the water right now actually it is boiling so I could shut that off that's gonna go into our beaker and I'm gonna put the yeast in there once I get it cooled back down to 80 and then let the yeast wake up start warming up a little bit and then we'll go ahead and get that pitch in there once we get everything else up but this is just the bare-bones we're just warming up right now and I got a new giant spoon okay if you want to spend somebody this is the spoon yeah action okay so what we're doing is now I'm gonna be adding yeast into our beaker to start warming but this is red star a premier Blanc it's actually for wine but we're gonna be using it for the hard seltzer right here have also been sanitized this has been sanitized and the water that's in here you guys are earlier I've boiled the water for and then we brought it down to 80 degrees in the sink to make sure it's nice and just we want it at the perfect temperature for our yeast to grow and then what we're going to be doing over the next hour two hours while we're getting the rest of our brew going is we're just going to be stirring this up every now and then because I didn't spend a hundred dollars on one of those spinning plates stir plates stir plates they go that's very good alright because I'm wackadoo I've completely changed my entire idea of what I want to do today like in the last two minutes I'm completely redoing the whole thing we still end up with the same result but I want to change some stuff first of all I'm going to do the apples like you do with hops I'm gonna put them in there on a boil and get that flavor and get everything out of the apples and then strain them off that way it's not sitting in the fermenter for two weeks because I realize that I'm gonna have no idea what this is gonna taste like and unless I do it all now before it goes in the fermenter and we have to dial in the flavor for the butter the flavor for the crispness the cinnamon the apple I have to dial in all that before we just throw it in there and just hope for the best because this isn't just a lemon lime Seltzer or you know a single flavored seltzer we're just like ah screw it okay we just threw in an extract that's not great this is actually we're building it an apple fritter inside of a alcoholic beverage so I scratch all that the water just kept on boiling we're gonna throw in the the Apple saw the apples now and I'm gonna start off with one cinnamon stick I'm looking for like you know just like four or five grams and we're gonna let that boil for about 20 minutes and then I'm gonna pull a little bit off it see what it tastes like add in our butter extract but I'm gonna keep building the flavor as we go here because it just dawned on me that I didn't want to wait you know three weeks and then taste it and be like always just wasted ten gallons of so that's not gonna happen so we're gonna go ahead get our 10 pounds of sugar in there first right off the bat and then the applesauce and then I'm gonna throw in the first cinnamon stick I'm gonna wait out just so we get a little more exact than just you know guessing and we're gonna let that sit for about 20 minutes and then we're going to go ahead and pull a little bit off it see what it tastes like and then build the rest of the recipe from theirs I'm throwing everything else out the window this is all going to be done on the fly sure yeah so we'd like to try a lot of different kind of beers here at the house I mean we've gone through everything from ales Porter stouts for everything personally my favorite is genis their new Guinness Guinness bottles have got that full length sleeve label on them and that is the closest I have ever had to drinking a Guinness from the brewery there I travelled a few years ago to Ireland to do a fight and then again the next year and went back again it's just it's such a beautiful place and there's a lot of amazing stuff while I was there well we'd ever went to the Guinness brewery and actually became a certified I don't know why did their quotes I'm sorry I became a certified Guinness poorer I've actually got a coulis difficut for everything but the beer there is by far their best because I mean it's right there off the tap I mean if you can't have it from the air brewery on their tap there's nothing better over the years I guess shipping has gotten better or faster or they found new ways to shipper and bawl their stuff but man that one that that's out right now if you find it with like the full length sleeve I don't have one because we drank them all this is just another one of the box we like to taste everybody's beers but that is the best Guinness I've ever had since I've been to Ireland so props on them however they're shipping and bottling it now that's better but it's it's spot-on perfect it's just wonderful anyways this is another one that we tried is called harp for my friends out there in Ireland you know I got a trial or your beers when I get the chance so this was called the harp lager it's not bad it's not what I was expecting is still it's still a good beer but it was the last beer we had in the fridge and I just got a drink beer while you're brewing beer so actually Leanna's I ran to the store real quick to pick up still a couple of things because since I just decided I took our whole plan that I've been working on all week and threw it out the window and did my own thing she had to run to the store real quick to go pick up some more stuff and Shawn's in there playing Borderlands 2 rocking it on the Xbox so if you're a fan we played video games too who's going to be a big part of our brewery which is gonna be awesome that we're gonna have like tricking pinball machines video arcade games board games gonna be a place where you can come hang out and have a great time so yeah we also nerd out ourselves anyways so right now what I've got in there boiling in our hop phase even though we have no hops is ten pounds of sugar one pounds of apple eight grams of the calcium chloride to help clean up our water a little bit here and then we've got six grams a cinnamon stick in there I'm trying to see how it's gonna work in the boil and this parts going for twenty minutes and like I said from there we'll make all of our adjustments out so if I need to extend the boil longer or if we need to add more ingredients one pounds really like considering there's seven gallons of water right there right now so but we have plenty more that's big ole bull push you want to get another bag apples in case I really need to get crazy and like dump like ten more pounds of apples in there so we have plenty everything that so that's where we're at right now I've got it up there it's doing a full roll boil roll rolling boil and I'm making sure I start because I know they've got the sugar in there and I want that to start like sticking anything so that's what's up alright there's Tom playing with our our yeast that we've got going it's starting to actually come up really nice and we just finished up the first twenty minute boil and after we both tasted it we decided we're gonna go we're gonna add 13 ounces more of apples another five grams cinnamon stick and a half an ounce of the butter extracts and now the butter extracts going in there but it's not quite where I wanted to be yes around we have all these ingredients in we're gonna let it boil another 20 give it another taste again and see where we're at because first pour that butter actually it was really strong but that was because it was hitting the air and then immediately into our faces so maybe it's gonna smooth out a little bit it was good but I just wanna see what it's gonna end up after the boil so we'll check back one more time after that and it's so far so good everything's looking really good chiller down in here I just killed the boil so that way it'll have a few minutes to sterilize make sure everything's nice and clean and this will be our first time testing this as well we've now been through a 40 minute boil I've got our test sample cooling down here right now I'm going to go ahead and taste that so you were right but the smell is fantastic it's spot-on I ate the other little apple pie that you guys saw in the other video yesterday and I couldn't honestly tell the difference when I when I tasted it it was it was spot-on for it so I'm really really happy really excited for that so we've got the the wort chiller down inside here we're gonna bring over the pump set up our bucket with the ice water that we were pumping and cycling through like other guys that will tell you cleaning is 100% priority like I've always been a semi clean person you know and you clean up before people walk in but ever since I started doing this do it now I'm like in it I'm constantly cleaning making sure that everything is good and sanitized and there's an obscene something a sanitized something that's sterilized so I'll make sure that you like all the surfaces are bleached down before we get started in the morning wipe everything clean we use the stars' and and sanitize all of our equipment before we start anything anything that's not sanitized guests boil the other way so everything in here we make sure everything's clean and everything is ready to go because we want to produce a great product you know it's all any form bacterias that you get in there can change your flavor can you give characteristics to your beer that you just don't want you want to make sure everything's good to go we're gonna go ahead and finish hooking up the pump now so we can get this cooled down as fast as possible and we'll get back to you all right so as you can see there's our ice water that we're going to be using and there's our return line that's going to come out of the wort chiller and here's our wort and wort chiller yay so everything's good to go now we got to do is we got a prime the pump before we start it that's why that it's disconnected at the moment and I've already got our sample for the gravity pulled off and city these are just chillin a little bit so we needed to be room temperature and then I'm gonna get our OG and we're shooting for like a 1.04 I'm hoping one forty two point zero four zero I think hold up okay so this is a little louder than I thought it was going to be but there's our return [Music] okay no it's not terrible yet got a little pump it good this water right here ice creaking cold with water coming out of here nice and one so it's legit working and I'm gonna go ahead and measure how long it takes to bring us down to temp but this is looking really cool so it will just know for future reference that it's gonna be a little loud so all kinds of happened and we're only on a half inch line instead of a three quarter inch line for a pump but I figured since it was only one sixteenth horsepower motor that a half-inch should be fine and the hose just got kinked up for a second and it was just enough to cause the pressure I was expanded started ballooning out really bad so we had to shut off the pump pull everything in that we're back to doing it in the sink with ice again so a lot of it fix we're gonna go up to the three quarter inch line so that won't be an issue but you know happens even sometimes bad things happen but we got it in here no big issue which does a mess everywhere a bunch of water and we're trying to clean everything up right now the first batch is about ready to go to a carboy the second half it's still on the bigger one with the lid on hoping that we won't have any issues with how long it's taking it to cool that we don't get an infection which is why I'm doing two separate carboys and then taste them at the end make sure that both of them are still okay and if we if this one because of how slowly it's gonna cool because we gotta wait till this one's done to do that one then I'll know and it all on behalf the bachelor land and since we're doing ten gallon stuff bugging us now we still meet the minimum output we were doing before all right we got another new toy we've got another new toy we're trying to figure out right now the carboy carrier thing a lot easier to carry all right there goes the first five gallon and the second five gallon is almost done chilling now I'm gonna come get the door for you oh it's already open never mind oh yeah a little light I'll go down into the dirt Dirk remember if you fall turn so that way the beer isn't ruined or at the very least we don't share the carboy right yeah don't you oh god that thing's like 50 bucks oh yeah right no biggie it's cool all right second half of the batch is all done and in the carboy and we already got the yeast nutrient in there with it yeasts already been pitched we're gonna get it shooken up here some aeration on the way down the stairs Sean's over there putting our vodka in the airlock because we like to use vodka just because it's alcohol right they think we're funny when we go to the store and we buy cheap bottom shelf vodka and then we buy some nice high quality vodka and they're like why do you have two different kinds and we're like Shh y'all don't know right ere locking so that's the end of this brew day we have very much cleaning up to do but I'll tell you what's crazy this stuff turned out to be some amazing applesauce we've been sitting here like just eating it oh my god this is so good that's really I gotta help him do work okay", "SKi4NQlGsPw": "[Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] hello everybody and welcome to another edition of drew's food reviews and today i've got another episode of what's new what's new is over at mcdonald's they've got three new mccafe items uh that they serve all day and um the first one is the cinnamon roll the second one is a apple fritter and then also a blueberry muffin and um i've tried the other ones but i'm going to try this one this is the apple fritter i love apple fritters um so i'm going to give this one a try it was 219 for this one and we're going to see how it tastes like i said um you could get these all day uh it's just a matte cafe item and um here we go so when you order it you get it comes in a little paper bag but this is the apple fritter you can kind of see that glaze kind of all over i don't know why but i don't know if this is the bottom or not but they kind of got the glaze on the bottom but you can see how that um is kind of around there and it's just little bits of the apple or little bits of the dough and then it's got the apple kind of cinnamon sugar in between there and then they kind of stick them together it's in pieces but here we go apple fritter from mcdonald's [Music] good bit of apple fritter [Music] the little pieces of donut or dough or whatever are in between there definitely pretty good there is a good amount of glaze on there i can taste that glazing on there also i could taste the cinnamon sugar the little bits of the apple kind of filling in between it is nice and moist the dough itself is not hard a lot of time they're over fried nice and true i like that i might would go for this one again um yeah and sitting in the sitting in the um the glazing kind of makes it a little bit um moist on the bottom but that's what she said it is pretty good a decent size for you know 219 would i get this one again i don't know i've been to the donut stores and i usually get like apple fritter and they're like twice the size for basically the same price but if you're in a hurry and you want to go through mcdonald's on the way to wherever in the morning and pick up something really quick this would be a good option but that's always not too bad um the glaze is a little bit a little bit sweet but most of the time that's how it is so when i get this apple fritter again um maybe if i was kind of in the apple fritter mood but i don't know i i think i like the apple fritters from an actual donut store a little bit better but this one's not too bad so for that one the apple fritter from mcdonald's mccafe uh i'll give that one i'll give it a seven seven out of 11. [Music] it's pretty good it's got good apple flavor it's not my favorite one but it is good like i said go ahead and give them all one of the um items a try find out what one you like the best and uh yes go back and get it the second time it's a little bit different alternative to the the apple pies or the uh the mcflurries or the milkshakes so there you go yeah if you find yourself in the mood for an apple fritter or any kind of uh breakfast items go on down to mcdonald's and give one of them a try um like i said i'm not usually not usually a dessert person but anyways i thought i would give all the mccafe items a try over at mcdonald's so anyways if you liked the video give it a thumbs up don't forget to hit the subscribe and the notification bell over here that way you won't miss

today i'm losing my wig [Music] you", "uHrKxgljKJg": "[Music] hey guys today we are going to be comparing tim morton's apple fritters and mcdonald's tiny mini donuts apple fritters now we're gonna try mcdonald's aqua fritters donuts a bit so what do you guys think which one is better tim questions this one i personally think two more times [Music] so [Music] tim hortons it's fluffier or airy reminds me of cinnamon bun more sugar icing [Music] mcdonald's it's sweeter more dense there is apple chunks [Music] stronger apple flavor [Music] you", "JGKB-5q_Qjw": "sweet Celestia you think I can catch a break this week has sucked and it all started with an argument about birthdays you see I was talking to the others and they don't celebrate them and I can get the idea of it being a waste of resources as they might say when you get older the wasteland doesn't exactly supply you with a lot to actually throw a party but I felt like everypony jumped down my throat I let it go but it led to things that were even worse that day we did have some good luck we teamed up with some of the residents in the town and a few pegasi that are coming from a group called the shadowbolts from what I understand their ex Enclave members we all went back to the airfield and we finally beat that sentry bot so you know this is our third time going there our first two encounters were not very productive so you think that would have been the hard part right we regroup didn't search the entire airstrip looking into the air-traffic control area we were able to access the terminals and get records of what was going on during the war this led us to bunker number three you see back then the bombs were about to drop so they took the locals and put them into the bunker the military was trying to protect the populace I get that but they didn't anticipate the balefire bombs so we take the elevator down and we hope to hit the basement pretty soon and of course wouldn't you know it all the ponies were in a subsection that turned into goals we ran down to the basement and set up defenses using whatever two-hundred-year-old technology was left down there we survived at the expense of using half of what we had gone down there to get thankfully everybody survived however when we returned to the base I had a knife stuck in my back you see paladin sprinkles had apparently been talking to one of the Applejack's Rangers contingents right after the mission he talked to me about how immature I was and told me that I wasn't the one that should be elder he did offer me a position as a proctor under him as the new elder now I know I'm not mature I know I have a lot of issues that I've been trying to iron out while being the elder of this contingent but what he did was desertion and he broke my trust by not telling me he had been in contact with them for more than a week by the end of it I almost shot him and before anybody starts yelling at me I've already been yelled at a lot at this point I'm not done with the story yet I had a lot of thinking to do after that happened for almost a week I had spent time talking to other Rangers in the contingent we were split and I was wondering if we were gonna end up with the same war that was going on up north one of which was snow blind one of the Vancouver contingent that joined us she was understanding and spent time helping me reason out a good part of what was going on apparently some of the other Rangers had been talking to jenk about their thoughts of might less than mature actions this prompted me to have another discussion you see the Roanoke area does not have any official leader the closest that they have to any royal blood ties is some sort of experiment that happened a long time ago she's not like the Alec horns up north and the ponies of this region trust her we have the steel rangers of Roanoke had already chosen to follow her to some extent her name is e'r'day she claims not to be a leader but Ponies follow her just the same I know this isn't something that we would normally do but I went to talk to her by the end of it she heard me out and felt that it was better for us to work together so I made my decision at this time i abdicate my position as the elder of the steel rangers contingent we are disbanding and we are merging with the Applejack's Rangers I'll be taking a position as Proctor advising the new elder blueberry sprinkles in his position however I want to put this on record blueberry sprinkles is not experienced as an elder he is a good tactician and I did trust him to some extent however he has a lot of baggage and just as I could be considered immature for actually acting on my emotions he's guilty for showing almost none he's the extreme opposite our last talk actually made that apparent however I need to put my emotions aside and to actually work with him and the other Rangers regardless of what title we take up we all have to work together in order to survive so with recent events out of the way I should quickly recap some of the things that we're going on I spotted meanness in the area creepy blood mage cult leader if anypony else sees this person they are not to interact with them do not talk to them do not attack them do not do anything that will goat some negative response they will straight-up murder you and to put things in perspective a few weeks back we had some alec horns that showed up the Alcorn's came into the town in numbers they had set up in the area as a defensive position thinking that they could try to hold out while meatus was there they did not survive now it normally takes several suits of power armor in order to take down one alicorn we just have down for alicorns in one night this is a ancient abomination and threat to the existence of the town's folk a good number of them had closed themselves up in their homes fearing to be slaughtered while he was walking the streets do not put yourself in danger and do not endanger the town leave him alone if you are to see him coming or if you see them interacting with any specific towns folk turn around and report it to your superior now on to the next part snowblind will be giving us a report pretty soon apparently there's someone known as mr. diplomacy who's using a group of X Rangers as a mercenary group once the reports are sorted out I'll have her do her own video lock lastly I have to make a public announcement the following names are things you do not call senior night rocky roads send your ice cream pants Grandpop badonkadonk the floof inator the bearded bronco mr. personality at this time I have been informed by senior night rocky roads that it is not okay to call him any of those things ever seriously don't call him any of that he doesn't like nicknames and he really got angry at me I mean the pony who did that this is apple fritter signing off [Music]", "yQcwdQ8NSjQ": "hey folks it's eric here with whatever guy because it really is whatever with me here to talk to you about the chill brand delta eight thc bait cartridge uh apple fritter flavor um and if you will do me a favor and like and subscribe and stick around to the end of the video i will tell you how you can win yourself a brand new uh vape cartridge from delta farms i'll order that from vapeful supply on christmas day for a winter you got a really good chance of winning this because i don't have a thousand followers um you can check that out if you stick around if you like and subscribe stick around in the video i'll tell you how you can get on there okay so today we're doing a uh review on chill brand's apple fritter vape cartridge delta at sea based cartridge and i had um talked to you guys about them yesterday i did a banana kush yesterday um previous to that my girl had ordered from them um uh last thursday night which would have been thanksgiving night she ordered at nine o'clock um and they advertised two days shipping on their um on their site and so the cars were 70 off and somebody put me on something they were really good brands so i said you know go ahead and do that so thinking that i you know that they would be back into work friday you know friday morning saturday get my order you know run and then you know i possibly have my order monday or tuesday and i would have you know two three days to do vape cars because um they advertised the two days shipping for orders over a hundred dollars and i obviously got over 100 um point of fact was that i actually didn't get my order until thursday night at nine o'clock i was at ups fault um it's just the fault of diamond cbd not having a skeleton crew on friday and saturday or not uh you know loving their employees enough to go around and ask somebody you know they need the money and maybe work some overtime i mean that's that's the way i was when i was uh you know in charge of things you know where i was running and maybe maybe i'm wrong y'all tell me uh regardless of all that um i would have liked to have got my water monday or tuesday like the advertising alluded to um i didn't get that and so i ended up doing some other reviews uh so i've got a bunch of stuff from chill uh from from diamond cbd but i i just i'm not gonna have time to do them because what's gonna happen is i'm going to get another order in and they're going to take a back door step or a back step you know and then i'll just have to get to them when i get time and it's a shame because they have a really really good product so i like i said yesterday i did oh i'm banana kush about an hour after i got the package in and i told you that the banana kush was um a really intriguing card because it was like when you hit the vape card it was the very first time every time um a lot of times when you hit these vape cards what will happen is like two or three four hits into it you just won't get that taste anymore until you put it down and then maybe pick it back up and you get it again on that first hit with banana cushion i was getting the same hit every single time and that was really crazy to me and it was a really good high and i ended up vaping that throughout the night and into the day um and now what i'm on is this apple fritter excuse me okay and this apple fritter is a really intriguing flavor also it took me a second when i hit this to realize that i was easy on a high because it eased me in so slow um this is something that you can hit throughout the day again the flavor is there man i don't know what they're doing with their carts that are different than the other ones like i said i love vapor supply they have a really premium car they've got good flavor on theirs and their card design i'd have to give chill brand a heads up or a thumbs up simply because their flavor lasts throughout the cart um i don't you know throughout the hit and i'm obviously not to the end of it but i've hit this thing probably 15 20 times and it's extremely uh apple fritter it's got like a cinnamon um kind of cinnamon hits down in your throat and you get like a almost like an apple pie type of thing going on and it's a really good flavor man i'm really intrigued about these carts man simply because they're easing me into a good high it's something that i can work with all day long and they got good flavor too man and that's crazy so for a lot i would imagine this would appeal to a lot of the women out there because you know they love the fruity flavors and stuff like that this apple fritter and that banana kush yesterday with a bomb um they're really good flavors uh really light high no anxiety no paranoia and i'm really where i want to be hey folks y'all check it out man uh like i said if you'll stick around to the end and this is the end so i'm giving away one of these vape cards on christmas day uh to one of my viewers um if you'll look down in the bottom there'll be a little thing for giveaway if you'll get on that on

tastes kind of it tastes fruity and metallic I don't know how to explain it that's the only thing I can metallic you guys have had a piece of metal in your mouth maybe a point or something and you taste that metal taste now imagine that with earthiness and a slight undertone of gas because the gas is harsh on my throat I can taste it and it's got an oily aftertaste on the back of my throat I'm trying to give you guys an in-depth of what my flavor what my taste buds are going through you know what I'm saying the best way that I can explain it I can't say that um yeah you ever licked the tip of a unicorn's horn and cried at the same time and that taste right there I can't get too in-depth like that would you guys because I've licked the tip of a [ __ ] unicorn horn and it didn't make me gay either anyway uh so that's what it tastes like you taste some fruity earthy and metallic yeah what a slight burn on the end of it I would assume that this is you know this is a hard one because I can't say that this is dispensary grade it's street grade but this is one of the fire street grades that my homeboy was talking about in the comment section this is one of the fire street grades yes now I never said that day that you can own that that's the only place that you can get good buddies is in the [ __ ] dispensary but I know that 100% of the time when I go to the dispensary in California I'm getting good bud 100% of the time now if I get if I get bud on the street I might get good but on the street maybe seventy five eighty percent of the time there's a chance that you're gonna get some [ __ ] you ever had somebody that looks so [ __ ] good man [ __ ] like you too hard I'm just eat that [ __ ] right there man that [ __ ] look so delicious you packed that [ __ ] in your bowl yet palms are sweating yeah hit a sweat you're thinking of how good it's gonna be the hit this [ __ ] threw the ball and you like that [ __ ] up [ __ ] that [ __ ] and you think you [ __ ] your boner cuz you smoking some [ __ ] but it looks so [ __ ] tasty and delicious thanks that's what can happen if you get somebody off the street but if I get some out the [ __ ] of out of the dispensary I guarantee if I ever get bad but up the [ __ ] this printer I'm taking that [ __ ] back and guess what they're gonna give my [ __ ] money back or give me a [ __ ] uh a reasonable substitute I promise you but time rolling on the corner I try to take some bud back to that [ __ ] man and I got shot at of this playbook you get my point yes you can't get excellent but off the street I'll never knock it because that's somewhere I've got some of my best bud from street vendors but street vendors in Florida because you get something out of the dispensary out here man when I give this I gave this a time hop I'm high do I look like anyway I got high up apple fritter then did the [ __ ] anyway uh uh I forgot what I'm gonna say I gave it an 8 didn't I yes I gave this flavor eight damn y'all this book took me there I was like what the [ __ ] something cruel there in the corner I thought it was a mouse but it was moving too slow I've seen it out my my peripheral was working y'all never had your peripheral take the day off you ever they see it my peripheral was on point and it was like hey so I'm crawling over it in the goddamn corner [ __ ] look just I'm high oh so I give that a 8 let's go you got stuff for a second denied all right mr. lizard stop crawling back and forth you're distracting me or come smoke [ __ ] you don't know me I don't mess with animals too much man I mess with a dog or kick [ __ ] out of a cat I will not keep your cat so it does don't take that to heart but I'm messing with some dolls and stuff but anything else a snake hail to the no listen y'all there's only one species of snake in my mind and that's a [ __ ] rattlesnake they're all rattlesnakes and they all have them they're all just super poisonous even Black Mambazo rattlesnakes they're all rattlesnakes there's not one non poisonous snake in the world in my mind not one they're all poison is so I stay the [ __ ] away from all of them you're just like I don't really go to the zoo man I took my kids to the zoo it's like 20 years ago man take your kids to the zoo Bob you know what animals are unpredictable they brought this big-ass elephant out there we're sitting up there I'm looking at this elephant like you know this [ __ ] just decided to snap he's not [ __ ] chalky do and y'all got him outside the cage or we're sitting in an amphitheater looking down on him he's just walking around his little feet selling moccasins strutting across the floor and [ __ ] and I was like come on man look two minutes and all setting up he will hold him with a little chain and [ __ ] and do like tapping him in the butt with a little stick you know they didn't have the hooks cuz you know that's illegal hey tapping him with a little stick and [ __ ] a little uh-oh Indian news was tapping

No, I'm only sure that\nsomeone from the Wilson home called a phone at this location. I mean,\nit can't be Paul. He can't breathe,\nso he leaves the hospital and orders a muffin?\nIt doesn't make sense. Only one way to find out. Hi. Excuse me. Uh, do you know this man?\nHis name is Paul Wilson. Never seen him before. Well, maybe you\nhaven't seen him, but we believe he called here\nabout an hour ago. No one's called me all day.\nYou must be in the wrong place. What was that number again? Hang on. (dialing) (phone ringing) It's coming from the back. Hey, no, you're not\ngoing back there. We're trying to\nsave a life. Move. (phone ringing) (woman speaking indistinctly) Looks like an underground\nmedical clinic. See, now that makes sense. Hey, Doc. How did you get in here? This is a really nice place.\nI'm guessing it's not, uh, what's the word... legal. I am a doctor. I'm just not licensed\nin the U.S. But these people,\nthey can't afford proper care. They need me. My place. Look, we're not here\nto give you any trouble. We are just looking\nfor Paul Wilson. He was here, wasn't he? He's a good kid.\nJust needed help. Well, we're trying\nto help him. If he doesn't get surgery, he could die. I know. I said the same thing. But they wouldn't hear it. Left. You said \"they.\" Paul was with his brother,\nTanner. Well, this isn't exactly\nan easy place to find. How did they know to come here? Because I helped them\nonce before, 12 years ago. (raspy breathing) He got shot. Bullet's wedged\nin a tough spot. Doesn't seem like it\nhit any vital organs. I can leave the bullet\nand patch him up, but I can't guarantee\nhe'll be okay. I urge you to go\nto the hospital. We can't. Any idea who the shooter is? One of the draws of this place\nis that I just want to help people, so I don't ask\ntoo many questions. Mr. Wilson's child was shot. What could possibly justify not\ngoing straight to a hospital?

paper you're watching vaping with Lisa the show that vapes tastes and rates the best ages around the world today we're going to focus on apple fritter by Maude sauce before we get started let's take a look at the bottle and go over some juicy details [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] apple fritter is a mouth-watering blend of apples and cinnamon and then finished in a glaze creating that classic doughnut taste and as you're well aware I did just eat an apple fritter doughnut so what perfect time to compare this flavor to the actual doughnut I'm going to try this out today in 3 milligrams well I'd say they did a pretty good job because it was very similar the Apple is a nice refreshing sweet apple and the cinnamon has the perfect touch and it blends very nicely with the glaze the glaze definitely helps creating that smooth exhale leaving just a little hint of cream not too shabby I'd say the only thing missing the only thing missing is physically chewing on a doughnut so with that being said I think it's time to rate this flavor for the overall look I'm going to give this one an eight point seven out of ten the gloss finish makes a local really shine on the white background for the taste I'm going to rate this one a nine point three out of ten this flavor was spot-on they didn't overdo this in a minute so it blends really well with the apple and glaze for my experience I'm going to rate this one and nine point one out of ten I was very satisfied with how similar this flavor is to the actual doughnut for the cloud you're going to give this one a nine point zero out of ten the 80/20 blend made the club very smooth and filled the room full of vapor if you love apple fritter doughnuts and you're trying to cut out a little bit of sugar in your lights definitely grab a bottle of apple fritter by Maude sauce I can almost guarantee that you'll satisfy that craving this flavor is available now at True North vapor

act for the apple fretta to follow okay the blueberry muffin was phenomenal the cinnamon roll phenomenal this subpar good with that said i am going to give the apple fritta out of five the score of [Music] 3.8 out of five the cinnamon roll the decadence of that one was great it was dense the apple fritter was not as dense so out of all three i will say that the cinnamon roll to me is my number

fritter now we tried other opportunities around town and i'm really having a hard time trying to figure the best one but i'm in my mind i think this is the best apple fritter in town i mean it's hard to see it but it's on there it's probably hard to see there's so much glaze on it it's popping up the camera so it's making it hard for you to see it too but i promise you the apples is on there the cinnamon is on there that glaze is for show on there you can see it but i just love it because look how soft it is that's hard to beat so to me this is the best apple fritter in town now let me know what you think", "SMjL2bP6U8A": "[Music] good morning everyone and welcome to bonnie's kitchen uh wondering what kind of a week you've had mine's been kind of rough so sometimes when i try to push myself when i'm not feeling so good or that i do things that cause me to relax and you know and something that would uh just maybe bring some life back into this old body of mine so today we're going i'm going to bake so um i find baking very relaxing therapeutic and not only the mixing of everything but the smell of everything so join me today because we're going to make amish apple fritter loaf i have some apples that i got to use up and i don't want to throw out so that's what's inspired me to bake this so join me today and let's get baking okay when you're in my kitchen i carry through just like i would normally do so join me and have some fun so what i've done for this apple fritter bread i've already chopped two cups of apples and to that i've added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a tablespoon of white sugar so i've got that ready and then i've already buttered greased or if you want to use your vegetable spray use that a loaf pan okay so let's get started so i'm using my food processor today i have down here i don't know if you can see it is my big croc of flower you see that needs to be filled up but that's always at my feet so i'm ready to go so here we go so what i've got i'm going to do the batter first so in this batter i have one third excuse me a half a cup of um margarine or butter whatever you have i'm gonna put that in my food processor and to that i'm gonna cream two thirds of a cup of granulated sugar so this is a third cup and two thirds and we will cream that i'm wondering what you do to maybe get yourself going to get motivated what are the things you do this is one thing that i do is bake so uh now what i'm going to do is that's creaming i'm adding two eggs and cream that okay to that batter that i'm mixing here i'm adding about a teaspoon of vanilla what you heard is the beef of my oven and i've preheated my oven to 350 so that it's all ready to go now to that i'm going to add one and a half cups of flour and it also calls for 2 teaspoons of baking powder so i'm just going and what i like to do is add my baking powder to the flour so that two teaspoons of baking powder i'm gonna add to my flour mixture and i need a half and just mix that and now that once that's creamed i'm going to add a half a cup of milk [Music] i don't know at this time of the year or any time the smell of cinnamon and that is just so comforting isn't it nutmeg so it's so good all right all right all right so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to in my loaf pan i'm going to spread half of this batter in the bottom do you love apple fritters oh we have a bakery just not far from here and i'm telling you when i go there if those fritters are warm is the hardest thing to resist so i'm just putting a little bit of that batter in the bottom and then on top i'm spreading half of my apples okay and now what i'm going to do is pour the rest of that batter and spread that as evenly as you can on top you know baking is not hard it it doesn't take long to put pull a small cake and you know what even if you don't do it from scratch pull out a cake mix add a few extra goodies to that cake mix and make it your own just enjoy it now what i'm going to do is the rest of the apples i'm going to spread on top and i'm just going to push that down now in this bowl i have a third cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon and i'm gonna sprinkle that all on top i'm going to pat that down okay so this is going in the oven probably clo about 45 minutes i will keep checking it when that comes a toothpick or a skewer comes out clean you know it's done so it's going to go into the oven and we'll see what it looks like when we're when it's done all right everyone well here's my amish apple fritter loaf and it took about 40 50 minutes in the oven but i have a convection oven so probably you should if you have a regular oven you should do maybe an hour and uh i let it cool in the pan for about 30 minutes and then when it was cooled i made a glaze and the glaze was a half a cup of icing sugar and a tablespoon of milk and that was just drizzled over the top so there you go use up your apples and enjoy that give it a try i'd love to know if you do try any of these recipes and i'd love to hear from you so you have a good day and um enjoy every moment of your day god bless bye for now", "gOiUgFaOQXU": "[Music] [Music]

video today what I want to be doing maybe it's gonna be like a miniseries or something is reviewing apple fritters so apple fritters are fried pastry that I really like as a kid I've never liked them when they get doughnuts from this place near my house called coffee and my mom would always get them but I always thought they looked weird so I didn't want to eat them I just stuck to like the normal doughnuts then as I got older at some point I just decided to try one got an apple fritter I really loved it so since then anytime we go to a donut place or a place that offers apple fritters I get one to try it to compare to like my standard and my standard is the same donut place that we got donuts from when I was a kid coffee which is closed now so I'll never be able to have when they're delicious apple fritters but I still kind of have that as standard in my head so this particular apple fritter is from Whole Foods yeah we're gonna wanna try it for you all gonna let you know what I think just kind of going over it so it's a decent shape it you can see it has this icing on top on so there's two different items I guess there's an icing that's like kind of transparent and shiny and then there is this alright I guess that's a glaze the transparent shiny one then there's the icing which is white the icing seems more decorative to anything just given how little of it that there is so I guess it's just meant to make it look more appealing the shape of that before those okay I'm used to like maybe more like nodules and more of an irregular surface whereas this surface it's kind of regular it's not like kind of different parts in a sense let's break it open so it opens really well you can see the interior kind of looks like a doughnut it doesn't look like bread I've had I have a fragrance that we're kind of bready which weren't very good doesn't seem like it's greasy so these you were very likely baked and not fried but thought to really know couldn't see there's like a swirl pattern like a cinnamon swirl pattern on the inside so I'll give it a taste now flavors so so well flavors are right actually a little apple bits in there which I'm used to having so that's a nice touch to remind you that it's Apple Snapple further takes the cinnamon it is a little tough it's not as soft that would like which I think again to me means if it's just lightly baked it's sweet enough it's not overly sweet it's not greasy I've had apple fritters that were like extremely greasy so it's not it's not too bad it's not quite what I'm looking for an apple further I might buy one and again in the future but it's not something that immediately says like keep buying me every time you have an opportunity that's something that in the right moment in the right space I will get but it's not really calling me for a time being so I thought fine or not if but when I find another place that does a prefers I'll let you know what I think for some more fritter fun so peace out thanks for watching", "u4gp0Aj6dWU": "okay um this is the video the instructional video on how to make the apple fritter breakfast casserole that the eighth graders are going to be using for the next rolling scones I have you can probably see here I have already preheated my oven to 375 degrees I have also sprayed my casserole pan now for this demonstration because I didn't want to waste a lot of our materials or ingredients I'm only going to make a half a recipe so this is a small casserole pan you're going to be using one of the large number 12 or number thirteen pans and you're going to follow the recipe on the sheet exactly I'm going to be using half of that since I'm creating half of the recipe but you will use the large pan in the recipe I have already assembled all of my ingredients first I have washed my hands on I since I know I'm going to be touching food I do have gloves on today okay now one of the first things that you're going to have to do is open the can of the cinnamon rolls okay and in order to do that if you haven't done it before and you peel off the paper this is the fun part okay you just whack it really hard on the side of the table and it splits open like that okay and inside here okay is one small container that it's just a cardboard container that contains icing and you want to save that kind of for later I usually if I were going to icing my stuff on the first day I would go ahead and put it in a cup and set it on the stove not under any direct heat but just to pick up a little bit of heat to make it softer some of the containers they come in might not be wrapped in plastic like this it might just be a little excuse me a little um little too okay so then the directions say tops of the rolls into six to eight pieces nice let me slide this through a little bit so you can see what's going on here and I just cut two or three of them at a time and I just kind of cut them in a cross and then another cross okay go ahead and kind of separate them out a little bit while I put them in this bowl okay now again I'm using only one a tube of cinnamon rolls and the directions call for two for the full recipe and again I'm just cutting them in half like a cross and then doing that again so that the pieces are pretty small and I do a couple cinnamon rolls a long time works pretty good that way last batch beer now you don't want to try to squeeze and smush them too much you want them to kind of separate themselves pretty well okay so that's done the next thing it says to open a can of apples and chop them up into small bite-sized pieces now you're going to use a whole can of the apple pie filling okay I since I'm only using half a recipe I only need half a can so what I'm gonna do and after I open the can I'm going to take out about the half that I need for the recipe that size that I'm doing but since you're using a whole can what you can do is you can just take your knife and chop these because that's what I want you to do chop these pieces up smaller just right in there just chop with your knife but since I'm only using half I'll do much popping you don't want it chopped to the point where it's applesauce pretty small pieces so that you can distribute them pretty evenly throughout your recipe okay but again you're gonna use the whole can I'm only using a half a recipe here cutting the recipe in half okay then I'm going to add the apples in there I'm going to add my brown sugar okay now when you measure brown sugar you have to make sure that you pack it down tight brown sugar is always measured packed tight white sugar is where you take the knife across the top but brown sugar you pack it in very tight after you've done that you can crumble it up a little bit if you want to okay and then it's called for a portion of melted butter I had my melted butter and I also add some cinnamon you're going to add two teaspoons I'm only going half a recipe I'm going using them on come on teaspoon of course that you have to measure off and you want to mix until everything is really well combined now there's a good chance that you're gonna have to touch some of this casserole a little bit when you go to put it in the pan so that's why I wanted to make sure to wear the UM the gloves but once you just have everything blended really well okay and it really doesn't take a whole lot of stirring to do that once you have done that then you are going to put everything in your sprayed your prepared and kind of spread it around a bit make it pretty even and it looks kind of small now but you know that the cinnamon roll pieces will puff up at after they're baked for a little bit okay so then what we're going to do is we're gonna place that in the oven the recipe calls for between 40 and 50 minutes I found that to be a little bit too much even on a full recipe so you want to back that back to about 30 to 35 minutes okay so you would put this in here I said it for about 31 minutes that way I can check and if it needs a few more minutes and that's what we'll do now you are going to be preparing this casserole and baking it the day before you the rolling scones card actually rolls on Friday you will not take the the glaze and cover it you will not be doing that you're going to break bake this on Thursday I'm going to take it out of the oven or put some foil on it and what I'll do is Friday morning before you guys get here I will have this on and the oven on and ready to go and pop it back in for just a little bit so that we can put the glaze on and it'll be nice and warm for Friday morning right so and then that's it so that that's it's a really pretty simple recipe it just works best if you have all your stuff out and ready to go again I showed you a half a recipe you're doing a full sized recipe in a big pan okay", "eXs18EdOFpA": "what's up team happy uh happy day uh we're over here uh at the old chicago firehouse doing a little afr apple for the review for all you fritter

cinnamon roll and the blueberry muffin let's see if these are a must or a bus mud so it's still dark where i am it's about 6am but i'm gonna jump into these and let you guys see them let's go so after waiting about 20 minutes they brought out the food so i'm gonna go ahead and taste these starting with the blueberry muffin so as you can see it's it's actually all of these are warm they have an amazing smell sitting right here and they have an amazing smell so this is the blueberry muffin it has a little bit it doesn't really has like it looks like sugar crystals on the top and then you can also see the blueberries guys it's still dark here so i'm doing all the lights that i have in my car it's a good old fall morning right short days this was the least expensive of the three new bakery items and the reason i'm calling them bakery not breakfast is because they're actually available all day long according to mcdonald's website let's taste this one [Music] wow wow that's really good immediately like whoa it's warm it's soft it's fresh has a great blueberry uh flavor to it it's actually a little sweet but not too bad it's got a good balance of the sweet it's got those crunchy sugar crystals on it that really make you go wow i promise i know that's fresh too because it tastes like a fresh baked blueberry muffin that mom used to make like pull out the oven you got them all you know in the in the muffin pan and they risen and they smell and the house smells so good that's exactly what that is like right there as you can see they come in these bakery boxes right here and they warm them up so that's what i had to wait on that entire time is they're like you're the first person to order those here yeah and and they said you got to tell us what they're like because we haven't even tried them i'm like what okay so that is this that is the blueberry muffin it's excellent and that is a must so next up i have this cinnamon roll we're gonna pull that out of the box that has looks like fresh icing poured right over the top of that just look at that and that had it's it's still warm in my hand it feels like a fresh warm cinnamon roll right here let's go ahead i'm gonna just you know what i'm gonna i'm just biting into this guys let's go [Music] i'm gonna all up in my beard y'all definitely need my napkin for that guys so i will tell you with the cinnamon roll that is also warm that is also fresh and it has a good cinnamon flavor in the middle like it's got it but it's kind of all wrapped throughout the roll just like it should be that you can see it right in through here it definitely has the cinnamon wrapped through it it has fresh icing that is starting to to crust over because it's actually cooling off but my goodness that is an amazing flavor as well that has such a good warm vibrant taste to it and it's just fresh and i like that a lot now it's not the best cinnamon roll i've ever had it's not like the fresh ones i make in the oven i like the blueberry muffin but that is certainly a fresh really good take on this cinnamon roll guys that is so good i am so pleasantly surprised so this was 2.19 at my mcdonald's so if you guys have different prices let me know but that's not my favorite i've ever had but i'm gonna tell you it's not bad if you like cinnamon rolls you're gonna like it you will want something to drink it's where you take it and you're like man i wish i had some milk i have my unsweet tea and i have some mcdonald's coffee here too it's gonna go great with your morning coffee oh it's so good guys that is a that is a must but i have to tell you now as i move on to number three here i have been excited to try this the most since i heard it was coming out i love apples i love apple fritters i love apple pie i love apple flavored jolly ranchers i love apple y'all there is the apple fritter that is also warm and it's fresh this is these are so fresh showstopper i loved it i think it was okay but you got the fresh ones so those are the best ones i'm just diving into this guys i can see the icing you see the apples on top the glazed apples let's dive in all right so what do i think about the apple fritter i'm a little disappointed in this one it's not horrible right it's not like oh that's so gross but i needed a little more apple flavor in this i'm expecting you know it's got apples on it i can even taste them a little bit but the flavor's not there it's um and then it's got that it's got the cinnamon i'm tasting the cinnamon and the glaze part of it but it's just it's like a lot of sweet warm not a whole lot of flavor happening in that it's good but it's not great it's it's not bad ah i don't know the best part about all three of these is they've been fresh and i really thought uh i don't know this is this is okay for me it's still a must but not as like whoa you should go get this it's as great as i thought it would be let me ask you all out there this if you have tried all three of these and you're like okay this one's my favorite or which one is my favorite let me know in the comments below i'd like to know if you guys agree or disagree feel the same way i actually thought for me when i got these that i was going to be a big fan of the apple fritter and for me that was the least of the three it was i kind of tasted them in order that i liked them i liked the blueberry muffin the best and then i liked the cinnamon roll and then the apple apple fritter here's the thing i'm gonna come back again and i'm gonna get another apple fritter one morning when i just wanna a breakfast dessert and uh and a pastry as opposed to wanting a biscuit wanting something so you got that option i could go at night and get a big mac meal and grab this for dessert too so i have a lot

so if you guys don't know already i already tried the cinnamon roll new item so i will leave that either down below or up above and you guys can go watch that after this video or right now if you would like to but mcdonald's came out with three new bakery items we have the cinnamon roll the blueberry muffin and the apple fritter so in today's video we're gonna try the last two that we haven't tried yet which is the apple fritter and the blueberry muffin so i'm actually really excited but also really nervous to try these because like i said in my last one it is mcdonald's so it could either be good or it could be really bad you just never know so i'm kind of excited kind of nervous but i'm ready to go try them so if you guys are excited for this video give it a like comment down below video i just feature if your mcdonald's has this i would love to know if you guys tried it already definitely tell me and don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more videos and let's head to mcdonald's hey can i get one apple fritter one blueberry muffin thank you okay guys so i'm going to say there is a lot of if of road work across the street so if you hear that stuff i'm sorry um but we have our blueberry muffin and we have our apple fritter here so i'm so excited to try it i'm going to give you the prices for them so the apple fritter is 219 and the blueberry muffin is a 199 which is a great price this huge blueberry muffin is 1.99 which i think is like a really really good price um so i don't know which one i want to try first i think i'm gonna do the blueberry muffin first since i'm already holding it um so as you guys can see this is what it looks like this is the blueberry muffin it's very beautiful smells really really good um so i don't know what that is i think it's like sugar or something but we're just gonna go ahead and bite into this bad boy i'm scared i think this is like it's like sugar on it but the muffin itself oh my god the muffins really good i don't like the sugary parts on it though i don't like it in my teeth but the muffins actually like like hello mcdonald's like wow i mean they probably didn't make them themselves but still wow mcdonald's you did great it was really good and it's only 199 which is immaculate so out of 10 i'm gonna have to rate the blueberry muffin an 8.5 i think it's really really good i don't like the sugar pieces on it because i just don't like that crun like i like the crunch i don't like it in my teeth i just don't like that my teeth are very sensitive so i don't like that in my teeth but other than that this muffin is like really good and it's cheap for its size so that's our blueberry muffin now we're gonna go ahead and go to our apple fritter which i'm actually really scared about because i honestly don't know what an apple fritter is so ah oh my god i'm scared what do i bite oh my god oh wait that's really good wait it kind of reminds me of a donut it reminds me of a glazed donut with cinnamon i'm not getting any apple i mean i'm not complaining that i'm not getting any apple but that's really good too oh my god um this one's higher than the blu-ray muffin though i think i would rate this one like a nine point five cause like it's really really good i'm not giving it a full ten because they're i don't taste apple so if you're really wanting a true apple fritter i don't know if you're really supposed to taste apple i think you would since it's apple fritter um but it's still so delicious it literally reminds me of a glazed donut with cinnamon but it's so good like oh my god i am so surprised with mcdonald's like this is really good what question mark mcdonald's hello for the people that always be hating on mcdonald's like what is wrong with you mcdonald's is so good and it's so cheap like it doesn't hurt your wallet like oh my god i live for it i love mcdonald's you guys know i love mcdonald's i eat here literally like all the time like oops my bad it's just so freaking good so thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up comment down below if you guys have tried these two yet or if

keep doing that i will end you stop it so it looks like there's a cast in the castle very beautiful dog dealership isn't it because it looks like a flipping castle but it's just a car dealership it's me melissa and i just realized the last time i filmed something it was nine o'clock in the morning and it is 7 40 p.m and i have to go to bed in less than an hour and i haven't filmed anything and this is the part of vlogmas that stresses me out like do i still upload it up do i still upload do i still upload a video if it's four minutes in trash or do i just wait until tomorrow when there's more content and then upload a bigger vlog the reality was that today was nuts and we got home at 7pm and had supper and just cleaned up and now i'm just like i've been up for 14 hours like i'm kind of done you know and i still have to edit that's the thing like it's not even like the filming i need to train marshall how to edit my videos so that he can edit them when i'm sleeping um what can i do i can eat a donut so marshall went to the bakery yesterday and the apple fritters at the watchers bakery are the best i can never eat a full one because it's the size of my head but it is honestly the most amazing um excuse me i know you like the apple fritters too it does have raisins are they raisins or currants i think it might be a current on the outside but it's like it's not burnt on the outside but i think it's deep fried i also don't know if you guys can hear marshall playing music in the shower really loud today was a good day i don't want to get that messed up it was a really good day got us not a cough um we got a lot accomplished but it was just one of those days where we left the house at nine o'clock got home at seven but like nothing filmable it was just like getting stuff done that needed to get done and now i'm home and i'm like if i were to do something right now i would like watch netflix or like just chill for like half an hour but that's not filmable either so what do i do i sit here i eat a donut that's what i'm doing i'm eating a donut i'm filming it and i'm gonna upload video after because i promised myself that i was gonna upload a video every day in december i'm going to do that hi editing melissa here i just want you to know that i am okay um upon editing this footage i realized that i seemed very distressed and upset i'm fine um the donut was delicious i'm gonna finish editing this video go to bed um i just need you to know i'm okay this this was way more dramatic than it needed to be okay so this is the end of today's video you got a little bit of me in the morning a little bit of me a little bit of me at the end of the day obviously the end of the day melissa is much more tired and not as fun as morning melissa but evening melissa has a little bit more i've got more perspective on on what today was i hope you had a great thursday and tomorrow is friday and i'll see you then [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "MD0cSOsuUWc": "[Music] hey guys welcome to my channel I'm yoli's and today I'm gonna be trying the new I hop french toast donut I have here with me the bacon and maple one and the apple fritter french toast donut and each of these Donuts is four dollars each you guys the apple fritter one on their website is described as a warm apple fritter dipped in vanilla batter French toasted and topped with cinnamon apples powdered sugar and whipped topping and I got it to go so I guess that's why they didn't include the whipped cream and I don't know why they didn't put powdered sugar on it that's kind of weird but you can see here that they didn't really put a lot of of those apples it's just like a bunch of little pieces and then the maple and bacon one says it's a doughnut dipped in vanilla french toasted and topped with maple glaze and hickory smoked bacon so that one sounds pretty good right now I'm honestly liking the sound of the maple bacon one more than the apple fritter one but let's just go ahead and I'm gonna try the apple fritter one first you guys this tastes exactly like the McDonald's apple pies that's crazy maybe just the madona itself it's a little bit different but that's what I'm getting from this is the McDonald's apple pie the doughnut itself is of course softer than the pie crust and stuff like that so that's crazy Wow I I wasn't expecting that so now I'm gonna be trying a big maple bacon hmm I like that sweet and savory kind of feel and it's really really good I actually and that cream filling is so delicious too so I definitely like the maple bacon one better than the apple fritter one I guess so overall I enjoyed the bacon meatball french toasted donut but it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be it's really not that feeling it's good I like the flavors I like the combination of the sweet and savory but if you're not into something that's super sweet not gonna be for you because it is very very sweet the apple fritter one I actually I am like very disappointed in because it tastes to me like a McDonald's apple pie that you can get for what like 50 cents a dollar I don't know and this is four dollars and I actually even think that I prefer to the McDonald's apple pie to that apple fritter for my house and it's super small it had like a couple of pieces of Apple on it the doughnut itself just was it I don't know it just it just wasn't what I was expecting I guess so of course this is just ian's I've talked about it maybe you absolutely loved it and of course everything varies by location y'all so maybe they do a really bomb apple fritter at another IHOP but this one just in my opinion it didn't cut it for me it was a disappointment so that is it for this video you guys if you enjoyed it please let me know by giving me the thumbs up and if you're not subscribed it'd also be really cool if you did if you are subscribed thank you so much I really really appreciate you I hope you have a wonderful day and I really hope to see you next time goodbye", "ft1vfVb_834": "[Music] hey what's going on everybody welcome back to the gaining ground I wanted to do a quick video today on the protein powder that I've been using it is by Jim supplements science j ym is founded by dr. Jim's Tapani from who from what I'm what I'm learning on this journey is very big in the fitness world I belong to a couple Facebook groups that are centered around his workout science I guess I don't know why did the quotes but it is a science and he's also developed a lot of products that get really good reviews so I was trying to figure out where to start with a protein so I went with this product so today I have a mass gain protein apple fritter flavor there are two nutrition labels or I guess the nutrition is broken up into two parts one scoop or two scoops obviously the two scoops will be for a mass gain I'm not doing that I'm only doing one scoop which is 270 calories 30 grams of carbs 30 grams of protein so quick review smells amazing smells just like an apple fritter the taste isn't horrible it's very thick I mixed it with 12 ounces of unsweetened almond milk and even that's a little thick it's not it's not terrible to get down I just don't know how people do it with less and I don't know how they would do with water it tastes more like a vanilla cinnamon I wish it tasted more like the flavors on horrible I'm gonna finish the tub my cage $65 per oggi and see I have found it cheaper online sense I think Amazon has it for $10 cheaper so I'll finish the tub when the tub is done I'll probably go ahead and get a different flavor I was researching all the Facebook groups and his products are really popular so I figured I would I start with him and I saw that some of the flavors were at the local GNC I haven't had any side effects no digestive issues anything crazy like that obviously I'm using it post workouts but I'm also using it when I hit something sweet because I didn't get this sexy body from eating broccoli my whole life so would I have that feeling that I just need something super sweet I mix up some of this with some almond milk and I chug it it satisfies that craving so obviously like I said you can use this for mass gain if those of you out there are looking for something with 60 grams of protein and almost 600 calories 2 scoops of these will do it now one scoop serving is 31 so all I think about a month out of this and like I said I'll probably get a different flavor so I figured I would do a quick workout today is day number eight I believe and or is it night night today's date so I made a video last night like I said I've lost a couple ounces up and down but that's what my body does I did with myself today I went down a little bit again but I'll do an official probably update video later today on my current weights and for breakfast I had a bagel with some peanut butter on it my protein game is struggling today I just I haven't like I said I haven't felt good I got it this morning went to get my prescriptions I had my coffee by the time it was like 10:30 and I just I wanted something different I was messaging Jeri early this morning just letting him know I'm kind of sick of food that happens that I need any diet I just get tired of eating so I wanted something a little different so I had a bagel and with peanut butter on it through two tablespoons so I'll just watch my carbs the rest of today and I've got some thin pork chops some frozen chicken breasts that I might do I've been using sous-vide to propel my meat which has been a lifesaver so I'm gonna do a video on that at some point soon one of the reasons one of the main reasons I feel like I always failed on a diet was because I was just so sick and tired of the bland food and one of the foods that everybody eats on a diet is chicken breast and man they suck and they're just terrible I should say they used to some because I cook them in a way now that just makes the most amazing chicken breasts you every in your life so I'll do a video on that as well but anyway I just want to do this quick update check it out JY m google it it's everywhere and thanks for watching and if you haven't subscribed and want to follow me

really a simple recipe let's start by grading a peeled apple as always you will be able to get the recipe from grandmother's kitchen by clicking on the link below the video next let's squeeze the juice from half a lemon onto the Apple to help keep them from browning put the egg and milk into a bowl and stir with a fork combine the dry ingredients into another Bowl stir the wet ingredients into the dry add the grated apple mix together with a fork until well combined we prefer coconut oil as it has a high tolerance to heat heat the oil to between 350 and 375 degrees Fahrenheit you can test to see if the oil is hot enough by dropping in a small amount of batter the oil is hot enough if it bubbles right away when you drop in the apple fritter batter isn't it fun to watch them cooking the fritters will Brown up as they are cooking use tongs to flip them over so they don't burn it will take about three to four minutes to cook them right through place the cooked fritters onto a plate lined with paper towels now we'll prepare the glaze measure the ingredients stir with a fork you will want a nice runny consistency using clean hands and a pastry brush paint the glaze onto the apple

apples onto the flour and then gently fold them together over our folding i used about a cup of all-purpose flour [Music] [Music] after that you're going to divide it into sessions and you can use the

course it's winter so tomorrow is another storm well believe it or not this is episode 22 of at the stove with audrey grove and i'm so grateful that we get to spend and share this time together and make some really good recipes so today we are going to make apple frito bread and i don't know about you but i think it's going to be really good so as i say let's get cooking all right i've gotten everything kind of set up in bowls so that this will go really quickly here we go we're going to mix the wet ingredients first so in my mixer already i have a stick of butter room temperature it's a little shy of room temperature so we might have to mix a little bit longer and into that we're going to add two thirds of a cup of sugar and we're using the mixer today so i apologize ahead of time for the noise and here we go we're going to just start with that maybe that's not off to a good start okay here we go so noise get ready so i'm just going to let this go for a minute and um i see it's breaking up the butter nicely and it's creaming with the sugar so all good [Music] excellent we're going to get this till it's a little bit light and fluffy beautiful i'm just going to turn this off for a second and scrape down oh i feel like i'm yelling i think i was uh scrape down the sides of the bowl and just another 30 seconds more and we'll add our next thing [Music] okay we're all set okay next thing is we're going to add our 2x and we're going to add them one at a time so i apologize lots of noise again and second egg which feels like it went more on my fingers than it did on the mixers okay here we go second egg oh i put that one on nice and high okay and then two teaspoons of vanilla i thought this would just be a really nice recipe to make today to have to snack on and for dessert since we're inside since it's freezing out today i think they said with the windchill factor it was going to be 16 degrees okay put that in gonna scrape down the bowl again this recipe calls for scraping down the bowl quite a few times just to make sure that everything is really incorporated well it's really nice like you don't have to do anything just press the button one more scrape down because this is really important to get this base part of the batter incorporated because next we'll be throwing in our flour mixture okay looking good okay so now in my flower bowl i have one and a half cups of flour two teaspoons of baking powder and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and we're going to add that all in so it says with the mixer on to add the flour that always makes me so nervous because you know the flower tends to go so i'm gonna start by throwing in a little this one all right fingers crossed not bad a little bit of flower flying let's see if we can get this flower in without spilling it off okay i want to get every last drop because i really want them to come out good good oh this looks beautiful okay so now i'm going to take this out of here and move that over a little bit get this off of this looks good okay so the last thing i'm going to do is put in a half a cup of milk but i want to get all the batter off and mix that half a cup of milk in by hand okay there's still more on here so i'm going to take my half a cup mixture and i'm going to just gently pour it in and take it with just mixing by hand you could do um the milk mixed in on the mixer but i don't want it says be careful not to over mix so i decided that i would do it by hand and our batter is done and it just i'll give you a quick look at the batter it's nothing too exciting so now we're going to prepare our pan and i have a loaf pan getting really crowded over here thanks and we're going to spray it with some canola oil make sure i get the sides and the corners and i'm going to take half of my mixture and put it in [Music] okay i'm just gonna let's see what can i use i'm just going to push it around in here so that it nicely covers the bottom i'm just going to check my recipe for a moment okay so i've got half of them in there half of the batter so remember we call this apple fritter bread right i before we started i cut up two portland apples mixed it with cinnamon and sugar and i'm going to put half of this mixture hang on i'm going to get a spoon half of this mixture onto the bread a lot of stuff going on here too crowded maybe i need a bigger kitchen gotta work on okay maybe a little bit more since we're doing half of the batter half of the apple mixture i'm sorry on top of half of the water and then half of our brown sugar and cinnamon mixture so i'm going to sprinkle that on oh this is already smelling so delicious i don't know about you but i i love a good apple dessert just to cover so here we are that's covered so we've got half of the batter half of the apples and half of the cinnamon brown sugar mixture so let's put the other half of the batter in and i'm just going to kind of put it in in blobs so that it'll be easier for me to spread i realized that i forgot to put my apron on today so we'll see how much of this ends up on my uh shirt [Music] all right so covering up that middle layer of the apples and the cinnamon sugar let's see if we can get a little more batter out of our pan this is looking delicious folks a lot more batter okay i think that's good and i'm gonna take my spoon and just smooth it again so okay now here it is we're going to take the rest of our apples spoon them on you don't want to waste any of this although i used cortland apples you could use any kind that you have in the house that's what i happen to have and i'm just gonna have a little bit of this cinnamon and brown sugar melted mixture i'm gonna pour that on here and then our cinnamon and brown sugar mixture goes on top this is going to make it nice and crud like a sugary glaze on top nice and crunchy trying to get all of this covered okay so we are ready to go in the oven here we go and if you look at the side you can see some of those layers i'm going to put this in the oven at 350. let's see how long are we uh oh 50 to 60 minutes so by the way it says to just gently press the apple and cinnamon mixture into the dough or the batter okay all right here we go 50 to 60 minutes got batter all over me we'll be back when we pull this guy out of the oven all right our cake is ready to take out of the oven i did the toothpick test and um at 52 minutes in and it came out that it wasn't ready so i put it back in for another seven minutes and it's perfect now so let's take it out oh my gosh my house smells so good baby there it is so this is just another step we've gotta let it cool and then i'm gonna take my um little knife and run it around the edges and put it onto the cooling rack for probably about a half an hour so we'll be back to make the glaze and finish this off all right our apple fritter bread is cooled and i made a glaze with milk and confection sugar and i'm just gonna do a nice little drizzle of the glaze all over the bread and i'm sorry if i sound like i'm out of breath i just went and walked in the 16 degree weather for 35 minutes during my lunch hour which was really good because it has given me a lot of energy and maybe some color in my cheeks i'm guessing um i bundled up really warm if you're feeling good and want to go outside even for just a few minutes i feel like it just changes your perspective okay so nice little drizzle i'm gonna let this um dry or harden and then we'll be back to take a bite together we are back this apple fritter bread is ready to go so we've baked it we've cooled it we've glazed the top we let that cool again and here is our beautiful apple fritter bread and i am going to slice myself a little and we'll see how good this is so just to also show you the beautiful um cinnamon and apples in the middle of the cake let's take this put it on a plate and might as well use this knife give it a little cut here we go you have to make this hand down delicious oh my goodness not hard to make ingredients that you probably have at home except maybe the apples this is so good it's like eating an apple fritter wow okay [Music] delicious i'm so glad that you joined me today i do hope you make this bread you can reach out to me at a grove masonicare.org if you need the recipe or you can reach out to carrie hatch at ashler village leisure activities i hope you're doing okay i hope you can try to get outside a little bit in this cold weather if you if it's safe to do so don't forget always wear a mask and remember that cooking is love that you can taste take care", "JgT0N522Z_E": "[Music] hey everybody my name is Justin coming at you from Maplewood Minnesota that is a northern suburb of st. Paul Minnesota and I woke up today craving for an apple fritter and me I'm kind of a paralysis by analysis kind of guy I wanted to know who has the best apple fritter most of my house so I went around to ended up going to six different places and getting one apple fritter from each place so what I've got here is one from Cub Foods this is from a little place called the donut hut this is from Dunkin Donuts this is from grandma's bakery looks pretty good and this is from the Maplewood bakery and this is from a new place called Tim Hortons it's a chain from Canada that just opened up a location here and I'm going to be scoring them on several different categories trying to lump it all together into one maybe number ranking from one to ten and I'm gonna get to eat some apple fritters today it's gonna be pretty great okay so the first thing I did is I weighed each one using this little scale right here I also included on the sheet the price and then I just divided the price by the weight and got $1 per ounce so here are the results so Cub Foods came in with definitely the lowest price a pretty good weight for a total of 16 cents per ounce that was the cheapest one Dunkin Donuts had the highest price it was a dollar 91 and it wasn't even that big so I mean it was like three times the price per ounce of the cup foods then the rest of them came in around 20 some cents per ounce okay the next two scoring criteria were visual appearance and smell so how I'm gonna rank these is I'm gonna do a one to ten scale and I'm gonna force one of these to be a 1 unfortunately got to do it and I'm going to force one of them to be a 10 then everything else is somewhere in between so that gives you really good differentiation between the selections here so for visual appearance men I gave it to the Cub Foods donut so if you just look at this thing it's got so many hills and valleys some nooks and crannies for this for the flavor to be hidden in you know when they fry these things that grease is gonna go in there and that's what's so good about an apple fritter there's so much surface area that there's just a lot of grease and sugar and it's oh it's amazing but I gave that a 10 some of these other ones look good but I mean that thing just looks amazing and unfortunately I gave the Tim Hortons of one it just doesn't look that impressive it I mean is this even an apple fritter I guess I've never seen an apple fritter that looks this way it just doesn't look like there's that much flavor there's probably not as many calories right because we're going for a lot of calories here we're trying to get some some good sugar highs going on so in between those we had the Dunkin Donuts in the grandma's bakery those were sevens so those were the second highest the other one what did I say was the grandmas bakery that's this one right here I mean look at that guy there's just a lot going on there it just looks good underneath it though you can tell that they fried that one extra well ooh that's gonna be a greasy doughnut can't wait to eat that the ones that are scoring fives are the donut hut and the Maplewood bakery so after visual appearance I did a smell test I know right smell test but really there actually was some differences between all these so again one was a 10 and I had to force another one to be a 1 the one that was a 10 was the Cub Foods again this thing when I smelled it especially the bottom it smelled like an apple pie like holy crap this thing had some good smells coming out of it and surprisingly some of these actually didn't have much at all for smell I mean almost smelled like the carb or the the paper bag the one that was a one was this donut hut this thing just had like no smell at all Tim Hortons was a four it didn't really smell like an apple fritter it kind of smelled more like a cinnamon roll I wonder if they gave me a cinnamon roll and then Dunkin Donuts did pretty good again you know I told you about that apple pie filling that I saw coming out of there that actually smells really doing good that was a seven but it wasn't as much smell coming out of this as there was out of the cup foods apple fritter that thing was 1/10 I mean it really deserved it alright the moment I've been waiting for the taste test so what I've done is I have lumped taste or divided taste into four categories I've got texture / density I've got freshness or moisture I've got fat you know like I said these things have lots of fat in them because of all that surface area I want to taste that grease and I want it to taste good I don't know what that means yet but I'll figure it out and then sugar sweetness and then I put apples in there it's an apple fritter I want the thing to taste like apples if there are chunks of apples in there even better so let's see you it's a start number one all right so that would be this Tim Hortons and here goes I'm gonna take a bite eat the crap out of it and then rake it you know what I wonder if this is even an apple fritter it's good it tastes like a cinnamon roll man there are no apples in there I bet you I got the wrong thing all right so let's see what's next number three grandma's bakery here we go mmm I definitely taste the fact this thing is greasy mmm there's a little bit of a goodness going on inside let's see what this thing looks like oh yeah chunks of apple in there that's what I'm talking about oh it's like 12:30 I haven't eaten yet today so I'm gonna be feeling a sugar rush very soon let's go to the next one nope number 5 that is this apple fritter from donut hut let's break it open sue that looks like kind of thin not a lot just got revealed mmm there's some apples in there that's pretty damn good somewhere to that would be this one from Maplewood bakery let's break it open ooh mmm tastes different as it should came from a different place it's more soft I would say just less dense it's more like a roll you know it's more like just it's like one ground evenly cooked thing instead of you know different complexity in the layers and things like that it's okay for that was Dunkin Donuts kind of excited to try this out watch what happens when I break this guy open that pretty excited about eating this thing all right here we go oh yeah apple pie filling that is exciting on the outside here it's a little bit more dry it almost looks like bread when I'm not on the apple pie filling bites and I'm out here I'm just gonna be wishing I was back in there there's only one left not gonna roll the die for it that would be the cup foods apple pie fritter watch this so there's a lot going on there you've got different zones and layers you know we got some apple pie filling here looks like there's some cinnamon there we got nothing going on there but you know there's plenty of frosting it's on a border piece so looks like there's gonna be plenty of grease there to taste good let's see what happens when I eat it who is gonna be tough wow this is good I don't know if it's the best one though I think it might be missing out on a little bit of that greasy flavor that I was hoping for there's no bytes that are you know boring where there's where there's no complexity there it's not like there's any bread that's left alone by itself dang good we're gonna do now is I'm gonna spend more time scoring these then after that I'm gonna lump everything together and I'm gonna introduce the winner of the apple fritter Maplewood Minnesota competition okay now that I've eaten half of six apple fritters and I'm all jacked up on sugar I'm going to tell you kind of how these things scored as far as flavors so starting with the Tim Hortons this thing didn't do very well and I think part of the reason is because it's probably not an apple fritter so the next one would be this one from Maplewood bakery so it's scored a five for texture and density but for freshness and moisture it was ten it was the freshest one this one tasted like it had just come out of the oven nice and soft on the inside so next would be this one from Grandma's bakery in this category and the sugar and apples category this one scored second highest but anyway for fat though this thing scored at ten this is probably the highest caloric one out of the bunch this thing I mean you can probably tell by looking at it this thing just tastes fatty you can he taste that grease it was good so the next one we'll talk is the Dunkin Donuts this thing was despite how exciting you know it was because of this apple pie filling it just didn't do that great and I'll tell you why for texture and density it scored a three it wasn't the lowest but it was down there it's just too fluffy I mean there's it bread or apple fritter even though it has a gob of apple pie filling on the inside there's nothing towards the outside so I gave it a seven year I mean not bad but it just wasn't as high as it could have been if the apples were more evenly distributed so next would be this one from donut hut this thing got an eight for texture and density yeah I mean it wasn't super soft and fresh but should an apple fritter really be super soft and fresh it was kind of nice with this Maplewood bakery you know how soft it is but really I mean is that what you're going for with an apple fritter for fat it got a nine it was almost as heavy and fatty as this grandma's bakery one but not quite and lastly but not least is the cup foods won this thing got a 10 for texture and density it just has it's very complex it's nice and soft where it needs to be it's kinda you know more cooked and crusty where it needs to be it's got apples evenly distributed it's just very complex and it just rocked it for texture and density for fat it only got a six if there's anything I could say about this cup foods one is it just doesn't have the level of grease penetrated into it as this grandma's one or this donut hot one and lastly for sugar and apples I gave it a 10 this thing has sugar all over it it's got apples where they need to be they just did that right there's something about this grandma's bakery that I don't know he's just pulling me in I don't know if it's because it was so rich and so fatty and the thing is just it was as heavy and I mean it was just you know there's something there which one of these would I want to pick up now and eat after I've even had my fill it's this Maplewood bakery one and that's because it's just nice and soft and it still it's not wimpy it still got something there if I had to pick one of these even though these two right here where we got here actually the grandmas took second that's right that's what happens so grandma's took second and the donut hut took third and Cub Foods took first which one of these would I pick if I had to go tomorrow it probably wouldn't be the maple wood one because although I'd rather deed it right now that's not a third test I've already eaten three of these things so I'm not going to include that I don't think this one won fair and square it's a great apple fritter it just didn't win this Tim Hortons is definitely out telling to think that's an apple fritter but Dunkin Donuts won now you got to go to expensive not worth it to Chaney so which one of these would I have to pick if tomorrow I was gonna go man I think the donut hut is out it just it's not quite as good it's damn good but just not as good as these two which one is gonna win [Applause] hmm taramis you took it you won you know why you won because you make a product that is just heavy and thick and rich with that grease that penetrates in that's what an apple fritters all about this thing is just gonna hit the spot when you're really hungry for that greasy sweet apple fritter grandma's bakery good job [Music] you", "UYMYA_5mYwA": "[Music] oh you can smell the blueberries in there my guy yes sir [Music] this trash yo welcome back ladies and gentlemen so today we have another full review but first and foremost i want to say uh happy thanksgiving uh to all of the viewers um i know this here has been kind of weird but you know hopefully you find some sort of lithium in our videos um uh what else oh oh another thing right i gotta mention we don't get paid or we don't get sent these foods right so everything i say is my own authentic opinion right so let's get right into it first thing these look unappealing i get it i know it'd be a difference if i got them fresh and i had them right then and there but yo this glass look at some sort of weird part that calcified man i don't know what that is and this apple fritter it looks a bit overdone i don't know just how it looks right now this this blueberry this blueberry muffin looks fine though anyway um all of these i got from mcdonald's mcdonald's has a whole slew of new pastry items they got the muffin they got the apple fritter they got the cinnamon roll now grass right i'm saying this if you want an authentic experience with you know a cinnamon roll you could go to a cinnabon or better yeah better yet yo check this out if this video can get at least 100 likes i will drop a video of me making all of these myself and see how they compare it to the mcdonald's items um so if you want to see that happen be sure to subscribe to the channel like the video share the video tell all your friends and them and whatnot tell everybody you know the more the merrier you dig me so let's get into it this is the cinnabon this is the apple fritter this is the blueberry muffin now the cinnabon right here let's break it open and see what's going on [Laughter] cinnamon there you're right you're right cinnamon roll now the cinnamon roll again from mcdonald's let's unroll it see what's going on see that right there cinnamon got the glaze right there man look frankly um i wish i had enough time to heat these up so you know at least it would taste better i know that but um yeah let's see how it is man this is the mcdonald's cinema roll i don't know if it's i don't know if you got a bad batch or something but it's hard i i shouldn't have to put effort into biting into a cinnamon roll or maybe again you know you gotta get these fresh uh maybe if i heat it up you know it's it's supposed to be more of a chewy thing but a chewy pastry i don't know fam i it should be no effort to bite into this um so it's looking bad right now for mcdonald's man now as far as the flavor goes right wow that's crazy as far as the flavor goes the frosting is good a little too crazy about it i don't know man there's a distinct flavor um mcdonald's has with their pastry like there's something in here that i've tasted in their um apple pies before and um and then their pancakes i'm not sure what it is but mcdonald's has a distinct flavor and once i figure that out i'll let you know or maybe you know whether i can tell you what it is maybe a mcdonald's employee i don't know but actually yeah this is the worst cinnamon roll i ever had top two before this freshly homemade if you want to see that get them likes up 100 likes at least and uh right below that cinnabon maybe this cuz is fresh i don't know but that's my take on the mcdonald's cinnamon roll trash now the apple fritter right i don't know to me it looks a tad bit overdone now the apple fritter for those that you know don't know it's a um they said it's a donut that's deep fried with apples and cinnamon and whatnot all right so cool i get those at 7-eleven uh whenever i want one and um it was a bomb actually now as for this right this looks a tad bit overdone but let's see now as far as the the fragrance goes smells like pastry um i i barely get any um apples from the smell but you know that's to be expected uh with mcdonald's items they tend to you know not be the freshest of things now that's that's what it looks like on the inside now as far as the flavor goes right let's see how it is piece right here oh okay not bad not bad you know it's sweet like a donut you get that cinnamon in there and the glaze too um let's see what else see what this part is like i'm not getting no apples man that tastes like a little debbie honey bun you get that for like 75 cents to a dollar from the the deli or but that bodega whatever you want to call it but as far as i prefer the goals this isn't bad if i had like a couple of tea on the side i'm more of a tea guy you know coffee is not my thing but if i had a little tea on the side it'd be okay and if it was hot i'm telling you man when the pastries are best when they are warm and hot glaze is the same one thing to note though remember earlier i said how um the cinnamon roll has you know a distinct mcdonald's taste that um that i found in the apple pies as well i'm not getting much of that from this but the apple fritter not bad not bad at all i appreciate it so so far as as far as the ranking goes new items so far this is number one and this is far below far below now the blueberry muffin i've had the blueberry muffin before you've had the blueberry muffin before right it looks fine to me don't look got the blueberries in there now let's break it open see what's going on this was going on the inside did they glaze this one too or are my fingers just sticky anyway now as far as the smell right oh you can smell the blueberries in there my guy yes sir it's nice and crumbly as the muffins should be um again i just wish i had these hot but let's take a bite see what's going on oh look a nice piece right here all right this is good now imagine that this thing is fresh and hot way better but this is really good um tastes like it's like a regular blue muffin man you know it's sweet it's fragrant put a lot of blueberries in here you know what the muffin just topped the apple fritter by a long shot i don't know if this comes off from uh familiar reality yeah it's work you know i've been you know eating muffins for a long time i prefer this new to me but if that's the case if it's familiarity then this should be up there too but it's not this trash but these two the apple the apple fritter and the muffin the muffin is top two and it's not too trust and believe but um yeah as far as my take on the mcdonald's you know new pastry items is the blueberry muffin the apple fritter and the cinnamon roll or what they call a cinnamon roll could have been better but anyway yeah um that's all i have for you today so please be sure to like the video again i'm telling you man get this video to at least 100 likes and all these i will make myself and i'll show you my process and you

I'm going to share with you this incredibly delicious recipe it is a country apple fritter bread this recipe calls for very basic baking ingredients most of which you probably already have I'm going to list all the ingredients as well as the measurements in the description section for you to reference so let's go ahead and get started the first thing I'm going to do is mix the brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl I'm using a small whisk to break up the brown sugar and mix it well once this is done I'm going to set it aside now using a medium sized bowl I'm gonna mix my dry ingredients which consists of all-purpose flour and baking powder using a much larger bowl I'm gonna go ahead and mix of the softened butter with the sugar using my electric mixer and now adding one egg at a time I'm gonna go ahead and incorporate these into the mix next I'm going to add the vanilla extract and the dry mix which I prepared earlier it is a combination of all-purpose flour and baking powder I'm adding a little bit at a time so I don't make a big mess the last ingredient to go in is the milk I'm adding half a cup of milk into the mixture and I'm going to continue to mix everything until I have a smooth consistency and now that the batter is all done I am going to move on to the next and final step which is assembling the layers and I lightly sprayed my baking pan with a little bit of oil spray before adding half the mixture and trying to very carefully and evenly distribute the batter before adding one chopped apple and you want to press the Apple into the batter very well now I'm gonna go ahead and sprinkle half the mixture of the brown sugar and cinnamon on top now that my first layer is done I'm gonna work on the second layer by repeating the process I'm adding the remaining batter and I wanted to give you guys a tip when you add your Apple don't just layer it make sure that you press the Apple into the batter otherwise the bread is not gonna cook evenly so now we're going to go ahead and top everything with a remaining burned sugar and cinnamon mixture and get this in the oven you want to pre-heat your oven at 350 degrees and bake this anywhere between 50 to 60 minutes I'm gonna go ahead and set my timer for 53 because not all ovens are the same I suggest that you start checking your bread at about 50 minutes mine was done at 53 as you will see that toothpick is gonna come out clean so my bread is ready to come out of the oven and I'm gonna let this cool for a few minutes that is if you can't wait that long because this bread is delicious and it tastes better when it's warm we personally like to eat it as is but you do have the option to drizzle a nice glaze on top it's a very simple glaze that only calls for powdered sugar and milk a happy exact measurements listed below for you I think this pairs perfectly with a nice cup of coffee your favorite tea or even a glass of milk thank you to all of you suggest this video I hope that you liked it and I hope that you try this recipe we make it for special occasions and it's always a crowd-pleaser thank you and I will see you all in my next video [Music]", "uKlWBFlCUIM": "I pee my happy

going to start with the apple fritter bread I purchased it at the aldi supermarket um you can add maple syrup at the end if you like nutmeg and Pennsylvania Dutch eggnog powdered sugar cinnamon and vanilla and you're going to need about 1 2 3 eggs butter and a skillet or griddle and we're just going to slice the bread in large slices and the trick with slicing your bread is you need to turn the bread upside down so you can get clean slices as I demonstrate right here and that would give you a nice clean slice now this is where you add all your ingredients nutmeg vanilla and here here we are going to add egg nog this is a special thing that I did where the egg nog includes brandy and whisky so measure accordingly so now you're just going to go ahead and dip your apple fritter bread into your egg solution and you can just let it sit in there for about three to five seconds and then it's ready to go on your griddle your pan now if you don't have a kernel you can just go old school and use a nonstick pan and your french toast will be amazing as well so here is the finishing product with powdered sugar on top and you can also add some maple syrup warm it up and topics and here you go

bye-bye", "W0z3sjHoJSg": "hi guys welcome to another video in my blog tauber series um today is a beautiful fall day I made a nice pot of vegetable soup and I was kind of wanting something different it's the weekend my husband's not home so I'm kind of home alone and I wanted something else to go with the soup after dinner tonight and I didn't want to have like a grilled cheese sandwich or anything so I've been kind of like wanting something Apple II just because it's fall and other than pumpkins you know fall is the next best thing um so I of course I went to handy-dandy pinterest and i searched and I searched I searched for apple cake apple bread apple muffins and I found a recipe for apple fritter bread and I thought who this sounds really rich and everything like that and i looked at the ingredients and it didn't look too too bad um I just wanted something different and I didn't have granny smith apples but I have honey crisp apples and I thought those would be nice to give it a try so i am going to kind of explain it to you i will leave the link down below just so i don't have to write out the recipe in that so if you really really want to make it but i have not made this recipe before so let's see how easy it is and then of course i will do a taste test and let you guys know if it's any good i did tell my husband about this recipe and he was like that sounds really good so it doesn't seem like a very difficult recipe so I'm going to give it a try and if it's any good then it's something i could add to my regular you know things that i make throughout the year so let's see how it goes ok guys so i have the recipe here i'm just gonna follow along with it i also what i do i will show you if I think all of my measuring cups and spoons in this container when I organize my house in August and vlog asst i will leave the link for the playlist down below and i just find this is the easy way so i just take it out and put it owner so yeah instructions so i preheated my oven to 350 degrees so that's ready so mixed brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl set aside so it calls for one-third cup of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon um I really like cinnamon so I usually end up putting a little bit more but I really feel like that's just kind of everybody's own preference I know some people don't even like cinnamon but when it comes to apples in my opinion our cinnamon kind of the purse so I'm just gonna kind of mush my brown sugar it has some clumps in it so let's kind of get going here okay guys so I mixed that up together my son came up so I just had to talk to him for a little bit and tell him what dinner is so in a medium-sized Bowl be white sugar and butter together i'm i'm using margarine he's just using no salt added beasts also it is two thirds of a cup white sugar and half a cup of butter so I am just going to use my kitchenaid mixer and kind of cream that all together my kitchenaid mixer was the president that my husband had given me one year for Christmas it was something that I always wanted so at Christmas time usually they go on mine is not the high high-end wine mine is like the little lower and one and I really don't see what the difference is so so I'm going to cream the butter and sugar so I'm just going to scrape the science down and then it says to add the eggs one at a time and it calls for two eggs so I'm going to do that next and I'm also going to have the vanilla and it calls for one-and-a-half teaspoons of vanilla now the next thing it tells me to do is to combine and whisk flour and baking soda together in another bowl and add into cream butter mixture and stir until blended so it is calling for one and a half cups of all-purpose flour and one and three-quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder I'm just gonna do it in this school and then I'm gonna add everything together so I like I was looking at some recipes and they just like it was just more than what I wanted to do like some of it called for a lot of oil like a tough enough job or cup and a quarter of oil and I'm trying you know I didn't want to use that much so let's mix the flour and the baking and it also calls for half a cup of milk or almond milk i'm just going to stick with milk today and once again i am just gonna push my slides down you know typical bacon to apples and i have two large size honeycrisp so i am just going to peel them and cut them up into smaller into the bowl and then it's just your typical make sure you add what is it please bear with me here so 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon so now I'm just I have everything done so it just says to use a loaf pan and I think it does that you can also kind of make it into to love can if it's yeah for to you can do too low for us apiece so I'll from the original recipe to see what it's like if it's too much for me I can always take some over to my mother tomorrow I think she would actually really like this so i am just going to spray this with some pan spray then you take half of the dough or the batter yeah i don't think it'll be too bad oh it's a really nice link butter so just spread this all around and then it says to add half of the apple mixture so you add half of them apple mixture which i'm going to i don't know it seems like a lot to add then it says odd half of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture this is the first time i've made this so i am just sticking with the ingredients that it calls for and if I made it again and really liked it and if I felt like it was too much nothing I would probably kind of change it up then so then I just repeat these layers so I'm gonna put the rest of the batter it's really a pretty easy recipe there's nothing too complicated about it so I think that part of the reason why I really wanted to make it Oh we'll see we'll see let's see let's see I don't know it's one of those things where I know a lot of people do like Pinterest winter fails so let's see how this turns out I'm a little nervous but it seems like a really simple recipe so I'm just gonna poke the rest of the apple mixture with the cinnamon sugar so if this leg it really pops up I don't know where it's gonna go so and there's a lot quite a bit of being there so Lewis doesn't end up being a mess but I am gonna put my love pan on a baking sheet just in case I'm not going to quite use all of this so there's a little bit lot so it says to bake it in the oven for 50 to 650 to 60 minutes this recipe also calls for a glaze of half a cup of powdered sugar the one to two three one two three tablespoons of milk I do not have powdered sugar I feel like this is going to be rich enough without having to make a glaze on it so i am going to put this on my baking sheet just in case it pops over and i'm going to put this in the oven for 50 to 60 minutes i'm going to clean up my kitchen and I will show you guys what it looks like when I take it out of the oven okay so I baked it the 60-minute Senate called for them it smells really good the corners got a little bit overdone but hey this is real I trying a brand new recipe and I'm not sugar well I am sugarcoating it so it smells really good so I'm going to let this cool it's quarter after four so I'm planning on having my soup about five and hopefully it'll be nice and ready so I'm just going to leave it in the pan and let it cool and then i will show you guys what the inside looks like and then i will do a taste test for you too okay so i cut it in half it looks really good so i cut it in half that's what it looks like i put a slice on my plate and I'm gonna do a little taste test just to see how it is oh it looks so good hmm oh yeah that's good mmm really good the apples are still warm so it's really good what I would do hahaha if I made this again what i think i would do is i think i would put it in a round cake pan and then i'd probably use another apple and just put the apple mixture on top and then serve it with like kind of a warm ice cream that's how i would do it but it was it's really good so i took a nice taste test well i am going to enjoy this i hope you guys enjoyed this video I thought it would be fun to do you know it's just a Saturday at home I was all by myself so I need it's not in the kind of pass the time and I thought why not do this and add it to my log Tober video series so I

the apple fritter bread that is in today's video and i'll just show you it looks so yummy and delicious hers came out a lot prettier than mine but um you kind of have to whenever you go in here you have to go you know a blog so they post everything and then have the recipe down below or even on another screen for you so um but yeah this is what the apple fritter bread looks like and the recipe is down here below it's kind of a multi-step process but it is so good and so worth it so here um are the ingredients and everything so i'll just have this linked down below in my description box also to get you to this board and um so yeah so now on to the baking so the first thing we're going to do is get our oven preheated to 350 degrees and then we're going to lay everything out to get ready for baking the first thing that was needed was two eggs and half a cup of milk and those had to be at room temperature so i had already had those sitting out on the top of my oven and i was also filming a clean with me that will be going up on saturday so you will see that those things sitting out on my oven whenever i'm cleaning up my kitchen and then you'll see here in a little bit i messed up the measurement on the butter i thought it was supposed to be 1 3 cup of butter but that was supposed to be 1 3 cup of i think the sugar or something and it's supposed to be half a cup of um butter so you'll see me in a minute trying to figure out what i did wrong with the butter [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] here i am looking at the recipe and trying to figure out about my butter and i was like okay maybe i have to cut some more off and then then i think i finally realized what my mistake was and so i went and got the other part of the butter out of the fridge and put that together but then also the butter was supposed to be softened and i had forgot about that part so i decided i was going to put it in the microwave to soften it for just a little bit but of course me i left it in there a little bit too long and um so all that that just ended up going to the back and i ended up getting a whole other stick out and softening that up here a little bit later in the video [Music] so the mixture right there was just the brown sugar mixture that will go on top of the apples and it is one third cup of brown sugar and one teaspoon of cinnamon and then now i am making my flour mixture which is one and one half cup of flour so that's only a half a cup right there so i'm doing three of them and also one and three quarter tables teaspoons of baking powder and you'll see that i lose count while i was doing my baking powder so i put just a little bit extra in case i didn't have enough but after going back and watching the video i see i had counted correctly so it's all right still came out okay [Music] so now we're going to do our sugars and it is 2 3 cup of sugar and then the half a cup of the softened butter and then after that mixes up good you're gonna put two eggs in there and one and a half teaspoons of vanilla [Music] flavoring [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you want to make sure that your sides are scraped down it's getting everything off the bottom and then now we're going to start adding in our flour mixture and then it will also call after the flour is in there that's whenever you put that half a cup of room temperature milk in there as well and then i'm going to scrape the sides and then we're going to get ready for the filling part [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the recipe called for two apples and it said it could be any kind of apples and the apples that i had on hand were the jazz apples and i think they did just fine they're still pretty crunchy not pretty crunchy they're still add some texture to them and i also like to add cons into my like any kind of breads that i make and so i will be making or i'll be cutting up some pecans to add into that layer as well that you'll see here in just a second [Music] i watch you as you drive do you know i'm looking and i can't help but smile do you know how much i love you you put my favorite song on i put my feet up and we just sing along and i can't help but feeling just loving this moment can we stay here forever i'm loving this moment can we stay here together if i could stop the time don't you know that i would cause i'm just loving this moment can only stay here forever forever [Music] [Applause] as you sleep you don't know i'm looking so now we're gonna start layering the apple fritter bread and i had sprayed the pan right there with some pam and now we're just gonna put our sugar and flour mixture about half of that will go on the bottom part and then you're going to add in about half of your apples that have the cinnamon and sugar coated with it you're going to put that in there and i think part of the trick for this recipe is that you really need to pat the apple mixture into the flour and sugar mixture because if not it will separate whenever you take it out of the pan and especially if you're going to be putting like any kind of nuts or anything in there i think you should probably press it down better than what i did and then that right there is just the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture so you just repeat those steps again and like i said be sure to press the apples and all that down into the sugar and flour mixture really well and then after i finish assembling it we're going to put it into the oven to cook at 350 degrees and the recipe called for about 50 or for 60 minutes but i did at 55 and my bread was done whenever it came out [Music] don't you know that i would cause i'm just loving this moment can only stay here [Music] forever [Music] and just like that the bread is done and don't you wish it could really cook that fast but um now we're gonna let it cool for a while and then i'm going to make the glaze that goes on top and the glaze is how much is a half a cup of powdered sugar and then i put two tablespoons of milk in it and uh and then your bread will be finished and it tastes so so so good and i highly recommend this recipe [Music] all right that is going to be it for this video i really do hope that you enjoyed watching me cook this apple fritter bread if you want to try out the recipe be sure to go over to my instagram page my

you", "Qahv2Ng3HFc": "hey guys so we're here with a mcdonald's review they have some new mccafe breakfast items there's three new things they have a apple fritter a cinnamon roll and a blueberry muffin so we're going to try them out they're supposed to be a little bit more kind of like a bakery type of item more than like a store-bought item but i'm thinking it's going to be kind of a mixture in between the two so what do i do first we'll do apple fritter the apple fritter so this is what apple fritter looks like here and i'll read online what it says it says donut meat apple it's made with apples and cinnamon then topped with yummy glazed icing for a sweet upgrade so the apple fritter was 219 for this apple fritter so the glaze is on the side but the top is a little melted on the top but it's hardened on the side do you want to take a bite of it first are you gonna take a piece off actually it's better than what i thought it was going to be it kind of remembers me rob monkey brad do you remember monkey bread you'd make with cinnamon and icing then you oh no i don't think it had icing but you'd take apart monkey bread brownies i love monkey bread that's kind of what this reminds me it's actually pretty darn good that's good it's nothing that i'd expect from mcdonald's it is more bakery mm-hmm it's not it's not like i think it's a step up from like a grocery store type of thing you would buy yeah it might not be exactly like a super fancy bakery or anything but like it's it's pretty good for mcdonald's let me take a little more the glazing the glaze is nice on there yeah i like it i'm gonna have to go with a four and a half out of five on this because this is pretty darn good it's soft it's not too uh it's not dried out it's not dried out it's not too dense [Music] put it in the microwave warm it up for just a tad bit and it'd probably even be better mm-hmm yeah it would make a little bit softer it could be just a tad bit softer maybe but we are getting this kind of late as 12 37 p.m so i don't know if they leave they probably make them and then let's set them there so maybe if you get them earlier they might be just a little bit more fresh but it's still really good it's not like real hard or nothing it's just it could be a tad bit softer maybe just a tad what do i do with the napkins right there so next step we'll try the uh cinnamon roll you want wanna do this sunrise sure if you'd rather so the cinema well that just came in a bag the apple fritter came in this little bag here says mccafe and then the sim roll comes in a box here just kind of like a hamburger this this is my cafe and then inside is the cinnamon roll it's a cinnamon roll i should hold it while i read about it on line you're good so the cinnamon roll says buttery and flaky topped with creamy icing served warm cinnamony yep all the best things rolled up into one delicious treat so you got your creamy icing and cinnamon and all that stuff so that's warm is it warm the bottom is warm oh it is so they must i don't know if they warm it up keep it somewhere warm or maybe they microwave it or something i don't know but it is warm so do you want to like almost try to cut a piece off here ow you're cutting my fingers oh gosh probably easier just to grab and take a damn i'm on a bite oh gosh it's kind of hard to cut it's warm is it it's not the easiest thing to cut that's for sure just stuff it in your mouth it's big enough he said it's all right yeah it's okay i'm not as big as fan on this one as i am the apple fritter i don't know something about it it's a little bit chewy now this one's a little bit chewy it's not real just something about it the icing tastes different something about the icing is kind of off it's like sour or something let me taste the icing by itself you know that icing is i'm not crazy about it that's what it is it's just different almost like sour milk a little bit or something i don't know or i don't know if that's the cream cheese icing or just a glaze or something i don't they didn't say cream cheese so i don't think it's cream cheese but it has like a just a different flavor i don't know i'm not as big on this one yeah i've had much better cinnamon rolls than this even at the store i think i think i'm gonna go with a three on this did i write the what did you write the other one four four and a half okay i'll give the apple for the four out of five this one what did you say for this one three probably a three it's not the best i would say two and i probably wouldn't even get it again i would never get that again i've it's no like it tastes like a cinnamon roll that's the reason i'm going to go with the three put that icing though there's something about it that just different that i'm not keen on yeah the um well like i said the icings just taste different it's definitely no cinnabon or tea is there tj maxx anymore i don't think they are remember not tj maxx tj cinnamon remember tj cinnamon back in the day we have one at the mall i've heard of it never heard of it comment below do you remember tj cinnamon's i think it was only back in the 90s because when i worked at the mall in the 90s i had tj cinemas and it smelled the whole mall up of just delicious cinnamon rolls let's just be real when you were in high school i was in middle school well true but you went to the mall when you're in middle school didn't you yeah but you never know about it it's like cinnabun but it was tj stanton's back in the day but it smelled so good kind of like you want to go to ikea when you check out they have those cinnamon rolls there and it smells so good and they're really good yeah this is nowhere near that and i think i've even had some at the store that'll be better than this and i just don't care if the icings taste different to me yeah it's not crazy about that one yeah sorry that one's not i probably wouldn't get it again no but that preferred was good so now we'll try the uh blueberry muffin and it comes in a bag just like the apple fritter did it's got a little wrapper around it there and let's just show them close up read about it here so the blueberry muffin says blueberries in their best form packed into a soft and fluffy muffin and finished with a streusel chrome topping so it's just the blue muffin with of course blueberries and then it's got the little streusel chrome topping on the top of the muffin and well you can't eat it the correct way does anyone know how to properly eat a muffin just hold it and put it in your mouth no or you can comment below if you prom if you if you know the proper way to eat a muffin sometimes i'll use it with a fork because i don't get my hands no that's not the proper way so i'm gonna give you a minute while we try it and then i will tell you okay where's that fork oh cinnamon roll oh you just got icing everywhere all right let me smell this it smells really good it does smell good it smelled even more when i unwrapped the sides okay okay that's pretty good let me try a little more in the center here i like it oh i feel i don't feel like it's too dried out but it's a little dried out but not too much i was just gonna say tad bit dry it could be a little more moist the muffins are kind of that way sometimes you usually need something to drink to kind of wash it down because they tend to be a little bit more on the dry side but with muffins i feel like it's hard to get them just perfect though too and you don't get them very well and if you do it's got to be really early i feel with muffins you don't want it too dense but then the same time you don't want to dry you want to get this nice and moist and not you know but sometimes you tend to have to like kind of take a drink to kind of like wash it down a little bit sometimes right but um that's pretty good okay i'm gonna take this bite and then i'm gonna tell you guys how to properly eat a muffin not the best blu-ray muffin i've had but i mean for mcdonald's i guess it's pretty good yeah it might be a little bit of a step up from like a grocery store well i don't know they have some good muffins in the dell and like the bakery apartment at some grocery stores but like it's like a store-bought like boxed packaged muffin it's definitely step up from that yeah um so give them the way to eat it the proper way to eat a muffin is you take the top and you the bottom and you split them in half and then you're supposed to make a sandwich the opposite direction with the top and the bottom so you would take like the bottom part put it on the top and it makes it easier to eat it because it's more like a sandwich and that's how you eat that muffin properly i'm confused you need to show me that say a little bit now you can make a mess okay not now i'll make it like this crumbs everywhere so if you guys if you guys don't understand let me know and then we'll buy a muffin and i will show you how to do off of the muffin the top part the muffin top you take the muffin top off the bottom part so you know the piece of paper around the bottom mm-hmm take that off then you split the muffin from the bottom to the top and you put the bottom part on top of the muffin on top of the top of the muffin so upside down basically basically and it's more of a sandwich like and it's easier to eat the muffin than if it's that sounds wrong if you eat it the other it's not it's not real messy give me a demonstration someday i've never seen you do that yes i've showed you that and that's the way i eat my muffins you just don't remember all right so obviously out of uh five i'm gonna go with a one because he doesn't remember anything i ever show him to do with the muffin oh you're not reading me you're eating the muffin i'm just kidding anyways i give it a three out of five yeah i'm gonna go with a three and a half actually just because good not great three yeah middle a little bit better than half half is two and a half so three is a little bit up from half three out of five yeah i'm gonna go three and a half because it was pretty darn good but like i said muffins are just hard to get at a perfect like yeah i don't not price but a perfect uh consistency i guess you could say and like we said we did get it it is almost one o'clock so maybe if you get it earlier maybe it might be a little not a little not quite a little more moist maybe i'm not sure right so overall i definitely like the apple fruit the best yes and then um then the blueberry muffin the sim roll was last i didn't really care for that that much that's about that flavor of it the icing so the prices on these the cinnamon roll was 249. the apple fritter was 219 and the blueberry muffin was 1.99 so check them out if you want to the new mckay cafe

about this fantastic juice i came across at this year's juice gin it's called apple fritter it says coffee shop apple fritter right there that nice nice little bottle great picture let's see if that zooms in there you go anyways that's the picture right behind me and it looks and tastes that good well it tastes better than it looks because it's a picture right it's produced by Van Gogh vapes they're Canadian and it comes in zero three six and 12 Nick it's max VG to get great vapor and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this even one thing i like that they have on the bottle here is um you don't get on on many juice bottles it has the description of the juice it says right here light pastry with a sweet and tangy apple filling and i'll be honest it's a really strong apple but let pastry it's not very weak it's not saturated or nothing or diluted like very if you taste the Apple you literally feel like you just took a bite out of an apple fritter it's of that good and I've been beeping it all day I put some fresh caught in here some cotton candy wick I got my Visnjic 200s yeah really they've been on my turbo bike tobacco I know it's not fancy but I love it it's nothing fancy but it works for me great I just it's my favorite RDA right now and what better than to top it off with some apple fritter it's got a nice Apple tastes definitely taste of pastry but the cinnamon it's a warm cinnamon you know what I mean it's not a very strong overpowering cinnamon it's just they just did it right just even on the inhales the exhale whatever just all no lips are perfect spot on it's like it appeals to the the big boy in me because it's so sweet so good it's not too sweet it's just I don't know what to say but it's just right my grandmother was a great cook and I'm not ashamed to say it's just like grandma used to make I don't know how they did it but they did it any they did it right let's do it I got a fan running on the side because that's just so hot sorry guys let's do this so we're going to be vaping at 78 I like it high you get that Apple right away on the vmail the pastry the exhale you get the cinnamon and Apple anyways I have nothing bad to say about this I'm going to put in the description all the links you need to get ahold of these guys it's fantastic I'm really happy that I ran into them at the juice jam this year and yeah that's all I got to say about this this stuff is fantastic if you find a bottle list in your local vape shop don't hesitate pick it up you won't regret it alright guys have a good one", "QGMwr9CBHV8": "and good day good afternoon why why is that Frank of why why is that review for another edition of C Mon Jean machina we eat in the car still on the hunt for the best apple fritter and today is the final day country-style Tim Hortons and coffee time the big three in Canada obviously Tim Hortons is number one country styles too and for some reason coffee time has died down we used to have about four them in Woodbridge now we only have I believe one it's actually Concorde not even Woodbridge but one thing I've got to give them credit to is look at the size of this thing not bad nice size fritter from coffee time so that's this will be the score not the score who makes the best fritter under the chain man G machina C Mon gene Mauch gonna weed in the car and here we go okay size doesn't always matter it's all about taste so I thought copy 10 because everyone said coffee time makes a good one Coffee time makes it get up a fritter we can't do which do you prefer it er because on all three locations they all make apple fritters so coffee time if you're off their size and you want a big apple fritter go to coffee time but if it's all about taste cuz that's what's important I'd rather have two good ones than one big one or just you know one really good one I'm gonna have to go countries though makes the best apple fritter followed by Tim Hortons followed by coffee time but if you're into size go to content it's not bad tasting but compared to the other three oh sorry other two by far country so has the best apple fritter followed by believe it or not Timothy Hortons Tim Hortons rather than that that's the winner of the big chains country style if I find another big chain that I could think of like I'd like to try Dunkin Donuts in the US of A which is a very big in country and obviously Krispy Kreme but for now that's it why why is that Frank why why is that review comment like share subscribe always just looking for new ideas and shout out to all the supporters

[Music] hello everyone starting off with a large bowl and one and a half cups of all-purpose flour then we're going to add one half teaspoon of salt a quarter cup of sugar two teaspoons of baking powder one and a half teaspoons of ground cinnamon give that a stir and then we're going to add two thirds of a cup of milk two large eggs a tablespoon of lemon juice teaspoon of vanilla extract and then you're just going to stir this together until just combined so just so that you can't see any more dry flour then you're going to stir in two apples medium-sized apples that have been cut up into pieces all right so now you're going to line your airfryer basket with a little bit of parchment paper and then you're going to take scoops of that batter i'm using a quarter cup measure that i actually sprayed a little bit a little bit of cooking spray before i used it comes out really nice and i was able to put five at once into my airfryer then you're gonna bake these at 400 degrees fahrenheit for about five or six minutes take a look at them they're going to be golden brown on the top flip them over and then bake for an additional couple of minutes until the bottoms are also brown and they'll they will stick together a little bit but it's not a big deal once they're done take them out and you can do your second batch now for the topping which is the best part of this recipe that's a quarter cup of butter that you're going to heat over medium high heat now what happens to butter when you heat it it'll boil and then it'll start to foam and once it starts to foam you're going to notice little brown bits in the bottom continue to cook until it looks like you have a nice chestnutty brown on the bottom take it off the heat add one cup of confectioners sugar an additional half teaspoon of cinnamon give it a stir it'll be a little bit chunky i added in a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a little teaspoon or three quarters of a teaspoon of milk just a splash of milk just enough milk so that you get a glaze that's pourable and then you're going to pour them over your fritters and what's awesome about this glaze is it has a nice amount of butter in it so because you're not deep frying these fritters what you normally do you're air frying them you need some extra fat in there to give them that that flavor you're looking for and i find this glaze does a really good job and there they are now are these as good as your classic deep fried apple fritter with a glaze maybe not not as good but they're very good my family really enjoyed them there were no i didn't have to throw any of them out because they got stale that was for sure lovely chunks of apple in there and a delicious amazing glaze this makes a really nice dessert i have other airfryer

we're going old school southern with homemade apple fritters welcome to my southern farming kitchen all right y'all so it's not quite fall we know that you know everybody's excited for a change of anything right now but i'm craving apple fritters it's my favorite pastry of all time and i'm gonna make it at home which is fairly easy to do you need three granny smith apples need to peel them and dice them i'm not the best peeler in the world don't judge me it's just like a potato i'm not very good at it but i'm gonna get these peeled diced up and then i've got everything ready to go i'll show you how easy these are [Music] all right y'all i got one and a half cups of all-purpose flour i'll have all of this down at the bottom for you so you can just you know screenshot it or however you want to do it so one and a half cups all-purpose flour a couple of teaspoons of baking powder quarter of a cup of granulated sugar and a good pinch of salt because you wanted that to kind of offset all that sweetness and give it a whisk together make sure it's all together good all right don't throw your flour around like i did all right come on in here make you a little well just like so all right i've got one third of a cup of buttermilk regular milk works too all of it works and of course you know i gotta use my simply natural buttermilk it's so good all right i'm gonna go ahead and just put a little bit of cinnamon in there that is to taste cinnamon salt pepper garlic things like that is always to taste you don't have to necessarily follow the recipe i like a lot of cinnamon bob likes a lot of cinnamon we just like a lot of cinnamon so a teaspoon to a tablespoon you put the whole daggone bottle in there if you want to i don't it's your kitchen you do you so i got that in there i'm gonna add two eggs right to the middle just like that like so and then actually i'm going to come in with a little bit of apple sauce a couple of tablespoons i probably should have this open before i started filming but you forgive me right i'm gonna get this open and put a couple of tablespoons right in the middle just like that don't worry about that i'll take care of it and then i'm going to come in and actually break up those eggs and then just kind of bring that flour in a little bit at a time give it a mix you know the drill and then we're going to fold in those apples and we're going to fry these guys that's the best part [Music] wake up honey i made you breakfast fresh coffee and bagels too a new day is waiting for us we got lots of fun stuff to do let's go to the zoo

take care y'all and god bless [Music] you", "w6IA-bWr8tM": "[Music] what about like what about a decent cinnamon roll is type thing really I'm thinking I'm trying to think of like any type of bakery that everyone always uses c.d.s for that ends up becoming trash I haven't found a single cinnamon roll that uses anything other than CDs now I also just want apple filling and everything in fritter yeah an apple fritter with like a like apple cinnamon filling or whatever like a pastry dough style outside or whatever yeah with what we've done absolutely nothing with Apple yet yeah I mean apple filling is great and it's better than like every other candied apple says my other problems sometimes do is it's like well I'm gonna add a Jolly Rancher and call it apple my Apple cream Jolly Rancher I just picture to them cinnamon roll with so obviously flavor apple filling what do we want to do for the dough I'd want it softer I guess softer not like a cookie all right so what about like an ancillary apple filling thing like another apple of some kind or maybe ya know you'd want to because like that's the downside of apple filling there's no body I'm thinking there was a flora apple that was kind of like a cooked Apple is there Apple pop no I might be thinking about mullen berry I think there is a cooked one but I can't remember instead of they have eight apples or something yeah I have red apple they're regular Apple Apple could be good too but it would be too it might be too wet yeah but it could get like that fleshy mouthfeel of it possibly and then if you push the dough hard enough you could dry it back out actually to get some flavor into whatever dough maybe something like a pastry says there recessed hell yes ass that's right okay it's just like thinking like wait what about also pastries s like my miss bread something that is already kind of a spice bread oh yeah pastries just a hundred percent what do you want to use to make up most of the dough though like what's the main the hard part we could always use sweet dough but I I'm not a big fan of that dumpling dough we want to be pretty soft so we want like a buttery soft he's slightly yeasty dough we can do like a redo biscuit base the flavors biscuit yeah but they could add some weird coconut ish jungle flavors yeah or at least the first batch of jungle flavors had some like almost coconut no it's do it like similar and aware cuz I get it from innovative it is yeah it's similar anywhere but it also might it also might be myself tricking myself of like this is biscuit there's coconut you could you could do something biscuit ish well I think I think the the main part of this is going to be like the dough part is gonna be the paste resist I think the sweet with the pastry zest maybe some biscuit that could work I also have another crazy idea to I love it what is it liquid barn Belgian waffle what it's got maple though it's got some but I just remembered I have that it's so good at the dough it's good dough but it also has a cinnamon note with the people right and the maple can blend so easily into the filling Belgian waffle plus pastry zest plus I feel like biscuits gonna help yeah so Belgium waffle liquid barn Devorah pastry zest and a touch of biscuit that's what I'm thinking I think it could work but it's almost getting too light right um it could be but it would your dependent percentages to you because I don't at the same time I don't know how good pastries ask the Belgian waffle work at all I think I would be afraid of that though I almost feel like a graham cracker might work better well let me just throw this out up there liquid barn Belgium waffle and lavoro pastries s are very similar do you think we need both of them I mean I I'm just I'm just uh I'm just throwing that up if you bend the Belgium waffle I feel like pastries s will do a lot of work okay so we should wish we should focus on like the patient's as being you know more of that then say the Belgium waffle the Belgian waffles they're just for maybe some texture or the body I think your body fill it out we can always go with a little bit of graham cracker or biscuit whichever you know what about that cappella then graham cracker graham cracker b1 Belgian waffle pastries oh that sounds so [ __ ] weird out loud you mess probably meant I don't have the one capella graham cracker I got b2 so I'll be trying it out oh well yeah it's the same kind of cinnamon so I mean especially if we end up adding more cinnamon exactly all right so we got Belgian waffle pastry zest graham cracker V one apple filling red apple if we use red apple I look good very how because you know you don't want it to be like a raw Apple great and it will add wetness so do you think we need to add another apple with Apple to make it yet but we great to make it's like a strong Apple thing going on or whatever it's like to really sell the apple filling probably but I don't think it matter I can still be good without it yeah I think I think we can I think I would test it first without yeah and we can always throw an apple on top of the already metal stuff it's like yeah you mean Apple feeling strong enough that it's already that warm this that it's like is you have anybody on that I feel like it'll probably be 90% there if not there yeah all right so Belgian waffle pastries s graham cracker apple filling I know I might be tempted to throw bad green you think we should we should add some type of creaminess to Alfred what do you mind bavarian cream okay let's can see their favorite EP hey I'll add that paper bearing cream to anything fa fa it is oh yeah then there's still for Apple that's good you you can't make red apple Granny Smith apple all these like specific and then just have an apple and just have like a Apple pop yeah apple just Apple we have all the actual apples but look at me an apple - what kind of Apple is it it's an Apple Apple like what red apple green apple granny smith apple apple pop apple zest senator apple zest hey remember what for a regular Apple smell taste like at this point okay so I'm looking at my notes that I took like two years ago on Favara Apple just Apple and I've got I've got written down here that it's a creamy Apple good for an apple pie tastes like baked apples without cinnamon you want to use that straight up or see they wanna I mean I think it's worth a tester then if that's your flavor notes so that's let's talk about percentages there are we pretty always saddle are we pretty settled on what we're going to use yeah I think this is what we'll start with bavarian cream apple filling graham cracker pastries s Belgian waffle l'amour apple okay so let's talk about the pastry tin a guy want to start with pastries s cuz I feel like that's the one that could get weird or work really well where do you think that's gonna happen - that's kind of I was thinkin yep so we have 2% pastries s so that should do a lot of heavy lifting mm-hmm now Belgian waffle let's figure this out poor Belgian waffle is white it's more like a soul it's almost like a silver lion flavor to me you don't think that's that's gonna be - maple either that's what I'm but that Elsa isn't terrible for right if it has some Mabry right if you're making a fritter I think for percents a good start they get started I have no idea that's gonna work ah four percent on liquid barn Belgian waffle what about what about the graham cracker now graham cracker whiner one and a half yeah I say one I say - see - what and a half it is one and a half split the baby 1.5 love this [ __ ] so much okay the star of the show Devorah apple filling repeat at least I was thinking exactly three so we have a 3% apple filling how much regular Apple do we add let me look at my notes ooh this smell tells me - that's exactly what I got in my notes yeah yeah a variant cream this is this is what's gonna push it over the edge in - okay - whoa yeah thinking like 6% I love this one too man honestly though I feel like we can use it fairly high we have a lot of dry ingredients like two to same yeah all right I mean we could go to point 5 but no yeah I meant like I was saying high compared to like using 1% or something okay so floral paste resist at 2% liquid barn Belgian waffle at 4% let's go to and cap graham cracker version 11.5% that's going to basically when they cut the dough and the fritter part yeah the fritter part then we're going to use Favara apple filling at 40% to boost that Apple a little bit we're going to use for VAR Apple just Apple 2% and then to give it a little bit of creaminess and maybe some more body more mouthfeel we're going to add F a bavarian cream at 2% so this is our first version hopefully last version apple fritter first we're going to use flora apple at 2% [Music] next we have flora apple filling we're going to use it at three percent God that smells good next we're adding a little bit of flavor art bavarian cream at two percent now we're adding liquid barn belgian waffle at four percent Exodus capella graham cracker I'm using version two here but the original recipe has gone for graham cracker v1 so just keep that in mind with mixed it I'm going to use it at one point five percent and lastly we're going to use four Vora pastry zest we're gonna add it at two percent I think it's pretty [ __ ] good flavors good I want more body and you must sample I'm not we get a whole lot of doing this out of it ray that's what yeah like the flavors there there's just no fakery like I mean the the notes are there but there's nothing feeling your mouth that was part of that problem because it's making it really heavy on like a raw apple juice I mean you can still probably use that right to percents too much I think yeah I don't I don't think that I don't think that Belgian waffle is doing much at all yeah I think I might have to go higher pastries s is good where it's at right I think so yeah cause you get it you get just enough of it and then it mixes with the apple filling really well adjustments are Apple Belgian waffle maybe graham cracker like 1% Apple yeah I'm a wicked wicked lower that down son I love her I don't think that's bother me near as much is just not having feel same good I think so you think increasing the dough part more yeah because I want to see I want to see what that does to the Apple gyrators yeah I know you guys are right the apples perfect we just have to push the dough to match it right but oh yeah I got to see it I got to see it actually fold I got to see a big booty bitche Force Base yeah what's the adjustments we're going to make here on this thing so I guess the idea that we came to was increasing Belgian waffle to six add sweet dough what do you think on on the sweet garden just started to yeah that's what I was thinking you know one of the things that I think people really like about this show is that the fact that we showed the fuck-ups is that my imagination or does it taste like that we boosted the flora paste resist and now it's just paste resistant sweet though now it's ruined all right so let's go back and figure out what else we need to do to the first one because that show is delicious I really think Gemma flavors biscuit will add the body we could try that all right yeah like one and a half percent okay so what do you think about the the Apple part of this Afra do you thought we should lower it some if anything lower the flip over Apple the regular one okay so let's let's lower the floor apple say down to what go run a math one and a half and we're gonna use jungle flavors biscuit it I really think it'll it'll fill it out when an epic could belch an awful what for think five was like the sweet spot where it's not gonna do a lot of weird stuff so the Belgian waffle at four or five will go five and how much on the on the jungle flavors biscuit and then get started it wouldn't have it won't find out yeah that sounds good to me [Music] okay so this is Round three we're gonna start off with four apple we lowered it just a bit to the 1.5% [Music] Borah apple filling at three percent if a Bavarian cream at 2% liquid barn Belgian waffle at 5% jungle flavors biscuit at 1.5 percent our graham cracker version 1 I'm using version 2 that the original recipe is version 1 I'm going to use it at one point five percent and last not least Favara paste resist at 2% [Music] it's so [ __ ] good the flavor is spot-on it's definitely fully and I feel like we can take biscuit up if we want yeah that did it we could definitely go up with the biscuit in fact I'm gonna go ahead and do that were you thinking - I also still want to see what happens if we get go bearing higher a little bit I think I think we we actually could bring it up some say around 2.5 oh yeah yeah that's it that's how you make an apple fritter without using cap cinnamon Danish world [Music]", "aVCJx7WNhm0": "believe what you see you're watching me i picked up those new pastries from mickey d's and um i've been looking forward to it i don't know why oh there's that sea roll baby it's warm and smells delish it's looking picture perfect and it's a little box uh it's not super heavy but it does seem pretty substantial i'm gonna eat it super elegantly with this here fork because it's pea sticky or are you guys wanting to see me make a mess  i'll just eat it with my hands then i'm so hungry right now let's dip it in some of those icing remnants it ain't bad um i wasn't sure what to expect if these were going to be similar to uh you know pre-packaged hostess cakes or something but uh they're definitely a step above the cake part is a little dry it's not as puffy or flaky as you might want your sea roll to be the ice stain is passable and good there's not a ton of it but there is enough of it see what's going on with this apple fritter this guy's looking pretty and glossy and slick in the sun let's see what the inside looks like oh it's super soft i like what i see guys this texture is kind of what i was wanting out of that cinnamon roll let's see what's going on with this apple fritter rn as much as i love the consistency and um appearance uh of it the apple flav is just not there it's just basically like a sweet roll um and it's good but a little more apple would be nice it does have teeny tiny apple slices on it but they unfortunately go unnoticed i brought my own coffee and finally let's see what's going on with this blueberry muffin this actually looks like a v appealin little muffin i like the crumblies on top this one is also served cold but it's super moist and wet with muffin grease and it smells delicious the blueberry scent is filling my car and given this muffin some premium vibes i'm gonna hit it hard where it counts this section right here that's full of crumbs and blueberries here we go the inside's nice and not greasy at all it's super spongy the blueberries are there they're not plentiful but they're passable and they are good oh look at this while all of these little mickey d's pastries are okay they're not really worth your money they're like two dollars each and that seems kind of hefty for just a muffin especially when there's not anything truly captivating about it it's just a passable solid muffin um i don't know are you guys gonna get pastries at mickey d's or you're just gonna

see outside my window it is nighttime the kids are in bed it is going on nine o'clock p.m but i um we got back from apple picking last weekend usually when we go apple picking you know i come back with a ton of apples and i'm usually making apple breads and apple pie and fried pies and apple fritters and that's not happening because i am on weight watchers now and i'm trying very very very hard this day on my get that blue dot every day and so one of the recipes i really wanted to try out was an apple fritter recipe that i found on the app that i was one of those times where i knew it was there but i didn't really look closely at it and as i started looking at it a little bit more closely uh today because i wanted to make it with you i realized it's really more like an apple pancake and that just that was i just wasn't feeling it so um i got online and started googling apple fritter recipes and i found this really cool recipe drizzlemeskinny.com i don't know if you guys have ever used that as a resource but this woman makes just weight watchers recipes and she puts weight watchers points all colors green purple blue on all of her recipes so she has a recipe for an apple fritter loaf and that thing it's looking really beautiful and uh it's calling my name so that's what we're gonna make tonight um i've got two points left for the day and one slice is four points so i don't mind going over two i'll i've got the weeklies left over to do that so i'm going to have some apple fritter to load tonight and you are going to help me um make it so um anyway if you can't tell i have a lot of family memories that are involved around like food i i've realized i'm coming to realize that so many of our our family traditions involve you know caramel apple making and apple pie making and pumpkin pie making and can't wait till we make gingerbread houses and i'm sitting here thinking hmm how am i going to handle this christmas season on weight watchers but i'm so excited that i've found a recipe that's going to be something that i can eat on weight watchers and also still enjoy my favorite parts of the season which is eating you know i mean i i i didn't okay so i have my oven um set to 375 preheating and it says to just take a regular size loaf pan and spray it with some nonstick spray so all right okay our next step is to take a small bowl and we're going to take three tablespoons of brown sugar this is another one of those recipes that uses like a little bit of brown sugar rather than splenda or sugar substitute so i feel a little bit better about feeding my family actual sugar instead of like a sugar substitute like splenda so um three tablespoons of brown sugar and one teaspoon of oh it cinnamon so good guys is it fall is it is it fall where you are i hope it's fall where you are because it's just the best time of the year it's been super crisp and cold lately the kids i never know what to dress my kids in in the morning um you know do i put uh if i put them in and lungs it's freezing outside i put them in their little sweaters and their long pants and they're burning up by the end of the day but then what do i do put them in shorts and a jacket well that's what i've been doing anyway all right um so i'm mixing up uh that teaspoon of cinnamon and those three tablespoons of brown sugar and we're gonna set that aside oh gosh it smells so good guys i'm gonna eat me some apple fritter loaf all right next step was to peel and dice your apples into small pieces i went ahead and did that ahead because i didn't want you guys watching me with my knife skills i don't think they're particularly good and i didn't want any judgment okay so um i was trying to save some time so um i cut them about this small i don't know if that's the right size but that's what i did and i wanted to show you guys this apple so i used remember how last week um at the beginning of the week me and misty were talking about the apples that we get when we go um to um apple picking and her favorite type of apple is the she says mitsu i think it's mutsu i don't know it's mu so it's gonna be moo or ma i don't know anyway whatever this apple is mitsumatsu i thought i didn't like it but it's growing on me it is like a granny smith apple in texture um but it's sweeter and so it's like got the crispy dryness of a granny smith which means it's going to be a good baking apple because there's not a lot of juice in it but it's still sweet kind of like a honey crisp i think this is going to be a good apple for our apple fritter loaf so we've peeled and diced our apples into small pieces and then we need to add another teaspoon of cinnamon i'm trying really hard not to bang things on the bowl like last time i watched that video afterwards and was clank clank climb cling [Music] i believe i'm gonna be having some of this for breakfast too i had only four points of is a four or five five points of slice i'll take it okay so in our larger bowl we are going to take our eggs there should be two of them [Music] our next step is a quarter cup of brown sugar so that's almost half a cup of brown sugar in total in this recipe which isn't isn't too bad because it's going to make a big loaf now we're going to take one third cup of unsweetened applesauce and i think that's probably pretty important that it's unsweetened um points wise and i just happen to have some in my cabinet which is remarkable i was not prepared i was gonna make apple pancakes some vanilla and i always use um pure vanilla extract it's more expensive but it makes such a big difference and have any of you guys ever tried mexican vanilla i have a friend from the library who anytime she went on a cruise to mexico she would always bring back mexican vanilla for us and it's so good you can ever if you've never tried mexican vanilla that is the vanilla to be baking with and now we're going to use 1 3 cup milk i still have some skim milk left over from the pumpkin spice latte uh test that we had a couple weeks ago if you haven't watched that video i found the best pumpkin spice latte on weight watchers only five points on green so check that out mix well okay in here i have one and one third cup flour and one teaspoon of baking powder and one teaspoon of baking soda and the recipe says to fold in and you know i'm not like classically trained baker or anything i i don't really know what fold means i'm just gonna be really gentle i thought folding was more of like a dough thing i don't know what do i know so we're gonna very gently just i'm just gonna dump it in there i mean come on guys okay yeah i think it's like a you know do you know what i know about folding um any of you guys seen sleeping beauty the old sleeping beauty classic and that green fairy fiona says fold in eggs that's what i know about folding probably should have googled it before i started a youtube video we're all friends that is not folding i mean should it be lumpy i don't know it doesn't really say we're gonna go with it i think it's fine okay that's folded our next step we're gonna take our little pan and we're going to put half of the batter into the pan folding gently that's about right then we're going to take our apples that have the brown sugar and the cinnamon are the cinnamon already mixed in and we are going to take about half of them and we are going to gently press them into the batter according to instructions so it looks a little bit more like a plop but yeah that'll be fine all right then we're gonna take half of our brown sugar cinnamon mixture and sprinkle that on top oh my gosh guys you don't even know how good this smells right now this i think is gonna be so much better than an apple pancake all right we're gonna use this again so uh same thing repeat it's like a little layered loaf we're going to drop the rest of the apples now the apples i used guys were two kind of big apples i'm wondering if i put too much apple in here but they'll probably cook down so we'll can see guys see that can't smell it wish you could and then we're going to finish sprinkling this on okay guys so here it is you can kind of see the layers on the side it smells really good there's batter in there there's apples in there we're not frying anything so it's not like an apple fritter like a fried apple fritter but i think it's gonna taste really good so we're gonna go pop this in the oven for 50 minutes okay so it's in the oven and it's going to bake for the next 50 minutes it is now 9 15 p.m i'm usually in bed right now to be completely honest but that's okay because we are gonna have some apple fritter loaf and it is going to be completely worth it so um while that bakes i'm going to clean up in here and then i'm probably going to read a book i am currently i don't know if any of you guys are readers out there i do love to read i love to read more than i love to watch tv misty's the the big tv guru and i i just mostly read books um and i am right now reading have you guys ever heard of naomi novak she wrote um like her majesty's dragon or his magic somebody's mad she's it was a majesty's dragon series and i read the first one of those but a couple years ago she wrote a book called uprooted which is like by and far like if you like fairy tales if you grew up reading like fairy tale books um it was like one of the best and it wasn't even like a retelling of any particular fairy tale it was just a very very talish story but it was for adults and it was so good she just did such a great job of of taking a character and making it very real and there was a you know it was just it was really good well she has just come out like in the past month or so with a new series it's called the scholamance series or something like that and um and the first book is called a deadly education and i started reading it last night and i could not put it down i ended up like staying up until like 1 30 in the morning reading this book and i had worked the next day which is not good anyway um so i am like 70 into this book so i am gonna go read that while this is bacon um and if you are a fantasy fan then definitely check that out if you haven't i haven't read any of her books yet it's really good so um i'll check back with you in a second when it comes okay it is out of the oven um i let it sit for about 45 minutes to completely cool off because i was in the middle of a really good book and um it smells really good you guys see how nice and crispy and brown and yummy it looks so one of the things that the recipe does call for is a little bit of glazed topping so i've got two tablespoons of powdered sugar here and we're going to add just a little bit of a half teaspoon a half tablespoon of milk i'm gonna stir that up and as you can see that's really just such a small amount um the author of the recipe said it's such a small amount it doesn't even really count as a point because you're spreading it over 10 servings so it doesn't really add or take away points whether or not you use it or not according to her so we're just going to drizzle that over the top she says it just adds a nice little sweetness recipe says that this is a 10 serving recipe so i'm just gonna cut that in half and i'm going to do my very very best not to lie to myself about what a serving size is that is where i go wrong all right so i've got five pieces cut out on this side do you ever like go for like the biggest piece like you get a piece of like a pizza that's like oh cheese pizza from little caesars it's only seven points per slice i'm going to get the largest slice why do i do that to myself it's a lie chelsea it's a lie but i'm gonna get the biggest piece all right can you see that so it's not an apple fritter but it's an apple fritter loaf and we're just gonna see if all the flavors of fall are in this bite and they are guys this might be even better than the pumpkin spice latte that is really good okay so i'm not the best person at making sure that all my little pieces of apple were cut the exact same size so so far there have been a couple of bigger pieces of apple that are a little crunchy still so make sure you cut your pieces small and then other than that do not change a thing about this recipe this is exactly what you're looking for all right guys so if you're looking for a way to enjoy your fall traditions and you still want that apple fritter that apple fritter taste but without the apple fritter points this is definitely a recipe that you guys need to make right away it makes 10 slices each slice is if you're on green plan five points if you're on blue or purple it's four i'm linking the recipe below in the description uh and so uh thank you for joining me if you enjoyed um our little get together today please do subscribe to our channel and thank you so much for your support and i'll be uh in seeing you guys again on weigh-in day hopefully down several pounds if i can stay away from the rest of these pieces thank you", "LjjrWWw7OCc": "hi guys if you're new here i'm megan and today i will be making apple fritters these are kind of mini apple fritters so we'll see we'll be using a like mini muffin pan so yeah i've already got a little bit of stuff together i'm using a recipe from thebakermama.com a website a blog where a mother does a bunch of cooking and stuff i look at a bunch of different recipes before i make something and i kind of take the best aspects of a few different ones but this is where i got the ingredients that i'll be using so i've already got a bowl over here that has an egg a teaspoon of vanilla and six ounces of yogurt i have a cup and a half of flour and i'm gonna add the rest of my stuff tried to do just a little bit of preparation got some crazy dogs here two teaspoons of cinnamon and a half a teaspoon of nutmeg and instead of using nutmeg i'm using pumpkin pie spice which pumpkin pie spice is actually cinnamon ginger nutmeg and allspice so it's just a little spice blend has nothing to do with actual pumpkin i do like my food very seasoned so i'll probably do about about a teaspoon of that when you're baking if you're new to baking and cooking in general well with with seasonings you can add a little bit more spices when you want extra flavor but you want to stay the same with like wet to dry and fat ratio which is enough butter per flour or oil some stuff you can mess with some stuff you can't okay one two teaspoons of baking powder i actually did a little bit extra flour a little bit extra baking powder half a teaspoon of salt not too much of that at all it needs whisking okay so this is flour granulated sugar baking powder salt cinnamon pumpkin pie spice get all these seasonings thoroughly mixed and the sugar you need cold butter we need to cut cold butter into this so i'm going to prep my apples first so after i do the apples which i will be grating one apple which is kind of different and also chopping up an apple i think chopping up the apple is worse so i'm going to do that first get the worser task out of the way okay there's a little bit of a bad spot so i'm just gonna cut that right off if you're not composting you should be this is going to take a little bit of time but uh it's worth it [Music] getting some good small chunks this part is personal preference i don't really eat a whole lot of apple fritters so this is kind of a new one for me but it is fall apples are in season i definitely want to do seasonal eating living some fritters have bigger chunks of apple this is what i think sounds good to me and it could be i could be wrong and i want to try it with big pieces next time we'll just have to see and i will also say i i saw another recipe where they said cook the apples a little bit first because if you cook it it takes out moisture and too much moisture in baked goods can have a bad effect on the texture so while this uh the recipe that i'm using the ingredients from the mama baker does not say cook the apples i will be cooking the apples also for some of these like donuts with fruit they say remove the skin but i really it doesn't matter what it is like i want the skin on because skin has nutrients and these apples that i'm using are fuji apples you could use whatever type of apple you prefer sometimes a task can seem daunting and it's really not that bad and it's better to just do it it could be anything if you're putting stuff off just do it oh i think i can also smell that that smells good too just the cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice and apples smells really good together alrighty on to the next i am going to grate rate this apple and we'll see how that's gonna go a grater is another thing like i never want to use but usually it works i'm gonna try this again try this again on my stool see if i can make it work i'm getting like apple juice all over me it's not the worst thing in the world but i'm sure it'll be sticky after this i'm going to cook the apple just a little bit a little bit of butter sugar just get some of the moisture out i definitely want to encourage more people to eat food in season oh no no bloopers okay i guess you can have some of that here oh oh my gosh the apple that i was grating just flew off the island mini muffin man mini muffin pan i definitely want to encourage more people to eat food in season okay i'm back okay i'm back for real finished creating the apple the dog got a snack i'm gonna put these away really quick if you're baking or cooking i really recommend putting it away as you go it just makes it easier you want to make it easy on yourself it's hard enough to decide that you want to do something i'm going to start the oven you don't want to waste money throwing stuff away when you can just scrape it better and i am going to try to demonstrate good habits by just cleaning dishes as you go too clean as you go i should have turned on the butter okay so we've got this waiting to be skilleted i need to boil the pan so the recipe says that this will make two mini muffin pans of stuff but we'll see about that also i oil my stuff with oil and not non-stick spray nonstick spray really is not healthy for you at all it's really bad for you everybody uses it i would strongly recommend against it i am going to make sure that it's really well oiled with the oil because i still want to work this is what i do i do use oil regularly do not use non-stick for the sake of your health and i don't know if you guys know this but a lot of non-stick product making companies pollute waterways around the country and around the world and we have non-stick spray from like hands and aerosol cans don't take my word for it look it up this is almost good i don't want too much oil but some just enough put the apples since the pan is not hot i'm gonna let that sit for another minute all right where are we at i gotta mix the wet with the dry apples are starting to cook i'm gonna add a tiny touch of sugar just a sprinkle just just ice wrinkle okay we've got the oil pan let me double check that i've got all this stuff flour granulated sugar baking powder salt cinnamon nutmeg butter you need to get egg vanilla yogurt chopped apple grated apple and then we're also going to do a glaze that is powdered sugar and any liquid you can use milk you can use water you can use this recipe called for apple cider but i don't have that so i'm probably just going to use milk so now i am going to cut it calls for six tablespoons of full butter but i did use a little bit extra flour so i'm going to use seven i am dicing in butter that i will then cut up cut in with a like pie crust cutter i'm trying to cut this up fast to keep the butter cold while also being careful not trying to cut my fingers off you really want cold butter because it will give you a flakier final product different recipes call for different like forms of butter for a reason for cookies you want softened butter brownies melted butter is right and it really just depends on the consistency of what you want under a box i am so terrible at looking for stuff i always put stuff back in different places i just like the chaos you could mix it with your hands the more you touch with your hands the warmer the butter gets which kind of defeats the purpose of cold butter for flaky dough almost done the oven's ready i have to incorporate this add the wet scoop it out it will bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees fahrenheit you don't want to destroy the butter too much but you do want like little smashed pieces what you're looking for is stuff about this size like the size of a an oat all right i'm going to say that's good finally going to add this i'm going to make a well in the middle of it just so it's kind of easier to mix in again this was just six ounces of yogurt one egg and it said one teaspoon of vanilla but i used about one and a half okay combine this add the apples scoop it in ready for the oven and then i can make the glaze wow this is pretty thick this is the first time i'm doing this recipe full disclosure but i liked how it looked on the website and i said you know what i'll try it it looks and smells almost like like snickerdoodle kind of i guess it's the cinnamon and sugar and spices it's just a little bit cooked down you can still tell that it's apples oh it smells so good [Music] beautiful it looks like a lot of apples to dough ratio but maybe it'll surprise me we'll see okay oh i'm gonna say probably about a scoopful this is like the zen time like just in the zone fill in the tray this is it i can taste the fritters also i think this will be an interesting recipe because traditionally fritters being a donut are fried in oil but i eat a lot of sweets and snacks and i try to do it the healthier way which is going to be baking but we'll see if if it's not right i could try to fry it if the recipe doesn't turn out like exactly how you're envisioning it it's okay to give it another go and get what you want this is such an interesting consistency batter i'm trying to think of what to compare it to cake batter is pretty liquidy like so is brownie batter i mean cookie dough should be pretty pretty hard you're supposed to bake cookies off with chilled dough so that's not liquidy i mean this is almost like this is like oatmeal kind of but it's also soft like souffle kind of dough you really want to make sure that they're all about the same size so they bake evenly and you don't get some that are a little bit underdone and a little bit that are overdone that are too small so i made these about the same size finished washing a couple dishes simple easy almost done now i will do the glaze two cups of powdered sugar i hate to say it but i'm gonna sift this because while i try to minimize dirtying up dishes i want a superb product and really they tell you that you should sift your powdered sugar i've done it with sifting and i've done it with without and i'm talking making glazes or making frosting you really really really really want to sift it because you get out the clumps and it kind of aerates it and it makes the liquid incorporate better and faster it's just smoother like you don't want a glaze that is very chunky where it's not supposed to be it's worth it and you can say okay cut corners and don't sift it it's okay but it won't be perfect okay everyone i finished the glaze double dipped the apple fritters while they were still warm and then ate a ton of them i will definitely be making this recipe again and i will link it down below for you thank you so much for watching please hit the subscribe button if you enjoyed this have a great day", "R1Tal2PHSJ4": "alright guys welcome back to a another snack review video you guys loved this video for some reason so I thought I'm going to do another one and at this point I want to thank the sponsor of today's video which is Squarespace a website that helps you build a website also I want to mention real quick that I decided to do a monthly giveaway with some of the snacks I'm trying here obviously only if it's possible that the things are still closed this is going to be an Instagram exclusive so if you're interested in winning a giveaway follow me on Instagram wait for a photo that refers to this giveaway as well as the conditions that apply this is out of my own pocket I'm just wanting to give back to you guys so yeah it's just I am gonna wrap up some snacks put a note in there and send it to someone out there someone of you guys anyways today we have a little more it's nice because you guys wanted to see more snacks so we have pop chips sea salt these are not special but they're I never had them I never tried them so I'm going to try those then we have strawberry milkshake pop-tarts we have the new Oreo s'mores we have pop-tart bites cinnamon taupe brown sugar cinnamon we have rebel pecan butter pecan ice cream which has 6 grams net carbs per pint that's absolutely nothing it still has around 800 calories per pint but these come mostly from fat then we have her she's old pretzel bite kisses we have Snickers maple almond butter and we have a Duncan apple fritter I think it is a yogurt and I'm going to raid all these items at a low rating system right here everything above seven is worth trying so let's get into this and I want to try on the stars with deep up tread butts Oh cute so they wanted to make it look like an actual pop-tart and then I got to tell you something they're very moist which is really nice they have a really good flavor of cinnamon I mean the frosting is not really there I mean what it says is this supposed to be frosting but the inside is very moist and if you love cinnamon you'll love this it's very crumbly dough that's actually very good I'm going to give this a seven point five out of ten it's a nice and easy snack it's very cinnamony crumbly that's that's about it so seven point five out of ten for these pop-tart bites next time I want to try it the Percy gold kisses Kretz l bites is it ripped up cute they're tiny all and if they're gonna taste exactly like the chocolate then they're gonna be super good okay so they are harder then like they're harder than the normal Hershey's gold bar and you really get a good crunch of those and what I could buy them because this chocolate is really sweet if you have to bar these kisses are easier to eat and not so super sweet you have a good size the crunch is there take it up and when the normal bar is a seven out of ten they also get a seven point five out of ten because they're super easy to eat but they have to crunch they're more exciting than normal chocolate so these are a seven point five all right next up I want to do this Morris Oreos because they're new and last time I tried the carrot cake Oreos and now I know exactly what these taste like they taste like pumpkin spice Nate figure it out it's pumpkin spice I don't get the carrot but they're super good but they're just not Paris so let's see I'm not a big fan of marshmallows okay that's interesting you see they're double sided so they're chocolate hair and a marshmallow here and then a normal graham cracker so let me try they taste nothing like s'mores nothing like chocolate nothing like marshmallow which is good they taste similar to the carrot cake ones cinnamon graham cracker which is really good I really like that it just tastes like normal cream tastes like a normal Oreo but better because the graham cracker and the cream so these get an 8 out of 10 do they taste like s'mores - no but are they good very yes so 8 out of 10 laughing like s'mores if you expected s'mores taste next up we got strawberry milkshake pop-tarts and I got those because mate is a fan of strawberries so we got a messed up icing on this one a few sprinkles and I'm gonna break this for you now to see how the filling is oh oh the filling is there the filling is there smells very artificially strawberry but I mean what do I expect so all right so the strawberries there but it's full-blown artificial taste strawberry I like that the icing on those is sick and the feeling is there it's decent it's not too skimpy but I'm just not a big fan of this so I'm sorry knit but I have to give this a 5 out of 10 just because it's the flavor it's not fully there it's just a little artificial strawberry and then yeah 5 out of 10 I'm sorry all right next up we have the apple fritter Dunkin Donuts yogurt okay I see you let me try this okay it's a vanilla yogurt and has Apple pieces in it very weird [Music] I don't know if that has anything to anything to do with an apple fritter because it's vanilla yogurt and then from time to time you get like this weird chunky Apple which tastes it's not good you know it's not good mmm it gets ugly out of ten good apple chunks just tastes like randomly throw in there and they don't really belong in this there's no cinnamon taste it's vanilla okay and I don't know what it has to do with apple fritter I would say this is a Apple fruit yogurt so this guy gets only a three out of ten and I would not recommend buying this yeah the Apple in there is completely throwing me off hello next up we got these pop chips I never had I'm a big fan of the barbecue ones I've ever had to sea salt one so these are vegan by the way and gluten free let's chip that all right these are way less boring than I expected seesaw chips to be and I love how thick pop chips are you just get an 8 out of 10 for salted chips just playing these altered chips these are fire then next we have maple almond butter I think I have this before but I'm going to try it again and if this little piece here hmm I was weird it's very weird it has like this strong artificial maple flavor in there and you can really taste the almond and you expect some nuts in there but there's nothing I give these 50s a 5 out of 10 because the idea is pretty good but the execution is just not there so it's a 5 out of 10 not a big fan and last but not least this new ice cream I discovered six from sip six Graham net carb which is pretty good for people who watch their carbohydrates this is what it looks like butter pecan not a low calorie food one I want to thank Squarespace

ice cream is creamy but it's not really sweet yeah I don't know I don't know where I'm where the like butter pecan ice cream is I can only taste pecan hmm I gotta say though this pint has less than one gram sugar and total in it and just like I said six governmnet carp so I think it's pretty it's pretty good I want to give this a seven point five out of ten it's definitely worth trying especially when you're on a low-carb diet and because this is super high fat was a good for keto I just missed a sweetness a little bit all right guys does it I tried everything thank you so much for watching guys let me know in the comments down below what you want to see me try next and I'm trying to make that happen and I see you in the next one bye guys [Music]", "rA1nmYbsZos": "good day why why is that frank at yyz review for a special edition of simanjin machina we eat in the car the reason it's a special edition is i'm not in my machine i'm in my trade in my tractor so simon i'm at work uh so um yeah so you know 7-eleven um the people that bring us the slurpees yeah all of a sudden uh they went crazy and they went on a food uh food explosion and now they have everything available so this edition we're going to do what do you prefritter apple or blueberry they have a blueberry fritter nice size reasonably priced i believe it was 160. um i i don't think they bake it in house so there's no room they bake there unless they have a magical oven underneath and and whatnot or fryer so let's see how this fritter is from 7-eleven okay considering it's 7 11 and i normally buy my slurpees there it's better than coffee times that's for sure but um it's not bad it's okay uh let's go six five considering the situation it comes from six five six nine six nine you know what sorry six five now seven eleven what's with the upselling does it look like i need three pops one's enough i know that they're three for five dollars but i don't need uh three upselling has got to stop i don't i know this will never get anywhere to 711 corporate offices because obviously this is my lovely fans and friends and family but stop with the upselling again why why is that frank of why why is that review simanji machinas we eat in the tractor as you can see there's british airways behind me that's probably departing to london heathrow and uh yeah thanks for watching have a good day", "Bva87o9ZAGg": "Put 8 Tbsp flour and 3 eggs and 200 ml milk into a large bowl and stir to smooth.

he would review the apple fritter from mcdonald's and um they're actually backed up should we not do this back then they go pretty quickly okay we're gonna do it um so i didn't even know mcdonald's had an apple fritter i knew that they had um an apple pie but not an apple fritter so we're um last time when kevin actually did a lunchtime review here he he had the mcrib and he had that holiday pie which he wasn't crazy about either one but he um actually ordered um online and then he came and picked it up and um it was really it was really quick it didn't take him long at all so this time this was like a spur of the moment thing he just we came out and he got his hair cut so he looks gorgeous looks but i said you know we're right across from mcdonald's and i said you know people have been wanting you to try that apple fritter and another thing too a muffin or a roll grab a sweet bakery treat it looks like a cinnamon roll cinnamon roll an apple fritter and a muffin oh well you can get whatever you want they're right here what's that oh okay let's see yeah because i can't tell me what you want to get well i can't tell what that says i can't read that too small for me and this is why you look to my old eyes this is why uh and we're gonna get to pull up right now oh no we're not well i got hair off my face this is why you look when you get when you're at home uh so that you can see okay we're gonna get to pull up so we can see what it says it says cinnamon roll blueberry muffin and apple fritter i don't mind getting the roll and the apple fritter i don't want the muffins are they all free now that's what it says well they're all free now i think you should get all three one of each yeah yeah get one of each and because they're all three new and then it has an ad for uh pep up your season as cinnamon roll uh a peppermint mocha and an iced peppermint mocha so we're not gonna get a drink but we'll just uh hopefully uh this stuff isn't dry because we we don't have a drink with us like i said we're doing this like literally on the fly so and my battery is blinking so i'm gonna probably turn you off and turn you back on so if you've never watched one of kevin's lunchtime reviews when he goes out to eat like fast food this is what it's like he um he doesn't record usually i i'm the one that makes the videos and usually i cut it out the time that the waiting period because he's literally just waiting in line and so much yeah and he doesn't talk a lot so yeah so i'll just like cut that chunk out um but you do if you've never watched one you do get to see him order usually now the mcdonald's one you don't because he had pre-ordered that yeah and you didn't do that with taco bell did you know what to drive through yeah that's right drive-through and then he said cook out and you went to drive through there um so would you say that if you could order through the app you would prefer to do that or do you like going just i don't mind going through drive through you wait a little bit longer but we sit in the car waiting for the pickup too so it wasn't like it was the mcdonald's yeah but it was quicker i still think it was quicker than waiting in this line is that the order thing oh it doesn't look anything like it used to happen i mean i want one of your uh blueberry muffins one of your cinnamon rolls and one of your apple fritters okay anything else no that's it all right 707 first one to place before how to get in it doesn't look anything like it used to i don't know used to you would order you would have your uh menu and it was part of that menu yeah the big the big screens is nice but when you pull up it it doesn't show you the menu right away you're sitting there looking at the next part the last person's order yeah because his order was still up there when i pulled up yeah we our total is 7.07 blueberry muffin was 1.99 cinnamon roll was 249 and the apple fritter is 219. so total is 707. um that just goes to show you how long it's been since i've been through a mcdonald's driveway that's how this has been but i'm like um stuck in the the the 80s i think really because it looks to have the paper menu it looks nothing like it looked before but i don't eat mcdonald's a lot when when when i was growing up uh when i was a kid i was a funny kid i was a funny eater i would not eat a hamburger on a bun so when we would go to mcdonald's i would never order a hamburger like most kids would order a hamburger happy meal i was a that kid that was expensive because i only would eat the filet [Music] don't even remember them having chicken nuggets i don't think they did that was probably more of an 80s but when we were older um i always got the filet of fish so um fileta fish and french fries um but then i didn't eat a hamburger on a bun until i was probably 13 years old when my parents would make hamburgers at home they would make them and put them just the plain hamburger patty on a plate for me and i would eat it with worcestershire sauce and i still like it that way i still really like the combination of hamburger and worcestershire sauce um or ground beef however you want to say it we just always call it hamburger meat even if we're not making hamburgers we call it hamburger meat um but i know that there were i spent the night with friends sometimes and their parents would think they were going to go to mcdonald's and get me some uh cheap happy meal and it wasn't that way with tammy because tammy had to have the filet of fish so it was not cheap i could have just kept driving with the rain now thank you very much how do you know to go to pick up one or pick up two huh thank you very much so i guess you don't go to pick up i guess that other windows or they'll take if they're really backed up or maybe they'll tell you to go to two i don't know so now we just have to find a place to park we'll show you what all three of these look like all right i don't have a parking spot it's hard to get out okay so here's the blueberry muffin and here's the cinnamon roll i'm gonna get a fork and scrape some of that uh frosting off because it looks like it just stuck to the top and then here is the apple fritter which looks really good this one actually says caution hot so they must heat that one up a bit so there they are they look really good we're going to try them out it's more difficult when you're filming in the in the car to kind of set it up um kevin has scored frosting on the apple oh no kevin has scraped the stuff off the top of the box of the cinnamon roll and we're gonna try it first because it does say it's hot so and he they gave us one set of utensils um in plastic but fortunately for us kevin eats out uh does his reviews so he had an extra fork in the glove compartment i'm sure we could have asked for one but i didn't even think about needing something like that are you just gonna hand me the box it's good it's got a good flavor though it's sweet it's hot but i mean it's warm it's not like it's warm but it's nice if you want a little bit of something warm it's really nice yeah the cinnamon's not as strong let me have one more the cinnamons aren't as strong as i was kind of hoping for but i like it it's very nice if you don't live near a cinnabon which we don't then i think that is a good um it's not quite as good as the cinnabon right i think cinnabon if you do have a cinnabon you're going to keep wanting to get a cinnabon unless it's really an a big big difference in price i like the cinnabon because it does have a stronger cinnamon flavor it does but i think that is it's very good and i do like it that they heat it up right now let's try the apple fritter since that's what people wanted you to try let me have a knife and just cut us a piece um i was just gonna pick it up with my hand i'm curious what it looks like in them um so apple fritter it's just gonna be apples pieces of apple and it's gonna be fried that's what i'm thinking an apple fritter i don't know if it looks bright or not it kind of looks like good [Music] so it looks like it's a it's got like a marbling in there um i love the pieces of the apple mm-hmm then the texture it's a little bit chewy that's good and you can tell it is a fried it has a fried flavor to it that's really good chewiness to it you really taste the apple it's very sweet but it's not too sweet you know no i like the texture of it too because it does have a little bit of a chew to it so it has a texture yeah there's like um it's like um you're able to chew through those layers of dough but it's not pasty or anything like that no it's really it is that's that's delicious and i actually like it better than the cinnamon rolls and you really can taste i'm impressed that you can taste that apple the apple is so strong yeah the apples come it's like the apple um it tastes like the apple part of it tastes like the filling in an apple pie yeah but you're getting those pieces those little chunks of apple in the fritter okay this is the muffin careful you might want to lean over that there's the muffin it's it's pretty exciting it's in this paper which is easier to take off than uh than one of those um things but it looks like it's in sections like they put it in like four little oh yeah so can you is it like a pull apart thing he can try to pull pull it apart um somewhat somewhat whatever piece you want it's huge this is like one of the kinds of blueberries uh that's heavy mm-hmm no those other sponge the size of a baby head that was the one i debated about not getting it's just a muffin it's a really good muffin though you know what sets that apart is the sugar crystals on top it's got like a coating on the top it has a coating a very crisp coating of sugar on the top if you like blueberries at all that's a really good muffin it's not dry at all which no that's what i was afraid of honestly very very moist i was afraid it was going to be a drama because some muffins are just dry as the sarah that is not it's a really good it's got a lot of good moisture in the cake that's this is my favorite and that one's my probably my favorite too because it has the most flavor yes it does it really it has the most flavor and it's the the moistest pastry and it's um the blueberry is just the flavor it really is terrific um yeah if there's nothing dry about that but i'm telling you and it has plenty of blueberry the blueberry it's filled with blueberry and but it's not squishy or watery blueberry or anything like that they're just perfect but the sugar on top that's that's what makes it that's what makes it that that that makes the whole muffin right there is that sugar on top if they hadn't done that i agree it wouldn't be the same they wouldn't i'd probably rather have the apple fruit or the apple fritter the apple fritter would probably be my second place yeah and the cinderella's good but they needed to bump the cinnamon up quite a bit more for me to really like it because the cinnamon was pretty light on it really i got a hunk that was the brown cinnamon you could see it and it just wasn't really strong with cinnamon it was good but it wasn't yeah all three of them are good there's nothing wrong with any of them um but yeah the the cinnamon roll just it can't compete with the other thing i put the muffin the cheapest thing in the in the bunch i think the muffin was yeah i think the muffin was only a dollar nineteen yeah the muffin was only 1.99 the apple fritter was 219 and the cinnamon roll was 249. so yeah you get the cheapest thing and it's the best you need to get that that's very very good so you all recommended to us we try the frederick and the fruiter is really good it's just not as good as that muffin but yeah if you haven't had the muffin and you like blueberry at all you have to drink that blueberry muffin with a cup of coffee oh that'd be so good and it is it's literally heavy is it there's no telling how many accounts oh it's probably a thousand calories yeah 800 calories but it was delicious that's very good so i hope you all enjoyed this impromptu video i know we've been crooked the whole time that's okay it's on the dashboard so i hope you all enjoyed it and thanks for watching you", "wy0DluUE5lo": "today we're reviewing the new mcdonald's uh the new mccafe breakfast

penguin", "uEqSxrJ4vDE": "hello friends family randoms i don't know everyone on the internet welcome back to this show called life i'm your host in today's episode we are trying out the new mcdonald's sweet treats if you don't know i get my mcdonald's coffee every morning i get it black this is no cream no sugar no ice i know i'm the devil so when i was there i noticed that they had these new desserts now if i try to remember back because i don't go to mcdonald's very often if you know that about me um for like food only coffee and you know i think they had the cinnamon at one point parfait i don't know if that counts as a dessert but like other than that there's there was really nothing like that stood out nobody went to mcdonald's like i need to get this dessert my favorite of all time from any fast food is the hershey pie from burger king if you haven't tried that go try that it is the best thing or go to the grocery store and get like the entire they have it in a whole pie so you can just buy the whole pie instead of buying one slice it is fantastic so they recently came out with three new desserts i guess they're trying to like up their dessert game so i went ahead and purchased all three so that we could try them out i want to see if they're actually worth the hype i'm not going to eat the whole thing because you know my diet is going to completely mess up so i'm just going to taste test each one you know top chef style where they just take they take one bite of the meal and then they give their opinion and then it's gone they don't eat any of the rest of the meal which is so odd to me first up we have i think this is apple fritter oh it's apple fritter okay okay this is it it doesn't look as appetizing as the commercial as always but so apple fritter was 229. okay i'm gonna take a big juicy bite of this guy that's good um not a ton of apple i think that it's like apple flavoring i don't think it's actual apple and i'm talking my mouthful oh my god it's good but yeah if i break it apart like i don't see pieces of apple i think it's just like apple flavor okay that's it so that's a win try that one out so this video was supposed to be like a try out the sweets we could talk about the election as i have my mouth full but clearly nobody knows what's going on with that and i mean i don't know maybe when this comes out we'll probably know what happened but as of right now as i'm recording it we have no idea what's going on one day it's one guy one dates another guy at the end of the day it's just gonna be an old white man so you know okay so second one in a bag this looks like the muffin so the second one they came out with was a blueberry muffin this like was upside down okay this looks like a really good muffin can you see that okay i'm gonna and it's nice and hot too because the mcdonald's is like right next to my house okay jesus christ oh my god this has got to be ah yo that's good it's like got like a sugary gooey like icing thing on top it is so good and then the bottom is like not too sweet so like you could eat this in the morning without feeling like you're gonna go into like a diabetic coma i don't think it was gonna be that good that is really good okay i gotta stop before so okay so those are two winners this i think is dangerous now i'm kind of regretting this because i might have to go back and get them and order them multiple times which we are not doing okay so last but not least we have this is the cinnamon roll oh look it's like perfectly rolled do you see that it's like i could probably just take it and like unravel it okay oh i need a fork with this guy let's see i want you to see it okay now the icing it like reminds me of cinnabon icing but i don't know could be hotter like i said i live five minutes down the road from it so it should be hotter okay oh no it's a little rough like if you look like i feel like a pound cake is softer can you see that you probably can't but it's like really like kind of dry on the inside the icing was taste better so okay so we're gonna say out of the three this is probably the least least best this is the one i'm liking the least out of the three so up your game mcdonald's because i've had the cinnamon they used to have it was better than this i don't know maybe they heated it longer but cinnamon was better than the cinnamon roll in my opinion so yeah you know we're gonna pass on that one blueberry muffin bomb apple fritter bomb now i'm gonna pick a winner so you know i have to have another bite of each now that we've eliminated one let's see apple fritter that's really good but try this one again blueberry muffin okay i think i have my consensus so apple fritter if you're looking for like if you want sweet if you need sweet if you're craving sweet go for apple fritter if you're like you know i want a little bit of sweet but like i don't want to be too sweet but i don't want to like a nice little breakfast that's quick on the go maybe not every day because it's not too healthy i'd go blueberry muffin because you get the sweetness on top but then you get like the normal muffin that's not like too too sweet at the bottom perfect but yeah if you want really sweet go with apple fritter i mean i don't know i was kind of disappointed about this uh cinnamon roll but you know what are you gonna do nobody's perfect right but yeah like i said i was gonna talk election stuff but we don't really know what's happening and i'm getting so like overwhelmed with turning on the tv and it's all i can hear about and opening instagram and social media and it's all anyone can talk about and it's all i've been seeing and i'm just getting kind of sick of it and tired of it um you just get like information overload like it's not that i don't care like i want to know what's going on and what's happening but like it's the only thing i'm hearing about and the only thing that everyone's showing me and i just can't really take it anymore so kind of like what everyone got tired of hearing about coronavirus i feel the same exact way now like okay i'm done hearing about the election i kind of want to move on to like the next thing so anyway um if you are in the mood for some sweets have mcdonald's try that stuff out um i'm not gonna say that they beat out the hershey pie someone come out with something to beat out the hershey pie and if you know of something that's really good that beats up the hershey pie let me know i'm gonna try it out um but yeah i'm gonna go hurry up and get rid of these because if they are around me too long i will eat them and then um yeah i'm supposed to be heading to the gym so that wouldn't be productive that would be counterproductive so yeah thank you so much for watching and hanging with me for a quick sec like comment and subscribe on the video help you girl out i will see you next time hopefully soon probably on tuesday thanks so much", "k3FSBAuB55s": "why why is that

getting in the fritter game all you need bakery recommended by a friend of mine like i said lisa i was in her bridal party in 2000 lisa and carmel was in her their bridal party in 2008. um she um also like me always recommends a good donut or good food um now first foremost we're gonna talk it's the same price as the one from maple but maples is three times the size maples is a little football this is probably just a baseball anyway it's the taste that matters see mandarin we in the car which do you prefer of course this is an apple fritter from all you need bakery and maple so wow listen it's not bad it's good very good all you need bakery good job on the fritter um nice taste not too sweet uh you could taste the bits and chunks of apples in there um good job on it uh like i said all you need bakery on keel street north of uh rutherford north of rutherford south of major mac apple fritter which do you prefer this was obviously an apple fritter uh why why said frank why why is that

small town the only donut shop here is Tim Hortons and while I'm guilty of slowly converting to team donut Tim Hortons Donuts I think I'm the scale of donuts they're kind of like mediocre at best but I don't have many options so when I go to get my donut picks it's usually where I end up going that's until now produced by the company Rich's baked in the bakery at Toby's it's the apple fritter Donuts you guys heard me say multiple times well I'm not the biggest donut fan although that's changing I will admit apple fritters were always my favorite so when I came across this I knew I had jump on it just to try it dough from a yeast doughnut cinnamon and brown sugar chopped apple chop it up into bits squeeze it into a ball deep-fry it throw it in some place you got deliciousness as I mentioned this is produced by a company named Rich's but the finished product is actually done in the bakery at the store so they're nice and fresh and thanks to a healthful lady there I was able to track down the nutrition facts as well as the manufacturer for you guys just in case you're wondering so nutrition facts will be listening the pictures at the end let's open this up and see if it's better than the only other apple fritter that's available to me which is a Tim Hortons one just bust these guys open and take a look and here's what the apple fritter looks like you have that chopped dough the apples and cinnamon and alike lays cards this is looking and smelling amazing so the only other apple fritter available to me like I said is the one from Tim Hortons which isn't really an authentic apple fritter like it's not chopped don't have chunks of Apple although it is delicious it's not an authentic fritter this might actually be my first authentic fritter well as the thin thick as you can get from a gues pre-made baked in store kind of good but it's looking smelling awesome I am so excited to get into this it's very out for me to get this excited over a doughnut but this is my first time having this type of an apple fritter we're looking for a super soft dough awesome taste of cinnamon and brown sugar bad apple and just doughnut goodness oh yeah look at that I just got a little bit more excited I'm biting in here we go I love the chunk of Apple that chunk of Apple pears so well with this dough I really like that and it has all the pretty good qualities of the Tim Hortons one but those chunks of Apple really steps this up there's some good things and some bad things about this it is really good and I love the inclusion of those apples it's not too sweet which I prefer but I will chalk one thing up to Tim Hortons their actual dough is a little bit softer but I bet if you pop this in the microwave for like 10 seconds this will be amazing and for four dollars for four that's a pretty good deal what does Ron think of the riches so bees bakery glazed apple fritter doughnut considering the dollar value it's a spot-on not too sweet good taste the cinnamon and those chunks of Apple Ron's gonna give the glaze apple fritter doughnut and a tenth of ten guys value considered this is far so this is from the bakery on Sobeys so obviously I bought the Mets Opie's so across Canada you should be able to find him at your Sobeys as well this has been a quick look at the riches so V's bakery glaze the apple fritter doughnuts it's been another quick round reviews in see you guys next time you", "b3mWLLqGX6g": "life is good when you become one with the apple fritter it's fine come on inside oh my gosh goodness scary [ __ ] come inside we're the printer [Laughter]

mcdonald's and tried one of their new brook or mcafee items the uh apple fritter they have an apple fritter a blueberry muffin and a um what's the other one a thinner roll so this was uh two 19. here we go man it's okay same thing you can get like any conveniencer really the cross-section of it that's a lot of uh icing on it ah okay i give it a 5.5 out of 10. not really worth it all right that's the review guys i'm out peace", "n6HbF-Lp89s": "apple fritter from twisted and glazed in paso robles california [Music] now it is definitely substantial about the size of a hand right i've had other ones that you know where the size of your face test this is not quite there but i will admit to you as much as i love these those ones inside my face i'm not eating all that um and if i do i'm gonna feel like a real a real roly poly afterwards not the best feeling um right quality quality uh i will take any day over quantity so as i always do uh when i was in the donut shop i asked i actually lady working there asked her you know what should i get what's the top picks honestly because i'm happy with everything they all look delicious uh if she was not willing or able to kind of direct me one way or the other i can pull the trigger on what i want but if you work at a donor shop you know donuts so i asked her and she kind of directed me and she uh she she said do you like apple fritters of course i do so i said yeah and uh she said you know you gotta try it of course then i asked are there big chunks of apple in there not just apple flavor she's like oh yeah she's like it's big chunks of apple and then the dough the spice then they then they they put it all together and they fry it all up said all right good sign me up so let's take a look right here now right here already you can see nice chunks of apple apple trunk apple chunk apple chunk cut about as small as you know most places most places will do like that little little guys but it does look like there are and i'm breaking it in different way it does look like there is uh a little bit more than the average donut shop which is great so let's see oh that is really nice that is really nice hmm i'll reserve judgment for a moment but this one anyway uh so there's a few things i'm looking for in apple fritter real quick you gotta bring the spice right you gotta you gotta have that cinnamon and nutmeg whatever you're using clove for me spice it up you know make it even you know put those cloves put those things in there make it have that bite even ginger whatever for my taste uh but whatever spice you're putting in there you know make it substantial i don't want to just see a lot of uh pale dough i want to see some color in there some flavor in there um they got that uh the other thing you don't want it to dry and that's something i really like about this it's really nice it's just really really soft and moist in there i know some people don't like that word moist but come on get over it um really great but then still the crunch of the outside from from you know from the frying process and all that so you got the crunch you got the soft inside moist inside really really nice there nice uh cinnamon and all that going on um and then you also want to have apples chunks and chunks of apples now i mean is this chock full of apples or apples falling out of this thing no um i it's very very very very hard to find that uh you know i may never really find it you know quite the level it's not gonna be an apple pie where there's you know pie in the top the pie in the bottom and just apples in the middle that's just not what apple fritters are but so many places do the apple spice it's just all fritter and a little hint of apple right makes you makes you makes you remember an apple you met once in elementary school but it doesn't actually introduce you to an apple uh this this brings the apple this brings the apple part it brings the fruit apart and uh and that's that's that's a winner right there so let me let me stop uh taking apart all the pieces and just give it another nice big all right so i said i was going to reserve judgment but now it's time for the reservations to go uh so far so far i will say this is my number one this is my number one apple fritter um that i have that i have tried since i've started doing these videos i'm still kind of holding out my holy grail for me believe it or not was an apple fritter i got from a grocery store called big bunny bag of massachusetts um maybe i'm remembering it wrong maybe who knows rose colored glasses at that point any place i've gone to in california i can say uh this this does be this is the tops for me because it kind of does everything i want not too much of anything um it's moist but it's not so much that you lose the crunch right it's got the crunch the crunchiness but it's not so over fried they don't get the crunch just because it's fried to the you know within an inch of its life it's got the apples of course give me more apples i'm to be even happier but i am happy with the amount of apples here definitely more than the average shop spice level's nice freshness is nice it's it's noon right now they uh they open from six to two right now uh they were 24 7. hopefully they get back to 24 7 but they are still open seven days a week it's just 6 a.m to 2 p.m so uh you know this is this is at least six hours old obviously if they open at six they probably made it prior to that and still just got the moisture uh it hasn't hasn't bled over to where you lose the crunch it's got everything going on all right i i need to stop going on myself about it but uh that is uh that that's taken top spot so far for me so check it out if you're in the area until next time see ya", "DDlkZfPE84M": "[Music] hey guys it's haley welcome to hailey's world and in today's video i have a special guest my sister and we're gonna be making apple fritter so let's get started so we got sugar cinnamon apples we have actually apple sauce that my mom made because we just want to get rid of it and we have cinnamon rolls but you can also use biscuits we just don't have that so we're going to use cinnamon rolls and brown sugar powdered sugar and butter so bronzing your powdered sugar and butter so now we're going to turn the oven on to 375. so three seven five start and now we're going to grease a nine by five inch pan okay so we're gonna open up the cinnamon rolls and put it onto a cutting board and cut them into little quarters so open that up bring it against the table oh good job guys let's scare me okay so now we're gonna open it up and we're gonna cut it into little quarters i must have had a panic attack that was scary get a knife i've never actually done that i've made you do it okay so we're gonna cut this into quarters and then we're gonna make a ball so i know you want to make the balls and then we're just going to dip it into the bar all right so after like 15 minutes of melting the butter it doesn't take that long we had some incidents with the butter spilt on my shirt and it may or may not have popped two times in the microwave but you need six ounces of butter which is a stick and a half um and you need one teaspoon of cinnamon and two tablespoons of sugar we made that mixture and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a ball this that we made earlier and we're gonna put it into the butter mix it all around take it put it into the cinnamon sugar and like mix it mix it all around and then just put it into our pan so we're gonna finish that with all of them and we'll see you in a second so we just did the cinnamon rolls like this and now we're going to put our like our applesauce this applesauce it's just apples that have been like made into applesauce so we're just squish it and that's it we're just gonna put it on top um usually you would use apples like apples but we're just gonna use up it's based applesauce it's basically apples because my mom just our mom just mushed in and that was it and then what you're gonna do after you put this layer on is you're gonna you're going to sprinkle some brown sugar cinnamon and sugar and sugar and you could just probably like estimate how much you have to do but the ingredients are so you actually just do the brown sugar and the sugar and stuff too like however you want so i'm gonna take a spoon put on some brown sugar i'm gonna mountain clubs i'm just gonna spread the brown sugar in different areas and then we're going to do that with the cinnamon and the sugar so emma you can get the cinnamon and [Music] she's gonna put on that and then i'm gonna put on some sugar just like this that's a lot sugar in one spot pretty much however much you need but yeah so now we're going to do the this top layer of these so we're just going to make some more um sugar mixture so we're gonna do two tablespoons of sugar this time two tablespoons of sugar and then we're gonna do one teaspoon of cinnamon and then we're just gonna coat them again and we'll see you once we finish coating them alright so but now we just did the second layer and we didn't have like fully enough so we just kind of smushed them out a little bit but now we're gonna put our next layer of apple sauce apples on it should be apples but you can use applesauce if you want like like us um yeah we're gonna add cinnamon and brown sugar and sugar so you can start adding some why is this cinnamon no because then it has cinnamon and sugar yeah okay okay i'll put the brown sugar on okay i'll take this off and i'll do the sugar this is going to be really good um the main use instead of cinnamon rolls it should be biscuits but we don't have biscuits so we just did cinnamon rolls but we also coated it in cinnamon sugar a second time so it's gonna be really cinnamon and sugary but cinnamon but cinnamon rolls has cinnamon in it so biscuits are okay you can use cinnamon rolls too so we're gonna finish that up and we'll get back to you so now we are going to put this in our 375 degree oven for 30 to 45 minutes until the apples are like bubbling and until it is um the the biscuits the cinnamon rolls are golden brown so we're gonna say timer i don't know let's just do 30 minutes so far oh we put it in for 30 seconds um whoops okay gosh okay so we'll see once it's all right so we just took the uh apple fritter thing out of the oven and it was like bubbling so now we have to let it cool for 15 minutes and then we can heat it okay so now we're gonna make the glaze for our um dessert so i'm gonna do half a cup of powdered sugar and then i'm going to do three tablespoons of milk one oh i spilled one that's okay two three now i'm going to whisk that all together until it's all whisked together um and it should make a glaze but right now it's not a glaze it's more like a milk so you also might need some more powdered sugar so i'm gonna add a little bit more powdered sugar just to make it thicker so it tastes more like a glaze and nachos milk yeah that's a good consistency well it should be more stringy like more funny like not as ready to be more thicker i'm gonna add a little bit more it's more like a milk right now but i'll make it better all right so it's a little more thick now and i also added a drop or two of vanilla not that much at all just a tiny bit so it's a little more thick now i just added the rest of that and now we can pour it over our um dessert please make mixture now i'm just gonna pour it over this i'm just gonna move it over here a little bit more and there you've made apple fritter i am in a different kitchen because i went to my grandma's house but thanks for watching my video and i'll see you guys next time on haley's world [Music] bye",

but uh you can't win them all and this one is these fritters are not good cam is obviously enjoying it but keep in mind he's dust bunnies all right gives very low standards I'm easy to please but even I have limits these are soggy soft bland flavorless turds these are an embarrassment to the word fritters and while cam might be asking for more they do not get my seal of approval and as a matter of

still don't have a cheeseburger what is going [Music] on [Music] [Applause] hello goblins and goblins welcome to another edition of destined to be goblin dustin goblin here and this is where i will try a new food product of some kind and decide whether or not to give it my destined goblin seal of approval now today i am at my favorite fast food restaurant and that is mcdonald's i've always loved mcdonald's since i was a little kid i love their cheeseburgers i love their double cheeseburgers that's probably my favorite offering that i get from them uh however today i'm trying something new and uh today i am going to try one of their pastries now mcdonald's is rolling out some new breakfast items some new pastry items uh and that includes a blueberry muffin there's also a cinnamon roll and today i have the apple fritter now i got the apple fritter through the app if you haven't yet downloaded the app i would highly recommend that you do that not only for mcdonald's but for all of your favorite fast food restaurants everybody has an app just download that right onto your phone and the advantage of placing your order through the app is that you will very often get deals that are sent specifically through that app so today for instance um i was able to get my large coffee here a dollar fifty for my large coffee and i got my apple fritter free through the app so um something to keep in mind there's a lot of different deals that you'll see coming through the app and a lot of places uh especially like mcdonald's taco bell and wendy's they are doing uh rewards where if you purchase through the app you earn uh points and then you'll be able to get some free food items down the road so wendy's and taco bell especially seem to be leading the charge with that a lot of good deals available and a lot of free stuff that you can actually get over time if you use the app so let's go ahead and take a peek at this apple fritter um so there we go it's a pretty good sized donut there so take a peek at that um smells very um donuty very apple fritter like it's got that nice glaze all over it looks like it's nicely cooked let's take a bite see what we get [Music] okay so first impressions um i'm not sure exactly what i was expecting from mcdonald's um but this tastes like it was made by somebody who really knows how to do pastries really knows how to do donuts and things like that um if you didn't tell me that this was from mcdonald's i might have guessed that this came from dunkin donuts krispy kreme something like that um it's as good as any other donut that you will get out there there's a nice cinnamon flavor in there in addition to the apple you get that strong bite of apple lots of cinnamon in there and that glaze is nice and sweet nicely cooked not too greasy not over fried or anything like that let's get a couple more bites gonna have to wash it down with some coffee okay that last bite that i took actually had a chunk of apple in it i wasn't expecting that this is good this is a good product the deeper i got into that the more that apple flavor really took over and that surprised me that is a very good product um when i first heard that mcdonald's was coming out with these items as part of their um bakery uh offering that they're gonna be giving out now i wasn't quite sure what to expect i mean obviously we've known that mcdonald's can do sweet treats um of course they have all of their ice creams and things like that but then of course they have their apple pie which they've been known for for decades and then they have those seasonal offerings that they'll come out with sometimes like the um pumpkin cream pie and the guava cream pie but this is a a departure of course from their usual pies and this is really good um i definitely would recommend that now um the price on this as i said this was free because i did have the the special deal in the app i was able to buy my coffee and i got the uh the fritter free but um i believe it was uh around two it was a little over two dollars uh so something to keep in mind a little bit i don't know maybe a little bit on the pricier side it was over two dollars um so a little bit on the pricier side for a single donut-like item but um it's it's a good it's a good product um it definitely gets the destin goblin seal of approval and uh yeah another good product from mcdonald's mcdonald's tends to never let me down as i said they are my favorite fast food establishment so i especially like when something new comes out from them they don't put a lot of different seasonal options out and things like that a lot of fast food places will put gimmicky burgers and things like that mcdonald's knows what works they've been doing it for decades and so they don't have to put a lot of different things out but um this one's good i would say check this out um don't forget there's also the cinnamon roll and there's a blueberry muffin as well this is about 510 calories for the apple fritter so a little bit on the heavy side as far as calories go um again if you would be so kind as to like this video share this video comment on this video and then uh of course if you

late to the party but like I said nobody sends me stuff so I just kind of review what I have I did recently do this the pulse 80 watt I'll try and get a review on that since is relatively new I want to do might do a couple more like I did that one for the drag and the truck at work might do some more reviews like that just because it's so easy I can do I have instead a lot of time aside for having to do it on my lunch break and working those you know all the reviewers they got the little things they do and that's all fine there's a place for that but I think there's also a place it's for some regular dude who's been using it you know for weeks on in to tell you what he thinks about it now told enough I'm sure you know drop it a few times now the holding up from that holding up different wattages and different atomizers but on top of the blog reviewers another one wants a long but some of them they just get it in the Mallee open it and they review it they don't they've taken to work with that they work they don't care to work with put it through the paces did I have a real job you ever watch fogging would [ __ ] that with a Batman review channel he has a real job - harder than my job I working a desk or anything like that so my god my mods get tossed around the truck a little bit I can beat up I hope this stuff he said good as everybody says it is I was thinking the other day I'm out I had some apple pie from budget papers as I running out I should get some more when I was like let's see what when you find a deal I bought a deal on this apple fritter I'm in won't meet rot so I ordered it it's funny with vaping some of the flavor here I would think like I would love like I like Apple to your even wrong but I look at the flavors I've used the most I was like I like him that are not something I would think how I love some reason I love apple flavors I've gotten to the point where I'm really tired of putting too much time and my dripper so I'm trying to get it down to where I know how much I need just to get it to touch the bottom of the juice will I was pulling a [ __ ] now one the other day I felt like I was like one of those clowns pulling handkerchiefs out of his sleeve my goodness how far down there did I stick this feeling yes yes this is good right amount of cotton in here it smells pretty good because I thought it would feel like Oh some need you did I get it smell really good tastes like but the feeling this one might be the other way around the smells okay and it taste is even better but who knows let's find out here this is Shane I came in a glass bottle and you don't have to pour it out into a rage of the bottle glass bottles don't work you will when I take them to work the plastic part of the glass kinda always gets

today we are going to be reviewing mcdonald's new breakfast sweets today so we got our cinnamon roll here we've got our blueberry muffin and we got our apple fritter so i'm really excited to try these all out because i love all of these but i've never had mcdonald's version of them so let's get into it [Music] so i'm going to start with their blueberry muffin we've got some blueberry bits on top and then we have a sugar glaze and sugar coating and it also comes with this really pretty brown parchment paper makes it super bougie looking i'll cut it in half so we can see the inside was moist i could feel it that's what she said oh my god wow look at the inside you see that very it's very moist i'm just touching it very moist come and take a bite that's really good we got blueberry inside too you know this kind of reminds me of the costco blueberry muffins it's like equally as moist but i think this is a little better of course it's not as large or like you know but i think it's pretty good and it looks like these dried blueberries inside there's not too many though i personally like my blue my blueberry muffins like super blueberry e you know but the flavor of blueberry is only coming from the fruit and not like the actual cake but i think it's still a really good muffin i would probably get it again and next i am going to try i am going to try the cinnamon roll because its calling my name and this one is a little warm i like that and they got this they got this um sugar glaze on it as you can see oh it's still warm i can feel that hmm hmm that hits the spot i love cinnamon rolls so much i haven't eaten one since like probably last year my school before covid used to sell these giant cinnamon rolls i kid you not it was like this big for two dollars and i i would i would have to resist myself from buying it my sweet it's cinnamony it's slightly warm but it's nice and chewy just how i like it as you can see i'm struggling a bit to cut this but it might be because it cooled down a little bit between the time when i ordered it and the time it got to me i find it kind of impressive that you can get this at mcdonald's because those are really good okay apple fritter let's take a look so this is apple fritters like appley cinnamony got that sugary white glaze okay hmm no this one's good too they got like very tiny amount of apple chunks like i said before i like i like fruit in my thing so i went like i want 50 50 50 apple fifty percent red you know i'm like i'm a texture kind of person hmm very soft and soft slightly dense sweet cinnamony could be a little more aptly a little more tart but it's pretty good it tastes like the ones you get at the like at a bakery like a donut shop i feel like if one day i was going to work and i was in a rush i would 100 just grab these on the go because they're like these are all items that i would eat again 100 and breakfast is served all day which means that these are served all day so pretty cool

pancake I'm gonna have changed our font it's really delicious so what I did today I needed to do a quick thing right quick so then you would have a snack I would have something and I could have something for breakfast so I took out a recipe from my old cookbook cooking southern style with Deep South homestead and it's for apple fritters but I didn't want to fry anything exactly so what I did today I took my ninja and I dumped in 2/3 of a cup of milk 2 eggs 1/2 pint jar of applesauce now you can do fresh apples you can do apples I mean but this is the way I did it today and I'm using my cookbook page 33 so I put the milk eggs and apple sauce in there and I blend it together in my ninja then I have mixed together the flour the sugar the baking powder and the salt it's one and a half cups of flour I used gluten free baking flour a rice bran rice mix I put 2 tablespoons of sugar cause for one but I wouldn't mind a touch sweet and I put 2 teaspoons of baking powder 1/2 a teaspoon of salt in the Ninja I put the eggs milk and apple sauce i pulsed it a couple of times and mix the eggs up and back then I added a little of the flour at a time until the flour was ready and mixed up in there it doesn't take like three four pulses you're done ok so it it made it a pancake II type batter then I had a mini muffin pan it does I think 24 I'm not sure 20 it does 20 of the little mini muffins like this those are so cute so that's Danny snack he likes to run by grab something and keep going he doesn't want a big muffin or something he's got to sit and take time he wants just to get something and go so this has the applesauce and very limited ingredients I didn't put any butter any oil anything because the applesauce takes the place of what you're doing with the butter and all the rest after I filled those 20 up became pancakes mm-hmm no this is great and the cane syrup we processed here at Deep South so we have a playlist with cane syrup and how to make it that is our go-to for sugar this Canton syrup if we were in a really bad situation then I can only do with what I had here I have my chickens for the eggs I have flowers stored we have sugar stored we have baking powder and salt stored then I've got the apples that we've turned into applesauce plus I can open a jar of apples and add it just it was about a cup I could add a cup of apples in there you're blending and it's gonna mix up or you can use fresh apples and just drop them in after you get everything else blended and you'd have fresh apple chunks in it but what I did I got this done I got that twenty little mini muffins done I made pancakes for me I ate one with cream cheese and powdered sugar mix that I mixed up it was delicious this one with the cane syrup the other pancakes that it made I put on a cookie sheet and I froze in a little while and take them out put them in a ziploc bag with Danny and I go to the cabin I will throw a couple of those pancakes in there next morning he will throw up in an iron skillet heat them up and I'm good to go I have cane syrup 1/2 pancakes Danny has this little snack the little mini muffins y'all it's a way to go using your canned foods what you have available and saves you and butter by using applesauce saves your bowl so guys hope you enjoyed a little bit of a tutorial on apple fritters made into pancakes and mini muffins thank you from crazy days", "YrN_qQd98Eg": "me and tonight we're going to be making apple fritter rings which are apple rings that are fried anyway intro for this hmm guess I'll have to go to the ingredients part you will need flour buttermilk canola oil sugar salt baking powder nutmeg cinnamon 2 a kiss and a bunch of apples now onto the making it parts alright so we're gonna do the dry ingredients first 2 cups of flour and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder quarter cup of sugar 1/4 teaspoon of salt and just put all that in this bowl so just throw that in there and we need to mix this up alright now we need to add the eggs and the milks let me go get that all right so that's one and a quarter cup of buttermilk and two eggs [Music] all right thanks we gotta cut these apples up into rings and I think I'm gonna use the biscuit cutter but I I don't know if it's what we'll see how it goes all right is it the cutting part [Music] yes this is going terribly I think this might be a job for disembodied mom [Music] okay now got to the part where we need to batter the apples circles and put them in the oil pan now I think it's at the right temperature I didn't actually have a thermometer like the instruction says but what this is good enough we'll see how it goes [Music] moving on up hello I just that hi Julie good to see you yeah I made apple rings look they're not great here's what I learned the Internet is that Tom's make a big hole in this in the dough and if you can see that I don't know how it's supposed to be turning him Tong's is maybe got the answer all right let's try one [Music] well one of them allergen yes I mind healed some powdered sugar that's great I hit yeah I don't know about anything did somebody mom this could use some work I don't dislike it

shop collection Jimmy's bakery soft baked apple fritter cookies have no canola and apple streusel the granola was for 39 and the cookies were 399 both of them were bought at Whole Foods okay so come on 65 Whole Foods okay so these are this is what 399 and there are 650 ridiculous what effect is there to be more and now we've had these before but you forget if you don't mom all the time that you don't get that many because like when you buy the Pepperidge Farm there's several layers Roberta yeah this is only get it's just the one but they're so they are they really are a one cookie thirty grams is 110 calories we bake in small batches with time-honored recipes apple fritter the new apple of your eye Dewey's calm okay here we go apple printer cookies the moment you open this bag the enticing scent of apples and cinnamon will fill the air that's just a hint of the sweet surprise to come fragrant golden brown apple fritters have been a breakfast staple in small southern donut shops for years and years the soft pull apart texture of these cookies full of real apple chunks and topped with a sugary sweet glaze creates a nostalgic treat that will leave you hungry for more and it says if you if you put them in the microwave for eight seconds it will transport you to your favorite donut shop that 100 crispy cocaine mmm he's good enough to texture cookies I know magic if you did put these in the microwave you would soften that glaze up yeah well them I'll love up that's good mm-hmm a while back one of the Dewey's bakery geminate shops made it to our favorites video and they may have been a birthday or something actually weapon several Dewey's products making cookies make it to our favorites video but I remember that specific doughnut shop one because it has that texture I love the crispness of that glaze and I don't know if you could lose it a little bit in the microwave or not but it's very very good I think that's enough light for them and the cinnamon is good he's overpowering now yeah nothing is overpowering in which it takes it all yes it's very very good I would bought these again these are delicious they're good there's I think I like some other other cookies better but they're good at all icon I think it's way way way too expensive would you get um I mean you get literally six cookies for how long four dollars I'm wondering if that would be cheaper somewhere else bad baby don't worry I'll be here yeah around here they're very hard to find well Kroger has on and actually Walmart has them too but they only have very very basic cookies yes they don't have anything special at all they're just the basic Nerys cookies so you have to go in a place like Whole Foods or The Fresh Market if you wanna be more sensitive anyone right if you want them more especially please I'm telling you what though I would pay $4 again for those because I like on that land that they're good I think they're overpriced what they are they are good they're terrific and they're huge they're thick and just the texture isn't wonderful you're good that's the big double price okay like Kevin said 365 Everyday Value is that Whole Foods my opening of them this is the Apple streusel granola it has cinnamon and spice and the reason we have them down here is because you can eat this like cereal you can but that's not how I eat it I eat it with yogurt and you need 58 grams I eat it with my yogurt and so I want to show you how much you get 58 grams is 250 calories and this is limited edition it says our apple streusel granola starts in the way any great granola should with whole grain rolled oats but the rest of the recipe is inspired by the classic German crumbly topping we've added dried apples along with seasonal spices including cinnamon and a signature spice flim to this perfectly sweet and crunchy granola this tried-and-true combination of flavors makes our seasonal granola a must-have in your fall pantry whether enjoyed alone are dressed up with a crisp with crisp fall apples and yogurt it's a satisfying breakfast enjoy it while it lasts to get a pretty decent sized Bowl I mean it's not full so the date on these this is good until April so if you like this enough you can just buy extra boxes since its limited edition unless so it's pretty broken up there are a couple of bigger honks like this than most of this is loose I got Apple I get Apple but nothing else no there's a it's got the calm like a cup of cauliflower to be told that taste is like every over know about them mm-hmm it's a basic regular grenoble I'm sure they're pieces of Apple in here too like this one right there right but you could that's what you do right there yeah / - yeah that's what you taste is the Apple so you get the Apple and there's a basic granola what were you expecting it's Apple person so yeah a little bit more sermon no but I don't post a cinema no but they maybe they wanted to make it appealing to everyone so they didn't make it strong but I will tell you this when I went back and when I bought this in all foods also bought one that we had already reviewed last year which was the I think it's called like poking spice with cranberries anyone I'm almost finished with my box already I have like this much left but I noticed that it really doesn't taste like pumpkin pumpkin spice at all i mean it it's really good quality granola and it does have cranberries in it and some pumpkin seeds but you don't taste that you would never know in a million years that you were eating the pumpkin spice so I've done see I heard yeah I figured this would be light on the flavor as well done and it really is them when you get a piece of the Apple it has a different texture it has a little bit of a chewiness to it so it's good that they made up their little small squares yeah so it's really nice that they make them that small because they're it's Apple it's very chewy um but you don't get a lot of those so for the most part you come away with this Tyson regular granola regular girl so so this is good I think I like the pumpkin more just because of what it has in it it has cranberries and those pumpkin seeds in it this doesn't happen right this has little apples so I like this but I probably would not get this one again I would keep getting the other one and the cookies that I told you I would get those getting in I like them a lot nothing there are very good cookies so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "xqJV7qTHJRk": "what the [ __ ] are you gonna do what am i gonna do you're gonna use that pen and you're gonna give us some feedback so first things first first of all you could maybe start with saying hello to people hi everybody how's everyone doing introduce introduce us yes steve this is luke thank you thank you okay and what are we doing here today we're going to be reviewing the strain here which is apple fritter so just we want to go a little bit more in depth with the strange we really had we met we did a little sort of quick synopsis on apple fritter and then it was like you know everyone was suddenly asking for us and wanted to know more about it and then we feel like we owe you more so we have the terpene test for this and now we're going to go into a much deeper insight to us uh to give you a better understanding about the strain apple fritters and first of all i just want to read out a little bit here of leafly uh basically says you know very straight forward here apple fritter oh one second here apple fritter is a true hybrid strain it's known for its powerful relaxing high put out by lumpy's flowers apple fritter is a strain with with secret origins oh so we don't know exactly where it comes from um and um i'm basically here relaxing is the is the top thing is the top feeling from us sour apple and animal cookies is uh is is is what created apple fritters first things first what's the flavors so first things first don't hit steve's pen that's his back off um what is the setting that you like i start with the lowest setting white it sounds like that you changed from that though is that later later on in the day or when you are you fit or when you get to the end of the cart you hit it however what do you mean by you start here i just the first tin i'm going to take is going to be the flavor flavor yes all right are you going to share you do any knock-off swap no you got to get your own card come on man i know i don't have to go and get a little bunch of them here come on give me get an alcohol swab or something all right just let me hit it first sure okay you do that first all right so should i hit it right now yeah uh-oh i may need to give it the preheat yeah being in the car give it to two clicks two clicks preheats the oil for you nothing worse when you're in a cold car and you can't get your head and you're trying to suck it through and it's just it's the worst so the preheat function really helps you get it what is it i just hit i mean it's a good hit i don't know that's a good hit i don't know what happened you know this is the other thing this is actually like a type 4 setting because i talked to another guy and he said he doesn't use any of the settings he just uses the preheat that's all he does two clicks keeps it and boom it tastes good it does it has a it's like a caramel apple yeah yeah it just tastes like a pastry a little bit i don't know what strain really tastes like apple i guess cakes cakes cake strains this is this is the steve's special here look at this down here look that's a good cloud for a low setting good cloud for a low setting that's right so here we go now okay i'm feeling the tingles they're coming now are the tingles the result of the terps or is it the result of d8 it's both it's both i'm being fooled because it's really well i think that the best thing would be is you know maybe we could do a raw we could do a wall test versus like a terpene test and do wrong one thing go on just one more that's a good sign why because you want more hey we could also ask we could ask if jarrell's out there normally i don't like vape cards okay so i'm gonna try this again because i wasn't super as i said the cakey the pies i just haven't really been there when it comes to this that's just not really what i like so you're gonna you're gonna pop it in your mouth yeah all right let's go on squeeze scooter over here come on steve come on all the way over there now are we all in are we all in the shop yeah we good okay so i'm back so we're just talking about the apple fritters um we're going to talk more about the terpenes what the terpenes do god that's a lot for me um so basically we just want to know what's the flavor like what is the feeling so you get the setting that you prefer that's it for me i'm on the white setting this is 4.5 terps and uh let me just see here now how it tastes yeah i get that like the cakey it's a cakey sort of sweet not really my thing honestly not really my thing i don't like that it wasn't my thing until me i got to turn it up as you can see where are you going ready he likes a red heart he likes a red hot top to get on cough to get off look at this big dragon here this is nice so what are the flavors like a like kind of like an apple tart type deal you ever had like a part chart growing up like apple flavored apple cinnamon something like that brown sugar or something but yeah is that is that something is that something that you like i don't like that i like apple jacks whoever ever had apple juice yeah i like cinnamon and apples together this is good all right so we're gonna go in a little bit more no you know i will say this i think the delta a thing straight away what i feel is i notice it always around my eyes i feel like just like a little ever so like heaviness so basically the question that steve was wondering is are the feelings that you have when you smoke that is it from the terps or is it from the d8 and it's actually a blend of both i think we could do like a raw we could do a raw sample first see how that feels and then we can do another one another day but so just to just to go briefly into this terpene test and each one of the al's products all come with the terpene test we want all of you to be getting familiar with these tests you should scan that the the can verify qr code that is here on each and everyone's products um this is a one-time qr code and it can't be duplicated so there's no fakes with this and it you have all of your tests in here for every single one of our products and um so the main thing here is when you look at the terpene test and honestly for me for years i sort of i have these tests um and i don't really know what i'm looking at just to be perfectly honest and there's so much information here that it's overwhelming if we think about cannabinoids and you know i think if we talk about like thc versus cbd cbg i mean you get to cbn i mean you that's four cannabinoids you might have like a few people that know all four when you start going down to like th tv and on all of these others people just lose lose touch and with the terpenes i mean it's like you're getting hit there's like there's probably like 40 different terpenes on here right now and i can't even pronounce half the names but the main but the main thing i wanted to share with you is that there's there's some core groups of terpenes and those core groups of terpenes can give you a pretty good synopsis you can get by without needing to know every single terpene under the sun and so when we look at this here today uh so the first thing is is pining right let's just go into quickly pining is what we would consider to be more of the up the awake uh mental clarity and um and you'll see alpha pinene and beta pining the two isomers of each other and then we also have mercene mercene is is your indicas your og kush uh sedation um and and we're actually i got a lot of this information uh credit to uh corey up at immuno organics i just hopped on a phone call with him beforehand i'll probably have him here on the show he knows more about this stuff than anybody i've ever met and uh he really schooled me asking where the different terpene tests were for the al's products and really opened up my mind to it so basically um after mercy and then you've got caryophyllene so beta-carotelline is basically a big uh anti-inflammatory and pain reliever so if we just look at all of these right now you can see on the apple fritters that we have the most amount of terpenes is actually with beta-caryophyllene that was the last one that i just said uh on the example and that is a huge anti-inflammatory and pain reliever uh from the research that we've done online and from the anecdotal information that i've been given uh from my friends in the industry and um and so straight away we see that that's up 1.2 percent and that means that you if you if you have pain or you're you're you you've tension that you're going to get some relief there and then also we see there is a half a percent of mercene mercing is going to be very relaxing very sedating so if you put those two together now you have something that is going to give a lot of relief a lot of relief a lot of uh relaxation and um you know basically everything you think of when you think about smoking right like i'm chilled out my pain is less and um and so that's basically apple fritters in a nutshell there's also alpha there's point four percent of alpha bistro i'll have that information oh no god we also have here the limonene uh limonene where i wrote that down somewhere um limonene is something that is oh what was it inflammatory it was an anti it's anti-inflammatory is that what it is yeah lemony and so it's got one percent it's got one percent that's also that apple sort of lemony appley flavor is coming from the one percent of the limonene in there and uh so overall what you have here is something that is pretty well balanced um sweet flavor and uh again the cakiness i see look you see try to trick me there this apple jack yeah come on no i'm not that i'm not i'm just not that type of guy i don't have it sorry i don't smoke 25 blunts in a day i can't the other thing to notice is uh clogging happens less with lower voltages so if you are smoking honestly that feels a little harsh to me even with even with my even on the white setting really yeah do you two not get that at all yeah the white's good enough for me yeah i'm definitely feeling this i definitely i definitely feel it [Music] you should have seen the first video we did with this we went through too many of them and at the end of it at the end of it it was just like we don't want to get there we don't want to get there again i'm sorry to get there just i'm learning with this stuff it's the optimal dose no sense in overdosing yeah but i smoked for so many years so i need to like so that's the other thing like so do you even yeah so you probably don't even do you no i feel that i feel it but like i need to turn it up too like that little it's not gonna do it's not gonna do it for me that little like white or blue i need to cough to get off man gotta count together oh that's right all right so let's do that oh let's give it a score let's do that let's give it a score once i did ten what would you well how would how would you write it [Music] i think is probably for me is probably the straw nana i think is a 10. yeah that is like that is the strawberry at the start and the banana at the finish and i think i think that's quality i really like that uh what is the other one i mean bronze has always been one that everybody just loves runs northern lights for me tastes like sort of like cola like coke i don't know how to explain it it's like i don't know what it is it's a really nice flavor northern lights those two are product they're all like probably my tennis i need to look through more of them but those are really and i have a unique flavor that i really enjoy i don't really like like for instance all the cake straight i think yeah some of them are sweeter than others or pies or whatever it is but i find like a foam i like the purpley flavor that is there for the runts i like that sort of candy like flavor for the runts um as it said it's the uniqueness of the northern lights and yeah skittles is sweet i like that girl scout cookies really good all right i think we're good here uh so what it is there's an eight out of ten an eight out of ten and then i gave it a six so it's probably around a seven seven out of ten total well you know what people really like the name they really like the name and they're they're excited about it it's something new so i think that i think that it is gonna do well and the next one we're gonna do a cantaloupe haze well i think we'll save that for another day though um yeah and that is a very unique one too but anyway let's leave it there let me talk my head off now all right", "-OJrbFWGhuM": "[Music] hi you guys welcome back to my channel i hope you guys are doing wonderful today so for today it's a quick one um

thicker so yeah it's chewy and like sticky when you chew them properly i was really skeptical about these pancakes i've seen some cheat days and they were small they were flat but these were proper let's make it even better with some nutella oh yes here we go grab some nutella [Music] i'm just gonna spread it on this one right here because take the other pancake and just make a sandwich oh yeah now i'm excited nutella pancake sandwich radio the cheat days are getting better and better here we go i was looking forward to this day wait whole week and this is my favorite so far better than the mixed sausages i just have to do this oh my god the pancakes are so soft and flavorful and with the nutella just makes it complete mcdonald's props to you [Music] sadly this is the last bite [Music] and the whole breakfast is gone it has passed an hour i'm in the living room i'm heading to the kitchen to make some epic stuff so last week i made donuts this week i will also use the donut dough but i'm not gonna make the donuts i'm gonna make just apple fritters but i want to change it up i want to try something new today so i'm going to boil i'm going to put softened butter in the bowl and i'm going to add some brown sugar to it so i want to try something new i'm going to make a paste out of this and as well i will add some cinnamon this is basically your cinnamon bun filling i've got my green apples also the cinnamon allspice brown sugar as well i'm gonna add some dark brown sugar and to make it even crazier guys i'm gonna add some baking chocolate chips so i want to see how this all turns out it might be a mistake but it's fun to try i've got the dough perfect donut though springy springs back gonna roll it out now i'm just gonna take this butter mixture and guys let me know in the comment section down below should i make it cinnamon buns in my next cheat day video because this looks pretty damn good and i think this is how you make cinnamon bun so now i want to add some corn starch just to get some moisture out then i'm gonna take my apples so there we go all the apples now we're gonna go hat with some brown sugar again some dark brown sugar add some old spice seasoning not too much and two apple fritters you gotta add a lot of cinnamon like a lot to get a crispy edge you need to add cake flour there we go and now let's go crazy with the chocolate chips so i'm just gonna do this right like so the whole bag of this chocolate chips i have no idea how this will turn out let's just go roll it up in a big log i should have just baked it like this just gonna roll it out make it all into one so i kind of have it rolled out now i want to fold it again and roll it out again this is how you create those layers there we go kind of rolled out now i need to cut it just add it together so flour and for the last time try to roll it again cut it and you want to make a big log out of it or two logs add some flour again and now just cut your apple fritters or fritters i'm not sure how to say it guys i say fritters fritters i don't know so i gotta cut out again some flour on one and just press it really thin and there you have it your apple cinnamon chocolate fritter there we go the last one is done i added a little flour on the bottom because i noticed with my fritters the bottom just gets so soggy and i almost can't take them off so hopefully the flour will take out the moisture and add some more flour on top just to get rid of the moisture so yeah there we go guys these are my crazy apple fritters with a cinnamon bun filling and chocolate chip you can see the chocolate chips right there so there they go they will need at least two hours to rise something new i wanted to try out i'm not sure how this will turn out but they look pretty good hopefully they won't get too soggy and they stay together i don't know i will see in two hours now i gotta clean up the mess the worst part of making donuts yo guys but wait what's that so yeah i went to the bubble in between the time and i said as bad as three hours it's 108 and it's now time to fry these apple craziness oil heating up almost done but before i have the oil i do want a delicious frosting or a glaze for the apple first duplicate the cinnamon roll just so here we go cream cheese i've got here melted butter going to add fresh honey to this and i'm just going to whisk this in together so there we go this is your cream cheese frosting and i want a simple glazed one adding some powdered sugar do this again a little bit of honey and just a couple drops of water and whisk this in also when i add a couple drops of vanilla there we go a simple delicious honey glaze let's go and fry up these fritters i'm not sure if this will hold together but we will find out second one the last one for now it looks good let's see after a second i will say it smells pretty damn good let's see they are holding together the color is perfect so far so good just look and listen guys this is foodborne asmr enjoy this apple first crying yeah here we go i did take a couple out and now let's just glaze them i'm just gonna lightly they're holding together so that's pretty damn good and they are crispy i can feel it so with the glaze hopefully they will somewhat soften up i've got all the fritters fried up and i glazed most of them in a light icing sugar coating and some i just left plain because they will get crispy and just to change it up a bit just gonna take a dollop while they are hot and just glaze it on top the apple fritter cinnamon bun flavored chocolate radia the dollop on there and just spread it oh yeah there we go guys got some of the apple fritters topped with the glaze and some are just plain this looks so so tasty i'm gonna let them cool off a bit i'm gonna clean the kitchen because it is again a mess and i will see you upstairs with a mint lunch sweet meal oh yeah it's two tutti getting pretty late my second meal of the day my lunch is gonna be a sweet one we're gonna start with the milk i'm hungry guys last meal was at 8 30 or something i did have a couple snacks in between like a small chocolate kitkat and i got a orange juice a small one as well two feet banana milk banana flavored milk oh wow oh wow i need something sweet so let's go guys first i'm going to start with the protein cookie so here we go my protein rocky road cookie really lacking my protein so i need some protein protein cookie right here gooey looks kind of dry i was really expecting a crazy cookie today but let's just try this out [Music] this is not a cookie but it's like so gooey and dense not really liking it to be honest but it has protein some fiber something healthy i would give this like i don't know five out of ten not even four out of ten it's not that good with this milk it's seven out of ten but for you not my cup of tea next as well i want something like something to eat with a spoon and i don't want to have my ice cream now so this is a custard vanilla and chocolate flavor or a potting this is custard really liquidy um this is the old school pasta custard for all the dutch folks right here really liquidy chocolate chocolate and vanilla flavor mmm ah i just love to eat this with a small food enjoy it [Music] um hell yeah my lingerie is something sweet oh my oh my gosh to the side and now let's just go with the main course of the day i really have no idea what to expect but my mouth is very wary and i want just to bite into it here we go guys and just listen to the oiliness when i bite through it here we go wow wow the big brother of the apple fritter look at this so oily so soft and the flavors the brown sugar some chocolate chips i don't really taste it as much but the brown sugar and the best part right here the crispy edge crispy edge with the cream cheese apple wow this is fire no joke this is a flavor town um guys the creations are getting better and better a nine and a half out of it then piece of the edge so oily it's so damn tasty i gotta i gotta give you a bite of this i will say without the cream cheese it looks much much better so look look at this side oh my god omg apple chunks and this one has a lot of chocolate chips didn't add too much glaze on it it's crispy listen wow wow you can't even see the dough on how much brown sugar and cinnamon i added this the crunch [Applause] is the apple fritter without the sugar glaze this is even more crispier if i make this again i'm gonna leave out the icing when i add cream cheese on top because it's much better right there [Music] yeah much better without the glazed icing and i can taste the cream cheese more last bite right there apple inside the grease firmed up oh my i think i i prefer my apple fritters more over my donuts no joke i got them figured out this is bomb the time is now 2 40 i'm going to enjoy this custard maybe just crumble up the cookie inside like so hell yeah the cookie is not good so the custard will make it a little bit better enjoy this really quick i'm not gonna go too crazy today at least i think so [Music] oh my god i'm sorry i had to pause the video but damn look at this i was just shocked when i bit into this the cream cheese is setting the layers in the fridge and this one has a little bit more dough which doesn't feel that oily oh my god guys you gotta like the video the apple fritters are getting better and better best apple fritter i've ever made wow i'm happy i made this instead of doughnuts and with the milk i love swedes too much here we go last bite and this 9.8 out of that wow that was good to show you the time almost three o'clock might go for a walk [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh all right the ice cream is like melting but yeah grab myself two bowls of ice cream pistache and dolce latte flavor and it's melting like crazy like i said it's like 30 degrees it's so warm i'm sweaty as hell um but this kind of refreshing i will say that oh my god this is so messy and this is like the most packed ice cream place i've seen was waiting for 10 minutes you can see how warm it is i didn't even get it like three minutes ago and it's melting like crazy [Music] i kind of regret buying it it's good but it's not fun to eat quickly gonna finish this oh wow that bite smells pretty damn good some of the cone and the ice cream this is a relaxed dj [Music] at the end brady and this reminds me so much of a cannoli right now [Music] so yeah i really regret buying this and i don't have a napkin and i'm like all over the place messy yeah i'm just sitting here on the stairs wanting to eat this as quickly as possible the city is packed it's like really warm people are walking sitting on benches having ice cream and i'm here an idiot just walking around with my camera so let's walk a little bit more and and just like that we got home you can see how warm it is outside i'm sweaty under my titties so i just gotta my mom is just eating and she will make some food for me because today i just don't want to prepare something so this is what she had for herself and i thought you know what i have the same thing today so these are basically sausages here i have two chicken piri piri marinated chicken sausages barbecue and i've got a couple of these chew up basically bulk on sausages with these sausages my favorite cheap ass meal radio lasagna i'm gonna have this as my meal my mom is gonna prepare it i'm gonna take a shower because i'm sweaty and i just feel so nasty and dinner is served by my mom so first let's start with some healthy stuff i've got a simple salad with cucumber tomato and lettuce then i have here the meshed up corn mixture and this is just like mashed up potatoes but just simply made with corn flour and this is so damn good which is called buddha it's basically just boiled some water added some corn flour and she made like a mashed potato like mixture and with this i might have a little bit of cream cheese paprika and chili flavored low fat of course and you gotta add milk with this or yogurt but i prefer milk so here i have my lasagna which is which is hot it's kind of still sizzling inside so this will be at the end and on this plate i've got a simple white piece of bread slice of bread my chihuahua chichi and the chicken piripi sausages i will have this honey chipotle sauce i had in my last video with the sausages and of course some barbecue sauce almost 6 30 and let's just start with this meal and i'm going to start with the mesh corn flour right here and childhood bulk on favorite because my granddad always made it and it just reminds me of when he made it normally my grandma cooked for me as a child but this is the only thing my granddad always cooked and it's called pura basically just corn flour and the thing with this is normally you add a mixture of cram fresh yogurt and butter to this on top warm but i in some way enjoy it with just milk yeah guys i know it's weird you add milk on

with this this is a dutch treat which is called bokeh poaches it is basically just meringue like the macaron it has a mocha filling and it's covered in chocolate and some kind of hazelnut crunch it's like crunchy really light like a macaron i really like delicious yeah a really cheap chocolate wafer today memories memories come back oh wait oh these wave was next thing adam i did put it in the fridge tiny firm now but it's still like melting let's try it out never had almond one whoa whoa that has a lot of almond filling some caramel on the bottom not sure [Music] if i like this more or the peanut butter one i think i like the peanut butter one more here we go pick up a double or triple chocolate bar had this one before and this is just so amazing [Music] they call this the triple chocolate one because it has a chocolate biscuit chocolate filling and a chocolate ganache in the middle this is chocolatey [Music] this is going to be my plate next thing i'm going to try and i'm

completely the pickle bar on there the almond snickers in there some of these cookies crumble up the wafer let's just put two of these and one wafer to the side the skippy bite just use it as peanut

this is so sugary sweet but i love it wow [Music] it looks like a pile of mess but this pile of masks is a really tasty pile of mess um wave up let's work this [Music] if i can be real this meal was not enjoyable last bite of the ice cream jungle and with not enjoyable everything was like melted the chocolate was soft wasn't crunchy wasn't hard my fingers are all sticky it was not bananas gone not really enjoyable it was good though and i think guys i'm gonna skip on the apple fritter this is just way too oily and yeah it would really upset my stomach that is basically it for this cheat day i'm pretty full not gonna lie so the ice cream is gone and i ate almost half of this container almost this whole container of cookies for sure the pint is gone and i think my favorite thing of the night were these pecan pie eminem and this skippy but it was like melted so i didn't get the flavors how i wanted to get them but these m m's pecan pie after a couple of eating them the flavors are really strong something i've never had this reminds me of coffee of mocha of a dark bitter taste which i really like i do prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate so this dark heavy taste i really like so these m m's i think are the best m m's i've had so guys i'm gonna just end the video right here drink my water i will say i'm pretty satisfied i could eat more but it is now 9 30 and i just don't want to eat too late might grab something savory i'm not gonna have the chips because i'm just it's just too warm to eat that is the excuse i'm gonna give you ah i feel pretty pretty damn good

country style yeah listen it's very good obviously it's not comparable to the obviously it's not compared to the the other bakeries that I had the other day but you know what for a franchise doughnut it's actually it pretty good it's big in size so I was in the carwash I have done just in the process of exiting it's a jumbo size and like I said I've always liked country style they always made good

Well for me, who grew up in upstate New York, it always meant one thing \u2026 a trip to\nthe orchards. There we would pick baskets of apples, go on a hay ride, and before we\nleft we always got a cup of hot mulled cider and some freshly made apple fritters. Those\ntrips were some of my best memories as a kid. So today I'm gonna recreate those recipes\nso I can share those memories with you. We begin by peeling and coring a few apples\nand instead of cutting them into chunks, we're going to cut them into round slices \u2026 like\nthis. Now we dip these into a traditional fritter\nbatter, which is simply some flour, a bit of sugar, baking powder, milk, and an egg.\nThe key to these is to dip 'em one slice at a time. Then carefully put them into hot oil.\nThat way, they won't stick together. After a minute or two, flip 'em so they get\ngolden brown on both sides before draining them on paper towels.\nNow finish them off with lots of powdered sugar and serve 'em up with hot mulled cider\ntopped with whipped cream and drizzled with caramel,just like I had growing up, Both recipes\nfor the Apple Fritters and Spiced Caramel Apple Cider are online now so you\ncan share my memories of apple season in a really sweet way. I'm\nHoward in the Mr Food Test Kitchen, where every day we're looking for more memorable\nways for you to say \u2026                            \"OOH IT'S SO GOOD!!\u00ae\"", "DwS_hva8_-I": "what's up everybody Carlos here with the very first episode of Randy's Donuts so I've been working by Randy's Donuts for 10 years most of the time it's it's it's not that busy you can drive up to the drive-through window grab a doughnut and you're on your way out you can walk up you're not the weight but in the last year I've noticed that it got really busy and I wondered why I went one of these days and I saw that they had a complete new completely new menu of premium donuts so I decided I'm gonna try all of them but first I'm gonna go ahead and try a classic this is their freakin apple fritter is it considered a doughnut I don't know what's a fritter who knows but it's one of my favorites it's flaky soft in the middle and it has a nice crunch on the outside mmm love it right away come by um stop by next week or tomorrow I'm not sure how often I'm gonna do this to see what their other stuff tastes like", "7yrTy0soPHw": "it's almost a rock this is almost a rock guys you could almost throw this through someone's window we have to be fair how did this one turn into you know what i mean i'm taking them out of this edge okay this is hard i'm telling you if someone was ever attacking me i would just throw it at him shout out to the kj family rocking with kristen and jamil and we're back you guys for another review you guys today we're doing a mcdonald's mcbakery review yes we're super excited about we have new items um that mcdonald's has that we've never tried before they have a cinnamon roll um they have an apple fritter they have a blueberry muffin uh so we're gonna review all three and then we also got a blueberry muffin from dunkin donuts stuck in donuts yes so we can at least compare just to see which muffin is better exactly we tried to get the other two items from dunkin donuts as well to do a complete review of all the items together uh to see what tastes better but dunkin donuts did not have a cinnamon roll or an apple fritter exactly so we're just gonna review the mcdonald's let you know what we think that's right shout out to uh turtle look like urkel because he had mentioned this idea a few weeks back a couple weeks back or so so shout out to him because uh honestly this was a great idea i wanna i've been wanting to try their stuff for a little bit so i'm glad we finally had a chance to do it me too so cool we got our jack well i got my jack mug right here it's really cute all right it's cool yeah that's a good one i have a coffee that i've been drinking so nice coffee yep uh so we are going to get it in guys we're going to test it out uh let's start with what do you want to say oh of course okay thumbnail's super working okay are you ready yeah uh i don't know what to do so we're not we're comparing we're reviewing okay one two three okay whatever you want to start with let's start with the i want to save the cinnamon roll for last okay so let's start in the middle okay it's kind of random start in the middle but we're doing it yeah uh this this uh apple fritter guys you know what i mean the apple fritter looks sad it looks a little sad a little dry uh it needs some stuff it looks like it needs some stuff so the inside is is pretty dry itself it's a little more moist i think i think there's a little bit more maybe moisture inside there um i wouldn't know because you're holding it oh gosh okay so here's let me at least explain this the fro usually apple fritters have like frosting over it uh it either melted or they didn't have enough you can see the glaze yes the glaze a little bit edge yeah here but it's not yeah like you said i don't know what happened to it exactly um it feels kind of soft it does it's awesome um but it looks dry on the outside for sure that's right it just looks like it doesn't have much life to it exactly and how much did we pay for this do you know a fan this was two dollars and some chains for just the apple fritter is that a lot yes it was hold on i'm looking it was two dollars and 39 cents is that a lot yes if you go to a bakery the bakery over here they're like a dollar really yes and they're way bigger way bigger i have to say you guys are we are apple fritter connoisseurs so we're gonna let you know if this is good enough looks wise though it's not looking fab exactly and we're gonna rate this one to ten we'll let you know if these these are uh hit or misses by the way um because we want to let you guys know in case you want to get these how they are it smells like apple and i thought i saw a chunk of apple but yeah the inside's soft so okay let's do this without further ado let's take a bite one two three hmm okay you know i gotta be honest about mcdonald's the thing about them some of their stuff that they have doesn't always look the part but the taste is pretty consistent they're pretty good about getting the taste down you know what i'm saying like i feel like i've had things from there that didn't look great but they tasted great i gotta be honest this apple fritter is very good for how that looks if i went to apple if i went to a donut shop and i saw an apple fritter that looked that's dry and lacking of frosting i'd be like that's old and i don't want it but this is actually really good i've had worse apple this yeah um it's not the best it's not the best that i've ever had but um it was it was pleasant yeah it is moist when you eat it which is good it's soft um at least on the inside it's soft the outside's a little hard but it's not like that hard like you know you can tell it's it's it's fairly fresh fairly whatever that means you know because we've had like old apple fritters before that's hella dry and you know when it's old this doesn't taste all this tastes like it's been made today it's just it looked pretty bad yeah so what would you rate it one out of ten [Music] seven seven yeah maybe six and a half okay like i know there's way better i'm gonna go with the six just because i've had the best uploaded in the world i feel it i feel it and that's not that okay so six i'm gonna say i would give that a five okay because i've yeah i've had yeah we did have like one of the best albums in the world apple tree apple was it apple health apple hill apple tree same thing anyways i would rate this if i'm comparing it to the best one that we've ever had for sure that's probably a five it's passable you can eat it it does have the apple flavor in it um the inside is soft which is really good just missing the glaze and a little bit more sweetness i want a little more sweetness but if you're an apple pudding fan it's good it's pretty good i'd say try it out and it tastes good with the coffee i just did a little coffee taste test and it's pretty good eat it warm exactly yeah okay what do you want to try next whatever one you want how about you pick okay well since you want to see if the cinnamon roll for last yeah let's do the muffin from mcdonald's okay and then we'll compare them okay so i'll write about this sounds good okay so let's see all right muffins next can you move your jack i think they've seen it enough he's cute i'll just hold it up i'll just hold him above my head i want this guys okay um now this muffin ooh i screamed when i said that this muffin um is actually pretty all the time it's actually pretty soft yeah this muffin's really soft um and it look i think it looks really appealing that does look good it has like a i don't even know what this powder stuff yeah on one side it's like a crumble it looks like it has like a crumble thing on one side of the muffin yeah but it's blueberry um again this was two dollars and some change as well okay uh 2.19 that's about right that's about right for a muffin because muffins are a little bit more expensive than doughnuts so to me and it's a blueberry one that tends to make a lot of sense yeah watch out the top on this one has completely popped off so the dunkin donuts muffin dunkin i'm already here it's the duncan muffin yes i guess it's not donuts anymore duncan muffin the top is off but okay which one do you want to try first uh let's try uh the duncan one first okay so the daca one has like a sugar like on top yeah here can you hold it the top has been popped off guys oh god it's fine literally it's right through the seinfeld episode top of the muffin to you they were only selling muffin tops oh that's right which is a genius idea yeah but this muffin top's hard yeah and the body is soft it is so it's falling apart and like look at this i mean i just put it down and it's like crumbling so let's eat it before it collapses completely okay so i'm not in the top okay good idea it has a glaze of sugar on top okay just a lot of sugar i don't like the sugar crystals on top i'm telling you that off the bat yeah the crystals are i mean you've had crystals before they're sweet but because they're so thick they're too crunchy yeah they just don't work well with it i don't think you need a sugar crystal on a muffin no you don't let's do the body of the muffin okay honestly i don't love it that's like the three that's like a three for me i've had a lot of i've had a lot of blueberry muffins that one's definitely in the not that great one i would never get that again i wouldn't get it either i wouldn't call it a three okay well what do you like about it what do you don't like about it i like the body of it i think it's soft you've got a good blueberry flavor you take one bite of it it's big it's hearty yeah it's just not like the best yeah i'll give it a five five huh out of ten that's a three to me i'm just like i don't like this too this part's not cool the crystal thing and if you've ever had yeah if you've ever had a blueberry muffin from costco it's a life changer it changes your life and you can't go back you can't have these you can't you can't have these anymore facts yeah i mean i've had better brand muffins than that [Laughter] we all know brand muffins are decent yeah no a lot of people do i'm just i'm just never not a fan of them i don't know never been i just like that chocolate or blueberry okay let's try mcdonald's okay i'm excited for mcdonald's it looks soft yeah um it looks fresher yeah i'm so mad about this muffin top oh this smells very blueberry and there's like chunks i just want to say like more fresher chunks of blueberry in this right off the bat muffin than the dunkin donuts one yeah you're right about the blue oh go you can take a bite you're right about the smell it smells like blueberries are all through this so i wonder if they actually they use fresh blueberries for sure i told you mcdonald's does it right oh yeah that's how it should be done that's how it should be done to a coffee test i don't know why you're irritating me right yeah that's right jack agrees too get a coffee everywhere i don't love the muffin you don't love it huh no i do um i don't know why but i don't like it you must not like do you like the inside of it like do you like you know versus the top of it or something like that no it's hard to explain i almost feel like the duncan blueberry muffin has a more blueberry muffin traditional taste yeah i almost feel like the mcdonald's one it's almost like it's just not traditional and tastes it's almost a little too blueberry to me i don't know am i tripping the mcdonald's one is more like costco the way costco's are because costco's are soft like that they're more like uh bready if that makes sense the other one's like crumbly the dunkin ones more this has crystals on it too of sugar unless that came from that it might have come from that okay because i keep crunching on sugar it's probably from that because this the sugar got everywhere so yeah oh wow yeah i i would i would give this in my opinion i you can like it well i love it i do love it i would give this a seven to seven and a half even mm-hmm because this with coffee is so good it's so good you can't have it with the club it has to be by itself well just by itself even with by itself even it's it's a seven seven probably seven yeah seven okay this is how okay duncan blueberry muffin is like a muffin you'll get from like a convenience store okay it's not bad it's not good it's like whatever yeah this just to me has a weird flavor that i'm not digging i give this muffin a 4 out of 10. listen no one's listening no one's here for your opinion okay they're here for mine and i'm sorry i wish i liked it i do i'm just giving away don't like the flavor it's a weird flavor to me yes i had some trouble with mcdonald's a couple weeks ago you guys where i was like i'm never going to mcdonald's again because i got really really bad like crazy heartburn from it i got like a really but anyways with that said mcdonald's is doing it right i like their their pastries i feel like so far the mcdonald's one tastes fresher it does taste fresher which is which is big to me because and it looks better and it is softer it's softer and i do think a lot of people probably would prefer this muffin over the other yeah 100 is just something to me about the flavor that i don't love and i really can't put my finger on it except for the fact that it just doesn't taste like a traditional blueberry muffin to me i get it maybe it's like more artisan i don't know yeah i feel it yeah okay you guys we're going in for our last one but looks wise this looks way better than the duncan one yeah i'm gonna say um keeping an on our theme about hit or miss that the donut at the beginning i'd say that's definitely a hit and i would definitely say yeah the apple fritter apple fritter is a hit yeah the blueberry mcdonald's muffin for me is a hit for you i mean i'm gonna say it's a hit because although it's not my type of flavor got it it's still a good it's a good muffin sure so i definitely think it's a hit i just don't think it's like my favorite muffin you know but i call it a hit for sure well that dunkin donuts a miss yeah the duncan park mix well no that doesn't make sense it's a yeah the dunkin muffin is a miss yeah a bigness too in all factors even the look of it you know yeah it just doesn't look good okay here we go we are going in our face yep and i think this is a little dry here i'll just let's just break up a piece i'll let you break up the piece first okay what can we talk about how this looks first oh yeah yeah it's dry it's dry af we should have used the heat of the sab i did well sorry we should have heated it up more yeah it's hard how does the inside though let's just eat the inside how about this you have the outside that way you get a good assessment of the outside and i'll get the gooey inside i feel like it's a good company i'm like heck now oh my gosh i feel like that's a good compromise all right should we do the inside yes okay so the outside's hard like it's like touching this thing is like it's almost a rock this is almost a rock guys you could almost throw this through someone's window we have to be fair we've been it's been sitting up for a while though like if it was fresh would it be softer that's true that's true it wouldn't be because this is ridiculous the other ones were sent out too for it's like why is this one a rock how did this one turn into you know i'm taking them out of this edge okay this is hard i'm telling you if someone was ever attacking me i would just throw it at them oh let's go for it i've never gotten a crunch on a cinnamon roll ever that's not good the frosting is not dead yeah i do agree although i'm joking i guarantee if you did get it from mcdonald's right away and ate it it'd be fresher it's still hard though um it's the frosting the frosting the um cream cheese frosting is not good let me take a bite of the inside what is this hard the inside's hard oh my god whoa cinnamon rolls are our jam and that is not the business that is not a good time it was not something i wanted my mouth ever again so it smells a little weird too have you noticed that even the smell of it is a little it's the frosting the frosting um it's the it's like a cream cheese frosting it is a cream cheese is it supposed to be of course our cinnamon rolls cream cheese fries it's just that this one is obviously made a little different the thing is though it tastes like a cream cheese frosting but it's almost like it's it's it's they've added some dirty socks in there right like something's in there it's a smell that's like what is going on what did they add in there that it's like funky i mean it's not like oh it's not like old like i'm sure this is fine maybe it's old it's just not good you guys listen can you hear it it shouldn't be sounding like that even yeah even though it's been sitting out for a little while like you said it shouldn't be hard ain't even this it should have some bounce there should be something in there nothing yeah no i'm definitely gonna say that um i'm gonna say taste wise let's see what uh also what this cost by the way sorry oh yeah yeah this cost two dollars and sixty nine cents how much is a cinnabon because because if a cinnabon is like 50 cents more it's way more i'm sure it better be because that that i mean this thing is trying to compete within a bun no it's not but you know it's trying to be a good cinnamon roll what do you give it i don't know i don't want to give it a a one oh okay here we go i'm gonna i gotta i gotta say this that that muffin from duncan i gotta upgrade that to a four and i gotta do that because this is a three i thought you gave the duncan muffin a four oh maybe i did i don't know if you didn't maybe it was wrong i thought i gave it a three bucks okay but either way the muffin the dunkin muffin's a four okay this one's a three because if if i was if i really needed a cinnamon roll i was out in a row in the middle of nowhere and a mcdonald's was there and i wanted to eat it i could eat this if it was fresh but i i wouldn't really want to like eat it all the time it just doesn't that cinnamon yeah the the outside tastes fine i guess other than the fact that it's hard something's wrong with the cream cheese frosting oh so bad yeah so someone like dipped their toes in there or something like that and stirred it he did something but it right doesn't it taste like food or something it tastes like you guys they did something to that i don't know it's because they don't like us maybe they know they know we're reviewing them i don't know but it tastes it just tastes a little weird i give it a two out of ten two out of ten oh yeah it is a mess it is a mess and why do we say that for last we should have we should have nobody touching it that it was not going to be good well i i didn't know it just it was actually i would have had that first because it was in line it was pretty bad i would have that first okay i'm very sad that we leave you know what i'm saying apple printer left and i am finishing this isn't it funny how the apple fritter looked the worst but i think this one was the best it was it was the best apple fritter is a hat here's the thing if you're not someone who like and i think you know here's the thing too i don't know if every place is going to be different maybe they didn't put as much glaze on here as they should have i'm not sure but if you're not some if you're someone who's who doesn't like a lot of sugar this is perfect because it is sweet it's very apple-y yeah it is it is more appalling it is very applicable i like it a lot um yeah okay so hit to the apple fritter head to the blueberry muffin from mcdonald's and hit or miss to the cinnamon roll mcdonald's and misted a blueberry dunkin yeah i don't know absolutely yeah so yeah i mean i think it is too i mean i didn't mind the blueberry i didn't like the top at all but the body of the blueberry duncan is fine for me that's right i feel you i get it um i would say try the try the muffin and try the apple fritter from mcdonald's yeah for sure i agree and they're two dollars and some change i don't think it's that expensive that's kind of expensive if you got a donut shop in your area don't even just skip mcdonald's i'm serious and i really wanted a lot i really wanted to like it but i would say go with yeah if you gotta if you got a donut shop in your area that's good just go there so now you're not endorsing it no definitely not none of i mean you know like there's a donut place by us everything's like a 10. or at least a nine you know your local donut shop most likely wouldn't it's to be way better well it should be i mean mcdonald's doesn't specialize in the bakery no they definitely don't i could tell by the the cinnamon roll but if you're going to mcdonald's for coffee and breakfast and you want a pastry exactly you can you know what you get now that's true right so we hope you guys like this review yeah let us know if you tried these before let us know if you liked them or didn't like them let us know if you plan on trying any of these yeah exactly let us know what you think if you did yeah we'd love to hear about it all right guys we will be back again and then

is technically sandy beach road we're just gonna pull up a little bit we're just gonna go to the side here it will be an awesome year okay you got your strut you didn't put my straw in my cup holy i thought you were my assistant anyone liking the side hat oh yeah that's cool okay go for it okay show the camera geez it's all about the oh yeah apple fritter okay you can eat it now sorry oh my gosh i spit up my gum this is the best part gotta get some oxygen wow that must have went at least five feet actually probably went farther than that i'm not gonna lie i had to look for it though are you choking you good okay don't die on me man it's the first day of the year can't tomorrow i don't care but if you die today i'm wow there's a lot of fruit in there well it's a lot of apple but like honestly their donut game is better than the french fry game their donut game is better than tim hortons it's mcdonald's is killing it right now not gonna lie they're killing me slowly too but like it's a good donut the bread is good it's not doughy slightly annoyed i'll be a little bit hard on them they're slightly dory but holy moly it is awesome that's a good donut yeah window close gotcha i'm on it sir i'm on it yeah it's honestly i know this is stupid but it's a great donut like i've not been i have not been let down yet from mcdonald's donuts boston cream on uh tuesday was amazing or no sorry that was wednesday i think wednesday we had boston cream thursday we had um strawberry jelly and today the apple fritter recommended by andrew at mcdonald's [Music] just awesome just absolutely awesome it just seems fresh doesn't it and it's soft for you right it's easy to eat so yeah great great donut anyways we're just coming around you know the slick corner here at sandy beach road it's where we do our donut review so coffee is cheaper too i i think that i should ask mcdonald's if i can start using my um mccafe hot beverage cards because i probably got about 30 of them and i just don't drink hot coffee anymore so i'm wondering if i can start using them for iced coffees i'll even i'll even use like they should just be able to discount it right but i'm gonna ask them so yeah anyways let's turn the screen around you guys don't want to see my fat ugly face", "83MU_yPj-9Y": "hey guys what's up here's another uh thing where i try a thing usually from mcdonald's i guess at this point this is from the mccafe this might look like it's a muffin or something but it's nothing different also ignore the new new background i've moved my table out into the living room which is next to the kit it's a whole mess it's a whole mess anyway mcdonald's has this apple fritter and we're gonna bite into it we're gonna see what it's like it's got apple flavor but no apple like i don't know you can see that very well i mean it's okay yeah still no apple so we'll recommend this from mcdonald's no mcdonald's if you can't do it right don't do it this is an abomination and a front to all apple fritters that have ever been eaten never been made how can make an apple fritter without chunks of apple  you mcdonald's", "BMdEuvFS5Js": "what is up guys Tony come back again with another review so today I'm gonna be reviewing if you saw my last nothing donuts for me you know what I'm reviewing and the air conditioner just kicked on so sorry about that so today I am going to be trying the apple fritter from Dunkin Donuts I've had many an apple fritter in my name but I've never had the one from Dunkin Donuts and I don't believe they have won a Krispy Kreme at least the last time I went there they said they didn't have it maybe that was just that location they had that Apple Cinnamon which is like a it was a yeast doughnut with apple pie filling in it which is really good but I like the hard crust that you get with a fritter so you know I'm really excited to try this and if you saw that maple doughnut reviewed the maple glazed you know that the face kind of hit the bottom of this one you trans it so this is gonna have a little bit of a maple flavor to it so I'm gonna bite in the side that doesn't have the blades on it the maple glaze and see how it is oh wow right off the bat content cinnamon flavor and it has a bit of like an apple saucy kind of flavor to it not like apple pie filling and where you get like chunks of Apple but it's like apple puree so giving it another bright because I'm pretty sure they're supposed to eat like chunks of Apple this hmm so far this is just tasting like their coffee roll with a little bit of apple flavor to it jumping I'm real complaining but just trying to describe what this tastes like get one more right here okay yeah it's not filled so maybe it's hit or miss but uh you know for the apple fritter from Duncan I'm gonna give it three point seven out of five because I've seen them where they're actually filled with chunks of Apple and this one just isn't it's like like I said a coffee roll or a cinnamon roll with a glaze on top can like an apple cinnamon flavoring so it's a bit disappointing to be honest but it's still a very good doughnut so I definitely recommend you give it a try and if yours has the chunks of Apple let me know what you think in the comments below and if it does let me know if your Dunkin Donuts does differently than mine so yeah let me know in the comments give this video a like if you enjoyed it share so someone else can see it subscribe to the channel if you haven't already see you guys in the next review peace", "ecqSl6lf5XM": "aight well folks I'm going to make a video of something that i bought at walmart and we're going to see what we think of it here we go turn the light on this is my fridge and just to show you my fridge I have a thermometer out and it is 41 degrees could be a little bit cool in here now these I bought two days ago who may have been in the fridge for two days the other day I brought one out last night and but seemed really ironic was if you look at them yeah look at that you see that yeah this is supposed to be an apple fritter look at that into this this is coming out of the fridge so my question is what is on these you put it in the fridge and it doesn't even get cold I have bought many apple fritters one of my favorites and i buy them and normally i put them in the fridge and the stuff on the outside gets rock hard but this particular stuff as you will notice i have just taken it out of the fridge and what is it what is it it doesn't even get cold look at this this let's just see we're going to hold it here and we're going to see look at this look at this there it is it's already tripping this is from walmart in North Vancouver British Columbia you see this look at this this is the icing on the outside which should be a sugar base which is literally dripping so it would tend to lead me to believe that there is something in there other than an icing sugar which is what is supposed to be used now i'm going to show you so you can see that i'm not crazy i'm going to take every one of these and i'm going to get the ball so one two three four five it shows you that i've actually have money or attempted to have one now look at this this is what is inside of them this here yes look at this raw oil dripping out of the icing sugar so they don't even have icing sugar in these things they are the most disgusting things I've ever seen i'm going to show you the lid apple fritters October seventh is when they're supposed to be no good today is October third in the evening so you tell me what that is so we'll just see here look at this this Walmart's apple fritters what is that what is that that's coming off of them the ingredients in reached enriched wheat flour palm oil why would you need palm oil in an apple fritter see look at that see it's almost completely melted and the apple fritter this is like a quarter of the size of a real apple fritter it doesn't matter what I'm talking about honey you never mind go away see this look at this here we are Walmart's apple fritters so I don't know what to say about these all I know is that there's something quite toxic and quite disgusting about these", "iRp2OLx41Hs": "[Music] good morning good morning guys it's me barb or whatever time it is that you're watching this it could be good afternoon it could be good evening it could be good night or it could be am early early morning so anyway you get the gist of it but i figured i come to you today um hopefully you could hear me because it's very loud with the wind chimes and the wind blowing but it's so beautiful out i need to take in this beautiful scenery but um i figured i would do like eating video for you so i got duncan i got my charlie i got duncan and it's an apple fritter and then i have an apple we'll see how well i do with it i haven't eaten an apple in a while so maybe i should have gotten a banana or something more easier sometimes i'll pull it apart or sometimes i'll just eat it i guess it depends on where i'm at like if i'm out in public or sitting at a restaurant and i'm eating something like this i'm not i'll probably pull it apart yeah it just depends it's my preference on how i'm feeling that day so i don't know if anyone else goes through that too i wanted to do makeup for you guys but i have so much to do i gotta clean my house and we need a new lawnmower look at this caterpillar isn't it pretty it's such a sign in new life so yeah these are really good look they got like the apple in it i don't know if they're so good for for your health eating wise but and anybody that watches a bar video knows i play with my hair yeah so i got some stuff to do i'm gonna clean the couches inside and out and my mom wants to come on here and talk about you know how dentures are you know are at an older age she has a lot of topics she wants to talk about it just seems like sometimes it's hard to get into the mood of doing a video when you're grieving and you're you're doing other things and or sometimes you're just doing nothing at all but you're like relaxing a little too much because it's it's a stage of grief i believe everybody that knows me who has watched my channel for some time knows that my baby brother died on may 5th and it's been really really tough on me it really has but we're going to enjoy this in memory of him because he likes stuff like this he he had a sweet tooth i probably should have got a napkin my brother um like like sweet stuff candy just everything i liked he liked pretty much but when he was little he he didn't want his food touching anything so i had to be on a different plate now he got dentures before me he might have been in his um mid-20s i think my dad was supposed to get them but he passed away he never ended up getting them never followed through with it or did he i have to ask my mom i can't remember but it definitely is a genetic disease for sure um i see the one lady one of my subscribers i'm sorry that i can't even remember her name i apologize but for the next video i will she said she started wearing them at a young age and had her one set of dentures for 17 years now that is amazing i guess if you keep them clean and everything then everything will work out and be on point um i want to do like an updated cleaning denture thing because i got a new thing to clean them with to soak them in and i want to do a video on that i just want to say thank you so much for all the ones that are out there that are subscribed to me and have stayed subscribed or even new subscribers i know my channel is up and down that's my life i guess um but you'll at least hear from me once a week at least that from now on i'm gonna at least um dedicate that i'll give at least one video it might not be the best one but it's something and um yeah so i really am enjoying this it's got like little icing dry icing on it or whatever you would call it i'm so upset my husband had gotten me a pandora bracelet and this is not the first time this has happened he got me one for christmas a few years ago and the one charm was 90 bucks that was lost that got lost it came right off the thing now my other one he just got me when we were out in vegas for our wedding anniversary it was like the rope kind of bracelet and you turned put it on yourself two times that came undone and i lost two charms off of that i don't think they might have went down the toilet when i went to the bathroom and he's like you shouldn't have slept with it but even what so what if i was wearing it so then i'm on my way back to the house this morning and the other one came unclamped the one that has a lot of charms on i'm like i ain't buying pandora anymore that shit's wet it's it's too much money to be flushing down the toilet i know he spent a pretty pretty penny on that mm-hmm some of them charms are 100 or more a piece sorry pandora i'll go back to tiffany tiffany's always have my heart they're expensive too but he got me this too for our anniversary let me right now some i've got an appointment but this is really good really really good see how it gets on your teeth um let me take a picture too oh this is a boujee boogie picture looking all run down um i already washed the apple so let's try to bite into this now that's sour now remember i ain't wearing glue so don't knock me down for this one i mean i don't like the skin on it a little hard for me it's very hard without glue i just squirted it on the camera it's it's you know i'm just gonna get the right side i just don't like the skin i don't know i'm throwing it in my garden that's bad somebody else some animal eat it i think i'll try to use the canine that i have and see how that goes it's pretty good for not eating for not having any glue on now i do have a um yeti microphone so with that being said i was thinking about some eating videos does anybody interested in that or feeling that i know my videos when i have makeup on and i'm dialed up gets more views but hey this is me if you don't like it lump it again i'm 39 years old i was born and raised in south philly um got dentures when i was 32 i believe yeah yeah 32. uh oh oh no oh no i hope my husband fed them my my plants are dying i have some beautiful roses though getting windy out um what does everyone else eat does anyone else eat like fruits and vegetables can anyone bite into a snickers i think i'm gonna do a video where i can bite into um snickers and certain chocolates and caramels maybe i should glue it in or maybe i could do it and start doing it and then clean them off and then glue them down so you can see it with it with it or without it or i'll do one video with glue one with video without it how's that sound guys because that's how i'm good so basically i'm going between i think this is a stain in between apple fritter and apple i'm sorry i cut my off and i go from one in one direction what i was going to say was we went to linville orchards and we picked our own apples and i believe this one's called a stamen apple and i think they're preferably used for bacon it's kind of like sourish and something that reminds me that would be in i don't know maybe something like an apple fritter um i'm just watching this little guy go around look at this going around and round and round any time i see stuff like that it reminds me of my brother but what's your favorite choices of foods or candies or do you drink coffee or some of your smokers or non-smokers um is it hard for some of you guys to eat in public so i'm going to ask you guys a few questions so maybe you guys can give me some feedback do you take your teeth out and put them in a napkin when you're eating at a restaurant or at home um if you do i suggest you stop that right now because i used to work at a um diner and they used to we used to have to find try to find people's teeth in the trash can in a napkin and i think we were lucky two times but a couple other times not so lucky they already went or i don't know what happened to them yeah so it's sad um for something that costs so much money you have to be careful you know some um i do this with the fingers my husband hates that should have been napkin but you guys mean the world to me ma'am really do like i have a great husband great family but sometimes like people reaching out from all over the world you know you're we're all in this together like going through this stuff with our teeth and like no matter what language you speak no matter what race you are no matter gender color whatever we're all connected and by one thing our teeth i was watching a video saying one thing that will make a grown man cry is tooth pain tooth pain and i do not miss that at all but i could tell you sometimes you get i get depressed when i first got my dentures i was so depressed a little bit because when i would look in the mirror i would see no no teeth but then i would i can't even say i was depressed i was sad i wasn't used to seeing myself like that and then when i got the teeth put in it was it was like oh my god these aren't for me the couple different things had to be tweaked i mean color they gave me teeth that were like so green and ugly i'm so glad some things got fixed ain't nothing like having some bad bad dentures and you can't your smile is all messed up and you can't smile it changes your whole face your whole structure your face it can make some of us women look so drained and old so when you're this is important to to sell the people that you don't like the way things are that you don't like the way they look don't sign off on them dentures if you don't like them remember you're paying for them or your insurance is paying for them but they're your teeth and if you don't speak up for it you're getting stuck with some some bogus ass dentures and i don't want to see that for anyone um but please if you have any questions my email is lavida

size of your face test holy moly this apple fritter is huge let's see how it does [Music] all right reds donuts in seaside or uh you know you may think of it more widely as uh monterey monterey bay area reds donuts now i uh kind of just checked out a couple of their other ones in a different review but i'm on the hunt for the best apple fritter as well so when i was in there i saw they have an apple fritter this thing is friggin huge caked with uh with frosting i see a little bit of hint something good here what are those those are apples it's an apple fritter you know after all so that is making me feel a little bit positive holy moly uh this thing this is uh this is quite an out preferred to behold how does it taste we'll see right we'll see how it does in that respect now bringing it back i've been on the hunt for the best apple fritter search for best alfred or whatever you want to call it um and i laid out in my mind three main criteria right there's other things i'm looking for but three things you gotta have one don't be too dry two bring the spice cinnamon whatever spice spice it up right but it's not an apple spice fritter or it shouldn't be in my mind if it's the best it's not gonna be an apple spice trader it's gonna be an apple fritter so you gotta bring the spice that's number two but number three you gotta have apples little tiny bits there um i tried a couple already missing whole great uh apple spice fritter not quite an apple fruit in my mind um i try the mccafe one because why not um you know good apple spice fritter not an apple fruit in my mind christie's i tried that one uh was getting closer to being you know an apple fritter um but the hunt continues let's check this bad boy out break it apart so you know you and i don't know four friends could probably share one of these massive massive all right looking at it right now look at that right now all right definitely a lot of dope but it's an apple fritter that's what it is right um i'm not seeing a ton of spice in there not seeing that yet and again everybody makes it different right just because these are the things i'm looking for doesn't mean it's the way it's got to be it's just that that's what i'm looking for to be the pinnacle but it could certainly be in there and i'm seeing a little piece of apple so let's see definitely interesting i will say it's got a ton of glaze on top a ton of glaze on top um so if you like that and who doesn't that delivers now there are little bits of apple little pieces out here not tons right what i really want to see i want to see tons that much that i see happening right here i just want to see that throughout just just jam apples in there right apple's the first word in the name if not fritter featuring apple right it is apple fritter so just jam pack this baby with apples for my taste right if you want to open a donut shop and you want to make donuts just for me apple fritters for me that's what you do but anyway all right so definitely not too dry nice and sweet all that uh not a ton of strong spice um like something make cafe i want some other ones like it's just you can see kind of laced throughout just so much cinnamon so much time not a ton of that in here it does have a nice flavor though so it's not lacking in flavor um but it's not like this if you want like a really spicy you know a spiced one um like an apple spiced one this isn't uh necessarily gonna deliver on that um definitely some apples in there so that's good i just kind of want to see more so i guess i would say spice up ideally i'd like more apples definitely i'd like more but what i will say is um you know i always say with donuts you don't want a dough bomb right it's if you want it's donuts but if it's just like if it's a you know a a lead belly lead balloon um you know you might enjoy it for a second after the second third bite you might not love it so much what i will say with this though and is that no matter what apple fruit is they're they're they're dough bombs that's that that's what they are um and that's fine but what i will say with this is it's a lot of dough but it is like just like you see i'm doing it i'm uh pressing it's it's it's super moist and um and it tastes nice right that's like the difference between you know just kind of run-of-the-mill bread or really good bread you know if you get like amazing sandwich right you actually the bread isn't just holding it together you taste the bread you taste until you taste whatever is you know in the bread that's that's a sign you know it's bringing something to the table and that's what i'll say with this the dough is not just uh you know to hold spice and to hold apples and to hold um you know you know the frosting and all that the glaze and all that the dough is actually like the dough is a bit of a star in this because it actually tastes nice just the dough all by itself has a very nice flavor which i don't find a lot even with apple fritters that i you know that i really like um i like them because the stuff that's in it and the overall consistency but you're not necessarily tasting the dough all by itself and this dough is really flavorful um i'm gonna use today strong spicy flavor like i said not necessarily but it's it's it's fresh right like like like bread like it's the taste i know there isn't a flavor of fresh but you know what i'm talking about right um and it just tastes fresh and that's and that's awesome i mean to have that have that nice fresh doughiness on the inside and then also have the outside that certainly is fried it's it's it's it's uh it's it's got that like crunch to it because it kind of hardened a bit and when the frosting is hard a bit so you get that like kind of crunchiness on the outside you get that soft uh really fresh joyness on the inside you know the frying hasn't taken it over it hasn't ruined it you kind of got uh you got two characters going on in this and um man i'm i'm certainly very happy in in that respect that is a winner now after all that i still have i still have what would pass for a full apple fritter or more at many shops so like i said go with your appetite or go with a couple friends um this thing it you know it's gonna be a it'll be a crowd pleaser uh emphasis on crowd because uh this bad boy is big so all right definitely uh it wasn't too dry spice um not quite as much as i would hope you know if i were to make it but everyone makes it different but that's not to say it's lacking in flavor i think a lot of a lot of ones because the dough

for a whole year and never made it and I thought you know what this I had to drive three hours to the Apple barn we're on the other side of Tennessee to get this nothing I'm gonna save it forever I will use it but I want to see if I can make it from scratch that's right so I looked on the internet and I found a ripoff recipe that is exactly like the Apple barn apple fritter mix so come on in close and let's do it okay I already got my oil heating up and my little deep fryer but this was we got egg orange I don't know I think I only need one of these recipes down below orange some butter a little baking powder apples of your choice vanilla salt sugar flour and cornstarch these two are gonna go together to make cake flour I'll show you in a minute or if you have cake flour just cake flour and milk all right here's the formula to make cake flour okay I have a cup and a half of flour the the rule is this for every cup you have a flour you remove two tablespoons I have a cup and a half so I'm gonna remove three tablespoons it'll be down below and I'm just gonna kind of I'm gonna kind of highball it try to level it out a little bit one two and three and as many as you remove you're gonna replace the cornstarch try to if you want to measure it out exactly one you can like I say I'm eyeballing it to three I bought one of these for the first time ever I never had a flour sifter all right what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to sift this together okay and you're gonna want to make sure all it gets in there make sure it's all out okay you're gonna sift this five times and when you're done get it over and it's gonna be cake flour okay and it should look like this nice and fluffy and airy and just a finer powder than what you started with first if we can do is mix all our wet ingredients so we have our we have our egg we have our milk our vanilla and our butter we're gonna use a method called folding a lot of you already know what that is in each one of the ingredients is we add something here we're gonna fold it in just gently gently grab it from the outside and lifting it folding it in and just mixing in a slow easy pattern okay so the first thing we're gonna fold in is our orange peel and I combined the salt in the baking powder take it in you don't want a high speed blend this and now we're gonna fold in our flour and our sugar now we're gonna fold in our apples okay so the first thing I want to do is you're gonna want to put your basket in now normally I would put it like this and but you don't want to drop your dough in here because it'll stick to the basket so I'm gonna put this in to the oil like that and then I'm gonna drop my dough balls I'm do one right now so I'm gonna do do one and I'm just gonna take it and pop it right in there and I'm gonna test it out that's kind of kind of big and puffy see I may have made them too big so so all weeks test when you're deep frying something new for the first time try a smaller one see how that works oops drop one more here there we go all right I'm gonna take this one out right here that one right there and we'll try it hopes done yeah Oh hot alright so I'm taking this one out and I'm just gonna experiment cuz I've never made these before so we're just gonna keep a close eye on them look at that look how many it made is that amazing I still got some more in the deep fryer but that little batch made a whole bunch these cuz they puff up they're really light and airy okay we got two more things to do so hang with me grab one of these or you could use a flour sifter but I want to mix my flour my with my sugar so dep dep dep dep dep dep dep dep dep - look at that see it's like it's snowing anyway thanksgiving it there we go beautiful beautiful we're missing one more thing I have a jar of Apple barn apple butter where you can use a jelly-like can use a dip it right in there here we go leave that off to the side oh it's beautiful is that amazing that is a

holiday spirit cuz plenty more great recipes are heading your way take care bye bye", "8CHqQ4q105E": "[Music] hi [Laughter] welcome back to i eat pie and today guess what we're actually eating well what today we're eating is we're back at it we're supposed to say pie it's fine we're eating pie yes well we're back at it with the homemade verse bot store so i made this apple pie and with my assistants yes and then apple turnovers but she was calling them apple fritters because she made them at school and so then we're like oh this is perfect we'll do the you know store-bought stuff and then she'll make that and then i'll help her with that and then we'll be good to go but then when she made them we're like wait those aren't fritters uh but either way it's gonna be delicious and it smells if we could let you guys smell the apple cinnamon sugar it smells so good i think we're you're gonna have to make these for christmas too oh yeah all right do you want to give a quick prayer and then we can uh dig in yep heavenly father lord i just thank you for a wonderful new day i thank you that i get to do this video with mommy yeah thank you for all of our followers and fans and that you keep everyone safe and play that you bless us good to our body jesus name amen one man i got a knife here oh whoa elbow to the head perfect i'm gonna bring this here so i can i'm gonna steal the spoon that's for ice cream yeah i know so what should we try first the stores so then we can be like oh wow okay the homemade way better we're gonna try the starbucks yeah but this one you can pick up oh here you take that one now pick up the other one bro what happened the same time not for you again it's missing the cinnamon so it's good the crust is like really thick you definitely taste the crust it stays all together in form the inside is very what's the word appley no i was thinking of um like you know nothing oozes out cornstarchy i don't know microscope okay so we like it we like apple pie it's good [Applause] now for the homemade oh that looks so good ready yep you know what this needs ice cream but what do you think so it's definitely not as sweet no as the other one the crust is not as thick which i honestly don't like as thick of crust i was just gonna say i don't like it that's it and generally i don't like to eat this part of the crust not very good but i will on this one because it's thin good cinnamon it probably would have been more like good sweetness oh yeah if you wouldn't add it she added a little bit of cornstarch not a lot not much yep if i added more i probably want to be so liquidy if you like cinnamon which we do and i feel like because we didn't add too much sugar ice cream would go really nice with that too out of five i give that a ten out of ten yeah i give the bot store um probably it's good but i like this better so there's probably a 9.5 i wish it wasn't as liquidy oh okay okay so none of this like and that one probably a seven because like they're both really good i'm definitely a harsher critic probably because i've lived longer and had a lot more apple pies um but i feel like this one is probably like a i don't know it's like a five six it's kind of like your generic apple pie like it's really thick i don't always want to finish the crust so unless the crust is like one of your favorite parts and you just like or you eat it with ice cream then the crust is like good because sometimes it gets a bit dry um overall five or six around there and then for ours for yours i'd say it's more like an eight it probably could have used excuse me um yeah a little bit thicker sauce but i like how the crust is like thin you can get through the whole crust without it being like too much dough in your mouth or like you know and we'll go really good with ice cream and not be like too overly sweet so now it's just around five or six and this is like eight eight ish more this is the homemade apple turnover that i made oh it's pastry dough so it's like really crumbly [Music] whose idea was that to break it in half can you see that i don't know if you can see that oh yeah i can see the steam cool okay so we're eating this one first it's so crumbly here you got the beer piece okay oh it is nice and flaky it smells delicious the bottom's a tiny bit burnt sorry mhm whoa i feel like hello ice cream hello ice cream my old friend mm-hmm is that french vanilla or just vanilla what's vanilla a lactose free banana that ice cream is smelling can i put this on my mouth i don't know this one's definitely a little bit more flaky flake here well but that's because it's also fresh from the oven so but amazing light delicious i would err on the side of like if it had a little more oh um not apple juice but if it had like that how this one's like more saucy if that had a bit more sauce in it it'd be like a 10 it's so good if you like puff pastry stuff yes which i do i enjoy making doughnuts chairs cheers cheers trying to push it on my hand mm-hmm i mean totally different grant's like okay you gotta show the camera everything because this is a donut so it's very different but delicious yes can we get some ice cream up here i don't it's like super sweet i usually add ice cream if it's not if it's not super sweet ooh it's like a good donut it's a chewy the outside is a little bit crunchy the apple chunks are small but you still get some in there yep do you like donuts better or turnovers um always liked donuts better almost reminds me of uh strudel no so out of all these for what's your fave no that's because it's done and who doesn't love dennis okay that's a fair assessment but if the donut wasn't here probably the pie okay so i mean i love doughnuts too so the donut is awesome i love i love the pie but you know what's funny maybe because this is less sweet so i like and because i'm pregnant i'm gravitating towards things that are less sweet also then i can have the ice cream which makes it like more liquidy and then it's delicious nice little french touch a french touch yes i'm not french oh you're good you're acting french got you gotta keep up with my teens these days except i'm a queen i'm a crazy teenager yeah you're one of the best in my opinion yeah so because i don't got to worry about you and she's not like one of those teams that like argues back with you no i'm very it's wonderful

threader this time I am going to be reviewing the Kroger apple fritter I reviewed the Walmart one a couple of weeks ago and it was really good so I have really high hopes for the Kerber one because I love Kroger so this is what it looks like it's here it is in relation to my hand so it's a little bit smaller than the Walmart one but uh the size isn't everything you know let's see how it tastes hmm well as still fresh it is really hot it's actually burning my fingers hmm so like a good apple fritter mm-hmm has a really nice crust on the outside and the inside is like a cloud it's like a pillow and this one does have decent chunks of Apple in it just in that first bite alone I got several chunks of Apple so it's definitely got a good feeling to bread ratio man this is really good so for the Kroger apple fritter I'm going to give it a four out of five I don't remember that give the Walmart one but this one has I would say it has more filling but it is definitely smaller then the Walmart one and it's a lot smaller than the one from qt the QT kitchen apple fritter is still like the best like fast quick service kind of place apple fritter I think those things are like the size of a dinner plate but this is still a very good apple fritter I definitely recommend if you have a Kroger go out and give it a try and if you have had the apple fritter from Kroger let me know what you thought of it in the comments below give this video a like if you enjoyed it sure so someone else can see it subscribe this channel if you haven't already see you guys the next review peace",

okay so we shall see this is the blueberry muffin oh let me also say the only thing that came warm was my cinnamon roll i don't know if the apple fritter was supposed to be but it just wasn't warm but this is something that came in the box and came warm so there's that okay we tried that and i'm trying to get a piece without so much icing on this cinnamon roll because i'm not being on ice i can kind of already tell my rating by the consistency of that inside can y'all see that and again we're going to cut that in half and we're going to get to getting hold on yeah i got to bring this out there we go a little piece just broke off from the inside cheers so okay so we're gonna go down the line we're gonna write these i'm gonna give them a rating between one to ten and we're gonna start with this apple friend i'm gonna take one more bite of this y'all just because i just need to refresh on what this was until i remember really well this one that kind of got lost in translation okay okay the apple fritter to me is similar to um one from my local bakery like it's actually pretty good for fast food um dessert it's not bad at all if you like the apple fritter you will enjoy this um you get the nice little bites little pieces of apple the icing is just enough it's just layered on there not you know caked up or anything like that it's nicely just glazed on there it's actually pretty good the cinnamon flavor comes through like i would definitely if i was in the mood for it i'd prefer to go and get this again so mcdonald's you you own some mickey d's okay we gotta hit y'all with these little sweets these bakery treats okay i see you making these okay for the blueberry muffin this is delicious i couldn't even i could even let me hold on that blueberry muffin can get it it has a little streusel or crumb topping i don't know if it's just you know icing flakes it's not icing it's like a crumb like a streusel on top it is very very good it's not too sweet at all and you know what honestly for a fast food restaurant even with the price tag it's a nice little decent size for a breakfast muffin again like i said they came out the gate you know swinging with them prices i guess they they already knew they was going to be hitting on something so that's really good the cinnamon roll i can't lie y'all now the iceland has a very nice taste and i'm not a big icing fan but the consistency of the cinnamon roll literally to me is like some of the um grains you know the grand cinnamon rolls that you can just go and get in the freezer section for a lot cheaper and make it at home so i would pass on this so 10 all day seven and a half eight six okay that's my ratings hopefully you guys will go out and try these new items tell me what you think in the comment section down below if you have let me know if you think that the price tag matches the quality and um taste of these items it's been your girl geneva with another review hopefully this one was quick enough

"[Music] let's come on along guys mark from the simple vapor back with another us review for you guys today and uh yeah you have to excuse the background noise I don't know if you guys can hear that or not but the damn furnace just kicked the one again this weather is freaking crazy yesterday we were like in the 70s and today we're back into the 50s again such a spring up here in Pennsylvania but anyway guys I got apple fritter for you guys from the Zen vapor okay this I just cracked this bottle open this morning I've been vaping it dripping it on my bonds RDA on my Visnjic gen3 I got it sitting at 80 watts right now with a point to 1 ohm build in there yeah let's get right into this okay actually I'm going to read it right off the bottle for you guys alright now I'm gonna read it on the website I do have the website pull it up but I'm gonna read it right from the bottle he has all the things you need to know right on the bottle on the label on his bottles great job Matt alright so this is a 75 VG 25 PG blend guys again think it's a little 30ml bottle here of course mine comes in three milligrams and nicotine but you can also get 0 1.5 let's see what it isn't 3 6 or 3 6 9 and 12 milligrams of nicotine if that's what you prefer ok this was mixed on March 1st of 2018 it says a sweet juicy gooey cinnamon apples and deep fried donut dough topped with a light sugary glaze this delicious fate is a perfect complement to your morning coffee oh yeah see there you go you can read the description rate on the bottle love love love that which more places would do that anyway guys let's get right into this review here I'm gonna have a baby give you my thoughts on this alright Oh [Music] all right this definitely brings me back to my childhood hey I say that a lot some of these e-juices but this definitely brings me back to my childhood of something my mom used to make all the time when I was a kid Wow and I'm not even an Apple fan I'm really not this tastes like apple dumplings to me my mom used to make apple dumplings all the time and I get that cinnamon gooey sugar taste in there with the apples very very good and it's not an overpowering cinnamon at all you get the cinnamon but it mixes well with that sugar taste and you get like a gooey doughnut type taste in there but the apples the apple taste is there as well I get the Apple on the inhale but more so on the exhale mixed in with that cinnamon and sugar oh it's good that is really good guys it does definitely taste like what it says it tastes like apple fritter by the Zen vapor very good guys if you're not even even if you're not an Apple fan and you like cinnamon I would suggest picking this up it does have a very good cinnamon and sugar note and you get that Apple tasting like with the doughnut almost in there it's actually exactly what he says in the profile is exactly what I get on this I did find that the sweet spot for me was 80 Watts on this I was vaping it at 60 and it just didn't bring out the the sugary note that I was looking for so I actually bumped it up a little bit here and there and I even went up to 95 92 watts I think at one point and I didn't care for that so I bumped it back down to 80 and right now this is like the perfect temperature vape right now for me it brings out all the notes it's actually very very good and I'm not even into apples but I love this taste sweet sugary gooey apples I get it I get it totally guys it sounds like something you may like I'll leave links down below for you guys check it out at design vapor calm apple fritter awesome awesome awesome ejuice guys he has all kinds of bottles all kinds of nicotine strengths for you guys go check it out you won't be disappointed alright thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in a next review [Music] you [Music]", "3SeQ5118DOo": "hey you guys welcome back to the villa mars channel i know it's been a while but shh don't worry it's all good i'm back today i'm back with something pretty exciting because of course you know i work at mcdonald's so you know when they get something new i gotta talk about it so not necessarily new here because um you know we have snowbirds here in florida and every year they come down and they're like can i get a blueberry muffin and we're like we just have english muffins we don't have like cranberry walnut muffins which sounds great but we just didn't have this stuff here in the us so now we do mcdonald's stepped up their game so now we got blueberry muffins look at that i mean and it's moist too can you can you look at that yeah there we go there's some good lighting look at that that looks ooey gooey i don't want to touch the top because it looks ooey gooey all right next up we have the apple the cinnamon apple fritter or maybe just called the apple fritter it looks ugly right but i mean most apple fritters look ugly but it tastes really good i ate one of these the other day but i didn't try the others so we're gonna try them all today last but not least you know we've done away our cinnamon has been discontinued so i know it's so sad but we did get these new cinnamon rolls and they look pretty big um and they're warmed up now the muffin and the fritter are not warmed but the cinnamon roll does come warmed up so this is nice and warm um no all right so we're gonna be like savage on this all right so first i'm going to try the fritter for you guys because i've already tried this and tell you right now it's the bomb and it might be really good warmed up too hmm not the donut if you haven't tasted apple fritter before it's got a doughnut like it's got some icing on there now they come how they are so you can't get like i had somebody today ask for um light glaze they didn't want a lot of glaze on there but they kind of come how they are we don't really have control over that but that is really good i thought there were nuts in there but there's no nuts i thought i tasted nuts i'm a little worried y'all know i'm not the biggest fan of blueberries but this thing looks so moist i'm not gonna lie this thing looks really good i'm pretty sure it's not a blueberry biscuit but we gonna find out [Music] so the sugar on top and it's really moist the blueberries are soft and they're juicy very juicy blueberries like i said i don't like blueberries but it's not horrible i mean i don't hate blueberries i'm working on it there we go all right so next we have our cinnamon roll and i don't know if you remember go in the comment section and let me know just say i do i do but years ago i was a teenager working at mcdonald's and um in north carolina um and we were doing away with the cinnamon rolls because we were about to get cinnamon and i remember being so mad because i'm like i want no cinnamon i like my cinnamon rolls you know i was used to that but we did used to have cinnamon rolls but they didn't look like this these are different they're packaged different because the old ones used to come like in a in like a pan like a square package packaging and um and you know you would just kind of cut them they'd be in a row but these are a little different than that i believe so let's try it out let's see if it's better than the cinnamon cinnamon there's a good amount of icing on here too it smells good you know what it smells like you can smell the vanilla like it's like the strong vanilla smell it's not a regular cinnamon roll like i thought taste cinnamon or the vanilla it's good because i wasn't expecting that now i don't know if it's the icing let's see i think it's icing something has vanilla to it like a strong vanilla and it's nice because it changes the what you would think like if you went and got like a pillsbury cinnamon roll you know what that tastes like right all right but this is like more like more that's the best i can describe it all right so if you've gone and tried one of these three desserts of course we still have our apple pies and we have our cookies still but if you have not or if you have tried these desserts go in the comments section let me know which one you liked which one you tried and which and did you like it so there's the three the cinnamon roll all right and then the blueberry muffin all right and then they're not so beautiful but wonderful tasting and i want to mention too the apple fritter you know how sometimes when like you eat a donut and it leaves like this uh coating on your mouth this does not do that because i was a little worried because i don't like that i hate that um i don't even like getting those little donut things so they leave that filling in your mouth but this does not leave any kind of coating uh feeling in your mouth so you know what i'm trying to say i can't think of the word but anyways let me know which one you liked and oh wait before you go hold up make sure you click subscribe and like thanks for watching you guys toodles", "jXP38DxGajs": "hi guys welcome back to my

but yeah this apple fritter you see the little cream on the outside looks like a mountain of I have no idea use your imagination but I'm gonna go ahead and stick your fork right in here no pun intended a CEO alright so far I just got the edge you know I mean got the edge of it not really talk but just like image playing soften and kind of hard okay I think it has a no I meant it didn't take no different you know I didn't take any different just basically I prefer I thought was the apple slices or something in here okay I'm gonna go hang with my hands off move him okay okay maybe not obviously I thought was obviously not as you see nope that's all it is bridge a pretty good I mean seems like apples it's into one maybe we are we're cream on top uh-huh ain't good though very good

bill yes sir imagine a little bit but until next time y'all I'll see y'all later", "D7KSlsE7WAA": "hey guys this is desiree so i decided to stop at mcdonald's today and try the three new pastries that they have this one right here is the new apple fritter right here see if i can grab it without dropping it is the new cinnamon roll with the cream cheese icing and then see if i can move that one out of my way for just a second and then last here is the blueberry muffin with the streusel topping um i will say that i watched another review yesterday and these items were actually a dollar cheaper at their location so i do feel as though these are kind of overpriced so i stopped at oak grove kentucky on my way to work and they were 3.49 each of course i had to get my caramel frappe because i absolutely love um mcdonald's caramel frappes call me crazy but it definitely helps me get through the day um but i do feel as though for a muffin 349 is kind of pricey but i am going to try each item and let you know what i think all right this right here if we get that camera to focus is the apple fritter it's not one to focus let's take a bite it's definitely good mine is a little cold i wish it was warmed up just a little bit it does have apple pieces on the inside sweet pretty good 3.49 no i feel like you can get homemade at one of the local donut shops it's going to be a lot larger [Music] yeah it's gonna be a lot larger and worth your buck but definitely give that a try it is actually pretty good all right let's go for the next one all right so this is the blueberry muffin with the streusel topping very good the crunchy topping is good blueberries are good soft moist definitely a good muffin check that out all right so i'm not gonna lie i'm going straight for the center if i can cut it with one hand all right let's check that out cinnamon roll now that one is warm thank goodness the other ones weren't as warm it was warm it's good really good icing um that cream cheese is really really good it's soft um i would say down at the bottom is a little dry but this is actually pretty good cinnamon roll also not bad definitely give um all of those a try i don't know if i have a favorite they're all really really good i think the blueberry muffins stood out to me maybe a little bit more um only only because this one is just a little bit drier maybe a little bit more stiff at the bottom um but otherwise really really good so again you guys give those a try hopefully your mcdonald's location they are cheaper like i said um the video that i seen they were pricing anywhere between like 219 and 299 for those items again mine are all 349. so a little overpriced but they are definitely good especially if you're not wanting you know the typical items from mcdonald's so definitely give it a try and thanks for watching", "QE6FQJo-Rmg": "check these buds up cut that carp so no mmm except delicious that Apple frit I need to cut it this some beans of this man I love up a frits mouse so damn good don't look at God's is so damn good", "585I1DH7Y-Q": "[Music] alright alright alright what's up welcome everybody to developed tonight we're gonna be talking about our recipe apple fritter hope you guys mixed it up or we also have a couple guests tonight we have ML Nikon and we also have Jerry and you yo how's it going Jerry helped us out with this recipe and really interested in here well folk art and Jerry how they came up with it spice so what do you guys all been up to well I've just I've been pretty busy today had to do a bunch of running around my brother's girlfriends in a hospital and so I'm kind of working on three cylinders not not doing too well but I'm here I'm ready to talk about a perforator okay yeah yeah yeah she's she's okay she's just it she had a scare so everything's good everything's good oh I hope that stays that way yeah yeah sorry to hear that man yeah laugh happens that's true yeah anybody get anything new in anybody play around with anything try new recipes or anything not yet unfortunately Stedman and Athens Georgia all week are you doing they're looking at colleges oh yeah the University of Georgia I gotta say that this is actually really [ __ ] nice I've heard it's cool I heard it's like super cooler it it is it's uh I didn't want to like it because I know offense everyone I don't want to move to the south I want hockey yeah but like no it's actually real nice really nice lovely city a lot of great food places really competitive and good pricing it's a lot like some of the favorite my favorite places I've ever lived just slightly bigger so Devan it's supposed to be real cool man it's cool yeah Soviet spam is really cool but Athens definitely surprised me it's just a college town of a hundred and thirty thousand in the middle of a forest with Hills in it's just gorgeous and then you had lake about sixty bars and food places including one guy who won Top Chef a couple of times and now has like two Michelin star restaurants there you're gonna make oh I know but I'm gonna love it cuz like food wise it was like it was I mean you can go to a Michelin star restaurant is because there's so many restaurants that the food pricing was competitive enough that it was like 25 dollars meal for the [ __ ] Michelin star restaurant that's crazy and they do you're tired daddy but it's a great great deal yeah sounds like it's right what you want to be doing right now should cheap food that's really good hard to beat that when I was in Atlanta probably two years ago some of the best food and I was shocked when the bill came is so cheap and so amazing as good as everyone said yeah I was gonna move there I was all I was yeah I was gonna move there two years ago when I was still working as a chef and my previous chef he had moved down there he offered me a job but the money that you know it didn't really it was a little bit expensive to budget no no yeah the income too how much where we look to rent and everything it was just would have been really tough looking yeah yeah what would you say there on the way back let's positive stuff I mean there we were gonna move there because she she was uh trying to transition everything she she works at uh oh really [Laughter] she worked for she worked for a makeup company and she was trying to instead of being for like a counter executive she was trying to do work more for the company so she was trying to get a bigger position down there just a lot to gamble on it's a big life yeah I mean it's a like big like move for like decision a lot of thought to go into it it's an incredible incredible place though I mean if anybody ever is looking go somewhere on vacation I recommend it it's great go there for the food alone I always super impressed with the food yeah so you mixed anything up Emily and I've just been doing a shitload of single flavor tests of coffees for noted yeah isn't that always fun I'm sorry you have to do that again oh I have to pick I have to pick Emily's brain then cuz I'm working on a coffee yeah yeah can you can you divulge any any really good coffee flavors absolutely --n yeah I guess it depends on what you want if you want to so straight black like coffee coffee I would go with like Jerry said it when a players Brazilian but if you're anything like me and you want something a little more [ __ ] if I'd then I really like pure Ilham caramel coffee and sweet milk baked train cafe latte is it really is a really good one and Shh water flavors smooth care cappuccino and cream is good like it's just all those you've just got more mild and you know you you don't really want to go like too strong on coffee because they all kind of have that really bad bitter like for popcorn type note right yep well no hangsen hazelnut - yeah hangsen hey it's good because it's like straws were not as sweet right but it's so pretty creamy yes I just got in this this health cabin caramel macchiato I don't know is that how you pronounce it yeah macchiato don't don't correct and that's just the way it is I make up words I make up words right go ahead and it's it's got that cut that caramel coffee nut that's kind of what I'm working with now is I really like it it's pretty nice I got a ton of health cabin stuff in a couple weeks again I'm just kind of now going to it so have you been I've only tried about five or six of them so far they're just they're different now I've been told that health cabin just rebuttal stuff and puts their name on I don't know I don't know if they do or not because the ones that I've tried seem to be a lot different than TPA or Capello or or even hankie they've got some real winners but they're they're different well you got to start out at the lowest possible as low as you could possibly go because those like literally like point two six it's too much like you know I mean like the [ __ ] with those because they're it's like some of them you can't even go low enough like the corn the sweet corn I mean that's like what is going on there yeah well that's that's kind of like the the oatmeal cookie - I think I think yo y'all just had a show about Mills and granolas and stuff didn't you and I think I think Dave said he thought it was crap I actually kind of liked the half cabin oatmeal cookie but you got to use it really really low I don't you know like you say I don't think you can actually use it low enough because it's so strong so potent I got it in I haven't played around with it yet but it's very dark not to slap in the face flavors yeah yeah I think that might help maybe because they're what they're trying to go for it most the time seems really usable really good but doesn't work like that yeah don't don't get the south I think it's called sour cherry it is total crap total trash flavor I love it yeah did somebody say that they liked it no I said why would you think anything different always to be good and they always turn out you live in a role disappointment in general in the wild don't taste like cherry flavoring and then cherry flavoring doesn't taste that good so yeah but you know I think they ruined it for us it back in like that whenever they develop lobster because it's grape and cherry right or the two that we always say taste like and then what they say you know I mean like I'm saying like it's kind of hard to get away from that at that point medicine tastes like it ores are the flavors or tastes like that you know yeah you equate it to the medicine but I don't know doesn't matter they both they suck anyway yeah they're terrible they're awful if if somebody could come up with a true tart tartness to a flavoring well that's really all you need for a cherry because when you eat a cherry off of a tree you all I get is just a tartness like there's little may cherries um yeah it's just tart that's all it is it's Nevel heart bomb yeah exactly so I think that's the reason why they have such a hard time trying to you know Luden's cough drops Luden's cough drops nailed cherry what how come no one can get that yeah what's the deal with that's like what cherry that's like the Holy Grail right like what everyone's striving for no one can do it yeah diluting okay there's my breaking news so I've been one I've been working on a couple more recipes to I'm still working on my peanut butter getting pretty close to a peanut butter base I've like say I've been working with some coffees and a vanilla aurilla been working on that turn out turned out pretty good I believe in you anybody can do it yeah it's it's pretty close I still need to get a little bit more of a creaminess note to it but it's pretty damn close let's see when it's ready I will release it yeah so max you've been even mixing up anything interesting or uninteresting you know what I actually mixed up a recipe on ATF called lemon curd mm-hm and I can't remember who made it don't they look for it real quick and I mean I mixed it basically because I had yogurt at drink in ahead fave drains lemon meringue tart in it and it's yeah you can't really go wrong with that well I've been really liking a lot of lemon bakery so I'm really looking forward to what Emily's got for tomorrow but it it's made by mixing hope and heard of them but it uses a lemon meringue tart vanilla pudding vanilla swirl and yogurt drink and cannot be good it's is really good I don't know if it's a lemon curd but it's definitely just a really good lemon creamy it's not really um like when you make like lemon curd and everything it's not really it kind of gets a little bit of that flakiness that I get from the lemon tart mm-hmm but it's damn good mr. burgundy Alfred did make a lemon curd he made a lemon curd cheese cake which is also really good yeah yeah check out both those recipes are both really good coffee oh yeah okay coffee's not too yeah what happened are you redoing some of the same ones well we're gonna like talk about the highlights of the older flavors but there's a lot of newer and of course obscure coffee flavors out there that we're gonna be talking about not just popcorn popcorn I'm convinced now I could be wrong on this so this could be a stopgap effect of mine that I'd love to put out facts that aren't you at all you do I'm convinced that Sugar Smacks cereal is supposed to be coffee it looks like beans and it tastes like all that right do you think that's what they're doing there no yeah I think you're you're mixing things up a little bit what do you mean I know this because it looks like a bean it also looks like a note that's been puffed yeah they're just puffed oh hello maybe they use that to their advantage hmm hey we can try it what do you think cannoli shell probably [Laughter] yeah you know Emily actually brought something up earlier today and it kind of blew my mind that a wonderful wonderful avers roasted pecan and cream she said it's um like a coffee yes it most definitely is it yeah it totally like I did a knuckle test to I mean it's unbelievable that it's coffee it's kind of like a Starbucks made like you know the the grab-and-go kind of ones that's what it reminds me of sure yeah yeah so are we gonna talk about apple fritters what tell ya I mean might as well so did did everybody mix it up I don't I don't think Emily had a chance to mix it up though but the other guys to JA I'll mix it up yeah I did I didn't have the flora Apple they were out when I got the line they were out of it so it's I use red apple mm-hmm okay which is basically the same right just a little bit red apples a little water here uh this little bit different because the Apple apples more like a cooked Apple and then the red apples just flesh but we're what we were using it for it probably shouldn't matter that much okay you've used to make it more accurate do you think because I literally have like 73 apples I think I mean red apple possibly cooked at will possibly cat Fuji was what I was saying literally just anything that adds body to an apple the Reta Rhett that like red Apple probably would work that's why we were thinking about it somebody had mentioned using / Ilham country apple maybe cut your Apple yeah I was I was watching the show I was screaming at my screen no idea the fact that you're that excited about this that you're showing it at the screen it's great even in the comments people were yelling country Apple and after the fact we were like why didn't use country Apple yeah I didn't have this I know it probably well here's my [ __ ] up I didn't I didn't have for Apple either cuz pretty hard to find nowadays would you use I use cab Fuji yeah so so I heard the same thing that it was kind of hard to find have they discontinued or something they might have no the lava cake you I heard you can't get the lava cake anymore it was no I was just sold out on one of them I think I did mention it to you to show to you though then I'm not sure if it made it into the cut but it was just like we did have that discussion of like oh we're going through lavoro apples and realizing there's 13 of them or whatever okay so are we gonna use Apple or a red apple granny apples we shouldn't make it all Apple and then well no then we oh we always forget that there is no there's just Apple yeah like just Apple the company that makes every Apple also just makes Apple I think I've tried all the apples except for just Apple Jill yeah I feel like an idiot like trying to get it cuz there's like so many like like why would I you know I mean but if it's that much different well I had odd flavor tasted spinach a couple years ago and in my notes I wrote this tastes like a I cooked like a cooked Apple with no cinnamon it's just a raw cooked Apple and that's I think that's kind of why we went with it because we were just wanting to add that that put Apple like textured kind of to it yeah really good it's entirely there for a cooked body more so than like extra taste yeah yeah we I was gonna say yeah cappella double apple might be a good that one that was a talk to you yeah so if someone doesn't have for Apple just play around with it because you're just using it one to two percent literally just to add some body to it you can use like whatever your favorite apple is the only one I would probably stay away from this flavor our Fuji yeah like anything that's a jolly rancher ya know one of the crest guys with what's the crest like for that I gotta tell you something real quick on paper it looks like it's gonna be just complete bread you know it like in it it doesn't turn out that way but it's like looking at cuz I wasn't in on the you know development it looked it looked real bread heavy but it's not but [Music] ya know I think the idea was we wanted something kind of lighter and fluffy but I just started throwing out spiced things just like what what can we see playin like we were I was worried that we're gonna muddle everything with all the spices but it where it thank you talking about spice things I was thinking about something that could maybe replace like a couple of those flavors and it's wonderful Avery's deep-fried pastry dough because it's got like a nice kind of spice background that I think would play well with filling yeah I think that would definitely work as well I was I was like surprised that that liquid bar and Belgian waffle was even mentioned but went but when when Jerry I think Jerry was the one that suggests yeah no I thought of that was like wait it's perfect yeah yeah why not because it's it's light dough they got the at its base it's got a cinnamon note got a maple no but you can cover up the maple no and then it's just like dough I thought it was cool like I saw the rest of you first and then watch the episode like so watching it and watching the episode what can you guys come up with all this stuff that was really cool like didn't know if it would work but I definitely wanted to at least try it and ended up working really well it worked ridiculously good but yes yeah the idea to this recipe was was to make some type of like cinnamon Danish kind of thing without using cat cinnamon Danish swirl you know see yes yeah that was that was the idea behind because you know that that taste is just it's just so familiar everybody uses it and what we wanted to create something that didn't use that but still had that same feel to it yeah and I think it worked out pretty pretty good did it did you think that it changed very much with a steep I did I did and I got some pretty interesting things along the way I picked it up and made the every couple days and I think I was what did I have the first off no I got after like probably around three or four days is like weirdly got like a play-doh no but it went away like immediately and I think that that would be from the liquid barn Belgian waffle or some combination with it but I it's not gonna really scare you away it does disappear but I I definitely got some kind of a play-doh no and you know it's just something weird was going on there but I was baking that gingerbread mix that I made and then I dripped the apple fritter on top of it and I got an Apple Jacks and that was a weirdest thing because they both the other one it was just 3% of capella gingerbread 3% of wonder flavors vanilla ice cream and 3% cappellas the one gram cracker and the two of them made like a weird Applejack like I very strange thing that happened there but the more I baked on it it was just full-on apple fritter yeah yeah no it's like flavor-wise I was super happy with the pre shaken babe yeah really in your face when I loved the pastries asked him there really makes that Apple pop a lot more which that was the thing I was worried about the most was he taking apple filling pastry zest Belgian waffle you know just even even the flora Apple like you're taking a bunch of things that have some spice to them and then graham cracker on top like it's all just spiced crap it's all right Rea like I was like super worried that it's just gonna get super muddled and all of them work together beautifully yeah that was super surprising and that's why we're like okay we're on to something now the the firt the first version that we came up with it it had a really good flavor to it I mean you could you could really taste that Apple feeling and everything unit but we wasn't getting much bread note from it and so we decided to add flavor a sweet dough to it and boy did that really clash it done something really funky that was not good yeah yeah I don't know what was going on but it was almost like when we added the when we added that it's like it enhanced the pastry zest or something it just I mean it was just like overpowering it yeah it went from being the apple filling being Messire to pastry zest and play-doh being the star yeah it just it did not work out absolutely not you lot of times what I use when I'm wanting to not use it yes it's a is liquid barn Baker set oh yeah yeah that's that's definitely replacement for that yeah the wonderful it was a cinnamon pastry yeah yeah the cinnamon pastry dough what cinema just cinema pastry pastry yeah that's a good one too yeah yeah that's it yeah that's that that's the one pastry that I kind of go to instead of grabbing caps in mundane swirl that's s the one I grab is the wonderful a verse in my pastry yeah it's good yeah I just don't grab many of them because I don't want to deal with CBS anything like CBS I'm like yeah that's what I wanted to do this was just I wanted and I'll see what most leaders run at Apple Philly like I wanted an apple filling star cinnamon 3 that didn't have some of those yep at CBS like qualities do it yes I did I even didn't make a version with c.d.s just try instead of the biscuit to see how that would work with adding a bit more of the bread death no no the it was it uh more like the sweet dough of just it add some play-doh qualities and just a lot of muting sounds disgusting play-doh and blood yeah you get the blood from CBS like copper like that okay I don't get the copper from man it's just metal like doing that contest even three years ago now I'm still never want to touch that flavor again are you really did scar you you had 70 recipes a CD yes we'll do that yeah I can't believe you did that I really I just can't believe it but again it was all so we just I I mean at least me and Alfred for sure order the other day we're throwing around thanks to you gram we're throwing around dumb apple filling recipes and then that just was like okay let's the apple filling I was convinced you could use it three drops oh yeah no no the one she was a one two three recipe was one two three drops in absurdity yeah it's one percent drop of and to drop smooth the vanilla three drops apple filling people don't try that if you there's like a light flavor there and a lot of VG no but you didn't you guys do one one drop each though of each one like I did I did I did I made a tester of it no it tastes like VG listen I'm telling you it changes everything without you drop [Laughter] scale it down to a 10 mil or five mil yeah it might be 15 yeah I think it's the apple filling that doesn't work because this rich cinnamon in the smooth vanilla work the eye I still don't even think they work I know like I think we over overestimate how powerful and potent those flavors are yeah I guess you're right if you're only doing two two flavors I think you do with like Arabian but not in the 30 mil no yeah I think I bet just some play result oh that would do it mmm you could do one to three drops yeah I'm sure get some of that health cabin garbage that's how I shouldn't say garden throughout corn yeah still 1 2 3 drop adjust the corn yeah it might be possible with the health cabin somebody give that a try not me I'll do it yeah I'm gonna make health camp health cabins gonna be the flavor company of the year 16 years 30 you think it's gonna be this year what it might be it might be 21 19 on it 2119 okay somebody had had mentioned in the comments of this recipe that that they needed to pick up fa bavarian cream because i think we've used it in every single recipe that we've released that would be out for a pudding it's a lot lighter but it's the base taste i want to say is that much different it does do something right it does do some things different it's not nearly as like wet it is like TPAs but with some of the other Bavarian creams like yes that's kind of why we've been using it it's like way different I think it is it's way different yeah and I believe it is yeah it's a it seems a lot darker it is darker but I I used to buy 30 soj of Bavarian cream because you can use that as a mall so fire like surprisingly well compared to play just regular creams dumpin yeah those are about what about three years ago that was like their age yeah was like useful like and everything took everything in a different direction it's good it's usable there's nothing really that replaces it right now right for that what you use it for not that I can think of Severine I was able to I think I used that and like making a sweet tart or like a orange drink or something and it still works cuz it just give me it works as like a weird fruit emulsifier sometimes did you put that in the sweetheart I think so yo everybody needs to stop and go check out that sweet Thai recipe that thing that recipe it's what I can't remember look at you yeah I think you might have but that recipe is ridiculous so that's one of the best recipes I've ever made no [ __ ] what you call it it's a good old three star recipe on all the flavors we dad to because your that's you can't take of that you know that should be a sick that's one of the best recipes ever made I'm just not going to do no but you said I know you're not lying cuz no I know this stuff like every year yes Jerry is your is your name on all the flavors Jerry snaps correct yes it is it means where you confuse everybody of 42 different names know everything your honor is a different name I know it's always been apps I think I've always been Jerry stands for the most part yeah he stays loyal to the platform but didn't like you got another one like you know it's not gonna be snaps yeah I did a is it a two percent and that recipe at work doesn't am also tired for the sweethearts with my channel and if you thought that something like s we don't know delete specifically jf does some weird things with fruits that like it works I've always been surprised by that so that's like the most different bad cream in my opinion I think I've ever tried I just eat a pineapple oh I love it I love it I like to juice the juice you might might work getting that nose out that wasn't out when you made that oh no the only thing about about TPA pineapple is is if you use it you know like above 5% it starts to get kind of dry I think and it's busy it's pretty harsh too doesn't say you get it can be aggressive and then get tangy and dry and just Dave I think it was cuz Santa had a recipe within 4% they used to bring down the Twin Towers he might work at 4% was that I think yeah I used to use it to make a simulate like oh my god effervescence and like a sauna like coke coke makes it definitely worked I mean at the time it worked for you know getting closer and closer to that it's definitely not ever best what it was I'm sold asleep too so yeah um honestly you probably 3/4 apple fritter you could probably use GPA but FAA worked about it I think just cuz it's a little drier whatever is doing in there it's really he pulls it together no I thought yeah because we decided that because I was I thought we needed a cream mm-hmm basically just to try to combine the Apple in the fritter mm-hmm yeah for sure now Emily I have a question for you since we got here um how would you change this recipe or how would you go about making an apple fritter or you probably already have um I would use country apple and apple filling you did good there and I think for the crust I don't know like yours looks so convoluted yeah I'm like a minimal is yeah I would have I would have used like either um either beggars touch or or sin and pastry with the deep-fried pastry dough maybe a little touch of pastry sess cuz I like what that how that makes other ingredients pop right yeah it was really interesting I really wouldn't have been one of the things that I would have thought to put in there but tasting I'm glad it's in there could it's a really interesting accent to everything and I'd like it's versatile like you can use it as a small accent like 0.25% in something or like this you can go up to one 2% and have it more of a presence it's a really nice flavor yeah yeah I was a little bit worried about the zest part of that pastry in there but it does it does it I don't really notice it all that much if I'd if I do it's just it's combining with that Apple that gives it a little bit of a I don't know maybe up almost a appeal I mean an apple peel kind of note in there what do y'all think a little bit I mean it I was pleasantly surprised because it all actually works together you're way better than I expected mm-hmm and the pace I can get a bit of the pastry zest in there but it's it's doing more with a little bit of the light pastry note that it actually does have when you take it up I I think that's coming through more with the Belgian waffle than like the actual zest does but the zest I think it's mixed in with the apple filling and works well yeah it's it's it's almost it's almost like a very slight lack of bitters or something in there that I think it's adds to the overall mix it's not really a lemon note or anything like that yeah yeah it's hard to lemon zest in it but that's just one of like the many components of that flavor yeah right exactly mm-hmm and I mean that's the same thing with the the Belgian waffle like Belgian waffle has maple note to it you don't really get most any maple coming through it because there's so much I mean here you have cap graham cracker you have jf biscuit which has some off nut sometimes you have liquid barn Belgian waffle which has some off notes and apple I could see that pastries s had some weird off notes sometimes it it's just apple filling like they all none of them show up yeah yeah yeah I'm on paper it doesn't look right it all doesn't but it's totally totally crazy the apple filling is is most definitely the star of the recipe oh yeah yeah no like I was that's what I think I was happiest about was it actually all balanced together really well and there isn't weird off-notes coming out that is what I'm worried about with say long steep but I don't steep it because I'm an animal so believe in Steve so weighted so we really mix this up about a about a week and a half ago or I think it's two weeks ago two weeks ago it's not pretty good I think that weird thing that I got where it got to be that combination of dripping it on something different but I think it's because of a cap graham-cracker it really just sticks around and it pushes kind of hard it was kind of during that steeping time it just kind of pushed around the Belgian waffle a little bit but now it's got me thinking about Apple Jacks you could probably change that a bit make an Apple Jacks yeah or like I mean I would start with basically what you did to make Apple Jacks but then you could also do something like what you can tell it so if your line or whatever yeah oh yeah yeah Apple snacks or snacks or other snacks hmm that one you'd want to change you'd have to change a lot of the body and the bread bakery base because that's like much more in the cereal 27 kind of popped corn drying up right versus those like lighter dough that I was going for with like the Belgian waffle and stuff like that Courtney wants to know if we ever got a cherry that we were happy with no she might be talking about that cherry cordial yeah you know Alfred and I worked on that and well came up with a pretty good version that we locked but after like a five or six days steep it just fell apart it just completely fell apart you know what I was thinking about it might work is DIY flavor Shack has a there are a line has a dark cherry it's not bad doesn't really go medicinal am i working that yeah they after I've tried one of their cherries that they have an expert cherry which is isn't horrible but they have our yeah but they have another cherry that is very similar to TP a cherry X extra extra extra extract extra yeah yeah and it's very similar to that but there's there's a woody kind of a woody node in it which you know in a cherry cordials I don't think it would work I think it probably would work in its some type of a tobacco the only thing is you have to use it hot you really have you have to use it like it six to eight percent to go ahead I'm trying to think which one you got because I'm a rayline the flavor array line it's a totally different line than what they usually get or what they're they're regular line yeah it's like gonna white labeled like it's a different label even if I've got a couple of their cherries I think it may just be cherry flavor yeah that's oh you got one of their gigantic bottles that they give you yeah I got I got one of these huge huge bottles here that is the flavor what does it say chariot is a dark cherry this is cherry flavoring so it's a there's a dark cherry it's a little it's different and it's like a it's like it's a dark cherry it's like what like oh you know like one purple looking cherries kinda medicinal but you can use various flavors Armenia cherry good I haven't tested yet I just got it in but I actually zone and tell me about it she said it's it's a pretty decent cherry medicinal we hear that though right like we always hear that about yeah you hear that yeah and then you try it you know your hopes get dressed - again but cherry so goddamn good if she do all right you know yeah has sin hazard oh go ahead I was just gonna ask that has anybody tried flavor west cherry crush I haven't don't ya mister mister mister Berger says his dope is broken [Laughter] [Music] well I've yet to find a good chair that I like there's some that are okay it when used correctly but none of them are fantastic the conical it's I'm stiff I would watch area using definitely say that that cherry that me and Dave came up with that one day where that marzipan jelly bean and extract one recipe that's that's not bad David I was gonna cut the off notes off on shoot so I like I like FA marzipan I like in aware marzipan I like TFA cherry extracts doesn't my it's not that yeah I'm gonna have to pick that one up put those two together max in aware right you know where marzipan extract and then black cherry jelly bean the tart the chart cherry though like let me down I'm not gonna lie has that tart note that you were mentioning earlier like it has a really actual tart note to it but then it still has an underlying cherry that's you're smitten all yeah yeah it's weird you know what if you put it with the tangy each the tangy orange and then some pineapple the cherry the orange in the pineapple it makes well it was like big stick you know the big stick bars the missile pops or whatever they're called okay yeah oh yeah yeah yeah probably right about that it's almost like perfect I even put mango in it mm-hm yeah and I've just never been impressed with the cherry to be honest unfortunately lavoris era capella has a wild cherry that's not so sin has a question she said what happened to that creme brulee donut I think she's talking about and if we ever tried babe train creme brulee we are still working on that one and yeah yeah where we all are pretty set on babe tray and creme brulee being in there yeah but we want that recipe to be perfect so if you might take a little while yeah but we haven't forgotten we're gonna go back to that same train got mm-hmm still think probably pick up one on one burnt sugar whether we use it or not is a really useful flavor so and since specifically should pick up she's gonna get powdered sugar and a raspberry and ice cream yeah all their sugars are good actually brown sugar is good I think what we should do is we should do a pink popcorn yeah I think we should do it for since she wants a pink popcorn you ever seen pink popcorn you know what it is like apparently everyone not everyone knows what it is popcorn covered in candy melt yeah it's like a square like a brick of popcorn like covered in pink like caramel candy is kind of like it's is it raspberry I think so I think the one on one raspberry and ice cream is exactly if you put the raspberry and ice cream and TFA just plain raspberry together hmm and like a little bit of strawberry ripe it totally makes up flavor with the with the powdered sugar well check that out if people wanted to see that yeah that could be interesting yeah so uh kitchen kitchen sink I guess that's the way you pronounce it asked could you add cranberry to cherry for a tart cherry I have actually tried that so far with no success exactly exactly you know it does work is uh hibiscus yeah it does seem to happen it absolutely does yeah compeller hibiscus or what was the one that you suggested Graham wonderful a versa biscuits candy or it works in the tart cherry mm-hmm but you have to have a decent cherry to work with to begin with you know true there are people used to use like FA black current - oh I'm the big fan of that trick yeah it doesn't really make it as tart like I know a lot of people some people are in the camp of using like FA pomegranate which I'm not a fan of and I like black currant but it's not really gonna make it tart I think that pomegranate usually makes it a little bit more juicy and pomegranate or black currant makes a little bit more jammy in my I am home I don't like it I think it I get a lot of medicinal I just don't not fan bit apparently not but you like flavor Kiwi I like it with green tea no I like it with the eise i'ii siit that's the first thing you may be mixing yours and you sold it", "RlsBsguNbAs": "hi guys we haven't used our air fryer in quite a while and we have an overabundance of apples in our house so today we're going to kill two birds with one stone and in our air fryer make apple fritters [Music] to make this recipe we're going to need nonstick spray so two apples sugar ground cinnamon and baby first thing we need is a mixing bowl into the mixing bowl with flour one egg [Music] one and a half teaspoons of baking powder okay there's one and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and then we have to mix it together and then we need to peel core and dice or apples just like that and now we're going to need two tablespoons of sugar there's one and there's two matha teaspoon of cinnamon now I need to mix them together now we need to preheat our air fryer to 350 degrees now add our apples to the battery and gently folded it [Music] while my air fryer basket with parchment paper spread nonstick spray and now we need to scoop our batter into the basket [Music] then we're gonna slide it up into our hair dryer and cook it for five minutes now we need to flip them and then we're gonna cook them again for another five minutes [Music] smell good smell like fritters and then we have this apple fritters they don't look much like apple fritters though they look closer to cookies but we can ice them we have some leftover lemon cream cheese icing you from and Coco's graduation cake another pretty now we need somebody to eat these I volunteered [Music] [Music] so our apple fritters in the airfryer are worth making again I'll take that as a yes apple fritters airfryer yes or no Meah kinda like them but she didn't like the apples very much so maybe we could do strawberry fritters do you like strawberries maybe she would like strawberry fritters or banana fritters or cherry fritters blueberry fritters are yummy kind of fritters do you think Jack's donut fritters yeah let's put donuts inside our donut and then we can have doughnuts so one thing I would say that we could change would be the icing that we used because even though that lemon cream cheese icing was delicious on the cake wasn't so good on an apple fritter I didn't care for the combination the kids don't agree with me they all thought that it works great but I think I would probably prefer just a regular just glaze I think next time we'll have to figure out a glaze recipe and just make a glaze for it because I don't think the icing worked very well but the fritters did turn out very well but for now I better send my smartypants asses to bed so with your friends [Music]", "M6V9Jn-AuhI": "hi there my name is apple fritter elder apple fritter of the Roanoke Region steel Rangers right now my title doesn't really mean that much I haven't talked to command for almost two years now not since the Rangers were run out of Diablo Canyon before its meltdown anyways that's not what I'm here to talk about I figured I'd start back up my logs to help keep track of what's been going on they may not get back to command but they may at least help people make sense of this area I've since come to a new settlement that the ponies have migrated to psoralen I think that's how it's pronounced I want to talk about it because well it'll be making a target of itself soon enough the residents have actually turned on the water and the power again if Raiders hadn't noticed them before they're definitely on their way now a few of the residents and factions from Diablo Canyon have also made their way to the town the talons have showed up in the area a mercenary company made of Griffins the ones that are here though seem to be greedy and arrogant most of them making fun of the populace and thinking but they're lesser creatures two of them beat up an earth pony the other day just for getting angry at their insults I'm not well enough equipped to do anything about that kind of thing and I can only stand there while they they it isn't right I mean I've learned that the wasteland does this the creatures they call it the strong preying on the weak they often say that the wastelands version of diplomacy is a bullet to the head ponies just pushing other people around and causing problems not even thinking in the long term they give a show strength and push everybody around I already see that happening again I saw the Constabulary forces taking over the power plant and some redheaded zombie on the other side of town starting to amass his own force I'm gonna pray that I'd be wrong I'm hoping I'm wrong hello my success record is far from perfect I'm one of the youngest elders to exist the only reason I got the job was because there wasn't anybody

episode today we'll be making a very simple but delicious dish it's from the 1767 cookbook primitive cookery or the kitchen garden displayed it's called hasty fritters thanks for joining us today on 18th century cooking with James Townsend and son [Music] while today's recipe comes from the cookbook primitive cookery this exact recipe is in several other earlier cookbooks so it's collected from these earlier cookbooks fritters are very common in 18th century cookbooks they're basically any kind of a batter type item that's fried in fat you can deep-fry these like we're going to do today or you can pan fry them but typically they were deep-fried and many times they had a kind of a fruit filling to them you'll recognize this as the ancestor to what we might call fry bread elephant ear doughnuts all the same kind of thing this is a very simple recipe we're gonna start off by heating up a couple of pounds of lard in our pot you could also pan fry these in butter but you'd want to make sure to clarify your butter first now let's mix some our ingredients this recipe uses an ale for its base you could use a hard apple cider you're going to use an ale you want one that isn't too bitter so a brown ale makes a very good base we're going to use about a pint here I've got 2 cups of flour and I'm going to very slowly add the flour in to our ale mixture while stirring it up okay I've got this mixed up it's pretty thick a pretty thick batter almost a dough I'm going to add in here are currants you've got about a quarter of a cup and let's get these mixed in [Music] and I've got one Apple that's all diced up we're gonna add that in not too big it says if you put in more than one you want to make sure that they don't touch each other and stick make sure these dollops aren't too big or they'll take too long to cook the recipe actually calls for flipping these over with an egg slice and you might be confused by that an egg slice is a spatula and these are cooking up fast ok these are done let's pull these out and then you finish them off by sprinkling on just a little bit of powdered sugar give it a try [Music] you know these are extremely simple they only just have the flour and the ale and the fruit and a little bit of sugar up on top but they are a very very nice you could add a little bit more in here if they had maybe some some cinnamon or some other spices but for such a simple thing they're wonderful these make a great thing to make over a campfire they're very simple they're also great for a bonfire I if you want to have something a little special make this and a nice fall bonfire they are wonderful if you haven't already make sure to subscribe to our channel you can visit our website and make sure to request a print catalog I want to thank you for joining us today as we savor the flavors in the aromas of the 18th century music [Music]", "QO3ZGQGd8fM": "hey guys thanks for tuning in to poppy eats today i'm filming this earlier this may be the final day of collab week 2020. it's been fun it's been fun getting new fans meeting everyone working with some of my favorite channels here and today i'm working with my absolute favorite new channel uh this is alexa and avery they're two sisters down in texas and they go and they try food they talk in their car it's hilarious um talk more about them in a bit here but i wanted to pick something that i thought that they would both enjoy or especially like the younger sister avery because kids are picky so mcdonald's has new breakfast items and i'm going to get all three of them here i'm on my way there there's a literal hurricane going by sort of is tropical storm whatever i don't know and that's the weather's not terribly bad here there's a cone in the road and that guy doesn't know how to deal with it so the weather's not great and i was at the dermatologist and the power was flickering so it's it's a mood to put it as the kids might um let's see let's get our order here i think i actually have to check in oh it's spring all right now i still haven't showed up yeah for it's gc36 oh there it is perfect okay all right thank you did i get rain on the camera i might have yeah i definitely did all right we'll clean that up in a second here oh and i missed the one window whoops whatever good morning morning [Music] thank you all right they figured it out i got my stuff here we're gonna eat that i'm just pulling up the steps i can tell you a little bit more about it um i hate the mcdonald's app it's confusing to get to things like kind of like there's mick cafe and mccafe bakery can't just all be in the same section anyways i'm doing the blueberry muffin the apple fritter and the cinnamon roll and you don't actually want to get all three of these and i'm not going to eat all of them because the blueberry muffins 400 calories the apple fritters 510 and the cinnamon roll is 550. that's insane i think that rivals like uh what you might call it uh a big mac or something yeah it's up there it's up there with some of the stuff so that is what it is but we're to try them out here today and i also got a large fruit topia remember that remember for topia it was a line of fruit drinks that coca-cola brought out back in she's i don't know the 90s or early 2000s or something at least here in the us and they basically all went away it failed except it still was out in canada and they still sell this one flavor here the strawberry passion fruit awareness which is the one you always got so i'm excited um i've seen mcdonald's has had that but then i haven't seen it but now i saw it again so that's the good stuff anyways let's get on to these let's see what this is ah bm and not the bad kind blueberry muffin let's uh let's give that a shout out if you're new to the channel welcome um i knew this is kind of like a vlog style sort of thing lately that's what i wanted to do when i started my channel and that's what i've been doing this week for collab week that's what alexa and avery do they uh they film themselves driving there getting the food ordering eating it joking about it um and it's fun to watch because they're not they're like young and not jaded by how terrible life is yet so it's uh it always puts a smile on my face anyways here's the blueberry muffin it uh looks kind of decadent here it's i don't even know how to explain let's take a bite i just cleaned my car yesterday that's uh yeah it's pretty good very moist um very crumbly uh it's like a sugar these are like it's like sugar crystals on top there's something crunchy to it it's sweet so it's like sugar um it tastes like any blueberry muffin i'd get out somewhere right we're gonna put her away before she gets all over pretty good pretty good um it was like two bucks so if you're in the mood for blueberry muffin mcdonald's yeah that's good that'd be good with a coffee or something right most people aren't getting passion fruit awareness for breakfast um next up ap apple apple fretter who doesn't love a good apple fritter monsters that's who you hear that it's windy man was it zeta or something caviar zeta jones i i don't know whatever tropical storms going by here on thursday it's uh i'm not that close i'm not like in danger i don't think if the car blows over and i die you'll see it on camera it'll never make it up oh wow let's hope that doesn't happen right here's the apple fretter looks like an amplifier i've ever had looks good i gotta get a selfie with one of these right i don't know alex and avery when they do it they take the selfie image and then they uh they actually show what they're gonna use for the thumbnail there uh it's fun it's fun really good um i haven't gotten like an apple chunk yet usually they've got apple chunks [Music] i still want to say i haven't gotten an apple junk yet it's good though other than that so far rivals any apple fritter i've had anywhere there's apple chunks yeah very good nobody else like none of these other fast food trains have anything this good for breakfast right like for sweets there's traditional anyways it's always some sort of weird like pastry loaded with sugar and stuff frosting whatnot speaking of that that is our last item cinnamon roll um yeah speaking of that selfie thumbnail image yeah it's fun there their brother edits all their videos and that adds to the charm of their stuff because he knows his sister so well he sees the dumb stuff they do and he zooms in on it and he he cracks jokes and he knows he knows what he's doing um he's great at editing the videos i need to take a class or something i'm awful most i can do is clip in other videos i can put things on the screen but i don't know how to do effects and everything um oh this is gonna be messy this looks good though this is the cinnamon roll look at that look at that it's covered in frosting smells good so it's good but hold on let me take a couple more bites here because i'm missing something i really had to get into it to get a nice cinnamon flavor um [Applause] i'm gonna box this guy back up yeah so it's good but the cinnamon is weak i would have expected a lot more cinnamon flavor if you go get like a cinnabon or pretty much any other cinnamon roll anywhere ever there's more cinnamon than this head um that's a little disappointing it's really tasty but it's not what i'm looking for from a cinnamon roll so i probably wouldn't get that again make sure i don't get sweet breakfasts anywhere ever anyway so i'd probably never get it again anyways um that apple fritter is good i'd probably get that again um so yeah those are good it's uh new mcdonald's breakfast items mid cafe just came out um people have been getting them early so they've been videos for weeks but i figured that was something fun that alexa neighborhood like trying so i'm looking forward to seeing what they think um [Applause] they said definitely check them out if you actually want to watch like one of these and and not be a 30 plus year old guy just eating food in this car they're actually having fun they're enjoying life i love it uh brings me back right um i didn't have an older brother i was the older brother i wasn't older enough to the point where like like she's she's set up for she's she's 18. and or alex is 18 avery's nine so that's like a that's like a nine-year difference right my brother's four years different from me um so eventually when i got a car he was like in high school and i kind of fit that role we'd go out and we'd get food and stuff i was the guy that you know took him out for that but how cool would it have been when i was nine to have an older brother or sister or something that took me out for fast food and we made funny videos about it that would have been cool right i don't know i'm getting old i'm getting old somebody posted on reddit today there was a remember old like old video games in general 90s before they used the rca connectors the red white yellow excuse me um well those have always kind of been in use but there was an rf adapter if your tv didn't have that and you'd hook that in and you'd flip your tv to either channel like three or four or whatever you picked on the selector there and that's how it would get the signal it's like a radio signal some kid gets one uh for his old sega master system he posts sunrise like what is this how do i hook this up and the top comment is like oh i'm old that's exactly how i'm feeling um yeah speaking of being old i'm here telling you about these 90s juices i used to get this all the time i would go to go to baseball games not with my uncles i always take that guys to sports games they were awesome loved that i missed that um so we go watching the rochester rhinos soccer team or the rochester red wings baseball team there at frontier field up in rochester i get my passion fruit awareness good stuff not a breakfast drink um frootopia but yeah hey please go check out what alexa and avery thought of this um guarantee it'll be more entertaining than my video so thanks for watching collab week two i think this is the last video i hope you found at least one of these channels that i enjoy um i consider them to some degree you know my friends here on youtube anyways everyone i've collabed with collaborated sorry they're getting the lingo into me here it's collaborated um i love

a comment i appreciate it you guys take care", "ItC1uXZDSTg": "welcome back vape fam to another installment of in door smokers so we got kelly in the house today what's up guys and she stopped by today to help us take a look at this brand new wismic rx gen 3 dual hell yeah that's a mouthful that's a lot and i better give you a mouthful of vapor to go right along with it we're about to find out all right here's your sneak peek guys this is what we're gonna be looking at and vaping on right after this [Music] so i was very excited today to hear we had a brand new product from wismec always love all the stuff from wismick and this one looks extra slick yeah very unique i don't think i have a single mod in this color so this is a double 18650 and probably one of the smallest double 18650s i've used up to this point very tiny little mod can almost completely disappear in your hand look at that which hands it in no no no sucker so all right guys and as you can see you do have your power button a big ass jbo power button up there and then you got your up and down buttons right here and this is going to allow you to do up to 230 watts depending on the resistance of the coil you have in there we're not going to need anything nearly that high because i think we got a 0.4 resistance today in the tank recommended between 40 and 70 watts i don't think i've ever heard you say you don't need to get that high i already got high beforehand this tank that goes with it is actually a 5.8 mil and you can see we actually got the tinted windows on this thing tinted windows hell yeah nice little subwoofers little spoiler on the back and then this is the way the whole unit's going to look all together that is a really pretty mod yeah i love it man that matches i need a pair of shoes perry heals that color and it looks like that um new car finish on there you know paint job hold that for a sec gladly let's see what else we get with our kit i love this please be careful not to use batteries with torn or whatever batteries look [ __ ] up don't use them yeah i use good batteries same rule i have about women i date they look [ __ ] up i don't touch no go i definitely ain't eating it oh god you got a micro usb cord for charging of course you can charge that right off the unit itself or you can just use your own battery charger and swap out batteries and that looks like we got some seals and some rings in here ring-a-ding-dang extra rings yep there you go as well as a replacement coil if you like it put a ring on it and besides this sweet ass they called it gold i would say it is more of like an orange color to it like a burnt orange yeah but very nice but besides this one we've got another awesome looking one that's going to be for you guys at the end of this video once you get a little peek of that i thought it was for me look at that yeah and that actually has a purple tinted visor on it there that purple i don't know if you guys can see that but it is a really cool shade of purple so this is an advanced unit intended for advanced vape studs it says so right in the instruction book so yeah this is not something i would recommend for people just right out of the gate into vaping but for the advanced vapers it is a fairly simple system you just click the button three times and then you get into your modes here so from here you can switch from power mode into temperature control this will do your full array of temperature control nickel titanium stainless steel you also have tcr modes in this and you have your preheats that you can ramp up with it now if you were in temperature control you would be able to do 200 to 600 which i believe is right around 100 to 315 celsius that 200 600 was fahrenheit this thing will do wattage between 5 watts all the way up to that 213 depending on the resistance of the coil you have in here it will read resistances down to 0.05 and temperature control or 0.1 in power mode the tank itself is a top fill which we are going to do right now bam oh i like those yeah that is nice but all right what are we going to be filling this with today we have another loaded flavor this is the loaded juice line from ruthless vapor awesome and this one is apple fritter which you should love because you really love apple pie yeah that's about the only one of the donut lines or anything oh it does smell like an apple fritter some of that cinnamon on there right off they've got a great line of ages we're gonna put a link down in the description box i think there's also a coupon code that's gonna go for that you should definitely follow them on instagram we're gonna go ahead and get a vape on this but before we do that why don't we show you all the other colors available in this brand new gen 3 dual by wismec check it out yeah so some very slick colors to choose from there personally i think we got the best two right here yeah they are really pretty looking good so our first 40 watt vape on the brand new wismec rouleaux gen 3 dual vape right here let's check it out [Music] this is actually one of those that the apple is really prominent usually you just kind of get the apple flavor but it's a lot of crust a lot of cinnamon i'm just going to tell you about it and you get to dream i'm a bear i'm just going to watch them vape that's what i come on a video to do just watching all right all right give that some face man you're gonna like that 40 watts it's smooth it's mild it's freaking happily frittery frittering away the day that is a really easy drop and that flavor is really good yeah give them your biggest let them see how big a cloud you can get off of this and they can see what the intermediate bait can do with it whoo god damn that ain't no joke and no choke good job no choke the loaded lines have been really good i think loaded is like loaded of flavor or something because they're really rich yeah they are very flavorful yep it's not a real mild subtle flavor it's like three strong flavors i would say the apple the bready and the cinnamon yup that's the main flavors you're getting off of this but a nice mix all right 60 watts here we i don't know if i can do go i'll try i'll do my best [Music] still smooth huh cock-a-doodle damn that's smooth hell yeah i would say you're even getting more flavor still at 60 i think that was the most flavorful vape i got yet as you get more flavor on this i think the apple just becomes more pronounced i'm not really getting a ton more of the cinnamon or breadiness it's just like a lot of apple coming off of this but like a fresh baked apple yep exactly like a nice warm apple right out of my mind or something 70 watts on the new gen 3 rx by wizmix [Music] pretty good that was about a second and a half [Music] hell yeah there you go still getting tons of flavor on this it's still a real good vape of 70 watts i don't feel like we're pushing it you know beyond what the coils can do still getting that rich apple yeah really good it is a much shorter draw honestly yeah that's the only reason i really do turn them up is if i'm going to be out having a conversation or something you don't want to have to stop for four or five second draws you know i did some good conversation so the other day i was he said yeah exactly nice that's nice very impressed man thank you for hanging out with us for a little while today thank you to

going to sit here a week behind you um excuse me this is vlogmas day 12 and um right now i'm gonna wait to get some thing to eat because of the fact that i woke up super late because i'm in bed super late last night so it's now like 12 noon right now i'm just getting the day started but i'm on my way to like i say get something to eat because i'm hungry and i don't feel like making anything it was pretty cool seeing um fire trucks uh as well the fire truck with uh a santa claus guy on it um the the townships around here do that a lot um and i think that's a really nice touch um i'm pretty sure a lot of townships do that but i'm thankful that my kids get to see that every year so the kids are again not with me for today um and i'm gonna try to do some things again like i did before that uh i wouldn't be able to do with them here so yeah welcome glad to have you sit back relax and uh come on just ride with us hey can i just get one of them apple photos please the apple fritter and that'll be up [Music] thank you [Music] if i don't i will lose it 44 25 32 5 40. two three four two four four i cannot [Music] how you doing two 44. have a good one thank you have a good one all right all right it's not warm at least not in the bag i can fill it um so that is definitely um interesting maybe i should ask for a while but because it's not woman i am going to just wait till i get back to the crib and i'm going to warm this up i'm going to take a bite of it regularly and then i'm going to warm it up and then see what it's talking about but i like the way it looks so like i said before the fritter came rather um it wasn't warm so it wasn't cold or not like that but i think the good food obviously is warm it looks nice it actually looks like the one from starbucks i was mentioning in yesterday's vlog i warmed it up for 10 15 seconds and it's pretty decent i'm about to go and take this bite and we're about to see it looks really good yo this is delicious i don't care what none of y'all say y'all some haters yo this is delicious this is delicious it's soft it's super got good chew got apple chunks in there or legit it's not overly sweet at all not overly sticky those are y'all who said you didn't like it don't have to explain this is everything [Music] so today ended up being a rather chill day um i got some laundry done uh for the kids about to start mine um we were supposed to go to six flags today um for their winter holiday in the park event i mean season or theme um and today's weather was a little uh it was a little um it wasn't really assuring that it wasn't going to rain and although it was really warm today today actually probably would have been a perfect day to go so we pushed that back to next week so one of our um vlogs vlogs next week will be uh the six flex holiday in a park event um and actually we'll be doing that on my birthday so that will be saturday of next week um and we'll be uh vlogging from the six flags great adventure here well here in new jersey um and logan is 54 inches without shoes on and guess what the minimum height is to ride just about all the rides there not just about basically all the rides 54 inches so hmm i showed him some videos the other day of roller coasters he act like he wants to go on things and i will tell you like from his uh his his from from the one video a couple years ago or when we were at the new jersey state fair logan was was mad fearless um when it comes to like those kind of things so i could see him getting on rides and having a great time so i showed him some videos of some of the some of the big big big big rise of six flags that he's tall enough to ride uh well he saw him like i said told him right all of them um and he seemed really interested in wanting to ride that wanting to ride so we'll see what that looks like in a week um so when we get to the uh the six flags vlog next week um and though if you for those of you watching now uh see if if if if you know i'm right about my son i think um you know i don't know if i would let him get on everything uh but i would or at least let the first one be one of the big ones but i was just you know see halo because it's different when you get up on it and you see it and you hear it and stuff like that because you know ryan's been making noise um like roaring um and you know when he gets up on it and if he's like dad i really want to get on i'm gonna walk through the line and if we sit in the scenes like that i really want to go and ride this i'm letting them close it and if he says that i really can't wait to ride this i'm gonna let them hit the little button and we gonna go and we'll see um we shall see but the kid is 54 inches without shoes one um so she was going to even be like another inch or so um so yeah so looking forward to that of course next week is the birthday um we're probably gonna check out uh someplace fun for like a small dinner um i wanted to do an ugly sweater party i haven't done one in such a while um but y'all know covet i mean you want to be safe really shouldn't even go out to eat dinner but i think um [Music] going out in a small group to a restaurant um is not going to be terrible especially if we're all wearing a mask and the restaurant actually just opened i mean like for the first time ever um this week so it's new it's a it's a dave and busters um so going to check it out um next week but right now uh like i said it was a pretty chill day uh it wasn't really exciting but tomorrow i do have some um shopping to do because i want to get ready for some vlogs i got coming up this week um for some holiday uh beverages some holiday libations uh so look forward to those coming up but again um i thank you guys for watching this has been a chill vlog um i'm about to probably get uh something to eat because i know you're like nash we've been talking about food but believe it or not since the apple fritter you just seen a couple seconds ago literally eight hours

getting from you know you watch the first few vlogs you see the camera quality is top-notch very very crisp the camera uh y'all know i was having an issue with the camera was overheating um and then i broke the cord the charging cord so i just ordered new batteries to make sure the battery stay charged and a new charging cord and i'm going to check out and see why the camera kind of overheats so for right now i'm actually recording on my phone but i just want to let you guys know i appreciate um because a few of you hit me up with saying like what am i using and right now i'm using my iphone

look forward to talking to you all [Music] tomorrow oh [Music] oh you", "msEXRbxmVRM": "hey y'all we gotta back it again at least video and today we're gonna be making apple fritter fun cakes we call them apple fritter because that's what Applebee's call them and you can see this is my new video on my new account our friends video so you're gonna need pancake mix water and egg egg is optional because it just makes it more crispy after that they're gonna need a pot of oil you don't need a lot and then you want to put it on seven and a half if you want the Apple part you're gonna be canned apples and there a lot of butter my mom had whisk it some more because it was too runny so she put some more pancake mix in it after that we put it in a bag and then we cut the tip off and this is the second teaspoon of butter you're gonna need four teaspoons of butter more if you want to that's 1/3 teaspoon you're gonna want to put it all the way at the bottom so the pot doesn't burn so you're gonna need butter for effect unless you want nasty tasting it but I mean nasty tasting apples so that's the fourth teaspoon of butter now so we have watch the video and the lady said if you like swirl it around like in the circle wise it's not gonna turned out good it's like just spread apart not together yeah my mom was so happy when we saw it like it didn't spread apart it didn't go on the sides okay and it was coating so it look basically like exactly what you would get out of carnival so after that when your apples are doing you're gonna want to put it on the top of your funnel cake and then put cinnamon and sugar on it and then I heard that I put powdered sugar on it don't act like I didn't do any work I did a lot of weight but I did it off camera because it's hard to do stuff on camera while you're trying to do something with your other hair so that was the last part of the voice audio this is my this is friend be my um my opinion wise part of the video so it's not to be on the voice audio that one it broke a lie so because she put in a circle bye-bye okay so this is gonna be my honest opinion Frodo wear this one okay I don't import back because I made it here you go goes my help will stay step in the back my helpful sticks out her mom under to be honest you did most of the work you see all the way I like it let's put the bedroom and mix it up I'm exposing myself without a single Monster High so do this is my brother I'm gonna be asking a question would you prefer this one okay I'm a or the carnival funnel cakes are you know part of my life's work my mom I really thought this was they're gonna wait because she really was gonna make fried Oreos what no I'm not remember when you have faith running here I was like mom mom you should really make final cakes he was like yeah that does seem like a good idea but she literally bought Oreos and powdered sugar so she was gonna make fried Oreos two out of ten my mug you want to try it do putting strawberries on yours but that was the end of my tuxedo every idea this is my first video on my new page I really only use some of them to do most of impossible okay I just need it a good video to start off with cookin what we honor", "eeUx4m7Lsgs": "what is up youtube this is friend of a dude coming at you real quick with a little update here on the 3x3 grow tent I have rockin with the growers choice 315 this is the CM H light and this is day 15 veg just a quick little update since the last update we had a little issue here in the beginning in the first week there was a little bit of some leaf curl going on nothing too major they seemed to bounce out of it I'm thinking that it was probably just a nutrient issue could have been the cocoa you know I'm not really exactly sure what it was but everything bounced back within the week but it definitely delete a little bit of the progress so that was a bummer but on top of that a couple of days ago actually I had a flood now you can see I took the humidifier out of the tent now I was really stoked to get humidity in here and experiment with that but I was just kind of having some issues trying to set it up I had this tank over here I showed you in the last video it was just a trash can with the RO line going in with a flow valve and then a valve blow it feeding the RO now I thought why would I do that when I could just plug the RO line directly into the humidifier so I did that took away the tank threw it away just put the line directly in but the problem was there's more pressure and it ended up actually popping out now when that happens of course it flooded the whole thing luckily there's no drain to waste on this tray so the water just you know flooded the whole tray and then the plants soaked in that water now this was all RO water so it isn't the end of the world it was unpitched so that is the only thing that I was concerned about as far as the plants soaking in the Sun pH water so it's been about three days now and there's wet you know they really got soaked in it so I'm thinking I'll probably give them I haven't water them anything I wanted them to dry out but probably gonna give them some watering of the pH water just so that they can get something back going with their roots so we're rocking a 6.0 ph thousand ppm with the flora flex nutrients and i'm having great luck with it i mean i just absolutely love it it's really easy to use it's super pH stable and not sponsored but definitely love their products so you can see I took out the humidifier because of that catastrophe I'll include a quick video clip to show you what exactly happened right here but besides that everything is going really well I'm hoping to veg for maybe another two weeks max really get these plants back on track they were doing really well I'm only hand watering just to keep it simple they were doing really well before they got soaked in all the RO water but I think that we can get him back on track they're still really healthy the temperature and everything we're rocking the 78-51 nothing too crazy you know I'm definitely a little bummed I was looking forward to adding the humidity but I just honestly don't really feel like messing with it too much I was having second thoughts before the flood happened so with that being said I ended up just taking it out you know so I think if that's the way I'm gonna rock just keep it simple keep doing what I've been doing I'm really looking forward to experimenting with these LEDs when the plants get bigger in the flower and setting up the automated watering with the timer so you know this was just a quick little update everything is going pretty well we are now finally at 3:15 I started on the 119 and then I bumped up to 245 probably a week in and then you know I don't know a couple days after that I said spirit went straight to the 315 so with that all being said I think that's it for the week I'm going to do my best to just kind of tend to the plants after that you know catastrophe of flood but yeah everything is still really heavy you know so I'm kind of worried they're probably not up taking anything so I'm gonna go ahead and give them just a little bit of the pH water hope that that can kind of get everything a little bit more stable in the root zone and we'll go from there so I'll do another update here pretty shortly but that's it for now peace out hope you have a great day and see you in the next video", "EGo4-bcx1Ag": "hi guys my name is elena and welcome back to my channel let's make today the best breakfast as my husband will say in the world apple fritters yay last time i only made one batch and my husband ate it all and i had to beg for give me a little bite so at least i can try it how was it were they good or not but i guess he ate it all so i guess it says about something so today i'm gonna do double batch and i'm gonna show you how to do it and it was very easy and they were really tasty all right so first thing first we need eggs i already cracked mine in a bowl and then it's really simple we're just gonna keep adding things to the bowl and just gonna mix it up very easy all right so we have our eggs flour just regular all-purpose flour [Music] baking powder salt cinnamon [Music] sugar and milk all right and put it in the mixer all right and this is what it looks like all right so i'll put this on the side and let's cut some apples so granny smith and i have mine about this size so depends on you want more apples less apples two or three apples so we're gonna peel them corn and chop them small pieces all right and let's put it back in the mixer for just a couple of minutes just to mix it all up so this is what we got so as you can see there is a lot of apples but they all coated and there's still some goo on my spatula see so that's what we're looking for so i did double batch here so that's why it looks so big like i mentioned earlier i did first time just single batch but now i'm just making double because single was not enough so for double batch i ended up using five apples not six but five and i think it's just perfect amount for the size of apples i had okay now let's heat up our oil in the pan and start cooking all right for the glaze let's do glaze while the oil heating so we're all ready it's powdered sugar and add milk until it's nice and soupy consistency all right so again i'm making double batch and i had a quarter of a cup milk here so let's see what it looks like see that looks too thick so add more that looks about good all right so for double batch looks like i used up quarter cup and about the half so about a third of a cup so she'll be 375 for the oil all right we're good to go so now i put on a little medium so it doesn't start to burn on me and i have the big ice cream scoop i'm not sure what size it is but it's about a third of the cup volume in here so take your mixture like so okay and don't just dump in the pan one spot but kind of try to spread it out a little bit so that's one mistake i was doing last time i did it so get your thing and as you dumping it try to do see how it's flat like that so not in one spot there we go all right and let them fry until they dark brown and then we'll turn them on the other side and then i already prepared the plate just a little paper towel so i'm gonna put them on top of this so the grease absorbs so all right so continue that until you use all your batter service your glaze [Music] isn't that pretty let's break one apart they so soft and tender and the batter is fluffy oh oh they smell amazing oh um this is so good all right guys that was it looking good i hope you try this recipe it's simple and if you like apple fritters also amazing if you have fryer that's even better i didn't but it still didn't stop me from making those guys and um all right we'll see you next time thank you everybody for watching love you so much bye", "_kr2lNCqKJ8": "on today's episode of cooking with a t-rex chef I'm going to be making apple fritter grilled cheese bread and tomatoes I should [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Applause] how everyone my name is Annie I'm the t-rex chef welcome to my

earlier and I'm very proud to say that she kept it very simple very fresh and very easy for anyone who wants to make this recipe to be able to do it so what are we gonna start with first coin we're gonna get a pot and pour some oil in it get a pot and pour some oil in it okay so we've got that going now we need to get the tomatoes ready no is it okay if I use no see this is what I like really liked about Quinn she brought her own she has her measuring spoons she has the greater for this garlic she's not chopping the gut she's grating the garlic no that's really cool that's a really cool aspect what I'm gonna show Quinn is a cool way to peel Tomatoes okay so what I'm gonna do you're just gonna take it it's called scoring them like that and they're gonna turn it x marks the spot okay know when how long have you been in the kitchen cook those hours four to four or two and you are whole now well you are none okay so she's got some experience out there folks and I understand that you have a youtube looking Jay and how many years have you been cooking and doing the YouTube machine since 2011 2011 so eight years so that's pretty much your whole life even you've been doing this have you been doing it a couple months no yeah oh always always I don't know always be astir yeah we got it all right these are ready no I'm gonna drop these in okay cuz it's going the water it's hot it's only gonna take about a minute met back okay because we're gonna put it into some ice water okay we're gonna start a timer go so now that that's going I want to show you a cool way to get your garlic peel them because you said you're gonna grate the garlic and I think that's a great option to do that not handling a knife so what we're gonna do I'm gonna take these off you're gonna grab this grab it and you're gonna do that for about 30 seconds okay can I count for you absolutely go go [Music] all right sounds good let's take a look in here okay no didn't work the first time in and guess what the first time I did it it didn't work either okay tomatoes are done I'm gonna go like this real quickly okay and let's see okay guess what this isn't working today so I'm gonna peel these by hand and guess what we keep in our mistakes because sometimes when you're cooking mistakes happen well maybe not with you quick oh but with me the mistakes happens okay we're gonna peel these do we have any peeling music Barry can you put up some that's what really good peeling please thank you do you have a favorite cuisine or a favorite dish that you like to cook that you like cooking you're like all right I want to make this because I like making this it's this one right here cool done already done okay I'm gonna grab the tomatoes in the pie that's hot that's hot I should probably use I like that I do that my oven off that shower that Mary the part of this quit is what we're doing is we're going from really hot to really cold so we want to shock them you're not really tomatoes nothing happened that's good all right so we have these are a little bit warm but they're not too bad all right don't look kind of pruney like you know when your hands get wrinkly right it's like this dense area yeah and that's that's exactly what the process is supposed to do go ahead a little warm dad and I'm sure Barry will give us some peeling Tomatoes music I'm just gonna Park that angle to death all right oh my gosh this is I'm really excited about this Quinn like I told all my friends I said you have to watch it's coming up episode because we have a young chef who's gonna be starring and featured in our episode episode thank you for the word because I episode okay so I'm gonna get this going over here twin direct if you want some olive oil in here right okay probably over like a medium heat right okay I can take that from you alright so now what we're gonna do coin is we're gonna show you how to take out the seeds from the tomatoes that we have here we're gonna go like this right down the center okay and you can see seeds right hit just gonna take those out right here and then okay so I'm gonna have you help me with this if you want to start putting those seeds in there for me I would appreciate that any of your friends and school they're gonna be jealous in your point oh yeah what what is the name of your YouTube page for those were watching right now what's the name of it mind your own pleasing Cheers no it's just mind your hey mind your P's and Q's and now this is where did you come up with that oh I did it my dad just put it in okay because you're Quinn my brother's birthday and your brother's prize all right so once you go ahead and start away on the garlic way as well [Music] that smells fantastic okay well you're doing that I'm gonna get our Tomatoes going diced up I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you is this okay right here a dice like that so these are vine-ripe Tomatoes you can use roma tomatoes now you said you've used cherry tomatoes before correct yeah sometimes they grow through my garden wow so you're really like doing this cooking thing from a passion point utilizing every aspect you can I really like them I don't have room for a garden here I love yes tree [Music] yeah do you play anything on the radio or you have a certain artist that you like when you come Oh I usually just listen to the sender me okay oh I like that the sound of me cooking that could be an elf I think we've hit on something hit on something now we have a warm pot we're gonna add some olive oil enough for you overhead shots to smell the olive oil [Music] okay now we add the garlic you okay okay garlic's going in we've got the tomatoes at the driver so they peeled in there with the garlic that's simmer a little bit what are we gonna add the chickens stock which has a nice rich flavor to it chicken stock is does that look like if there's enough in there okay return this to the heat so now well we're gonna be pairing this with is an apple fritter bread grilled cheese grilled cheese tomato soup they kind of go hand-in-hand I'm taking a little twist on this this is apple fritter bread that I get from where I work fresh foods we have apple fritters which are kind of a doughnut but what they've done is they turn it into a low bow beautiful bread yeah there's a glaze on the outside of this and we're gonna cut right from the center that's for you for me that's very good yeah that's really good in we're gonna bring it up to another level by adding the cheese and there's gonna be butter in there and man this is going to be very very very very good so what I've chosen today is a cheddar cheese and a mozzarella because the mozzarella is nice and mild and it's creamy the cheddar sharp and it's gonna be very pronounced in there and the color contrast is actually gonna look really nice on our plate what you call that again cheddar a lot okay so we're gonna cut these relatively thin not gonna go like Texas toast too thick or and a half an inch I have to say we're gonna tuck these in I don't want the to hit the pan and this is how I do mine I'm gonna put these in just like this alright now a lot of people butter their bread what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put the butter right into the pan we're gonna use relatively good amount here coin okay because this bread is really gonna absorb it because this is more of a cait than it actually is a bread so it's it's going to absorb the butter much more and think we're going to drop our first one and I think it's time for a union brave mr. Barry we're ready so we're gonna get this finished up if we have this tomato soup it's still working over here and Quinn's gonna join me we're not going anywhere we're just gonna wait for this to finish all right we'll be right back [Music] when Sally gasps go and her mother bring guests home for a late snack after a movie they have something special in the way of a sandwich in mind the little imagination can turn a sandwich into festive fare [Music] make sure that's not mine okay all right now the soup is ready now is there anything else that we need to do with this you better shield your eyes I'll be fine all right when what do we do now you stir it around like this and press that's it all right [Music] it's ready to go alrighty so now we've got this ready to go it's all blended you're gonna add a little salt and pepper to taste right all right now do a little taste tell me what else it needs a little bit more salt you go ahead our grilled cheese is done so what do we need to do to finish this claim okay so we're gonna ladle this in here alright you want to put that heavy cream in there now we're gonna add the rest of the heavy cream to this pot right here [Music] we're gonna get this out of the way because we're gonna try this one right here cut some bread here so you know what we've done is taken very fresh tomatoes using quints recipe we've incorporated some heavy cream at the very end and now we're going to taste it with the apple fritter bread is mine okay then alright well let's let's do a little bit garnish you know it's got a garnish it right there you go fresh parsley fresh tomatoes here we go you ready go ahead I taste the mozzarella because it's nice and smooth and then I taste a cheddar with everything and then the sweetness with the bright looks very well now what I've been waiting very very long for the coin it's a taste test wins [Music] talk about fresh it's fresh as you can possibly have it that's fantastic coin nothing better on a cold day they have a grilled cheese why not make it an apple fritter bread grilled cheese and pair it with Quinn's tomato soup this is phenomenal another one last thing we need to do Quinn we always pair

we've come to craftsman and wolves they are known for their scotched egg uh muffin i believe and i myself am not the biggest fan of scotch eggs so i saw that their um japanese milk bread looked absolutely amazing so i got myself the egg salad sandwich with yuzu celery and it's on their japanese milk bread and it is so soft i'm so excited to try this here it is this is the egg salad sandwich give it a bite wow it's so refreshing you can actually taste the yuzu i like that [Music] and it has like romaine lettuce it's so good and the japanese bread is super fluffy [Music] we finished off our craftsman walls and then we just went to stone mill mato which is over there uh and we got some matcha lattes and i got a black sesame latte i've never actually heard that before and we also got a matcha croissant look amazing this looks you can see the piping um yeah i don't know it just it looks pretty cool but i didn't want to we didn't want to eat it there just because there's a lot of people and it was kind of stressful so we're going to try in the car how does one even eat this i kind of wanna oh that's super flaky that looks bomb so good we can really taste the mag time yeah maybe we can come back on because i think they have weekend specials which is why this is just the regular stuff but wow guys do you see that on the inside that is absolutely insane but it's like a matcha mousse maybe so good it was a black sesame latte fire whoa oh my that is so good i don't know if you like black sesame though yeah i'm not the biggest fan of black social media so i thought it was you know mature kind of tastes like but it's also very um the milk really meets the taste and unless you get like really uh traditional grounded matcha lattes that's kind of what i thought this is gonna be like but the black sesame taste is so strong okay i'm happy [Music] we have come to giardelli square i really wanted to come here because there's a really cool marketplace and a chocolate shop unfortunately there are a lot of things still closed but at least i can see if the marketplace has opened and it seems like the chocolate shop should still be open so i'm super excited hopefully we can get some nice little sweets [Music] we have finished walking around fisherman's walk and we've come for lunch we come to the famous swan oyster depot they're raw fish on instagram looked absolutely amazing i'm super excited they're so zoomed in outdoor seating so but they seem to be full so we might end up just getting take out we shall see so we also got oysters and sea urchin uh well that looks incredible do you see the oysters there we go sea urchin which looks like this look you see that's the ocean insane but i am most excited to try the sicilian sashimi look at how fresh that is whoa is it good uh-huh i'm gonna try one more i'm not too sure what this is but it comes with the red onion and the capers on it too this one absolutely just melts in the mouth by the way this is the medium size the large one comes with like 30. so this one comes with around i think 20 bit more manageable for two people next stop is bob's donuts we just drove past them and they are a 24 hour bakery known for their apple fritters as well as their crumb doughnuts looks absolutely amazing these ones look really good i don't know we're just we're just gonna see which ones they recommend and we're gonna pick one or two we got it this is the famous apple fritter it is humongous basically it's like apple and cinnamon fried let's give it a taste test do you guys see that apple in there oh my gosh so good [Music]", "ib1JQ8jdLwg": "yes ma'am you try to new Yoplait yogurt so these are the original yogurts not like withering like that these are the Duncan style yogurts one is the Boston cream doughnut and the open is an apple fritter sounds really good so I'm going to try the the Boston cream doughnut first we bought these at Walmart there were 60 cents of peaches which is dirt cheap I think this says 100 calories I can see it's too small yeah 160 160 for the Boston cream and 150 for the apples and apples a little bit less this is say thanked interesting no artificial flavors this is artificial flavors no coloring from artificial sources no high fructose corn syrup with live and active cultures a gluten-free that's the Boston cream the apple fritter says no colors from artificial sources no high fructose corn soup with wildin active cultures are gluten-free so this one does have artificial flavors huh so let's see what oi so playing Sam I try the Boston cream one first typically get play cup the inverted thinner at the top and is bata which drives me for personally just drives me nuts but I don't say it's a limited edition so that's good so if you want it get it tuned I'm gonna kind of go down to the bottom economy move up I don't think there's yeah there's nothing in this one so soccer is free to the bottom or anything like that here we go it definitely has that constantly sour yogurt flavor which I don't mine I like yogurt anyway yeah but if you don't like the kind of sour flavor you won't like this this reminded me a lot of just oh I don't know if this is much different than this ability over I don't see anything at the bottom to make sure no it's just to show her so is it is it a Boston cream dump oh no they got a Boston verb you can see on the picture here's a doughnut it's got cream in the middle which this kinda reminds of the cream in the middle but also have chocolate so not a Boston cream Donna that's still really good it's a very sweet vanilla kind of cream I like the flavor of it but it doesn't taste like a boss too freaked out about maybe a Boston cream filling they're not about something okay so this was an apple fritter I'm excited about this this one's also a limited edition one get to burn off calories just to get it off okay this one has little clumps of Apple in it yeah like a hook a backward there and the apples all through there so there's no really there's no reason to digging forward at the bottom there's a little there's like a little on to Apple off you there this is good again it's just something I like hover but it's got like it's got these little Apple pieces in there that have been like baked in like gum like a brown sugar cinnamon kind of flavor or brown sugar cinnamon seasoning spices it's not bad there's quite a bit of Apple in there it's very soft apple like an y'all have a baked apple with bigs and they're neat it will be a little bit more cinnamon in there the apple flavor is good I mean you can like the Apple hunter pretty good size in there they're good but they're they needed a little bit more seasoning out that being said if you like yogurt and you like apple with a little bit of cinnamon try this one out I really like that one the the Boston cream literally just tastes like our richer vanilla it's even premium it's a little bit darker yellow than like a yellow off-white kind of color than the this one but it still like it's like the cream inside like a sweet like a sweet cream so it's good definitely worth trying out a few yogurt but just know that they're not not a hundred percent what they say they are to remind you of that kind of stuff but they don't taste like those so try them out for 60 cents apiece I still think they're pretty preachy 150 160 calories I think it's a little hop for me for comics I like to get the ones everyone like 80 calories but the definitely we're trying out hope you enjoy this video next watch [Music]", "iltgXudrkYY": "hey good morning everybody what's going on it's saturday june 13th my birthday yay so what am i doing for my birthday bam we are getting ready to bottle the hard apple fritter today the one that everybody voted on the hard seltzer that nobody wants to make but we made it anyways and as you can see it actually cleared up pretty good with the gelatin we put in i only put one i think it was one teaspoon per five gallons so i probably should have used a little bit more but it does look pretty good it's not very dark uh it's not clear of course because we actually used real ingredients instead of just a bunch of uh those things extracts yay thank you so and there's the other five gallons down here so what we're going to do is there's sean hey sean what's going on this morning we're going to be putting five gallons of this into that six still over there which is sanitized and draining right now and then the other one we're going to make five gallons of the bottles yay so super excited

in a minute we're getting ready to start doing the drain into the big kettle so that we can start bottling this all right yeah so the less sugar that's in it now means the more sugar that's been converted into alcohol this is gonna be amazing let's see if i can get this damn thing to focus on it alright ladies and gentlemen i don't know if you can see this but it looks like our final gravity

Brad ass or Broadus but I'm just gonna call it Brad Asst this is a handmade mod it is an absolute stunner it's a beauty from wayne massey and he basically makes these available through his Facebook group I mean just perfect handmade workmanship uses a micro FET which is you know a MOSFETs which performs really nicely fits so well in the hand got the side switch right here and you know I absolutely love it it's a great mod now these are not inexpensive mods think about it like if you go to Walmart and pull a shirt off the rack it's 10 bucks but if you want to get one tailor made you know handmade for you it's gonna be a hundred bucks so that's that's the kind of situation here now prices will vary because it's got a lot of different options for you to do on these things you can pick everything from the little ring that goes around the button to the kind of tube that used for the battery tube even choosing the block that your mod will be born from you know you're gonna choose a wooden block and then he will infuse whatever color acrylic you want in there to make an acrylic stab wood hybrid type mod it's you know there's a lot of different options so but even if that's beyond your budget you still want to check this thing out in this video because she's pretty let's go and dig in and let me show it to you look what I'm using this time is loaded eliquid this is their apple fritter cutter 20 ml bottle they sent this along and I was like I don't know I don't usually like the apple fritters you know it's got cinnamon in there and all that stuff but actually this is this is quite tasty so that's what I've been using in here now I did clean this thing up because I wanted to show you the bottle that they actually send with it I've been using a little bit better bottle of silicone bottle but yeah this is tasty stuff and that's what we'll be using today this was sent by ruthless ejuice so I'm gonna put a link down in the description for you can find it so the brightest l/e this is in a nice gift box that you can either get it with or without the gift box I think it's a little bit additional for the box there obviously it would be but it's a nice little box and I think he actually personally does like the burning on it and stuff to give it that accent and then he puts this engraving on the top of it it's real nice got little metal handles and all kind of stuff you pop it open and oh now the foam that's in here not the prettiest of foam but that is what the focus is and look at this mod man this thing is absolutely beautiful all handmade and Wayne really takes his time to make sure that you get exactly what you wanted I mean let me tell you about some of the options on here let me look at this email so when the email he says that the 18 650 can be stainless steel or brass and this one's stainless steel that's the tube that he's talking about and then for the 2700 it's stainless steel only he does media blasting or polished battery tubes this one is media blasted I wanted it to have that kind of media blasted look I just like the way that looks or you can get it shiny and polished if you want he does clear powder coating if you get the brass tube in there and basically what that does is it eliminates the patina look and the smell of brass some people like it some people don't and then it has this micro FET chip that's in here I'll show you that a little bit more here in a minute they're all custom made so everything on this thing is done by hand by him well you know I'm sure there's some machining in there but all especially all the ripples and all that kind of stuff everything is done with files and sandpaper and all that so he does a really great job of these things you can either get a brass or copper beauty ring around the fire button or you can get no ring at all so everything that's on here stuff that I chose this is a piece of stab wood that what he did is he showed me these blocks that he had available and I looked at these blocks and I was like okay that one's pretty cool and when I say block these things aren't finished blocks when you see them basically what it was is a piece of broken wood you know unfinished it was I if I remember right this piece was kind of like you could see all of this right here but it was just jagged and kind of broken and stuff on the sides there and then you choose the acrylic and he actually adds like a kind of silverish polymer material to the acrylic to give it that look but you know so I said I like purple with green and he said yeah I can do that so basically he filled in all of those cracks and crevices and broken pieces and made this thing into the beauty that it is then he takes the block that he created from that and creates what you see here now it does have this little plate on here this is so you can get access to the micro FETs which so basically it's a MOSFET switch and a micro configuration and this hole right here you can either used to have that hole or not and what that hole is good for say you want to get the bottle out of there and it's hard to get it out where you can just stick something in there and push it down that actually is very helpful and the only thing is the tube does stick on there pretty tightly so sometimes the tube pulls out now this bottle that's here this is the one that he's sent with it and this is the mod maker bottle and you know it's a good bottle it's a decent bottle but I like the silicone bottle so that's what I've been using I didn't want to show you in the configuration that it actually comes in though so that hole that's there is actually also good and I'll show you the inside here while we're looking at that you can see its connection up there everything is really clean so you can see the tube I don't know can you see the actual feed tube that's in there okay Lloyd you'll probably see it inside that hole right there so what it does is it makes it so that you can easily take your bottle and you can actually see in there to see where the tube is going to connect it makes it a lot easier to put your bottle in there so there we go matter of fact while I have this out let's go ahead and fill it up I'm gonna show you a trick that I actually got from Brian from vapor Chronicles wife Amy I've never thought about it but you know you can use a try too little blue screwdriver or what this is is from coil master it's one of their little posts that you use for building stick that inside the tube unscrew of course you could use a refill bottle too but I don't have one for the loaded you know fill up your bottle I'm gonna go ahead and fast-forward this good enough then before you put the lid on there you want to squeeze the bottle just a little bit put this on here get that on there nice and tight and then when you pull this out the liquid just gets sucked back down in there so you don't have a bunch of liquid in the tube and it doesn't get everywhere all right so then we're just going to take this looking in there to find the feed tube stick it on there and there we go good to go so looking over the rest of this it's got a little catch cup up here on the 510 so he's incorporated the catch cup into that and he's got those little pins in there to make sure that nothing moves around so it's very nice atomizer that I'm using on this one is the twisted messes TM 24 Pro Series pick this one up when I was in London and it's a nice fit for this mod and the build that I have in there is an MTurk build he built it for me right well I was at VAP Rizzo in Kent Township I want to say but yeah great guys over there at that shop so we're just gonna go ahead and squawk her up squonk action works really good on this thing I haven't had any liquid getting out of the 510 and into the mod or anything like that so it's a very solid mod okay let me go ahead and put that on there just like that and yeah looking good right this drip tip is from signature tips let's give you a once-around on the mod again man she's it's it's a really beautiful mod he does a great job so when you hold this thing it just fits perfectly in your hand and you just hit right there to fire the button so let's put a battery in here alright this is a so DV TC 5 a just screw that on there nice and snug you don't want to really torque it on there but you just want to get it to where it's snug there we go no rattle on this mod at all perfectly good I took the atomizer off there because there was a lot of juice in that atomizer and you flipped this thing upside down and it may leak a little bit from the atomizer so we got all put together and ready to go let's pop this off of here yeah she fires real nice this bill bits on here is 0.12 ohms so that's the brightest that's what I'm gonna be calling it it's the brightest le and you know it's just it's handmade goodness I really enjoy the mod I will say that the bottle you know the mod maker bottle is not a bad bottle it's just it's a little stiff and I prefer a silicone bottle so that's what I've been using in here but I wanted to show it to you in the way that I got it some you know there we go the switch on here works really well I don't know if you can really hear it but it's got a nice click to it and it fires right away it's an instant fire type thing now it is a mechanical mod basically so it's just gonna be whatever current you have in your battery you want to use a good battery again I'm using sony BTC five aids in here I've got it to rewrapped obviously with the white wrap that's on there and what the options that I chose I think it's just a perfect little mod the way this thing fits in your hand I mean I don't know it just got this nice little curve up here so it sits right at the top of your hand and your thumb just falls right onto that switch so I really like that to the fact that I was able to choose the block you know the actual piece of wood and it was just a broken you know the bottom of it was square and then at the top of it it was kind of shards and broken and stuff and then he poured the acrylic in there with the color of my choice and he asked a lot of questions along the way like do you want it you know I like to put this kind of silvery stuff in there for accent in the acrylic do you want that do you not want that all that kind of stuff the atomizer is recessed into it so it just kind of becomes part of the mod you can choose whether you want that little hole to be there I would suggest to do it because it makes a lot easier to get the bottle out and to put it in there just to be able to see the feed tube you know from the 510 to be able to to install the bottle it doesn't have a cap on the bottom of this and I know a lot of people will call that out but I've never had a problem with the bottle falling out of here because the connection with the tube and the feed tube from the 510 is really strong so it I haven't had anything fall out or anything like that not much more to say it's just a really nice mod it's kind of more of a Show and Tell right now I will tell you that this atomizer this is the twisted message TM 24 Pro Series it's just a nice Adi it's very well made I mean it's not groundbreaking as far as the posts go or anything like that but it works really well it's very sturdy the flavor off this thing is great and it probably also helps that I have a building here from MTurk all that stuff I picked up when I was in London went to a party at vaporize oh I'll put a link down there if you're in it's like is it Richmond I can't remember the actual name of the place where it's at but it's in Kent County and it's by Charles Dickens childhood home apparently because we walked by that but yeah the folks of there Scott and all those people hosted a party out there where the cloud comp and MTurk was there put a built in here for me and I've received this one directly from Kent from Twisted Mesa's well he is twisted messes but yeah so I love it it's really good maybe we'll get this on a video all by itself soon here but yeah let's get another one here the mod itself hits really smooth and this juice is very tasty loaded it's apple fritter I don't typically do apple fritter it does have a little bit of cinnamon there but it's really more like in an accent of cinnamon it tastes like an apple fritter it's exactly what it tastes like these guys you know they make glazed doughnuts and stuff that are really good so if you like an apple fritter you might want to check those out I'll put a link down in the description for that I like it when a juice surprises me when I'm like I'm probably not gonna like that and I taste it I go that's good yep everything here working really well so if you're interested in the brightest l/e it if you have a different shape you want them to make or whatever I'm sure he would if there's any kind of modification you want to make to it I'm sure Wayne would do that Wayne Massey good guy very nice guy and he has a Facebook group I'll put that Facebook group link down in the description he also has an Instagram he asked me to send you to the Facebook group because that's easier for him to communicate with you you know this is gonna be out of the budget for a lot of folks but you know it's one of those things I have a friend that buys three hundred dollar pairs of sneakers and I won't pay more than 60 bucks so you know I guess it's all to each their own right and you know me I love my squawkers so when I see something I'm like oh that's nice

episode we'll catch you next time on the vapor trail Channel", "6moABNAsYDc": "if you're tired of cookies and pies from mcdonald's oh boy they got you covered hey what's good smack pack i'm back at mcdonald's to try out their other new pastry that they got going on in the mid cafe bakery we got the apple fritter today so let's see how this actually turns out today we got a real simple let's gave it in a mid cafe bag let's see if i can decipher the hieroglyphics today we got coffee we got fraps we got iced tea and we got cookies or any kind of pastry i'm actually feeling a lot better about my deciphering today but really none of that actually matters because what we are here for is the apple fritter which i don't know i thought it'd be a little bigger moment of truth yeah that's an apple fritter all right so we are looking at an apple fritter such a classic in the donut world we got some nice glaze on it smells like an apple fritter kinda looks like an apple fritter but does it taste like an apple fritter and if it does does it taste good you know what this actually tastes like an apple fritter okay i might have tried to write this thing off a little bit prematurely it's actually not bad we do have some nice soft apple fritter action some cinnamon swirl going through and that apple fritter taste i don't see any actual apples in it yet but i guess it is what it is although if you look really close right there on the edge i do see a chunk of apple oh wait a minute that edge right there the moisture's part got some apple action and some glaze seeping inside i love that not a bad apple fritter so there we have it part two of mcdonald's new mick cafe bakery items on a scale of 110 i gotta say the apple fritter definitely slaps it's real good tasting good nice and soft feeling fresh i thought it was gonna be all hard and cold and dry and disgusting but it was actually pretty good so i'm impressed the only thing is i can go to a number of different donut shops and for under two bucks i can get an apple fritter or literally any other donut that i want hot and fresh so the price you know i guess it's all right if you only have mcdonald's but if i really want an apple fritter or a doughnut i'm definitely heading to a doughnut shop i mean they're everywhere i'm sure i could find one plus i can get a doughnut that i want not the biggest fan of apple fritters if i had to pick not about the top of my list i'm not sure why they picked an apple fritter but they pick a buttermilk bar that's like my favorite right there all in all though it's a good doughnut for mcdonald's let me know if you guys tried it out and what you guys thought of it thumbs up red subscribe button get that merch social media and i'll see y'all in the next one [Music] you", "SoWAxVasRwY": "oh my god it's winter yeah everyone in the northwest is like we know I thought that I would take this opportunity as we march forth into December to share my favorite adult beverage with you guys and this is only for those of you who are 21 and older for those of you 21 and under stick to the you know to the sparkling apple cider whatever crap they feed you at the kids table this recipe involves 360 brand glazed doughnut vodka it's very good for this recipe not good to shoot do not shoot this it is a sugary nightmare and with this I will be showing you how to make an apple fritter drink apple fritter apple fritter martini I guess I don't have a martini glass but if that's what it is so you're turning glazed doughnuts into an apple fritter sort of like turning these into this right there kinda looks like a weird face okay ingredients I already told you you need this but you will also need apple juice and I got the good stuff a simply apple as you can see I've already made a few of these drinks myself so far and also you'll need maple syrup I just found this in my cabinet it's probably old yep that's expired that'll be fine and a shaker of some sort I mean you can stir it around but I got a fancy shaker because I drink a lot and I'd like to have these handy first we're gonna start with our glazed doughnut vodka you're gonna need one and a half ounces of this but I'm gonna double it because I can make my own decisions because I'm an adult next you need three ounces of the apple juice but again I'm doubling it so that's six see actors can do math gosh damn it okay well don't spill on your dress like I did next you want a teaspoon of maple syrup but it gets your teaspoon measuring thing like so sticky so just kind of eyeball it that's probably a lot more than teaspoon and then you want to shake this up ice I need ice I hope I'll be back so then you're just gonna wanna shake shake it up oh not good people are gonna be like Lisa why does your studio smell like vodka okay that's probably good okay so our drink is good and shaken up but first we got a rim the glass just to stay festive I suggest a holiday themed glass this has got some raindrop reindeer raindrops reindeer on it but a martini glass is actually more appropriate because this is a martini now you're gonna want to Rim the glass with cinnamon and sugar and the easiest way to do this I have found is just use your good old fashioned margarita salt container um you're supposed to oh that's cat hair on there you're supposed to use simple syrup to pour in there and then and then dip it in the liquid and then it sticks better but I don't have that so I'm just gonna use vodka wait but then I'm gonna need a plate to dip it on okay I'll use doughnut plate first I'm going to pour some vodka onto this plate I'm gonna sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar into my little margarita thingy  the glass with the vodka then  the glass with the cinnamon and sugar yay that works good enough next it would be really helpful if I had a table because I'm gonna try to get this in there without the ice okay Kevin Kevin bring me a table I mean that'll work I guess were you making margaritas earlier alright taking our rimmed glass we're gonna strain the liquid into oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh boy oh boy success so there you have it my cinnamon and sugar rimmed apple fritter martini mmm better than the real thing probably let's taste it ya better not just cuz the alcohol you're supposed to garnish it with an apple slice but like who has fruit in their house am i right Merry Christmas he and he could shift just a little bit more oh this place is a mess Kevin clean it up wait hold on I'm an idiot I forgot to tell you to top it with whipped cream you know it's optional just kidding whipped cream is hey guys thanks for watching if you want more vids be sure to subscribe because you know my channel it's pretty awesome you want to be part of this", "ZmiYfFtfr4I": "all right what's going on it's Saturday morning in there Sean and we're quickly in early bottling our hoppy IPA so great we're not going to do much video today because me and Sean got ahead out we're heading to Kentucky and we're a bunch of taste testings down there with a bunch of his old friends and family and I'm gonna go back there say hi to a few people so we've got everything set up here but today is also our first hard seltzer and we're getting ready to do a taste testing and yeah we got to keep an eye on that for our hoppy IPA and Liana her daughter the other Liana and John her husband and the wackadoo babies they're twins oh my god right okay so we're getting these set up just so we can do a quick tasting of them check out the clarity it's hard to tell it looks a little yellow just cuz of the background but that is some like white wine clear hard seltzer this is the apple fritter that everybody voted on and also here's our fourth of July bottle caps done tada celebrating a few days early because we all wanted to do a taste testing before we headed out look at that fancy we come back winged it up okay so which one of you two lucky folks is gonna try this hey girl you can share it it's a big glass yeah thank you and cheers to everybody okay those things it's cool okay yeah it still just tastes like seltzer but yeah it tastes like apple juice seltzer this tastes like john be honest tastes like a white claw or a typical okay so we hit everybody else's stuff but we still got to bump it up a little bit to make it better however here's the fun part this is 8% we [ __ ] rock with yes right that's dangerous in it because it doesn't taste like yeah so yeah we hit 8.02 purse alcohol juice yeah it's hard to stay in the doctor the definition of a hard seltzer and still Missi what we did is this isn't yen this is not extract flavors like all the hard cells are just extract crap which is where I get that after taste like cough syrup kinda you don't get that with these because we don't use extracts so it's still not great but it is a hard seltzer so for hard seltzer fans we just made you a hard seltzer that tastes better than alright so we're finishing up our bottling day and tada there's shawn finishing up those bottles we got these bottles right here we got like one or two more look at that almost gone hi Shay yeah alright and once we get this done we're out of here also later today Liana don't forget this is on you all by yourself today is the one month for the peanut butter porter yeah so you get to you get to taste that one and then let everybody in the out there in the world know what's going on alright we are out of here", "R5r6lNq0uH8": "alright so I just changed the coil in my smoke Gillian to 20 W and I figured that'd be a good time to kind of review a new flavor when I haven't tried before I got this one from Mount Baker vapor dot-com they've got a couple of good flavors I wouldn't say that they're my favorite but I think they're reasonably priced you know 30 milliliter bottles I can get 3 for about 26 bucks with shipping with a little bit of a discount code what I'm trying today is is when I have not had before its apple fritter and I'll just say for the record since we're reviewing these bottles with the patter tips not a fan I like the what I call a unicorn tip or needle tip bottles better than that but either way what I do with their stuff is basically just put it into one of my old bottles that have the unicorn tip or needle tip whichever we want to call it and works out fine just put a little piece of masking tape and then write down what it is unless to work but it's worth if you have a flavor from them that you like so this one again is apple fritter I always do 3 milligrams of nicotine on these and I don't know if it actually says on here what the PG VG is but don't believe it does it probably did on the website you can check it out if you go to Mount Baker vapor calm you could probably adjust it even on there on the site you know I don't worry about all that good stuff let's see how it tastes it's actually not bad um definitely taste the Apple but I want to see there's more cinnamon in there smells good no I'd say yeah I'd say not bad at all definitely worth checking out actually I like their sim enrolled one the apple fritter one is actually not that bad I'm left to vape on this a little bit while longer just to get a real feel for it see if I actually do like it but so far I'd say that's that's a good four out of a five he wanted to go there so apple fritter Mount Baker vapor calm you can check them out if you want to there's one more place to check out on the internet for different types of a produces and they have other stuff besides just their house juices as well so alright that's it for me today they've on people", "LEpp9v7l-5E": "[Music] hi this is Sandra I'm here again with another recipe and this recipe is Apple froze these are fried apple fritters and I'm telling Cantonese fried foods to Michelle's dad Michelle I'm grateful she has a dad it's wonderful he's been on whether but he's getting better and better every day and I'm gonna do these Apple fills in and let him know that I'm your daughter today I just think about him all the time so I'll do something else wrinkles he loved at Mastro's he loved one that's fries so what you need to do is get butter you get some granny smith apples and you need to chop them up like this some vanilla you need some cinnamon nutmeg sour cream and milk and brown sugar that's what you need for this day so what we're gonna do is a butter I have a little dirt on my top hey I've been cooking y'all and I haven't had time to clean that I'm a one horse show so give me a chance to do everything neatly and everything so we're gonna let these apples get kind of style before we put them in the bed and we'll be right back all right we oughta we added a cinnamon nutmeg a vanilla and I brown sugar now you can add some um if you want to add some white sugar you can that's the granulated sugar you can add that too if I let these apples get real soft and tender before we put them in that batter and we're gonna just let this to just like this stir them up and get them soft so so so so good forget them like karma like and you know get them ready to go in that bad I'm gonna do that batter that's just that'll look like okay better come up and like I said if you see my stove is not telling but the PAS just forgive me this time because I have really been doing a lot of work i remodeled my kitchen and trying to get it together and I'm gonna have it finished hopefully by industry the society won't tell you I'll be right back all right now what we're doing we got the apples all solved and we got that little firmer look at that that's what we're looking for we're gonna add it to our dog we're gonna get ready to do the apples I mean [Music] none egg and cinnamon and we're gonna add buttermilk I'm gonna blend it together and we want to add the apples okay we want to kind of stick together all right we fry the fritters and what we're gonna do is make sure they are golden brown the fritters is simply the flour and melted butter the apple mixture and cinnamon and we don't let them fry and go turn them over and it's soothing massage looks like okay right apple fritters us turning brown delicious and it open up and we're gonna make sure we don't forget the sour cream like I just told you put sour cream in and I style clean give it that taut taste and you'll be right back to show you what it look like [Music] all right I made some small apple fritters and they are delicious as I always say I made him smile and make them real big I just made a small so they'd be bite-sized like now you can make up some burp cloths but I didn't get a chance to supperclub I just made the apple fritters but they are so good y'all a full of apple they sweet and don't forget to put sugar in the batter because you need some sugar regular granulated sugar is going to batter and then you use a brown sugar when you do the odd serve and the apples together these are so good job these are delegated to Michelle and I hope and they look really mad no sir there's a Santa won't tell you have anything keep this recipe I'm for sauce we'll clean that neck and you can have you some homemade apple food you can put in spice she won't hear them and you can make them taste real real good I'm gonna bite one and see what it tastes like for y'all look at him hey make a big I made him just right but I don't like them to be I like I'm just right you", "5NwFrJRbfdg": "[Music] hey everyone Heather here from adventures in everyday cooking today we are gonna do gluten-free apple fritters in the airfryer oh yes the airframe so I hope you'll stick around and see how they turn out because frankly they're down like this so first thing we're going to want to do is we're we're going to want to cut up our apples one apple is equal to about one cup of chopped apple so you really just need one granny smith apple for this recipe so I usually take the core out just like that when I'm chopping and I'll put that into my compost bowl so I just cut kind of sideways next to the core my compost will be super excited about Apple alright and then what we do what I do I always say we anybody else noticed I always say we it's me myself and I we're here a lot together alright so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna make slices so try to make is even enough slices as you can in your Apple so kinda like that and then we're gonna turn them over in probably sections of two and we're gonna make slices again okay and then we're gonna chop and now I have nice even apple slice Apple Trump's what what so it is Tuesday today and Tuesdays are Taco Tuesdays but I decided to pour go taco making actually that's not sure we're having tacos tonight it's my daughter's birthday but we're making apple fritters too because I love Donuts you know that every time I even do it I have warm and happy fuzzy feelings so if I can make a donut be less than a thousand calories and we fry stuff okay frying is a beautiful wonderful awesome thing it really is but it does add quite a number of calories to your diet so when I got my airfryer I was actually super excited about being able to make things just a little healthier I mean it still uses a little bit of oil but really we're talking a tablespoon of oil compared to two cups of oil so then I thought surely I can try this in the airfryer and then I started to Google recipes and I see that they can make cookies in the airfryer so why can't I my kids make an apple fritter so here we go we're gonna try we are naked I'm really gonna do one in the airfryer and then if it doesn't turn out I'll go ahead and cry them in the pan but you'll be here you'll see I don't know if this is gonna turn out an adventure that's for sure well that's why I do this because I love experiments in the kitchen today when she can help so it's much easier this day and age to be gluten free and dairy free but sometimes it's just not an option when you're me though you really have to just not otherwise my belly is a happy camper my allergies tend to sit damn it my muscles and so I'll wake up the next day after having something with gluten and it will seriously be like I just got hit by a train all right here we have our chopped and we're going to need about two cups of apples and that's equal to about two apples so let's set those over here all right this recipe is so very easy it takes five minutes to throw together in your air fryer oh let's put our oil air prep the reason you want to put the foil in the air fare is because the basket for the air fryer the batter will just fall down inside the basket and you want to do it like this because otherwise the oil gets flying around all over the place so I've taken a piece of foil and I folded it into thirds and then I'm just going to lay it over the top like so that and then I'm gonna spray it with some cooking spray okay we're gonna go ahead and drop it back down into our fryer basket and Nestle it pretty far down in all the way down in there man there you have it so it just looks like that and we'll sing it your happiness quite warming up yet because it warms up so quickly I don't want to stand here and sweat next we're going to combine the dry ingredients we have two cups of one-to-one Bob's Red Mill flour and then we have half of a cup of sugar we have 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of Himalayan pink sea salt we have 3 teaspoons of baking powder we have 2 teaspoons and we're just gonna stir that all together a year we're practically already almost done with these spreaders seriously so alright next we're going to put two eggs in our wet bowl note to self alright and two thirds of a cup of oat milk 2 teaspoons of vanilla right at this point we're gonna go ahead and get our air fryer started alright and I'm gonna put my air fryer on 350 let's go as soon as it's warmed up which takes about three minutes we'll be ready for alright so now I'm going to mix the wet into the dry we're gonna mix this until it's nice and smooth and that really only takes just a minute all right once a food we are going to add in our two cups granny smith apple all right and now it's done clean up a little bit alright next part super easy but you must be patient we are going to scoop out one at a time into our airfryer and when we scoop it out we kind of have to move quickly so I'll move the fryer close to the close-up camera so you can see what I'm doing but basically we are going to scoop out the batter put it on the foil spread it out and push it in for five minutes when five minutes is up we are going to turn it over and then let it go for another five minutes so here we go in the best as you can and then we're just going to brighten and set the timer for five minutes and five minutes we will turn it over all right in the meantime we're gonna make our glaze so what I have back here is one cup of powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon of oak though I'm using oat milk because my daughter it's her birthday today and she is allergic to milk so I'm using oat milk but really you can use regular milk or any almonds about that good like whatever works for you I also know that this recipe works really well with coconut flour not coconut flour sorry coconut sugar but it has a very strong coconut sugar taste not this yes but also this so you could put coconut sugar inside a white sugar in that and coconut sugar and a little bit of arrowroot and this and it works just fine but all right so this is my magic bullet so I'm just going to make my glaze in here [Music] oh yeah nice [Music] all right it's been five minutes and it's time for us to get back in the airfryer by four minutes five more minutes we wait that's why [Music] stick it back in for five minutes and five minutes all right look at that it's not beautiful okay we're gonna take some blame that have my basting brush here we're going to take some glaze and we are just going to use it while it's warm and just glaze one side too much all right there you have it a gluten-free apple fritter let's cut into it so you can see the inside [Music] Matt I look delicious delicious it won't be free people this is a recipe you have to say you have to make it at least once but since I know that some of you don't have air fryers I've decided to show you how to fry it on the stove but first onto the stove we are going to put an inch of coconut oil and we're going to turn on the stove to medium and wait for it to get really hot so that we can fry our fritters in the meantime I'm going to get a plate and paper towels ready to go so that when I take them out of the oil I can drain them [Music] so check to see if the oil is ready we're gonna drip just one drip of water and it needs to pop but be very careful think it's what sells oh that was a big drip but as you can see looks like a pretty so I'm gonna take a scoop of ours apple fritter I'm gonna put it right in hmmm that Apple was crunchy I'm gonna go ahead and unstick it from the bottom right away there we go and that was so strongly of oil in here it's almost like nauseating time to flip over oh look at the beautiful color on that one that one almost looks a little bit more like an apple tritter because it's like kind of separated itself you can pick off that piece and numb them but again just the amount of oil that's there it's a bit disconcerting to me all right apple fritter number two in the fryer boom looking good I'm a little worried about the inside being cooked so I should probably well maybe that's why there's holes in it maybe the oil goes up through I don't know I don't I'll fry very awesome because they get a little weirded out about oil all right whoa that one got a little crispy wow that one's finishing up over there you want to blaze one of our frying [Music] or is the difference in size well check those out so those are very different crispy batter nothing the fact that that one is so crispy I don't know it just tastes like oil Muslim looks much more like an apple fritter the oil for three fried buttons they definitely look like doughnuts this looks like a dome however with just a little dream I'm not not I mean I'm not against oil but comparatively these look like doughnuts this looks like a loose based attempt at a doughnut but the amount of oil butter in these is zero and the amount of oil that is in these three is quite a bit but how are they going to taste and for those of you wondering about child labor I did position [Music] got a little crispy right here is our pride well it's definitely crispier more like a donut but like I was mentioning the oils just coating my mouth so I think I prefer the air fried donuts so the verdict is I prefer air fried so if you have an air fryer it's time for you to adventure out and make some baked goods in it chute make some donuts all right well thanks you guys for tuning in hope you enjoyed this episode of adventures and everyday cooking if you enjoyed it please like share and subscribe", "atJDRTV5eds": "no have you ever had an apple fritter never had an apple fritter in here I have some apples and what I want to do is I want to add some cinnamon to this brown sugar just until the brown sugar can sort of dissolve in out and of course I'm not Meg eight year old so we're gonna do a little grind of this as well can you use your only Apple that one your favorite apple or mixing it is better you can mix it but you know what what you have to do is think to think for a second about the textures of them so I know that that is a lot but like you can see that this is like firm where you can see that this is a little bit more delicate wouldn't use when you say does it change after cooking it does it's gonna it's gonna soften up what I'm doing here right now is in about two teaspoons of butter I'm just solving that sugar that brown sugar without cinnamon for the apples and I don't necessarily need to get them too hot okay I'm just dissolving it so what I'm gonna do now is this I'm gonna add flour sugar and baking powder so that's our dry ingredients and then just take a whisk to mix this up so now what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna add two eggs you can but I want some of the yolk because I want I want to have that that great richness I'm gonna add a little bit of apple cider and then what I'm doing is I'm forming a batter for our apple fritters now look this is way too thick so what we're gonna do is before we add any more liquid we're gonna add our our apples in here now chef instead of frying the apples what else would you say it would be good over like waffles pancakes ice cream just for ya if you don't fry them if you can you put them in something else oh you have to kind of frame right so speaking about that you know there are a lot of things you talk about well what is fritter I mean this could be a claimed fritter it could be a shrimp fritter or a zucchini fritter but how do we know what you would use the same dry ingredients yep and just add whatever else you accept if I was making it savory I wouldn't add the sugar how we can tell if this is done we're gonna just try a little spoonful of these and see you see how they float like that so we're gonna fry I was expecting it to make a noise it doesn't we're gonna fry some fritters okay now when you frying fritters or anything that you frying which is kind of like a doughnut you have to turn them cuz they won't turn on their own you see how how that is we're gonna get a little a little fritter little fritters coming your way we got apple fritters that we're gonna put in some cinnamon sugar when they come out see and you got you have to turn them or they don't they don't cook all around you can do it on the stove in a pot but when you fry on the stove make sure you don't put more than 50 60 % full because oil is gonna expand and you don't want to have to redecorate your or your house all right so look we're gonna see if this baby's ready see that fritter right and then when I hot like this you're gonna rub them in the sugar how can you go wrong how can you go fry it and sugar and as christine has the first one how did that happen how did that happen they're hot they're hot small boy no small bite they're hot all right maybe you're gonna keep frying fritters and then we're gonna put this whole Apple collection together", "d4bBiLr3Bk4": "[Music] all right uh time for donut review this is a missing hole donut shop or missing whole baking i guess uh they're known as and you can see right there is their delivery truck no trans fats i guess that's good i mean it is good but uh honestly uh health uh healthy ingredients is exactly top of my mind when i'm getting donuts uh it's maybe more just uh flavor but anyways let's have a look-see at what i got today so right here i got my chocolate frosted i've got the favorite right here i'll talk about in a second and then of course i have a massive apple fritter i think it's freaking ridiculous so all right so my favorite always uh growing up was the the chocolate frosted the chocolate glaze whatever you want to call it um i even way back uh in a past life i worked at a dunkin donuts getting out of high school and uh great thing there you could get donuts i get free donuts however you want during uh during the uh the shift and um for better or worse i wasn't really into coffee at the time probably for better because uh their coffee is yeah so so but uh but the donuts i'd always have a chocolate frosted so this chocolate frosted right here immediately it's checking one of my boxes take a look at that melty that's what i'm talking about you see that that's looking good now of course you could see that and it could be hours and hours old and stale but this this bad boy right here that thing is uh that's nice and fresh also of course missing whole what are they all about square or rectangle uh doughnuts so that is a nice little standout feature for them you go you take a little instagram with this bad boy uh not many people are getting i'm getting one of these so nice and fresh let's have a let's have a taste that's great maybe it's just me this is what saturday morning tastes like it's saturday morning it's not crazy super duper light and fluffy maybe if i came a lot earlier i mean it's 8 45 in the morning it's still pretty early um but not not too dense that chocolate oof that chocolate that's fantastic this right here memories uh that's that's a good one right there all right so i'm usually in the habit of asking whoever's working there what's their favorite right because if you work at a donut shop you know donuts and uh so i asked her what her favorite is this is this is a donut a type of donut that i don't know before i moved to the west coast i just never knew about this donut maybe i just had a blind spot maybe uh maybe they actually didn't have it back east i don't know but this is a uh a cinnamon crumb crumb though and i remember as a kid having these like the drakes drake's coffee cake kind of version um but anyways these these seem to be big out here so this was her favorite let's give it a shot um i hate to say this i feel like i'm cheating on the chocolate one but man there's something about this oof this is amazing feels really good before you even really bite in you know you just got that aroma you just kind of you know you're almost tasting already that cinnamon sugar really nice really light um somehow this one seems maybe a little bit lighter a little bit fluffier than the chocolate i asked them this is super important and depending on when you want to go i ask them if they bake all day long or if they just bake once in the morning and you know that's it you get what you get these guys at least on saturdays they close at uh at one so it's not unreasonable that that that they you know might bake once and that's that but that is in fact the case uh they're open a little bit later you know during the weekdays but i know i've come here later in the day gotten one it's okay uh but you know going to get you know the chocolate later in the day and uh it's not not sticking to your fingers like that right it's just kind of it's kind of hardened up um i'm not their fault i mean the only way around that is to bake throughout the day and not every place does not not every place can do that just on the fit in their schedule um i feel like really it's a 24 hour joints that are going to do that um but anyways i mean unless you're me donuts are probably a morning thing anyway uh for me they're kind of 24 7. but uh so just something to consider but yeah these are really good all right time for the two-hander the uh fritter that is literally the size of your face this thing's ridiculous i told the lady that the girl that i said i was like man those things are freaking huge ridiculous and she's like is that bad or good so i don't know it's just impressive is what it is let's have a look all right apple fritters for me um that's kind of one of those things where i think i'm like chasing i'm chasing a dragon on apple fritters i've had two different places one in particular for me hands down best fritter i've ever had and i've just been like chasing that high ever since and i haven't found it i've tried so many apple for this so many places and they're probably good you know it's like if you had that girlfriend that you just you've built it up in your head some high school love or some whatever you know probably wasn't even what you thought it was but you just you have it in your head because it was you know when you were a teenager or something and then every other person is just just a human being you know so is that so is that first person but you just you have it built up in your head no one ever matches right um fortunately that's not the case for me with a date and i'm realistic but with apple fritters i am all about realistic uh with apple fritters man it's gotta be light gotta not be over fried and i know they're fried but there's a difference right you have the ones that are fried and you taste the fried and it's just it's gross like it's got to be light it's got to be heavy on the cinnamon and a lot of apple chunks in there it's like you know the difference between pumpkin and pumpkin spice right in the pumpkin spice it's just the spices if you're giving me an apple spice fritter you can go home with that i'm not interested what i want i want apple chunks this is an apple fritter it's not cinnamon fritter it's not a big ball of dough it's gonna feel like you know a lead bottom i want big chunks of apple in there and right away not necessarily seeing it i'm seeing a little bit of it i'm not gonna blame them because i think that is kind of the standard for apple fritters i think that's just how apple fritters are done but when you've been spoiled like me and you've had some phenomenal apple fritters uh just no no no place ever lives up i'll tell you right now because unless it's you know i don't know when i'll be able to review them there's a grocery store little grocery store in massachusetts and it's called big bunny and they have apple fritters they're just you know in a clam shell you know they're probably made relatively frequently but it's not like they're busting them out you know 24 7. those apple fritters i don't know maybe i'm remembering it wrong those elbow fritters are the gold standard and i have just i have not had i've not had one that's matched up since but how's this one do you can see lots of dough lots of cinnamon lots of glaze on top nice thick yellow little pool of glaze right there not too bad not bad not bad at all in fact if you like apple fritters if you like your your local donut shops apple fritters or whatever this one's at least as good uh you know could be could be better and it's a giant all right i got this freaking behemoth and these two donuts for 450 i mean that's amazing good value uh anyway but this thing pretty good as you can see i keep eating it but i'm still chasing that dragon anyway so uh that is that is the missing hole donut shop uh this one nope this one the girl that worked there said it was her favorite and i gotta kind of say as much as i didn't expect it that one that one is my favorite too close second chocolate frosted because a it's good b it's just in my head and that's just kind of always my favorite go-to but i mean i think you can't you can't go wrong so check it out missing whole donut shop so here we go dan the donut man at missing hole uh he's there baker obviously uh owner i assume so interesting story about this guy i was in there uh one of the very first times i was in there i was checking out the donuts and commenting to the staff about some strawberry muffins that i smelled they were cooling and uh and they said we make them for the local schools so i said oh that's great you know they smell delicious grabbed my donuts you know left i'm out in the car eating them and then i don't know where here comes dan you know knocked on the the car window and must have heard me talking about the muffins inside and just came out and just just brought me up a brand new fresh delicious uh strawberry muffin you know just because he's a nice guy so i mean that'll always stick with me and that's uh that's really exceptional uh so anyways let's uh let's get to the review", "8YrnmHbvYwk": "hey guys welcome to captain corner today in this video we will be showing you how to make American Girl doll food alright so these are samosas that I made it will show you how easy and all steps for making these samosas and may also so this is really bad lighting but we will be showing you how to make these I'll move them over and over and we'll also have a few others um so mean I don't know how many yet but we'll have a few but first before we go on to that and we'll show you how it's made yeah stuff so you should get a stretchy don't like this yeah you'll be able to stretch it like play-doh but and this is how to make it so you need a bowl and some flour and this is I'm two thirds of flour and we also need a one-third of water but with the water as you stir it in see if you need to I need more do I need less and if you need less just add some more flour to redo this thickness okay so this is how we do it this is happy so there's a fire be 25 and we add a little tiny bit of water good that's good that's good and you mix it all up oh we forgot to say you should use a spoon yeah and then just add a lot more water I think that's a little too much um so make sure you don't add make sure you don't add too much you can't really see this but we're starting to gain like a thicker pace and just stir it and once you get like a certain amount like this is not enough just stir it around a little bit make sure you got like a lot of flour and also when you're doing it make sure to push out as many air pockets as you can because it just helps with in the process okay so now we have this here for easy and I'm to handle but it's still very very blessed digg need a little more flour will come back with our extra farm we are back with our full cup of flour it might be a little bit scary so just add this to your well you can't see this but add it not too much add length around this moisture bowl and then just put it in just like bread dough and just roll like marinate it in the flour and make sure it's okay if you get it on the table on the surface that you're working on afters you can just clean it up with a wet paper towel make sure that you're working on a surface I'm needing this as I'm talking by the way make sure you do it at on a surface like like this where there's like if you have any pets where there's no fur like that and so then you can just take it and put it on your table that you are working on and since this is a messy craft if you are younger a kid you should probably ask your parents first before you do it this is now right look at the corner you can do basic hello down there soon is that ok so here we got a do I just want to need this that Wow put a spring collection flower like we just did and needed in it and need it and you will get yourself like this but make sure even once you make your dough you keep kneading it because this has gone hard you gotta make sure it doesn't go hard cuz when it starts to go hard and you're finished with it she just roll it up like a hot dog and then fold it over like a taco now then a hamburger then up this way in sideways as a taco and then you just go quick and then you just repeat the process you also want you can use chakra something like we'll be showing you how to use that so Brosius get some more flour like sprinkle a bunch out and then just go around and like wipe it up like your dough is a napkin or is it so our chalk we will show you that when we're done so here is it this is actually really good now so what you want to do is get a fork ready and we're back in a minute okay now we got our dough done and we have a four so put that to the side and we'll be is the other dough that we made cuz this other nose gets all right so pinch your dough and just need it up roll it over and by the by implication wonder this is like a different set of dough it's the same process of making it but the less air pop there's like the better like this one is a lot of your pocket so it's like right weird and this one don't so it's hard to happen and where the air pockets are it just traps moisture so you don't want that yes it I don't know if you guys were able to see that she actually liked me no I'm a friend like you I trying to fight your finger there i'm jumping it's not fake face alright let's watch for talking less oh sorry if this video's too long guys just fast forward to some random spots that you don't want to see like that just seeing that we just all right so now we got this done and what you want to do is take the size of a well i don't know i'm about that's like a fence order all probably a lonely there you got learning take a sizable loony need put your big Mongol John boom take that away and our get your little tiny Tony and roll it make now make it smooth it over to make your learning into its hunie so this is the size of a loony and then stretch it with tuning and then like fold it over like AG attack arilla and round off the edges like make sure there's a big like lump in the middle like it makes it look like this feeling inside yeah like almost like a croissant yeah like use this as well you may not be able to see it very well with camera that is pretty bummed this one's bigger than the other one so now that we got our taco formation like we will get our fork and then just go from one end to the other and this is actually like a pizza pocket really so if you don't want it to be like something fancy like whatever this is I don't know what that you can just do it like a pizza pie or it's actually like an apple fritter too so I had a brain fart a second there I remember the name is now it's a samosa so once you have to help me yeah once you got this like all of the ends all done you might not be able to see this but hopefully you can just do this with the description on giving the exclusion description so now that I got this done just turn it over and do the exact same thing on the other side yeah so it's like a little twin little then swim a triplet or something I quadruple it doesn't matter I don't think that's a thing okay now we got this beautiful little thing done that you can see there's some good lighting I found you sound you uploaded it's not actually right be weird don't make it red unless you're bleeding then it will turn a little bit red make sure you're not bleeding when you do this we have like a cover ECE over / ugly secret that Robert so here is my apple fritter

market", "lOQDiN6scdI": "[Music] hey guys what's up good morning happy thursday drive through thursday here at big jog tv thanks for watching thanks for tuning in thanks for tuning in that's right drive through thursdays we like to find what's hot new and trending in the world of fast food quick bites drive-throughs takeaways that that sort of thing right yeah exactly because of big draw tv we're all about family and fun that's how we roll so we like to find new items to say facebook pages windows or restaurants that's the kind of stuff we're looking for the new stuff and mcdonald's has got some new stuff right now yes they do right so mcdonald's has been really working on their mccafe lineup of coffees and drinks we don't we don't do those but we do these new items i got super excited because one of them is like a really big favorite of mine there you see that what's that say what's that say gal that there we go there it is way to focus there they've got new bakery items that have only been out for a couple of weeks and so they are still fairly new now the family you know you see that look right there it's because i got the family up and going a little bit early on the weekend morning and you'll notice there's only three because the fourth wouldn't get better still asleep when i was i didn't i don't do tons of research before we come to check things out i thought these items were available only in the morning time but according to that bag they're available all day so we didn't have to necessarily get up first thing in the morning to come do this but the early bird gets the worm or it's a good start to our morning so or in this case the pastries yeah we're talking pastries we're talking some baked goods from mcdonald's and it it legit smells like a bakery in here right now it smells like you walked into a donut shop and i'm looking forward to eating it we've got three new items and there's three of us so we've each picked one i think they want you to have this one jamie got dibs he's gonna go you want to go first too yeah okay jamie has the new cinnamon roll look at this and this one is served warm yup this is the one of the three served worm it says loaded with cinnamon layered between buttery flaky pastry dough that is drizzled with a delicious cream cheese icing served warm the aroma alone sparks a craving for the next decadent bite talk about a reason to roll out of bed can i hold it for you here and have you come up here i just don't want you to drop it and we want you to sit closer and you need to be on camera otherwise hide in the back we get a piece doesn't do us any good now hold it for you yeah that's what we're afraid of pick it up hurry hurry it's okay thank you that smells good i did the cinnamon smell the frosting on there it can happen nipple it's a nice glazed coating but it doesn't seem super heavy super thick so you're not going over the top with sugar what do you think of that i'm gonna give the spoon my thumbs up are you like any complaints any issues no i just i like you know i just like it yeah i think it really benefits from being warm hey right now yeah do it it's all you yeah i think if it weren't warm it'd be a little bit more of a tough chew yeah but the warmth really creates like that melty uh pastry and the sugar on top of the gooeyness and the warmth tell you the inside bite that little the final inside that's gonna be heavenly so that's absolutely delicious but a little messy you're gonna finish it go ahead let's tell you if you want to scoot over just a hair they can still see you munching back there but hey don't drop it all right jessica's gonna go next she has got the brand new blueberry muffin our new recipe is baked with real blueberries on top of the streusel crumb topping making for a crave-worthy soft and fluffy muffin feeling blue all day never tasted so good let me lean out of the way there you go all right so it's got the fancy paper not just the regular muffin so like i feel like i'm at a fruitful place fancy schmancy it smells like blueberry it's got like cuts down into the side of it the way it's baked so like you can pull it apart but maybe that's the where the ridges are from um i wish this one was warmed a little bit i think that would be good too like however they're warming the cinnamon roll might as well warm everything up because i think most pastries are better hold up slightly warm right smell i can really smell the blueberries in here it smells fantastic good texture to the muffin good flavor definitely blueberry flavor you want some sure thanks um the streusel on top is not there's not too much of it but the flavor on this is good this doesn't taste like fast food no that would come from a bakery shop that would come from you know a coffee shop whatever you want to call it blueberry flavor the crumb topping's not over the top sweet the whole muffin itself is not overly sweet that's nice so i like this this is a winner thumbs up from you that bite i had was tasty as well and jamie have you finished that just about all right and the last new item i will be on because it's one of my favorite things anytime i go to a donut shop this is my go-to item the apple fritter a classic fritter made with cinnamon and apples this hand held treat is fried to a golden brown and drizzled with a sweet glazed icing check that other there we go there we go so it is this one's messy i think it's just about as messy as the cinnamon roll was because it does have a bit of a glaze to it i think it's a nice serving size sometimes you get fritters in donut shops that are like as big as your head yeah and they're like sickly sweet yeah and doughy in the center because they're so huge like i'm assuming these are being baked somewhere off premises and then reheated and kept here right i don't know but [Music] i'm not are you you want it no you can have it buddy thank you though so there's bits of apple in here that's what i was checking there's a great layer of cinnamon flavor in there that's fantastic um it is fully glazed top and bottom but it's not super sweet still it is the sweetest of the three i think so i was gonna say cinnamon roll fritter blueberry in sweetness level going down yeah you're right you're right yours is the sweetest yeah yeah um the apple flavor in here is fantastic the cinnamon flavor is really good overall it's a great chew done well the apple pieces are fairly small so you don't get big chunks of apple but there's lots of small chunks you good for now somebody wants a big here you need a napkin baby so yeah again apple fritters are my favorite my go-to at a donut shop that's what i get and this one is on par at with any other donut shop tell us if you've had it yet right all these items comment down below if you've had them um let's bring up real quick the prices just to share what we paid for them um they're not necessarily cheap but these are also typically premium items at a donut shop also that is true so the uh apple fritter is two dollars and thirty nine cents jamie cinnamon roll was two dollars and sixty nine cents and jessica's was two dollars and nineteen cents not horrible not horrible like it's like we said if you go get an apple fritter to donut shop you're paying more than just a donut right and jamie's cinnamon roll had a lot to it plus all the extra frosting and it was a decent size i love making those yeah making cinnamon rolls is fun i think the prices are a little bit high for a fast food joint yeah and that's but their flavors are good but that also could just be our area because we pay more for everything around here but the flavors on these are fantastic no complaints so uh comment down below if you've tried these before and your thoughts on them have you had them right have you which is your favorite let's say comment down below your favorite donut ooh in general in general i like uh the

guys need to check this out they are bomb", "LwdrN3IGMwI": "yo what is up youtube this is friend of a dude and this is a little update here of the reset of my 3x3 tent with a growers choice 315 ceramic metal halide and yeah this is going to be day one of veg the reset as you can see the setup is a little different than last round I'll go ahead and talk through real quick what I've changed everything up here the top half all the wiring and all that it's pretty much the same we got the timer for the regular light and then I also have this timer here which controls these side lights as you can see now these are I believe I forget I think they're 20 no they're 50 watts I think each doesn't stay on the back I forget at this point but they're either 25 or 50 watts each LEDs full-spectrum so that's gonna be my side lighting for when everything gets a little bushier to really try and implement some side lights so we got that all hooked up to timers and then I also added a little fan here I had another fan that broke on me I was using before but uh something simple have a little system here so I can raise it up with this ratchet and change the height and moving forward there is that right there which is the sensor Pro for this controller I have this laying around from some previous growths this is the Saturn 6 environmental controller it controls cooling co2 humidity so I get that right yeah so anyways I'm only using that for one reason and that is for this which right off the bat you might think that is super overkill and you are totally correct this thing right here is for like a main like a big room this can do like 500 square feet I think so anyways a definitely overkill but I'll had it lying around and it was either use this humidifier or use the smaller community I have which you have to refill once a day so I opted in for this one because it has this feed line for ro which outside the tent so my whole room here is a little mess it's kind of a extra room but I have my ro over there coming in from the outside actually from the garden hose going in inside here I have a float valve and then here is the water line this will go down and feed to the humidifier so this round I'm gonna be using humidity as you can see it's not hooked up right now 47% community 77 degrees I'm gonna give them probably a little bit of a week I don't want to jump in it too quick but I'm really excited the only downside is the placement obviously it sucks I was originally put it underneath and I had the idea that I would just spray out towards the wall in the humidity would just rise because of my fan at the top there which actually pulls air out and that is set up let me show you real quick on this variable speed controller on a super low setting you actually can't even hear it that's how low it is but it's on so it's on at the like literally the lowest setting possible when I shut the tent I barely even have a negative vacuum coming down here have this cool intake bin which is just a small fan nothing strong with any needs and that just runs from this duct with this rag over it that's my dust protection I actually forgot to clean it from last round so so dirty but anyways that's getting cool air from the floor and that's pushing hot air out so anyways I'm back to the original point my idea was to put this underneath but it really wasn't working out at all I mean I was just soaking everything that's below here with water and it wasn't working so let me explain real quick here we have this reservoir which I had designs pretty basic that is my pump right here and then there's the timer that controls the pump I can set multiple settings on that timer and second intervals which is nice so I can water my plants by the second so in here it's pretty simple get the pH meter the blue lab if we go in there there's the pump it runs up to the tick valve it's hard to see but then there's a and it goes out the back through this tube which runs around back to the front connects into all the automated watering so this is the watering system and then I have in the back behind there and a air pump which is feeding these air stones in there so that is the whole setup like I said it's a pretty basic it might seem complicated to some people but if you know anything about this stuff very very basic so that's kind of the whole setup and a nutshell we're doing cocoa again I did actually a perlite blend so I added perlite in I just water - I'm doing a hand watering for now so I can control everything so yeah that's basically it this is just the start of the new series while all these plants right here are apple fritter I loved it so much that I just want to do a whole tenth of it so my plan for the future by the way is once I get the canopy higher I'd like to grow the canopy over this a little bit being that this shoots humidity out towards this wall you know I'm hoping I can avoid any issues with mold or anything like that but anyways I'll keep you posted on the future right now we're running at 190 watts just transplanted so I'm gonna keep it there for another day and then just do some gradual increasing um don't want to stress the plants out want to give them their proper time to adjust and see how everything goes so I think that's it for now I kind of explain the whole tent and also I just want to throw in real quick I did get a meter that calculates how much electricity I'm pulling and it's actually right here and I did some tests and under my current electric rate here in San Diego this 3x3 tent with everything it is once at 315 watts and a humidifier is going and everything it is only gonna run me for approximately 40 or 50 dollars a month so that's not bad at all so I'm really stoked to have a nice cheap legit little grill so on that note I'm gonna end it until the next video feel free to ask questions comment subscribe you know let me know what I'm doing wrong I always appreciate any advice so that know everyone have a great day and I'll do another update very soon these [Music]", "1UqbP_LEpHs": "[Music] hi everybody hey guys and welcome back to the easy family channel today we're gonna be showing you how to make an apple fritter Oh No using our Herbalife products so honestly guys Oh mill I usually don't like it at all like honestly don't like texture don't like how it tastes but this is the one of them that I will literally eat one of the only ones I like one of the only ones don't make me eat when I go out to work out before it's really nice really Hardy especially before work or working out but honestly it doesn't even taste like oatmeal to me it's like a nice little Apple kind of fritter a little taste to me so it's really really good but to get on with it these are the products were gonna use today Brittney's Herbalife protein drink mix in vanilla and that's where you get all your protein end and then an apple fiber complex and like my one of my family member says two scoops make you poop I mean of course but it's really good for you honestly and of course you can't have any oatmeal without you oh yeah now first you can use any oats but these are the ones that we prefer if you like them and of course just to make it a little bit sweeter and my sir we got our cinnamon so Justin pizzazz and this is how you make it okay everybody this is what we're going to be starting off with today we have our Herbalife protein on drink mix in the flavor vanilla [Music] and we have half a teaspoon 1/2 a cup in 1/4 cup now if you have an urban just boom go ahead and use it but if you don't have its 1 tablespoon is our opening now with our oat now we're going to be taking 1 ours is no sound but that's how you know when you eat all this ok the next thing we're going to be using is our Apple fiber now this is super good because it has more fiber than 1 it also keeps you regular you have digestive problems like go to the bathroom during my surgery yes we're in for your loved ones are at the hospital it's going to be perfect for them or the people that can't move around a lot it's good this is gonna be the miracle worker for them especially cuz you know after surgery either gone coupie one of the two yeah and that just means it has a great source of fiber and it has zero sugar even though it tastes sweet it has zero sugar so if you have any diabetics at home this is a perfect like oatmeal if they want something sweet but they don't want their sugars to race so the next thing we're gonna do is use our protein drink mix it's pretty empty this is because we use it all the time but we're going to use two scoops today because we're making it for my brother and what's great about our protein drink mix is it also feeds in girls muscles and this is what keeps you full protein is what keeps you full and it grows your muscles then I say we're gonna be doing a cinnamon just because it's even your apple fritter was out and that's gonna be your hobbies well now once it's all in there we're going to do they're probably gonna add just a little bit more of hot water since we do have a lot of powder in here since we're making it for my brother and then we're just gonna put a plate on top see it not boil but you know cook and that's it [Music] you", "ba0MYvl3gQQ": "[Music] the riches trying to stay whoa penny for my thoughts i get paid for quotes these pennies on my feet i see you taking those decided to get my oblique to make you float told me i might get hung i [Music] [Music] [ __ ] wanna come to cali [ __ ] sit up [Music] keep my vision clear", "LieQ_KLf8cU": "hello today we're talking all about apples right because we're in the season of fall and nothing to me says fall more than apples and we're making something super fun today we're making apple fritters is that my dog again he just always wants a cameo doesn't he okay so let's get started on our fun fall outfit today's recipe calls for very minimal ingredients you will need water butter granulated sugar confectioners sugar cinnamon vanilla enough apples to make one cup so about two and a can of refrigerated biscuits the flaky layers are the best let's get started on a really fun fault our recipe calls for us to preheat the oven to 350 degrees so that's going to be my first step next next a recipe calls for us to chop um one cup of apples so before i get started i'm going to make sure that my apples are chopped so i'm ready to go and it'll be easy for me okay so i told you that we needed to prep the apple first right because it's always good to make sure we have our mies in place everything in its place before we get started and we need one cup of chopped apple which is roughly depending on your apple size about one apple so you're going to want to peel it and remember when we're peeling we want to peel away from ourselves right because we don't want to get our fingers that wouldn't feel very good with it so we're going to peel this whole apple and you sometimes might see a little bruise like that that's not that big of a deal you can cut that out or just give it a little extra flavor okay so an apple has a core in the middle and that's going to be where all the seeds are but we don't want that when we cut it so you have something called an apple core which you put in the middle and it pulls it out i don't have one of those because i'm not really a gadget kind of person but i'm going to show you how you can do it without it okay so what we can do right now is we're going to cut it down the middle okay just down the middle okay so you see all the seeds right here right see all those seeds we don't want all of that in there okay now we want it on a flat surface we'll cut it down again we'll cut it down again okay and then what we're going to do is once we do that we'll cut around the core so see we have this little kind of core piece right there we're just going to cut that right off yeah easy breezy nothing squeezy okay okay so i've cut out all the core and now i'm going to show you how to very carefully chop the apple into kind of bite-sized pieces okay now i want you to remember that when we're using a knife we should always have an adult with us have permission from our parents and we've used all of our safety training that we've worked really hard on okay so we're going to hold our knife really correctly right like this okay and now their core is out i'm going to cut it down the middle and i can just put my hand right on top and that makes assures me that my fingers aren't going to get in the way i do that and i'm going to go one two three four okay we've got nice little chops right there perfect okay guys so i have my refrigerator biscuit here right okay and it's eight pieces so i've taken each one of the eight pieces we're gonna take each one of these biscuits and we're gonna cut it into little pieces okay so this is really cool is you can actually use scissors um to cut it and it makes it so much easier you don't have to worry about a knife but you want to use not like scissors that you're going to use your crafts with these are like kitchen scissors right but it makes it so much easier to get the job done you could also use a knife though too i don't want you to feel like you have to have that but it's always good to have a good pair of kitchen shears okay so we've cut our biscuit all the way into little bite-sized pieces and they're all roughly about the same size okay so i cut every biscuit into about 10 pieces okay it doesn't need to be precise but just kind of stick to that what we're going to do now is we're going to add two tablespoons of granulated sugar to our biscuits so one two of cinnamon just sprinkle that over okay and our hands are really clean so we can just kind of use our hands so think of like cinnamon sugar with biscuits and then we're gonna add those apples to this oh my gosh you guys it's gonna be so good okay we're gonna add one cup of apples to our mixture you can use a spoon or your hand they're not going to stick completely together and that's okay you're going to see what we do when you put them into a shape okay so you want to take a little like a little handful with your apples and we're just going to kind of mush it together a little bit but not until it's completely together okay and we're gonna put it down like that because fritters aren't they're supposed to be kind of like raggedy edges right it's not perfect by any means let's tuck those in there and we'll just keep going okay so we've got all of our fritters on our parchment lined cookie sheet and i melted two tablespoons of butter what i'm gonna do right now is i'm gonna drizzle because we're not deep frying these we're gonna bake these instead so they're a little bit healthier for us they're still a treat but they're a little healthier for us but we still want kind of that kind of crunch and deliciousness that it gives us when we fry it so we're going to add a little bit of butter to each one of these then we're going to bake it in that 350 degree oven for about 14 to 17 minutes we're gonna always check it at the lowest temperature first right so we're going to check it at what time at what time the 14 minute mark right that's what i'm gonna set my timer for okay that looks good let's pop this making off it's always good to make sure that the next step is already done right so i'm always thinking ahead to my next step my next step is to make the glaze so that when those come out and they're cooling my glaze is already done so to make this glaze is super easy it's going to be not a thick glaze like we would normally do with a frosting it's going to be really thin we need 1 and 1 4 cups of powdered sugar add 1 4 teaspoon of vanilla extract to it which is the smallest of our spoon measurements okay so that's gonna give it that good flavor that we like and we're gonna add about three to six teaspoons so we're gonna start off with three so i'm gonna do actually that's a half teaspoon i'm glad i cut that so we need one two three we're gonna use our whisk and we're gonna kind of look and see does our does our glaze need more water so it's super thick right now right that's too thick for what i'd want to put on there so i'm going to add two more teaspoons to thin it out see how it's already getting thin okay and we want to make sure that we don't have any lumps or clumps in there so i'm looking at this oh yeah that's a perfect consistency that'll be good on top of our donuts okay so i took these out at 14 minutes i was very careful and used my oven mitt when i took them out right and so and now that they've completely cooled i'm going to put some of my delicious glaze on top oh my gosh i think we'll be able to eat those guys what do you think it was so fun cooking with you guys today i had fun making another fall treat and i can't wait to see you next week bye",

dude taco bell what the what the figure it out man that's all i gotta say okay but here we are it's the apple fritter i mean first glance it looks pretty good but like i said it's like just you know dough mixed with apple pieces and stuff so like it can't be that hard to make it smells delightful let's give it a shot i mean listen when a cinnamon sugar apple it's going to taste good and this does taste pretty good like like i said before there's apple pieces in there that's fire um but yeah you can definitely tell this like was made like i don't know when like it's a little stale but it's not horrible probably so you're joining um now listen let me see oh come on gosh um like it doesn't compare to a like a donut shops you know apple fritter absolutely not like not even clothes but i mean is it good for a fast food one yeah i mean it's good a little disappointing but it's not bad at all by any means hopefully it's the most disappointing thing that happens today am i right guys i can

review of three more flavors from the Zen vapor they're manufactured out of Delaware I want to give a big shout out to mr. Don Thompson you're the man thank you so much for sending them my way to review I greatly appreciate it a 60 ml bottle is $17.99 120 ml bottle such as this is going to be twenty eight dollars and ninety nine cents and a 200 ml bottle just like this is gonna cost forty three dollars and ninety nine cents they also set up a coupon code for you guys my subscribers that's right if you want to get ten percent off your order use the KJ Andy oak code alright kj8 and dy o make sure to use an O not a zero and you get ten percent off the pretty much already low prices alright so the shipping I had it a 60 ml bottle to my cart just to do a fake check out and it looks like it's gonna be seven dollars for shipping which is the cost of standard Priority Mail these days the ratio differs on each flavor so I'll mention it as I go over each flavor nicotine strengths available are 0 1 point 5 3 & 6 milligrams I have mine in 3 milligrams that's what I prefer there's 16 different flavors in the product line I'm gonna review three of them today and they include apple fritter Nirvana and zazen that's right and the flavor intensity I would say is like moderates a slightly above moderate okay I mean it's like right in the middle there right smack dab in the middle there definitely all day vape so you're not going to get sick of these flavors I've been vaping them well all day and all day and all day for like weeks now just awesome stuff they also come pre steep there is a born date on each bottle here's a look at one of the bottles okay and they're definitely coiling cotton friendly I snapped a picture earlier so it would do some justice here's what it looks like you can purchase these flavors by visiting www.disabilitydenials.com for sweet gooey cinnamon apples in a cross between a doughnut and a cinnamon roll light sugary glaze on top of it all this delicious juice complements your morning coffee your 3:00 p.m. afternoon snack or that dessert you're hiding in the back of the fridge until everyone's asleep this one is an 80/20 blend a TVG 20 PG let's go ahead and do a smell check oh man this stuff smells just like an apple fritter would taste you know seriously it's right here in an illiquid and I'm smelling I'm smelling like baked apples I'm smelling cinnamon smelling a little bit of pastry and definitely there's like a sweetness that goes along with it but it's not overly sweetened or anything like that it's definitely coiling cotton friendly as I mentioned alright let's do a taste test I'm getting like baked apples cinnamon as it's soaking in a little bit more some pastry and like I said there's like a sugary glaze but it's not artificial sweetners sugar I'm not detecting any of that it's not like that at all alright all right so I have apple fritter loaded in the Alliance version 2 RDA on top of the X taste I got some staggered views Clapton's in there and here we go Wow love this flavor it's so good and I don't even usually like apple flavors I tell you okay this one actually has a slight throat get tuned and I'm sure it's because the cinnamon okay at least that's the way it is for me everyone reacts different to cinnamon you know but it's not enough for its making me cough or anything like that definitely buttery smooth out the nose nothing burning or peppery definitely good quality ingredients in nicotine I'll say that all right so on the way in on the way in I'm mostly getting a baked apple taste there may be like add little touch of cinnamon barely but it's mostly like a baked apple taste that's the way I'm tasting you know these and on the way out the Apple right as you're tasting the Apple the cinnamon is there they both last the duration of the vape and that pastry is there in the back notes and also there's like a little bit of that sugary glaze as well and like I said it's not coming across as an artificial sweetener not at all I mean it's like the real deal right here and it's not overly sweet okay so when I see sweet don't expect like a bunch of sugar or a bunch of sweetness like that it's not like that this flavor is so well-balanced and so perfect that I'm giving it a kjn do labor baby no 5 out of 5 stars is the best apple fritter type juice I've had yet I mean seriously I know I've had a couple along the way in my vaping time but this one definitely is like the best so that being said let's move onto the next flavor right about now the next flavor I'm gonna go over is Nirvana I love this stuff right here and the description reads transcending into another realm of existence you get a big mouthful of sweet ripe strawberries mixed into my rich layered and decadent Zen custard you might want to get two bottles of this addictive vape so you can let one steep while vaping the other strawberry custard has never tasted this real ever that's a high claim right and it's a 70/30 blend on this one and just just to let you know right up front I thoroughly enjoy this liquid look how far down I am in the bottle that's more than halfway gone and I've had these maybe a couple weeks you know and I sample all kinds of different flavors anyhow I love this stuff enough said let's do a smell check yeah I'm getting like ripe strawberries I'm getting that awesome Zen custard it's a little bit vanilla type it's got a creaminess to it it's just so good smelling and let's do a taste test yeah definitely ripe strawberries definitely that awesome Zen custard right there so good okay so this one I have loaded sorry a little unprepared right here this one I have loaded in the Zephyr Big Buddha v2 RDA on top of the ghost alive for 160 I installed some aliens in here and I'm at 125 watts and here we go totally smooth on the throat smooth out the nose exhale let's do a live impressions of what I'm getting on the way in and out here we go on the way and it's mostly the ripe strawberries there's like a faint hint of that custard there but it's mostly ripe strawberries on the way out the ripe strawberries are up front the Zen custard follows right behind it that would be like way after it like you're tasting the ripe strawberries and then as you're tasting it mixed with it through the whole exhale is the Zen custard totally good stuff and not only that I have this flavor loaded in the Omega BFT I decided to break out this tank I haven't broke it out for a while and I got some staggered views Clapton's in here I met 0.16 resistance hundred watts here we go with this I'm getting pretty much the same thing and maybe a little more muted it's a tank not a dripper you know but it's really good really bang in flavor and I'm giving it a kgm you know 5 out of 5 phenomenal stuff right here I love it and you're gonna love it to you as long as you love this flavor profile that being said on the last and final flavor we go right about now the last and final flavor I'm going to go over is Zossen that's right zazen I hope I'm saying it right this time damn it haha alright so the description reads deep meditation while sitting in the lotus position imagine the taste of the milk left over after eating several bowls of your favorite Fruity Pebbles cereal this rich creamy surreal babe is deceptively delicious this one is a 70/30 blend okay so that's 70 VG 30 PG and let's do a smell check yeah the fruity pebbles is there but it's a little bit more relaxed and set back okay it's not like in your face it's not in your face citrus notes or anything like that I mean it's just the way fruity pebbles like if you took all the fruity pebbles and smashed them together they're right here I am getting citrus notes but there's not any which one of them that are more distinguishable than another okay I mean it's not like screaming lemon it's not screaming orange I mean everything is just like so well-balanced okay and then there's that creaminess that's definitely got a nice milky presence to it alright let's do a taste test yeah fruity pebbles definitely and then that milk it's like so well balanced like I said it's like it like almost half and half but it's like a little bit relaxed with the fruity pebbles that's the way I like it at least you know I don't like those ones that are like heavy lemon in your ol face you know not even alright so this one I got loaded in the twisted messes squared on top of the limitless box and I have some half staggered fuse Clapton's in there resistance is 0.15 I'm at a hundred watts and here we go totally smooth on the throat smooth out the nose exhale on the way in on the way and I'm mostly getting a Fruity Pebbles cereal type of notes there's a little bit of milkiness presence there there really is and on the way out the fruity pebbles hits you right up front and as you're tasting it you get this nice creamy milky presence okay it's definitely like the bottom of a bowl of Fruity Pebbles after a couple bowls just like you mentioned okay it's not like it's just fruity pebbles and then there's a little milk it's like so combined and well balanced together I know where I'm at I'm giving it again a kjnt of labor income five out of five all day and all night these flavors are just bangin good stuff anyone that's tried the Zen before they're pretty much gonna agree you know let's go on to the vapor production test right about now brother vapor production test I'm gonna go with the omega BFT tank fisting puts out a lot of clouded you know and I got Nirvana loaded in here it's a 70/30 okay I mean you could just tell that my room is getting all kinds of foggy in here okay here we go I'm gonna do in this way one that way and let's do it nice dense clouds they drop down they definitely linger in the air mmm sorry a lot of vapor there is getting me a little it's like a little bit choked up all right here's one for you guys out there in YouTube land clouds up more than any 70/30 juice I've had I mean there may be a few exceptions but definitely it'll over exceed your expectations of a 70/30 and I'm giving nirvana actually all these flavors I mean one of them is in 8020 it'll perform a little bit more but I'm giving him a kjn do paper for that you know four and a half out of five that's what I feel it deserves all right so you guys if you haven't tried the Zen vapor visit www.sap.com/learnbi birth at was apple fritter Nirvana and Zossen go check them out folks totally can't say enough good words I totally recommend them get yours today don't delay and that about sums it up I'm gonna bolt out of here you guys have a stellar day be excellent to each other and most of all remember me I'm KJ Ann do

uh cinnamon roll a blueberry muffin with streusel topping and an apple fritter app fritter i'm really excited about that's what we're going for today the apple printer [Music] not very big doesn't seem very big i do appreciate a little extra packaging the cafe look at this thing what size of a doughnut it looks good but is that the not the smallest apple fritter you've ever seen it's about um 250 something like it's right around 250 should be way bigger smells good though smells fall autumnal i know words mmm right off the bat big pieces of apple oh i like an apple fritter i really like cherry fritters but everybody always makes apple mmm this is extremely similar in any cinnamon any seminal sweet but with all that cinnamon it helps that's really good bite gam right where mcdonald's is right behind us so everything's supposedly fresh i don't know but that's the apple fritter it's a little small i'm gonna say that's gonna hurt them something you know in the picture it looked a lot bigger apple fritters need to be about yay big come on donald come on you know what and that's gonna hurt the score it tastes really good maybe a little on the sweet side [Music] but it's too small so for the fritter i already did the blueberry muffin that was like a nine this one gets like an 8.1 just for the size man flavor was delicious but you got to give us a bigger fretter we know our

gas station and they've been putting out a lot of different donuts lately a couple new ones every month I'm appreciating they're branching out and being creative with their Donuts some of them have been amazing and not even just donuts pretzels to just their food products what's it necessarily big on the horchata donut that they had last month but they had this this is an apple fritter this is a caramel apple fritter caramel sauce on top oh my god the saying it is the size of my face kind of looks like a mask crazy there's probably like 3,000 calories in this but I don't care it's blonde December I'm excited to try this that part was kind of crunchy house fried too long this is definitely going to need a glass of milk I'm gonna go inside and eat this once I could do my videos outside because the lighting is so much better the lighting in my place is pretty terrible but come with me on this ridiculously oversized caramel apple fritter adventure and sure to be tasty okay so I finally got my glass of milk in my monstrosity my Apple monstrosity sorry the lighting in my place is so poor so lighting in here sucks things ridiculous look at this great I got my cat's attention now I don't know if it's that they're all like this or just this one I think this one was really well done like it was fried too long it's very crispy it's kind of weird milk definitely helps for sure it was pretty because it was so bright it was really dry if it was between this and a regular apple fritter I would just go with the regular apple fritter I don't know if all the extra caramel icing is necessary I think it's good I would definitely want to turn it down it's just why mess with perfection I give it a 7 out of 10 what do you give it mr. whiskers what that's so weird you sounds

bagel one of my favorites still can't get over that all right guys next up is the fritter it's apple fritter it looks delicious it smells so good very good i will say the blueberry muffin after eating the blueberry muffin the fruit is a little bit of a letdown but it's still really really good for an apple fur um you get the cinnamon you get the nice glaze on top little chunks of apple the dough isn't like it's a normal like fritter dough kind of chewy dense now guys this cinnamon roll they heated it up look at that oh my word smells like butter and frosting [Music] all the good things they used to have cinnamon and those were fantastic this is obviously not as uh cinnamony as those it's like light on the cinnamon if you can see guys that is so good it's buttery and then you get that frosting it is really light on the cinnamon though i will say that but it's still really good cinnamon that's so good these weren't badly priced either i think it's nice because my kids aren't huge on like breakfast sandwiches but they love muffins they love cinnamon rolls they love donuts all the above yes please these are fantastic i am super impressed i will say oh yep that's how you tell if it's a good cinnamon roll or not the center center has just the right amount of view 10 out of 10 across the board super impressed mcdonald's you redeemed yourself for taking the steak and cheese bagel off your menu i don't know if that's everywhere at least here in wisconsin and iowa we didn't see it on our menu anymore thank you to the you know the lovely pandemic we have going on but with

subscribed that's why I hit that Bell notification give you a big thumbs up and that further ado let's get started we have six fritters here from six different locations we got Publix Wawa Dunkin Walmart winn-dixie and then a local place called Pullman one if you don't have a Publix in your area I'm so sorry a lot of these are like southern places you don't have the wall wash you don't have the Publix is might not even have the winn-dixie don't have a winn-dixie you're not really missing much so we just started Publix so all these fritters are day-old by the looks like got them yesterday so it's all even so con first administration low-scale yeah that's so pretty soft annoys ya glaze on it the glaze isn't runny so that's always been a good start very ugly almost to a police but it's not that well on the scale of one to ten what would you give that mm all right so we gotta figure out what we're gonna read it on probably flavor texture weighs probably so what do you think [Music] close the first one I'm thinking that's probably the six the Apple flavoring was kind of overpowered almost like texture what's his a old so you gotta take that like factoring that out I think had a pretty good though moisten a soft like that like this are we doing point five or just kind of like but I wasn't gonna need Dutch yeah and then what's the last thing glaze glaze quality of the glaze didn't have its own flavor but the it held up it wasn't soggy it wasn't overly crusty or anything that's a good glaze I'm just like looking at the other ones and comparing our any and that one kind like it looked like the best one it looks like the best one because they like it looks separate and it looks like flaky doesn't work like it's soaking game I'm looking at the whole morning [Music] our next one is hole-in-one I'm excited for this one guys this one's pretty hard oh yeah like it might have not held up on the inside it's like actually maybe I didn't get a very good bike but the glaze seems nice [Music] so that one is replaced what about her what if it wasn't that's separate texture I didn't like the texture because it was super hard yeah it was also the outside piece yeah it was hard until you started chewing and then it broke down pretty nicely I did enjoy the crunch personally yeah yeah it felt like it was fried really well I don't know what might have been baked suffered extra I would because I liked the public's texture better and then glaze quality nothing to complain about but once again it's like a whole one has like its distinct glaze it's like a really sweet but it's set hard it doesn't like soak in and it doesn't like its own ya have to go with if the glaze republic's close to seven it's not a slightly better this episode sponsor about hole-in-one donuts alright the next time to Wawa this one is a gas station that's all they were mostly myself if you're in the Ohio area you probably have one similar is all the skeeters or something like that I don't know if you live in Ohio I'm sorry but alright so first impressions it's soft the glaze was like soap in cigarettes at us but it's like a hard glaive as well in some of the places that no this might be too big of a bite for me we can do it I believe [Music] like not picked all the way I'm gonna taste really Joey it tastes like funnel cake not too great that was surprisingly underwhelming like that was um number two on the list apparently you're not missing out too much on the breathable in the star the show anyway necessarily have onto seven but we can have you ever seen Shane Dawson Oh oh that's a shame Dawson I'm gonna start roasting all you youtubers show all shout out Jake Paul shout out h3h3 shout out a non-autistic youtuber shall Bruno moves David don't shout out any of those who cares about those those low ballers you feel me anyway oh we're back back to the rating the wah wah wah no she's very underwhelming so we'll start with the flavor which was very doughy and very non apple fritter yeah but like not in a good way like the hole in one one with my like I don't ever like it was a good thing it was like a cinnamon doughnut yeah and this one is more like a funnel cake that was undercooked so we're gonna go with for me if public tunnels are 5 and this one's definitely gotta be at 3 [Music] good well it was a gave a little bit of flavor to it like a little bit of Sabrina so we'll do it too next one is the winn-dixie one this one is looking pretty similar to the one I had nervous about this huh this one's a little soggy feeling for me so when I went to go get this one I was like do you guys have apple fritters and she was like yeah I'm pulling them out of the freezer right now and so she gave us meat frozen it she was like I lived a big brush but they don't think I'm fun taxes so that's a little background on the same thing that happens at Walmart you ever walked into Walmart and feel the bottom of these things they're always cold [Music] it's like ceremony but it's weird it's like different it's that artificial apple flavor oh yeah disgust no I know it's artificial but it's pretty good like I am not bothered right see this is what's wrong with Americans you taste something artificial and listen I'm not saying it's fine but it tastes good okay that's that's bomb on my list right there I thought what was bad at least we're gonna have a conflict opinions on this one so I liked the flavor okay they like cinnamon he had like green apples a little bit I only got green apple suckers Oh hmm that's a two for me fam ooh I think it's gonna have to be better than the public's one yeah so we're gonna go out and do a 6.5 I think I'm just gonna go some fun ones with texture this off I think it wasn't though inna didn't pass out there cook so I think it'll also be higher than the Wawa was like you don't an apple fritter and a glass of water for a couple seconds ways which is a separate category but the glaze was soaked in and there was a way and the bottom of the fritter was like you could put your finger through it if you put any type of pressure your analysis is so much more eloquent than I do not that's gonna be two for me again okay the case of the glaze may be bigger sugar your violet but the sight of the glaze is a picture of the place so we're gonna have to go with 225 Timur so the woman has made the same ways the winn-dixie weren't apparently but the glaze looks much better quality I gave actually on top of the fritter instead of inside you use this a little bit wet though okay if you gave this to me and didn't say what it was I would not guess it was a matter I would say it's a City Hall mm-hm looking for a predates in the mineral so it's like there's no app on the back end there's an apple tastes like I feel a slight one I think I feel like if you just sit there and eat the entire thing there will be like an apple taste which is good but I'm gonna give it the same public I gave public six so this is gonna be applied for me not a big fan of pre-made cinnamon rolls you got the tango again fresh out of the oven extra decently soft kind of giving me the winn-dixie vibe but it's definitely not a fresh apple fritter it's probably made in like 1970 and they kept in the Deep Freeze for a couple of decades this was gone the Walmart to buy a Apple fair honestly I think this was just like it's just like a half-assed fritter but it was not bad so I think I'm just gonna go with a pipe again which we was started with the Wawa one so we everything would be based higher no that's the worst one we can keep going up glazed nonexistent even though there was glaze on it sitting on the top it was singing on the top but it was like it was like hard water interface that's gonna be another it wasn't star the show moving on seminary standards it wasn't very good it was an apple fritter quality glaze and it wasn't cinnamon or morning boys I'd say it was better than while one winn-dixie but public standards so I guess we'll just go to five again oh no but it's like less than five so I think I'll go for and last but not least we have the classic Dunkin Donuts this one's actually build a couple feelings so this is the new bus she's a little biased listen I don't work there anymore come on today my last day I've hadn't heard it before but it's been a while so so the glaze is like it kind of looks like a like a croissant yeah there's more on your initial initial feelings of it it's more like a stuff done at that point we'll see that's pretty good the only quick teeth I will talk about it is that the Apple it's separate from the cinnamon because the so like the way that we make the Apple produce is that the applicator comes to us and then we put a feeling inside of it it's like an apple pie filling yeah we have it in our apple spice donuts as well so of the cinnamon seems to be like really actually like cinnamon II like it seems to be like that the fritter was made and then the cinnamon was put on top and then the Apple was put inside so they all came together a little harmonious little what's the word symphony yeah symphony of flavors sponsored by Duncan it's like a it's like a little song inside of the so I say the flavor would be better than winn-dixie but still not up to Lebanon standards so go with me oh wow I might be a little biased I agree that the flavors were a lot better than a lot of these ones I'd give a 7.5 just because I'm not a dunking stand usually Starbucks Starbucks boy hey if you need a cold brew go to the Starbucks we can't get that bad guys all right not texture very good texture the dough is soft but cooked thoroughly Glades ladies gave us some crunch to it I'm a sucker for those Apple filled doughnuts because it's about catch our next video which I would give the texture and I think I'm gonna throw on the opposite end for this one it was almost the best because I did like the film actually changed my answer because I don't like how it's filled with apple apple filling okay should've been it show them baked into it okay so that's actually a six because it sits on that territory of it being a stuffed doughnut instead of an apple fritter we're getting into semantics here about whatever we have we have our own scale that changes as we go so I guess protect her for me I like that it was filled I liked that all the flavors were like they came together but they all have their own texture and I came with it you know I'd say that it was so cool with one standard so I'm about the second finally the glaze glaze it was like flaky it was like so you know that mean we're like the glaze and then on to the trampoline of ice on it sure yes well better I love that mean it's like that it's like I says you bite into it just like everything just like falls or falls off mm-hmm I don't like I was observing yours and I'm gonna factor that into mine mm-hmm I like to Oh give it a uh Lea 7 those are good goals and for it so for mine specifically to plan so much glaze on it so but for yours it looked really good so I'm gonna finally like combine those and if : one was the best which I think it was for the glaze for sure then all right so now we're gonna number one for each of us specifically was which I was surprised actually because it was so hard but you bite into it and then it's not so it's like I knew I was gonna win as soon as I saw it you know it is sponsored by rolling on by the way so holding on was the first and then for me Duncan was the second mmm but her family Publix is the second which I think there's a little bit of bias to everything I think on your part there was some bias oh well all mine too yeah I'm a poets boy she's a Duncan girl so some grand alliance is going on the lowest now the lowest for him was the winn-dixie one with a father with the green apple flavor oh yeah cuz I love the green apple flavor but the lowest for me was the Wawa one because it was just it was doughy was undercooked : ones 48.5 and always so there is quite the disparity we kind of have like two different sides of the coin here with public holding on in the Duncan I'll being in one on one side and wah-wah Walmart and I'll be on the other side the highest overall out of all of us was holding one and the lowest for both of us overall was well maybe it's just like one batch but it's the one the first impression makes the most difference so now you have it if you're ever wondering where to get the best of the apple fritters we have the answer for you hole-in-one even though only people in like mid Florida happen so you guys are out of luck sorry so you know don't use Yelp hopes not going to tell you this information don't ask your friends what do they know we sat down had the most

superstore because there there was these pop-tarts bites that i've been looking for i had seen them at no frills a couple weeks ago but i wasn't paying about seven dollars i think that's what they're asking so they were on sale this week 498 at superstore i was also looking for the fiber one bars the lemon but there wasn't any left i mean the whole lemon section was they're all gone so i had grabbed these chocolate chip fiber one bars so these those are still going to be good i've only tried the cinnamon delights i haven't tried the chocolate chip but you know can't be chocolate chip right so i also got cheese because there were slices of cheese for 3.98 for like a pack of uh i'll show you guys these packs and they're like about think about 12 slices for like 3.98 i like these because these make great grilled cheeses and uh you know if i want a sandwich on the go really quick sandwich and i don't want to like slice cheese just take a slice of cheese it's real cheese cracker barrel uh sliced cheese so i got that i got a few other things besides the things that i've already marked down on my phone so i'll show you guys what i got this is just some of the things that i got so the other things are just refrigerated and i need to put the other things in the freezer i got meat but these are like the things that i got that wasn't needing you know refrigerating or freezer so let's start off with pop-tart bites these i've been looking for these are new family sizes 10 pouches and they're like 498 i think the whole box so i got that one and i got the strawberry one there was two flavors there's also the fiber one bars these are the chocolate chip cookie can't go wrong with that right remember these like as if it was like yesterday i you know i used to eat these when i was young i was like eight nine years old i remember these like it was like yesterday and these totally bring back memories total 90s if you guys remember these you definitely know these are total 90s i guess they got some life cereal but i'm hooked on these my girlfriend got me hooked on these strange because i never really liked them before and we needed a popcorn so i got a thing of popcorn for 278 for like six packs six bah uh six bags i should say nut packs six bags so that's pretty good so i got all these as far as non-refrigerating items i'm not sure you guys can all see this i always try to take a good video so i can create the thumbnail to the dollar store so i'm going to show you guys uh the things that i got from the dollar store a few things that i got from the dollar store because everything else is put away i don't feel like taking everything out i know i should have like brought the camera with me but i was so tired this morning that i just wanted to go to the store and get my things and get out i actually just came back from doing my newspapers i walked to do my newspapers today and i'm just exhausted i know lately i've been really tired lately so i'm gonna try

noticed i get a lot of acid reflux so it's like it doesn't really settle with my stomach so i try to have less coffee from tim warren's than mcdonald's big bottles i can drink all the time and not a problem i think it's because mcdonald's coffee is a lot smoother compared to tim hortons which is a lot stronger and i don't know it's just i think that's how i feel i mean what do you guys think you guys does it happen to you guys does that tim horns doesn't really settle with your stomach let me know if i'm the only one or if i'm not let me know it is 7 30 and i went to earlier to go get a coffee at tim hortons of course that coffee was really good what i would do is i would bring you guys a review on one of my favorite donuts from tim hortons and if you guys can guess it before i actually show you guys then you guys are awesome so my favorite donut or one of my favorite donuts is the apple fritter this is really good i'll have to try it for you guys look at that glaze that

another round reviews it's hard to get any more Canadian than Tim Hortons it's one of those things that is synonymous with Canada and it is getting to the point where they are sticking that name on everything literally everything new from Tim Hortons it's the apple fritter granola bars we'll also be checking it the salted caramel granola bar I'm starting to think tim has a Dede because he really cannot focus and has no idea what direction the head but hey good marketing is good marketing I bought them let's check out these two granola bars from Tim Hortons starting with the salted caramel and this is how the salted caramel Tim Hortons granola bar comes in the package pretty slick actually and this is what the salted caramel Tim Hortons canola bar looks like you had that salted caramel drizzle and a pretty nice-looking ran all of our actually this is actually smelling really good I wasn't going into this with much high expectations my mind has changed you know I really like the look of this has a great caramel smell and it's looking really appetizing I'm expecting something like a Quaker chewy bear but wood salted caramel let's check it in mm-hmm Wow you know what guys I thought this was just marketing but this actually has a really great salted caramel taste it's a pretty dense granola bar so it's not like a chewy Quaker I'm actually a little bit surprised by this maybe that lack of direction was actually going to pay out for them because this is really good nice hit of salt great caramel taste nice dense Carolla bar guys I'm into this you actually did a good job Jim what does Ron thing a new Tim Hortons salted caramel granola bar very surprised dense chew good hit of salt great caramel taste this is actually worth picking up guys Ron's giving the new Tim Hortons salted caramel nine is in I approve so if I was into that one I'm hoping for good things from an apple fritter I love apple fritter and this is how the apple fritter granola bar comes in the package and this is how the apple fritter granola bar looks like you can kind of see chunks of apple hints the cinnamon and once again been dense per NOLA it kind of smells like a cross between a fritter and an apple pie but I'm hoping for good things because that last hour really surprised me and I love apple fritters next to the cinnamon bun favorite pastries let's try out the apple fritter granola bar let's do it he's got vibes of it not bad this one isn't as dense as the salted caramel and I think that's because like the apple chunks they using it are like the fritter Apple chokes it's real Apple and you can tell definitely has the vibe of an apple fritter so I can't knock that what does Ron think of the apple fritter granola bar from Tim Hortons surprisingly it's not as good as the salted caramel but it got vibes in my favorite doughnut I think the texture and I'm an Apple Cinnamon guy so you know I like it Ron's giving the apple fritter her NOLA bar an 8 out of 10 I love me a fritter there we go a quick look at the two new granola bars from Tim Hortons salted caramel and the apple fritter well I would definitely strongly recommend the salted caramel you're not gonna be mad at the apple fritter either both of these are actually pretty solid granola bars I found these at Dominion so across Canada that's your Loblaws chain of stores spin another rod reviews and see you guys next time you", "NdmbvvZBkjc": "[Music] hey guys welcome to another west coast suite tour review i am here still with my friend riley from trippy hippie cannabis and today we're trying another washington brand k savage and this is their apple fritter and that is a beautiful looking nug lovely presentation i would say case savage is doing it right with the packaging big old windows so you can see what's going on the windows so key guys strain specific information on the top love that so don't make your uh don't make your streams live in a basement yeah i know i mean they're people want to see the sunlight from uv no i mean they don't want to see the sun i know that's why i correct myself that's actually not true but if we're talking about just seeing the nug from our perspective that's what we want okay guys this is a great example of fox tailing this is like what fox saline is you see that so i'm not i'm not gonna snap too hard on the growing style because this is a nutrient issue but it looks beautiful it looks beautiful she's got funky structure that's funky that could be heat too guys might be running you see fox in the hound right yeah cool we should bring out fox tails that's the first thing you think of this fox in the hound no it's instructions try not to cry guys go watch it smell are you getting apples get out look for some apples how about them apples oh man great great comedy over here guys not really a lot of apple yeah so hey maybe it'll be one of those sleeper apples you know yeah i mean the last one like you did yeah the last one tasted so much like apples check out the dosie dough by the white cross the dosy white by amber valley tasting like apples very confusing this is beautiful though it is beautiful and that's good trichome density that is really dark stigmas um potency on that one is testing like 28 too so it's a really good potency uh really good potency wise let's smoke here [Music] so um more information available at ksavage.com they don't have their social media on their label but they do proudly support the last prisoner project which is really cool to put on your label um do they hit that one yeah they do they support the world oh that's really cool yeah they're from tacoma washington tech town as some people call it some people tacoma shout out tacoma this is the west coast weed tour after all yes sia latta indeed thank you apples we're shooting for apples sorry arrow over the head which is fine it's fine which is some dead fine i'm i'm in it yeah did you actually get rip that big no no it did not um that is really delightful though yeah it does have a like a more there's not a lot of apple to it there is a crispness to it but like maybe that's what they're trying to relate to but crisp like your throat is crisp from like burnt no okay just clarifying i'm saying the taste is very crisp nice just very clean but yeah there's much more piney than there's any sort of apple vibe to it no um i'm alright without anyone yeah but that's fine like as far as like a standard thing that's a standard yeah it's a taste that um no one really has an issue with i assume right yeah well how's your experience of your high it's good it's good um it's very even it's like i don't know how to say it but it's very even across the eyes guys feeling balanced yes it's a very nice balance basically it's not overpowering at all um but i definitely you do feel it you know there is a little hit to it off the rip that is probably the 28 test results yeah which would make a lot of sense i would check out yeah that's very nice that's a that's a definitely like an above average um nice would you recommend it i really would yeah i think uh if i had to give a number to it yeah man like eight three eight three are you saying overall eight three or your recommendation of it what's my recommendation of it recommendation eight three overall i mean overall it's pretty much the same it's not eight three yeah not a huge differences from scores but yeah it is that's really clean awesome awesome yeah well great thank you thank you to case average thank you for the apple fritters once i got your soundcloud",

mouth looking at closes typing all our things in caps and that's getting very anyway", "XMKIIlE-7g8": "hello and welcome to my kitchen my name is Shari and today we are gonna be making apple fritters so if you can't tell by the big smile on my face I'm excited because we're gonna get to eat these warm today you know usually when you get them from a donut shop or the bakery they've kind of been sitting on the shelf for a while so I'm pretty excited about these I have not made these before but what happened was I went to go edit the video that was supposed to get uploaded today and part of it had no sound so I was forced to make something on a whim and I'll tell you there's no better product for making things on a whim and road's dinner rolls so I don't know if you all have tried these they come in the freezer section and I've used these quite a bit over the last you know a few years or so and they were kind enough I had seen something I made on I think it might have an Instagram but I made meatball bombs so you take a meatball and you stick it inside the roll and it becomes like a bomb and you dip it in marinara and they were fabulous anyway they were so kind that they sent me more rolls they sent me an oven mitt they sent me an apron so thank you thank you thank you two roads and they also sent me a cookbook so I thought how perfect let's get in here and make something you know I've never made and sure enough I ran across the apple fritters so that's what we're gonna be making today so to use these rolls you just need to thaw them out and then let them rise so if you want to do that from frozen you'll take these out and you know lay them on a sheet and you'll cover them with saran wrap and then you'll let them rise three to five hours so what I did was I put mine on a plate and I let them thaw in the fridge overnight so now that they're thawed and they're soft I just need to let them double in size so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put these in the oven and I basically just have the oven light on in there so I don't have it turned on but that keeps it warm enough that they should double in size and it should take roughly an hour I'm hoping I really want to try to get this done today and upload on time but anyway yeah these are just a fabulous fabulous product and they also make rolls they make big Texas rolls so they're the big Texas rolls are like double the size of these but there's 36 of these in a bag I also make cinnamon rolls which is awesome look at the cinnamon ring in here doesn't that look great so we're gonna let those rise and then we're gonna make our filling that goes inside and then we're gonna fry them up so I'll see you in an hour our rolls are just about done so it's time to work on our Apple mixture so I have just a couple of apples here that I went ahead and peeled and I chopped and I'm going to add a little bit of sugar cinnamon and nutmeg and of course I will put the complete amounts that I used in the description below the full recipe so just a little bit of nutmeg and I'm using fresh nutmeg that you can use whatever you have on hand all right so I'm gonna mix this together and then what we want to do because as the sugar starts to interact with the apples of course it's going to start releasing some of its juices and we don't want our fritters to get all soggy so what we're gonna do is take this mixture and I'm gonna put it right over the top of a strainer and then we will let it sit there okay so I'm gonna set this aside and then I'm gonna grab our rolls oh look how pretty they are and then all we want to do is take one of these and I'm gonna take my little Baker's roller here and we're gonna flatten this out into a little circle all right so I'm gonna do my best y'all know I don't have the best skills when it comes to all that stuff we're gonna try to make these look like little circles though I mean I don't know the ones you get at the bakery aren't really circles though are they all right so I'm just flattening them and then rolling them out just a little bit there that one looks a little better and then what I want to do is brush the bottom layer with a little bit of egg so this is what's gonna help it seal once we put the top layer on and then we're gonna take a little bit of our apple mixture see how all this is starting to drain away now that's the part that you don't want and your apple fritter so I'm going to take what's on top take a little bit of our filly whoops I need the whole thing take a little bit of our filling and then we're gonna take the other one place it right on top and then we're gonna press our edges together and then we are just going to well first I'm gonna move this out of the way alright so I'm gonna pull back my oil and I'm doing this in a saucepan today we're gonna take our little fritter and we're gonna put them put him in the oil and then while this is frying up I have got oh I think about a cup of powdered sugar I'm gonna add 1/4 cup of milk and we're just gonna stir that together he's frying really really fresh fast fast anyway cup of powdered sugar and 1/4 cup of milk and we're just gonna stir this together and this is gonna be our glaze he looks like he's done all right so we'll go ahead and take him out let him dry on there go ahead and roll out one more way to get myself into work this morning so what happens when you're in a hurry a little bit of the mixture on top again the other one back on and this one I just forgot to put the egg on but you know what I think it's sealing around her well so the recipe called for the egg I don't know that you necessarily need to use the egg though all right I'm just gonna kind of move my apples around make sure she's pinched together this one's a she the other one was he and into the fryer so I'm gonna finish mixing up my glaze I'm getting it all over me again I feel like I'm always using powdered sugar in here and I'm always getting it on my dress so like I always have powdered sugar on me all right way these are frying fast now glaze is almost done okay time for her to come out set it over here all right I'm gonna push this aside I'm gonna let these cool for just a few minutes just so our glaze doesn't run right off our fritters are done all right so I'm just gonna take my glaze and we're just gonna put it all over the top and because I have to photograph this I think I might try to sneak a bite from the bottom yeah let me tell you they smell so good but there's so much lighter I think then like what you get at the bakery they just feels lighter and fluffier so if you guys have not tried that like their bread or their rolls again the name of its roads those are the generals 36 in a pack they're orange they're in your freezer section but like I said they have Texas rolls and cinnamon rolls and they also have bread dough oh my gosh this looks good well anything fried with sugar on it's got to be good right I got some my glaze dripping on mmm-hmm that's so much better when they're warm I think the flavors just better in these these are really good I think I could open a bakery just using their dough oh my goodness so I'm anxious to get in that cookbook they sent me because there's so many other recipes that I haven't tried so many good looking things in there but these are really really good so I'll put the full recipe in the description below I thank you so much for watching I'll see you next I [Music] you", "Df8icLQKFIs": "good morning YouTube what is up everybody welcome back to the dorm or show this is

also call them Apple Donuts they're so good so easy you don't have to worry about a yeasted dough but they taste just like the most incredible Apple don't ever let me run your 30 ingredients so we can get started because it doesn't take a whole lot you need all-purpose flour sugar salt butter milk egg vegetable oil vanilla extract apples and you also need some frying oil like vegetable oil and some granulated sugar mixed with cinnamon that's gonna be the coating on the outside they are so fantastic you cannot even imagine what I have here is some vegetable oil I have enough to come about halfway up my heavy-bottomed pot here and I've got my thermometer because I'm looking for this to get to about 360 degrees that is like I'm a happy spot when it comes to frying I also have some apples that I started prepping but I was gonna show you what I do now I'm using Honey Crisp they're my favorite apple they cook really well so that's what I'm gonna use and they're not too they're not too tart therefore there's not gonna be a big contrast between the sweet coating and then the tart apple there's still gonna be some contrast of course but not as much but you can use any apple you want so you peel your Apple right and then as you sew I cut mine into rings using a knife because you can see I get nice like quarter-inch slices if I were to use my mandolin they come out way too thin and I find that they kind of disintegrate into my frying oil so I just do it by hand and if they're not perfect that's fine I'm just looking for them to be about the same about the same thickness and as I go you just kind of take your apple corer and you just do that so I'll show you what I mean by as I go I'm gonna continue this in a minute but so this is a brand new Apple right get in here take the first little bit out and you cut your slice right then you do another one and now as you go you get rid of the core so I'm just going to keep on slicing and then that way we have all the was ready and we'll be able to fry them up apples all done now to my buttermilk I'm going to add my egg along with my veg oil and a really good splash of vanilla now you're wondering why aren't you adding any cinnamon to your bed or missing and that's because I'm using it for the coating and I just don't want too much cinnamon because then I feel like it overpowers the flavor of the Apple I love when a spice complements something not overpowers it so you know cinnamon complements apples really well but if it overpowers and then what's the point you know what I mean so I'm just mixing all of my wet ingredients together just a bit and now I'm gonna pour them into my dry but before I do that I just want to give that a quick little mix I'm going to pour this batter or web my wet mixture into my dry and then just whisk it all together alright that is perfect temperature is up on the oil so now you just take your apple you dunk it in there you're gonna make sure it's really coating well and then you just drop that right in do just a few at a time because you don't want to drop the temperature of the oil too much because then your little Donuts absorb way too much oil so I'm gonna turn to a few at a time and I'm going to let them cook for a few minutes and then show you what they look like when they're done taking the last three out now it's really important that you don't slice your apples to Sagna because if you do then they cook too much on the inside and your doughnut kind of won't hold together that well there still be delicious but it won't hold together really well you can see I kind of just get them this is all just batter I kind of just get rid of all the extra grease when they come out and then you just coat them in cinnamon sugar and then you place them on your plate and these really need to be eaten right away for them to kind of hold their shape and texture otherwise because there's Apple inside such a big amount of Apple they will kind of start to fall apart and soften again still delicious it would still be incredible underneath a big dollop of ice cream but not for this purpose like it won't hold together like that I'm gonna go for one that I just took off a little bit ago because the ones I just took off a really hot hmm so hot though oh that mmm perfect amount of batter not too much batter the Apple is just perfectly cooked through still has a little bit of a bite again it helps to kind of hold it but they're perfect they're easy they're delicious they're simple and everyone loves a good apple fritter so I'm gonna learn in the kitchen

Okay and Justin be like,\nhey, everyone like that's-- - Oh, sorry, my bad. - No, but that's okay.\n- I'm excited to eat this. - He's excited, he's excited. - Let's get to the taste\ntest is all I want. That's all I wanna do. - Because today we're doing apple fritters with a vanilla glaze. It, you guys, it's\ngood, I tried it already so let's go ahead and get started. So here's what you'll need. All-purpose white flour, three Granny Smith apples\ncut into small pieces, whole milk, cinnamon, two\neggs, salt, baking powder, sugar and vegetable oil. And then for the glaze,\nyou'll need powdered sugar, vanilla extract, milk, butter. We're gonna melt that before\nwe mix everything together and salt and then of course\nsince it's apple fritter and you're deep frying it, some oil. I'm already heating up the\noil in a pan and a large bowl. So in a large bowl, you're gonna place your\nall-purpose flour, baking powder. I like mixing it with a whisk. Salt. Sugar. Cinnamon. Mix that really well. And now you're ready to add your milk. Then you're ready to drop\nin the eggs one at a time. Then you're ready to add vegetable oil. Give it a good mix. Now we're ready to add the green apples, the Granny Smith apples and just add all of them\nall at once and mix it in. So in a bowl, you're gonna\nplace your powdered sugar and then I'm gonna gradually\nadd the whole milk. We're gonna just gradually add it and mix. I'm just gonna do maybe\nhalf for now, right, and then we're gonna add\nthe melted butter, the salt. It's looking like a good glaze but we don't want it that thick, right, so we're gonna just keep on adding milk to the consistency that we like but for now let's keep on\nmixing, adding vanilla extract. It's looking good but I want\nit to be a little thinner so I'm gonna keep adding a little milk. Okay, you guys, this looks perfect 'cause I just wanna get it right on the apple fritter for later. So this is perfect, you guys. Alright, you guys, it took a\nwhile for the oil to heat up but it's ready. So here we are, let's do our first drop. That's looking great. I'm using an ice cream scooper to drop it but you can do it by the spoonfuls or you can do it however\nbig or small you want it but I think this size is great. It's gonna take about five\nminutes for these guys to be completely done and you're gonna wanna make\nsure you flip 'em over too. So when it starts to look a little golden, that's when you know you\ncan kinda flip it over and give it a few more minutes\nuntil it's nice and golden like two more minutes. Alright, you guys, you're\ngonna know it's done. You can open it up or you can just tell because it's looking nice and golden. So if you don't have a rack like this, you can just always put it\non a plate with paper towels to absorb the oil. My favorite part, let's\nglaze this, you guys. So here we go. Oh, that's so beautiful. Glazing is my favorite. Yes. So pretty. Go cray. However much glaze you want. Nobody can tell you how\nto live your best life so if you like a lot of glaze, do you and high five because I do too, high five. There we go, friends and I'm not done. We need to glaze it with one more pan. Let's do this. Glazing is so fun. I wish I could just be\na professional glazer. All I do is this. That would be so fun. There we go, friends. Now we're ready to get the taste tester to enjoy this delicious apple fritter. (upbeat music) Alright, we have our taste tester. He's been screaming about it. He been like, hey, guys,\nI want my apple fritter. - Here we go. Okay, upon picking it up, it feels nice. Nice consistency, doughy. - Mhm. - Smells amazing. - I'm getting the glaze in the bottom 'cause I'm not trying to waste it. - Oh my God. - I know, right? - Oh my God, this is incredible. It is so fluffy. The apples are perfect. I don't really, I would never\neat a Granny Smith apple unless it was in a dessert. It's not my type of apple but\nit tastes amazing in here. It's like the perfect, it's\nkinda like a little bit mushy 'cause it's so firm. - Yeah. - The dough is perfect. It's funny, when we were cooking this, it kinda looked like a beignet. When we went to this cooking\nclass, we made beignets but this is incredible. It's so doughy and the glaze. I could actually really taste kinda the cinnamon accent in there. - We could have added more. - We could have added a\nlittle bit cinnamon too but with the vanilla glaze,\nit's just like and I'm so, I'm just so impressed. I don't even, like. - I'm sorry, you guys. Meanwhile, I was just grubbing. I had two already, you\nguys and also when you, don't waste the glaze,\ngo under, boo, go under and get some like that. - No but for real though, I don't know what my expectations were 'cause you know what my expectations are is the donut shop, right? - Donut shops are bomb. - But this is way better like way better than the donut shop. - Are you kidding, I\nlike it as the same way. - No, you know why, let me tell you why. The donut shop apple fritters, they have like three little\nchunks of apples in it. They do not have.\n- That's true. - It was like, this was like\n60% apple, 40% dough on this. - That's true, that's true. - That's why it tastes incredible. - Thank you, boo, thank you, thank you. Anyways, friends, give it a try. When Justin be closing his eyes, you know this is the recipe for you like you know this is\nthe one you need to try. Anyways, thank you guys\nso much for watching. If you enjoyed, give the\nvideo a thumbs up, subscribe. See you next Tasty Tuesday\nor Thirsty Thursday, whichever it is and I hope\nyou have a wonderful day. Bye.\n- Bye. I feel like I've been transported\nto an alternate universe where all the things\nin life are delicious. - But isn't that our life though? We like to eat. - That's true. (upbeat music)", "2Pc37yvKlh8": "hi folks on my last visit to San Francisco I fell in love with Apple if you have never had these before they are little donut dumplings filled with creamy sweet apple gorgeousness and they are just a celebration of autumn a celebration of fall all wrapped into gorgeous sweet dough when we make them let's do it it starts off in a bowl with some flour we're gonna add to the flour a little bit of yeast this is fast action yeast so it doesn't need to be activated at all it's already in the flour we're gonna add in a little bit of sugar this is a sweet dough so I'm just gonna mix this through just to make sure that I get a nice even combination of ingredients in here first and then once I do have that it's time for our wet ingredients so egg goes in one large free-range egg we've got a little touch of milk now this is sort of it's an enriched dough so when this becomes a doughnut you have this sort of sweet and light dough that just becomes really moist and delicious bit of melted butter goes in here and a touch of water and basically just using your wooden spoon you're gonna get in there and give this a good mix through and once it starts forming together that's the point that you can get in there with your hands okay we have done most of the hard work turn that out now grab all those little bits don't be afraid about it a little bit of flour as you go just until you get the right consistency on your dough and once you have it at that stage it snail case of kneading this until it's smooth and elastic you can see when it starts going together because it no longer it starts sticking to the board so just shape it into a nice ball at this point and you can see does a little spring back and you're going to and I'm also out of breath at this point what area this goes back into the bowl now and I'm gonna leave it to rise it's gonna take a 45 minutes to an hour in a nice warm place now while the dough is resting I'm gonna make up the apple filling for these apple fritters now the apples I'm using here are Granny Smiths you could use a cooking apple but with the Granny Smiths you're gonna get that sort of tartness but you're also gonna get a little bit of texture and that's what I wanted these little apple fritters so I'm just gonna slice these off and dice them into nice little pieces okay apples nicely sliced up butter into a pan and now it's a case of making this apple filling so melty melty butter Apple Apple Apple II to this we're going in there with a little bit of castor sugar just to add sweetness a little bit of cinnamon the juice of about half a lemon give it all a good mix through you want to cook these apples they just until they're nice and tender they need a tiny touch bit more I'm gonna cook them out and I'm gonna leave them to cool and that will form the filling for our beautiful dough which should be just a bit risk [Music] right the dough has rested it has doubled in size and look at that beauty it's ready for a little punch and this is my favorite moment of the kitchen Oh ultimate satisfaction get this straight age we're gonna roll this out with a little touch of flour you want to knead it just to get it into shape you want to roll this out until you have a better centimeter in thickness a little bit less okay logger this we've got a nice little rectangle that is ready to be filled so with this Apple mixture that has now been cooled I'm just gonna take up a spoon and spread this all the way over I've got a nice smooth finish on my apples and now it's just a case of rolling these off and you just basically take a little bit of the dough at a time and just make it into a nice big long snake flip it seam side down and then using a knife I'm just gonna split this into twelve even pieces okay so twelve somewhat even pieces and now it's just a case of taking each of the warden and kind of rolling it roughly into a ball so just form them into nice little shapes and once you've done that these need to go and rise again so nice little balls and they're all slagging me off-camera that this just looks like an absolute mess but stick with me because these are gonna be deep-fried and you're gonna have these little craters and little pieces that will make it all worthwhile all right all right good stop shaking your heads yeah there you go okay brilliant right we have these apple fritters these now need to rise again and when they rise I promise you you're gonna relax with something absolutely beautiful so I'm gonna cover these and leave them to rise ye of little faith this is what comes back after you have risen them you can see all that messing around with those Scrolls has resulted in nice puffy little apple fritters ready for the deep fat fryer I have a big pot of sunflower oil which has come up to temperature it's a debate 180 degrees and now it's a case of dropping these in slowly but surely and very very gently one by one straight into fritter glory you only need to fry these for a vaild a minute either side or bate minute or two just until they get the right color you're looking for a nice golden-brown color right we are in business these look pretty good so I'm gonna get them straight out of the pan and into a plate with some kitchen paper just to drain off any of the excess fat so now that these are out it's just a case of working through the rest in little batches so that I get a nice even golden brown color I'm gonna turn off the heat now leave these to cool for just a minute or so and make up a very simple and ridiculously sweet but all together delicious maple syrup glazed so I have some icing sugar and I have some maple syrup and it's just a case of drizzling this in to the point that your maple syrup works its way it's really smooth little glaze and now all you got to do is get blazing if you're served one of these up to me on a cold autumn day I would be an absolute ecstasy which is exactly where I'm about to go right now because I have to try one I mean they're still warm and they're just glazed so I think would be rude not to [Music] it's like apple pie deep-fried though it's cinnamon with stickiness with that lightness of the dough I mean you can see just how light and airy that beautiful dough is this is awesome in a fritter right there it's so gorgeous and it's so sweet and sticky I hope you will give this a go for more now it's gonna be really hard to do the closing link but that farm I wanted to subscribe I want you to like this video I want you to leave a comment and I'm sorry for eating with my Merritt open and I want you to head over because we'd leave a link for the full recipe for these and until then my friends have a wonderful time making some apple fritters and I'll see you soon goodbye so into our pan we're going in here with a little motor my motor it's the butter it's a little bit of butter not mutter mutter butter why do I say butter", "lggqibroMfo": "we're just going to roll this out pretty thin don't have to be too careful of code because it's going to get topped up anyway but we want to make sure that we get the right surface space the toppings and when we do the chopping it needs to have a small uniformly small chunk of dough as possible it's good Applejack's you you want to get kind of nice and coverage if you put too much then you'll introduce too much moisture into the batter and then your fritters will just fall apart good then we'll put just a thin hit cinnamon on there the Apple actually is pre seasoned a little bit itself you don't need too much so we're going to do is take some of the regular cake doughnut mix this is called the binder what it does is it regulates the moisture content and gives a little bit of crispy finish to the fritter if you were to bake that off right now in an oven it would be the apples dessert pieces you get from like Papa John we're just going to roll that up you want to make sure to keep your best flowers away from your top area right now and then we're going to put gloves on so that it's a little bit easier to work with me here so we're going to do we've got this rolled up you know we top it at angles quarter to half inch with the you want to make sure that the biggest chunk of dough at the end is smaller than about a quarter inch in any direction thickness width height too big and it doesn't work well in terms of being able to to ball up to form the fritter you'll see what that looks like and the large dough making companies they'll have just a big machine that they pitch all these ingredients into it basically works as a big food processor chops them all up spits them out in the balls in the envelopes of dough looks pretty good we're going to take flour basically build a little flour walls on either side so that we can this is this dough is extremely sticky what we're doing is we're using the flour so let us work the dough making sure to keep the flour on the external parts of the loaf of dough to get inside and messes with the moisture content counteracts the binder and then soaks in moisture the one that hits the fryer triggers a little chemical explosion for this point we're basically making a meatloaf but no meat just yummy cinnamon apple goodness you want to make sure to kind of over compress now so that it'll stick together later and we've got a nice big loaf of this here so we're actually going to spin this off into two pieces make it a little bit easier to work with chop these off into little kind of one-inch sections here this is your last chance to get the pieces to hold together so you're going to work them it's really just like playing with play-doh couple nice alright so we we've let these things proof for about twenty minutes iterators proof a little faster and so we're going to take these out and let them sit for ten minutes therefore and this is what the finished glazed doughnuts", "N1rOe10V4Y4": "it wasn't even

conscious creation and the law of assumption here if you're interested in those topics please click the like button down below and subscribe and we will get into it before we do get into it i just want to mention that i do offer coaching my prices are pretty reasonable at the moment and the prices are listed on my instagram highlights and i will drop that information in the description box below this video so today's video is about testing everyone as you pushed out so recently i did a challenge on my instagram it was a two week challenge uh where every day for two weeks we all decided to manifest something random so i took suggestions and then i came up with some on my own and every day i put something random i post made a post on my instagram and you can still see them they're all there on my instagram the 14 days of the random list of things it was really fun a lot of people took part in it and people sent me their manifestations every day and we had so many manifestations it was amazing a lot of people messaged me and told me that they were grateful for the challenge because it made them you know remember how powerful they are or realize how powerful they are for the first time and i do recommend doing a test like that if you are doubting you know everyone as you pushed out if you're doubting the law of assumption if you're doubting that it's real that is the way that reality works what we focus on grows so when you can test it on little things that you don't really care about nothing is bigger or smaller we are actually god or we are source or we are infinite intelligence so nothing is actually larger or smaller it's just how our human perspective you know we from our human perspective we place some things on a pedestal or we we perceive something as larger or smaller when really it's all just us and it's all just part of us nothing is separate from you you can manifest anything you want but if you're just starting out it can be a good way to test your power when you have no resistance to you know little things so i'll i'll give a few examples of what we did so the first thing was a woolly mammoth which i was kind of laughing to myself about that because it's just so random we have a museum here uh where i live in victoria bc and there's a giant life-size woolly mammoth in there and when i was a kid i used to be super scared of it but uh i didn't go to the museum or anything but it kind of made me think you know it's an ice age wooly mammoths are in ice age and i said on the challenge like don't turn on ice age on purpose like when you're testing everyone as you pushed out you don't go like searching out for it you just decide that you're gonna manifest that thing and then you go about your life as normal and for even for myself it was hard because i was kind of like really noticing things and like looking in shop windows as i would as i'd walk down the street like oh am i gonna see it there am i gonna say like no don't force it like yeah be aware of your surroundings and like but just do it with ease and not like forcing like oh when am i going to see it why isn't it here yet i didn't see the woolly mammoth on the first day i think it was about halfway through like i had already been manifesting other things on the other days and then the woolly mammoth came up for me on a palatine bikes ad it was like way in the corner you can see the highlight on my instagram everyone is you pushed out challenge many other ones that other people have manifested and then mine are on there too and it's really fun to go and look at them but yeah the woolly mammoth was a funny one two my two favorite ones that i got were one of the days was a pink car and you know where i live pink cars aren't common at all it's pretty rare and i was downtown and i was walking around and i just had you know when you're manifesting i'm just gonna do a little just gonna say a little something about letting the state lead here because when you are getting into the state of the wish fulfilled you you get into that state and you let the state lead you're not forcing anything you're not oh i need to like figure out what what my next move is now like inspired action or like any action that you need to take you will be led to do so and it you you wouldn't be questioning well should i be taking this action so an example of this like i i just had like a feeling that i should go to this coffee shop where they have these vegan apple fritter doughnuts that i really like and like i had already had a london fog that day i love london fogs with like soy milk or oat milk but i had already had one that day and i was like i want another one don't know like i usually would only have one but you know i just had a feeling to go to this coffee shop during this everyone is you pushed out challenge so i'm walking over to this coffee shop get my apple fritter and my uh london fog and this is when i'm trying to manifest this pink car and there's a place across the street from this uh from this coffee shop that i went to called the pink bicycle and i was aware of that place you know when i was manifesting the pink car when i was thinking about manifesting a pink car this pink bicycle restaurant it's like a burger joint they i that was in my awareness that that that restaurant was in my awareness and i was kind of like well no i'm not manifesting a pink bicycle manifesting a pink car but it was directly across the street from this this coffee shop that i was going to anyways so i'm crossing the street with my apple fritter and my my drink and this pink bicycle place i'm like you know i'm aware of it i've been there before i know it's there i just kind of like looked i looked at it and the artwork below the pink bicycle like there's literally a pink bicycle in the window and then underneath like you can see the video on my highlight if you follow me on instagram but the artwork underneath on the cement on the underneath the window i had never seen that before i don't even think it was there previously but now it's literally painted pink car like headlights and pink and it literally i think it literally says pink in the corner and it it was like the painting of like a front of a car that's pink and i took a video out of it i was like what the heck like oh and i did want to say so letting the state lead is important like just get into the state of the bushel field i'll make a video on like different ways that you can get into the state of the wishful field and letting that state lead but ultimately it's just like an ease and flow and like you're not it's like minimal resistance anyways right before that i actually saw like walked across the street and saw that that pink painting of a car there was something else completely in my awareness that completely unrelated that i was trying to you know revise or manifest or or flip and i was saying and saying in my mind i am god there is no lack very boldly saying that in my mind about something completely unrelated and like just trying to you know center myself on on the subject like i am god there is no lack and that's when the the pink artwork like caught my eye like it's just funny how it happened so then i was like pretty excited and i was like in a really good mood from seeing that artwork and i shouldn't say this but i'm like pretty addicted to my phone and i will just be walking down the street like staring at my phone you know like making the stories of the like my god i saw the pink car and just walking down the street staring at my phone staring at my phone standing on my phone walk a few blocks and then i literally look up from my phone and there's a pink tesla pulled over on the side of the road like the the guy driving the car is just like looking at his phone but he's just like pulled over and the car is like running i look up for my phone and this pink tesla never seen one in my life is just chilling like right like it literally just like appeared i looked up and it was literally just there and i was like i took it you could see the video on my instagram i was like oh my gosh like i couldn't even talk properly i was like this pink tesla is like popped over for me anyways that was probably my favorite one and then another one that i put on the list for manifesting this everyone as you pushed out challenge was a ghost and some people are like i'm i'll take a pass like i'm not gonna manifest a ghost like i'm too scared i don't know when i think ghost i'm not like oh like you know creepy thing like sure that your mind might go there but i'm thinking you know scooby-doo there's like there's like a sheet there's like a sheet over them and there's two holes in the eyes like halloween costume kind of thing the second thing that comes to my mind is like casper the friendly ghost right like you know that old show well hopefully if you don't know it like it's just like an old old movie about a cartoon cartoon movie about a ghost a casper the friendly ghost anyways so yeah people were like yeah i'm kind of scared like i don't really want to manifest a ghost and then i'm like well you know i challenged myself like the in the challenge the the word was just ghost like manifest a ghost for myself i wanted to challenge myself to manifest not just any ghost but casper the friendly ghost and so i i was like yeah i'm gonna manifest casper the friendly ghost and i was talking on the phone with my boyfriend and it was a really sunny day it's it's springtime here in victoria so it it rains and then the sun comes out and sometimes it's warm it's like all over the place my boyfriend was outside tanning that day and he referred to himself as casper the friendly ghost and i was like thank you for my manifestation so i will explain how you can do this if you don't know how to test it there are many different ways you can do it right so different ways that you can manifest are you know scripting visualization and affirming but different specific ways that you could do it for me personally i like to just see it in my mind like with the woolly mammoth i just saw a woolly mammoth in my mind's eye right or i would just you know say like pink car pink car pink car like i just say that over and over you can say i intend to see a pink car one person messaged me that they were like kind of stuck on the harmonica one of the i think day two was harmonica just so random i was like you know i want to make some of them challenging well nothing is harder or easier to manifest it's just we perceive it as challenging right like woolly mammoth so random harmonica really random somebody messaged me that they were stuck on the harmonica and they said harmonicas are so common i see harmonicas all the time harmonicas are common that's what she did and her boyfriend ended up showing her some youtube video where where they were playing harmonicas and the her boyfriend was like look at this part where look at this harmonica solo like pointing out the harmonica so yeah you can you can just however you word it doesn't matter as long as the focus is a harmonica or as long as the focus is whatever you're trying to manifest it doesn't matter the wording it's whatever you know whatever comes naturally to you but you can play around with different ways for me with the harmonica i used to have a metal harmonica when i was a kid i don't know where it went but i know exactly how that feels in your mouth like it's cold it has a certain you know metal taste and i could hear the sound of it i did not know how to play it well but i know like the sound of it when you blow into a harmonica it makes us you know it's a musical instrument it makes a certain sound it has a certain feel in your mouth i could feel it you know feel it in my mouth and and hear it so that's another way like visualization visualization with tones of reality as neville goddard says like adding you know senses into your to your visualization that can be helpful too or you can say i saw my harmonica today at the beginning of the day or or i saw my harmonica this week and then like i said you don't go like searching for it you don't like oh where is it where is it like i'm bad at this like no you intend to see it you'd make a decision you're gonna see it or that you already saw it you tell yourself you already saw it or you see a visual visualization of it in your mind and then you go about your life as normal just go about your life as normal we're not you need to like there's no neediness there's no like law of assumption you already saw it you assume you're going to see it it's inevitable that you're going to see it you always see them or you hold a picture of it in your mind until it gets pushed out some people message me as well that they were doing the challenge but not with the random things that i suggested they they wanted to just choose something random on their own uh somebody messaged me they said they were choosing two things a day to see and it was really fun and they were they were seeing those things so if you don't want to do the things that i suggested and you want to come up with your own that's cool too you can go and do the challenge and comment underneath how you were able to manifest them or you can you know choose your own things and and be creative and choose something random that you're gonna see today or this week and and you can do it that way you can also do it with phrases i did one thing in the challenge which was i love you and you could either see it written or hear it and i thought that was a lovely thing to manifest as well so you can do things where you can hear people say things as well and that's another way to to test everyone as you pushed out i have another story where my friends and i tested everyone as you pushed out kind of in reverse so two of my friends were in a group chat um well there's more there's a group of us in a group chat but two of my friends assumed something for me so they i said okay you guys assume something for me and don't tell me what it is and my friend chris kind of joked and he was like haha well i could just assume that you're wearing a red shirt and was sort of like he was a little bit skeptical because we were discussing you know the reverse of it like other people assuming things for you because you know with the teachings of devil goddard and you know in the in the manifestation community you are the only one with free will when you're when you're manifesting your desires and i still i still believe that you are the only one with free will when you are you know assuming for your desires like when you're affirming for your desires and and manifesting something in specific everyone and everything will move to get you what you want that is that is true but i also believe in collective consciousness so if there's little things like you know this example here they're assuming something for me and it it didn't go against you know any like i had no resistance to it and so anyways i'll explain what it was so my friend chris kind of joked and was like well i could assume that you're wearing a red shirt and he was just sort of you know made a passing comment about it and at the time when he said that it was the morning and i was in my pajamas still and i had my robe on and i just wasn't even thinking i was like oh yeah whatever and then when i went to go change my clothes i took off my robe and i was wearing a red pajama shirt which i had put on the night before and he had assumed that i was wearing a red shirt and i happened to be wearing a red shirt like i had put it on before he even said it so i took up my robe and i was like oh my god i'm wearing a red shirt and i took a photo i took us like a selfie of myself with my excuse my gross nails right now but i took a selfie of myself with my like like this and i send it to them like oh my god you guys are wearing a red shirt and my friend my other friend karen she's like hilary is that a butterfly tattoo on your finger i was like yeah she's like i assumed i'd see a butterfly with you so the two things that they assumed about me came true within like an hour of us testing that out so you can assume it for your friends as well like you could be like okay assume something for me and i'll assume something for you uh you can you can you know you can assume someone's going to wear a certain color you know different you can play around with it in different ways so everyone and everything is yourself pushed out nothing is separate from you including you know back people in the background and their background conversations like if you become aware of like what you're hearing and things like that like previous to to learning about the law of assumption and about who you truly are you may not pay too much attention to thing you know be too much aware of what's going on around you but if you start to become aware and like listening and being present and you know hearing things going on like anything that you hear or anything you experience in your reality whether you know the person or not there's something you know going on over there like that you hear you know start to be aware of it and pick up on things and that that's it's your own thoughts and assumptions you know being reflected back to you so it can be interesting when you can you can see what's going on in your subconscious by you know just being aware of looking at your life and like you know being aware of like subtle things in the background as well like background conversations and things like that so let me know in the comments down below if you're gonna try my challenge or manifest something random i'd love to know what it is that you're testing out and yeah keep me updated and you can go over to my instagram and look at the highlight everyone as you pushed out and see all of the that's not even all of them but some of the things that we manifested the highlight can only hold 100 slides on it so there are way more than that but um on the post as well i posted 14 days worth of everyone as you push out challenge on my instagram and some of them have you know screenshots of what people have messaged me that they they manifested and it's really fun so let me know if you're going to give that a try and thank you so much for watching i'll see you in my next video bye [Music] you", "5rCtfmrRXTc": "[Music] hey y'all today i'm

much for watching please hit that like button subscribe if you haven't already and i'll see you next time", "6Rkvu5Po6lI": "hey everybody hope y'all doing good on this saturday it is fall and my granddaughter tatum and i are gonna cook you up something for fall um you know tatum fall is apple time did you know that fall is when we get all the wonderful apples and a few weeks ago i went to the um oren apple farm up in pikeville and got some apples and they were delicious this is the best time of year to eat apples tatum so today we are going to fry up some apple fritters from appleby from the apple barn we love the apple bar don't we yeah they're fans yes they're fritters are the best so we're gonna we're gonna make them at home and you can do that we bought this box um i guess the last time we were up there which was probably in the winter time like christmas you know and um tink and i've been on a diet so we haven't been eating many fried things or carbs so um so anyway we're gonna fry up the rest of this box and uh enjoy some apple fritters this morning so what do we need to do first tatum is we need to wash our hands let's wash our hands really quick and we're using bath and body works pumpkin apple soda everything's apple it smells great it does smell good it's like this is the apple house before yep this is the apple house we're burning our um white barn apple what's it called pumpkin apple candle so it smells like apples and pumpkins in here but you can't smell it to the camera no she said you can't smell it through the camera in case you didn't hear so yeah tayden spent the night with us last night so she likes to do fun things and we decided we would make a cooking video because she's been watching mine and deb's cooking videos and uh wanted to do one of our own so that's what we're gonna do so now that we've washed our hands tatum we're gonna cut up some apples so this calls for i'm only making a small batch so this calls for um a half a cup of finely diced apples and we're using fuji even though they don't look like fuji they look more like golden delicious but they're they're really fuji so tatum's got a little safety knife here y'all i ain't letting her use my sharp knives but uh see if you can cut that tatum and what we're gonna do like how big we're just gonna cut it like this so it's like that yeah hold on let me like is this how big it put the camera down so they see what we're doing should it be like this big yeah just cut it off cut around that um core in there it's what we want to do so we don't get the core in it this one is pretty juicy yes juicy that's a good thing right yeah we like juicy apples don't we yeah i like granny smiths they're the best yeah you're that's your favorite apple you know what my favorite apple is now i used to like go ahead and cut cut it up like i did all around that core and we'll just toss that core let me know if you need some help holding it you're doing good i know what you usually do you might be cutting into the core i'm not sure yep you did you went a little too far let's see if we can cut it about right there so uh we've got some oil here and it'll be heating up and we're going to deep fry these i don't do a lot of deep frying so i don't have a um like a fry daddy or a fried grandpappy or whatever that's called i'm just using my pampered chef medium sized saucepan and some crisco oil in there and i didn't put a ton of oil in there um so we'll see if that works i'm not the greatest at deep frying things because we just don't do a lot of that let me finish it up for you or you got it pretty much have to get one more i think it should be like okay and so this calls for only a half a cup of diced apples you can use any kind it said red apple but um i'd say use any kind use what you like and it tells you to leave the peel on so that's what we're doing so miss tatum i'm going to let you use the pampered chef chopper here and i know you like to use that don't you because i love pressing buttons exactly you love pressing buttons what kid doesn't like pressing buttons y'all but tatum definitely does she's a button pusher and a prowler y'all got any prowlers at your house okay right i ain't lying am i okay so we're going to put that on top of there tay remember how i showed you to do it hold it down and give it some pounds you have to use your muscle here let me get it started for you i think so let me look oh yeah that's finely chopped and so let me get the half cup measure i wish i could take a bite yeah well i'm sure there will be enough for you here we'll just use this because we haven't used it yet okay so let's um let's just scoop it up like this that's not quite half a cup so let's do um yeah do that one now i'll get it started for you now you so if you don't cook with your grandchildren very often give it a try it's a lot of fun we we enjoy it tayden and i have always liked to cook together my mom doesn't let me do it oh her mom don't let her you know i probably didn't let my kids in the kitchen a lot either when they were little i was too busy you know but now that i'm a grandma i'm not so busy anymore that looks great tatum okay i think that'll give us what we need so you can eat these if you want to yeah you sure can so i'm just going to scoop these up put them in here all right good is it sweet enough yeah okay so that's a little more than half a cup but you know me i don't like measuring stuff i just eyeball it so it's going in the mixing bowl now tatum if you'll get a cup of water in that measuring cup one cup so there's the lime right there should i wash it out first you can rinse it out but it don't matter because it's going in the same pan as the um as the apples so we're good does it depend if it's warm or cold it doesn't really matter okay so just whatever you got whatever comes out of there and we're gonna mix the water and apple and we're gonna add some butter now i've got one tablespoon of butter in this um cute little coffee cup that also looks like fall and so tatum a cup okay so pour it into your mixing bowl with the apples yep all right now you're going to take this cup to the microwave and there's a melt button on our microwave so if you don't have a melt button on your microwave just you know put it in there for about 20 seconds or so and see if you can melt it that way remember to cover it up i don't have to on the mount button because it doesn't splatter okay so hit the melt button hit one for butter and one for one stick even though it's not a stitch and then you'll press start after one uh-huh i pressed two ones yeah now let it get down to about 20 seconds and then it should be done okay okay [Music] or you can just pop it open either one i usually like to press stop i think i'll have a little bit of this there's good i can't reach it oh here you can always just twist it around like that yeah now you can get it it's not hot so good did it melt it sure did too okay go ahead and pour it in there i'm gonna wait till i get this oh she's gonna get her stool she's gonna be a tall girl but at eight years old i'm already this tall she's already pretty tall but she's gonna be tall but she wanted her stool today okay so pour it in that mixing bowl taste with the apples now i want you to take the spoon here you can bring it over here towards you and just stir it all together i love the smell of butter i like your chicken and the taste i love the taste of butter i like the taste it doesn't have anything when i was a little girl and we we would have fresh butter at the house i would just eat it by the spoon's full i would just i would just use my fingers in it and just eat it no wonder i was a little roly-poly i would wash my hands first you win yeah it's definitely good to wash our hands first but now because of corona okay so this is exactly half the package of the fritter mix so i'm not gonna have to measure it because it is half a package which is one pound the package is a two pound pack so if you got a lot of people to feed you can eat i mean mix the whole two pounds but we're doing the small batch recipe so that calls for one pound all right and i know you're gonna pour this in there girlfriend they pour it in here oh yeah okay tatum it says fold in fritter mix and blend thoroughly what do you think it means to fold something in doesn't mean we fold this package we think it needs to fold it in yeah it means to add a little bit and it means don't dump it in it means just don't just bam dump it in it's getting a little gradually pour it in so do you know you can do that yep you think you can do that for me fold it in getting heavier and then i will i will kind of stir it for you as you go a little more it just doesn't want you to dump in all of the batter mix at one time i want to mix it okay you want to mix it too so you want to do it all that's good that's a good sign that means you're gonna be a good champ okay using it okay we're on track i'm gonna go ahead and start heating up my oil smells weird what does it smell like flour okay fold in some more we got to use all that do you want to see those apples these are going to be so good no a little more we got time for this okay and don't you love it when it just goes everywhere yeah that's when you know you're you've been cooking when you see flour all over the kitchen okay just keep stirring now it's getting like better batter you know it looks like real better yep it's getting there right now okay get that around the sides okay let me give you something different to stir this is a spatula and you can it helps like creamy stuff so you can do it like that and it scrapes it all down let me let you use that we'll use this spoon to to deal with just stir it up keep stirring because we about we should be about good go ahead and finish it up put the rest of it in there like the whole thing yeah no not fast just slowly because we don't want flour all over us tayden's still wearing her pajamas y'all of course it's saturday so why not right i can't help it but she she would wear clothes while doing things yep i do wear clothes while doing things and y'all better be glad okay keep stirring because i normally see it's gonna get a little bit harder to stir yeah so you might have to get in with it i might have to get in with it yeah we'll get in there help me a little okay i'll hold this down for you too okay now it's very tough that okay definitely better now definitely better and it's a thick batter well if it wasn't thick though it would be hard to hold it into a ball to make a fritter out of it wouldn't it yes smell it what does it smell like so it's like apples nobody's snarling up that nose what you talking about girl all right well probably because my allergies i can't really smell it okay and my allergy and take them just for kicks just for kicks let's wash our hands one more time not with soap this time but we can at least just kind of make we have a flower on our hands yeah because we are going to be um we're going to be making balls out of those with our hands so we want like flour in it so we have to mix it up well we just don't want in case we had touched our face or yeah something like that we don't want to have any germs in our stuff okay every time i'm about to touch my face you're itching checking to see how our oil is i don't think it's quite hot enough yet you know so if you have a fryer that has the degrees on it it's supposed to be 350 degrees i don't have one so what i'll have to do is check my oil by dropping some water in it and see if it it bubbles up and we fry them for three minutes or until golden brown and then i hope i have enough oil in there i may need to add a little bit of oil tatum i'm gonna add a little more and i use canola oil but i don't know i don't know what y'all want to use but that's what i use i use um a lot of different oils depending upon what i'm cooking but um this is crisco pure canola oil she likes to make her food perfect that's right because ev everyone orders cookies from her so she feels like she has to make it perfect you think i feel that way i do feel that way if people you know expect pretty cookies i'm gonna give them pretty cookies right all right miss k i think it's a little bit liquidy on that side so should we mix it up a little more we're out like right there yeah it'll be good so what we'll do is we're going to take this regular tablespoon and this we're going to get out about that much okay and i have a great idea that may help us i'm going to get some flour out of my bacon corner just gonna get a little flour i want to dump it in there oh we won't dump it in there i'll show you what we'll do in a minute all sorry for that little detour y'all okay so what we're gonna do is before we touch it we're gonna put some flour on our hands like that and kind of get our hands all floured like that yay this is fun isn't it it's like snow yeah i like to pick it up and then i just do this yep put it over and then it actually clips it over this will make a little less of a mess in mimo's kitchen tell them what what you call me tatum nemo nemo have y'all ever had a memo as a grandmother we decided i would be memo because number one my sister her grandkids call her mimi so that that was out i couldn't be mimi because pam was mimi right and so my nickname is mo so i thought well call me memo so that's what tatum calls me it's memo all right so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna get this much in my hand and then i'm going to kind of roll it like that we're going to get a message yeah we are going to make a mess girlfriend and we just roll it like that and if you have to put a little more flour on your hands you can yeah and then i'm going to gently you can't do this part sorry yep drop it in the oil and it is going you have to keep it can you make me one a little more than that that's an awful small fritter i mean that would be like for a toddler to eat daddy a little bigger and y'all don't know how big grown-ups eat grown-ups eat big grown-ups eat big especially big piggy grown-ups like me i eat a bunch but i'm a kid so we're dropping them in this oil and i'll show you that as they're frying here in a second once we get a batch in there have you not got it done yet no it's sticky okay well what you do is you're overdoing it okay yeah you're getting it all over your hands see what you do put a little flour on there do it like that and you're done okay okay now you might want to go get that off your hands real quick meanwhile i'm going to do one more and then i'm going to turn the camera and wash it off with just water yeah okay so y'all this is the the hard part i guess is getting them into a ball all right i'm gonna turn this around where y'all can see it all right all right you can see it and they're just turning all on their own so that's good so i don't have to turn that's okay i probably need washed anyway okay so um y'all could see them they're browning really good it says to do this for five i mean three minutes so now if you have one of those fry daddies it's going to be a little bit easier i think then i think it is yep go ahead and start put some flour on there and do it like i showed should you get a little more flower anymore yeah a little more and just don't yeah now put it all over your hands okay good and now grab you some and just gently roll it don't keep rolling it because as you keep rolling it it's what makes it sticky now these are going to be good and i'm just timing this in my head you know because that's how i do things that's how mimo does things didn't it tay okay there you go i think that's all you need to do give it here and i'll put it in there i think that's perfect it's it doesn't have to be perfect it's an apple fritter yeah now tatum has a little bit of a perfection issue like her mommy does she likes for things to be perfect um well close to perfect really close perfect yep i guess we're all a little bit like that aren't we we like things to be right for sure ooh that one's got a little brown on the bottom it'll be crunchy you got another one ready for me no not yet i think do you think this is enough for this one yeah okay you got it ready yeah we gotta move quickly because our oil gets really too hot i'll drop some mole on the eye oh silly memo i'm gonna turn that down just a little bit let me have it thank you all right there's already a bunch of flour in the bowl anyways oh my goodness i might need to help you there girlfriend there's one okay y'all having fun watching these bull or me dropping them without hurting myself we're almost there tayden we almost got them all you're adding too much to it babe i'm trying okay frying the fritters we're frying the fritter out of the fritters i'm gonna remove this from the eye a little bit that is really getting hot that all good job that's gonna be a bigging that'll be papa's yeah if we can get poppy to eat it he might not want to eat our cooking huh and i think it's horrible because i'm healthy i'm sure he will want to eat our cooking yeah he's just trying to be good and not eat things that are bad for his health right now yeah you got it because of corona so we don't each i don't think it's because of corona i know of course everything these days is because of corona i blame everything on karana that's an awful i know a lot of dough that's gonna be a pretty one is that it yay we got them all and i'm all in the oil so all right y'all i'm gonna let you see our face again i'm sure you're excited i'm gonna take this one out because it is done it's done i hope i didn't get my oil too hot but y'all like i said it would be better with a fryer a fry daddy because you can kind of control the temperature of your oil when you got your i own and i had mine on high which was probably dumb i probably should have had it on like a medium high or something all right try not to burn them there's one that's ready and y'all you're gonna have to get you one of these little scoopers i ordered that from debbie my friend debbie from pampered chef and y'all it's the best thing um it's great for frying up you know squash or okra or anything like that and it's been great on these i haven't used it before so or maybe i've used it once i can't remember but it's great get you one of those i forgot what it's called but see it's got the holes in it and it's um it's safe and and hot oil which is great it doesn't like break down or anything some plastics might well that is a big one right on top tatum yeah i'm gonna wash my hands tatum and then we'll show our friends in the video world our finishing touch [Music] not that much though yeah you took your allergy medicine this morning though right yeah okay y'all so pretty much turn this eye off so we don't burn ourselves yeah burn ourselves now what do i do with all that flour we'll clean it up in a little bit okay so so cooking with your granddaughter is fun we like it don't we tate them okay now we're gonna show you what our little fritters look like over here and um actually let's just i'll bring them over here for you okay so i put them in this beautiful fall dish yes nemo but every um presentation is everything that's right i have taught tatum that presentation well it's really not everything but it's a lot right yeah so just like at the apple barn we're sprinkling it with powdered sugar look it's snowing who's gonna clean up the kitchen papa okay so as you see we have some nice apple barn apple fritters that we made right here at meemo's house right today and y'all i don't have any of the apple bar and apple butter but i did pick up some apple butter at the oren apple

half this one yeah and it was still a little doughy inside yeah still a little doughy okay so that's another thing you get your oil too hot your outside gets really really done but you're inside still a little doughy so let's try another one i bet this one yeah maybe that okay yes that one's done so there's your part i'm on a diet so i'm gonna eat this much you gotta dip it in here tay let's just try it without it oh my goodness yeah that is so good i wish you could taste it um i like it better without the sauce do you well you know it's not apple barn sauce so maybe that's why you're used to the apple barn yeah i don't really like the apple stock barn sauce with it we are making such a mess in this kitchen yummy i like them i like them apple better okay good job um so get you some apples

have a great saturday and we'll see you soon bye", "8t93GQDS23A": "[Music] hey everybody welcome back for another episode airfryer Friday this is episode number 20 I believe I've been doing this since January of this year and I have a little over 20 episodes go through some other extra ones in there but uh you know just do this on Friday that's quite a few episodes anyway on today's episode this uh this is a suggestion from a friend of mine Matt I want to thank Matt for the suggestion we will be making apple fritters in the airfryer alright so we're gonna go down low and we'll show you everything we need to do I will be skipping a step myself but I'll give you the steps in the video because I don't have a fresh apple I'm using PI apple - Kampai up so I will include that in there if you're using fresh apple so if you slice it up yourself so let's get to it [Music] all right so first off we need a quarter cup of milk take well my having luck today well it goes through the cabinet looking for my ingredients realized that I have baking powder but while I was going through the cabinet the powdered sugar we have was open and went flying all over the Lord and behind it was a bag of rice that I had tightened up but somehow it came loose and rice went flying all over so I had a mess in the kitchen luckily the dogs didn't get it let's mix our egg up with our milk I'm just gonna whisk this [Music] next we're going to need 1 cup of flour 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and just a pinch of salt and now we're gonna continue to mix this together now once we have our batter mixed up we want to take our apples and we want to mix these in with our batter and then we want to spray some cooking spray so that the batter doesn't stick to the parchment paper and then we're gonna drop these in here if we can only get about two of these in the air fryer time because they spread out and then we're gonna place these in an air fryer at 350 degrees for 10 minutes total flipping halfway through all right so here's our first batch of fritters they're smelling pretty good now you're maybe saying this don't look like an apple fritter hey it doesn't look like an apple for me either that you get the bakery what can you do we're gonna go ahead and finish off the risk this batter I forgot that if your batter seems a little runny just add I have two tablespoons of flour and it thickens it up a little bit so we're gonna spray our parchment paper put some more in there and continue to cook the rest these [Music] [Music] I'm gonna enjoy this apple fritter honey of that I hope you guys all enjoy your Friday and make sure to stay tuned [Music] [Music]", "NgtQmi115Wg": "what's going on everybody welcome to average guys gourmet I'm Tony Rican and today we got an awesome dessert for you apple fritters let's just go ahead and get started and jump right into this one the apple first is a really easy recipe I'm starting by mixing my batter which I gonna take my egg my milk my sugar cinnamon my sour cream and then I start mixing this all together and it's everything gets nice and mixed I'm going to put my flour and there also then we're going to go ahead and add in our flour you now that we've got our batter all mixed what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this over by the stove we're going to take our apple slices dip them and drop them into our oil to let them fry you so as you saw our fritters didn't have to cook very long I took him out I sprinkled a little bit of confectioner's sugar on them to add that little bit of pop of flavor and so let's go ahead and try one of these great things mmm these are awesome this is a great little dessert that you can serve and any type of function or forget it just make it for yourself you guys will love these so enjoy and we'll see you next time", "Vr811Cje3wk": "scene 1 Apple take one what's up everybody how's it going out there so in this video let's go ahead and so I saw that my wife had brought home an apple from her work and so i saw this and i said let's make some apple fritters so let's go ahead and we're gonna end up coring this and at the same time we're going to be peeling it do you need to peel it not really but I think that you end up with a better product if you do now depending on the type of fritters that you like besides you know you can just kind of crease through almost like you're cutting out the garlic something like this okay and after one direction that way come through like this okay so now what we're gonna do is we're going to take this and we are going to be throwing it in a frying pan and we want to caramelize this a little bit okay we want to soften the Apple a little bit so we're gonna be adding a little bit of stuff to this open the refrigerator and I saw the perfect amount of butter so that's gonna go inside there just a touch of kosher salt not a lot maybe eighth of a teaspoon tops this is ground ginger just putting a little bit touch of nutmeg touch of cinnamon put this on stove over about medium-low heat we need to sweeten this up a little bit so I'm taking some sugar and right there was maybe a tablespoon and a half that might be a tablespoon that's enough maybe about three tablespoons it's up to you if you want to use brown sugar you can guess what I've got here is just some regular all-purpose flour and because we are only using one Apple I think about 3/4 of a cup to a cup of flour will be enough same as before some cinnamon same as before a little bit of sugar tablespoon and a half maybe this is baking powder about a tablespoon if you wanted to you can put a little bit of nutmeg in there I'm not a big nutmeg fan but okay so now inside of this what we're gonna do is we're gonna be adding an egg now you can put milk in this you can put water in this but I had opened up the refrigerator and I saw my wife had a little bit of ginger ale so I'm gonna put some ginger ale inside this and what I'm looking for is a batter that is like a thick pancake batter after we had the apples we can always add a little bit more flour if that is too thin as it sets it's gonna thicken a little bit now the apples are done but I have to let them cool before I throw them inside there because if not it'll start cooking the eggs and stuff so let's go ahead and pour our apples in this so after stirring this up I can see that it actually needs a little bit more flour I added a little bit too much ginger ale and I think that that right there is a decent consistency some people will make it a lot thicker I kind of like it this this way so when you put it in there it doesn't really clump up it kind of spreads out and you have a bigger fritter and I'm using grapeseed oil right now simply because I have a bunch of it on hand it has a high smoking point doesn't really have that strong of a flavor or nothing like that so that's what I'm using but you can use any oil you want vegetable oil is fine Crisco is fine whatever because essentially we're doing this just like you would make donuts and then while that is heating up we can go ahead and make our glazing what I've got right here is just some regular powdered sugar I was looking in the cupboard and my wife had performed a cardinal sin and as you never use imitation vanilla she got imitation vanilla extract so I'm gonna use some real put just a touch of cinnamon in this you can use water if you want to you can use milk if you want to I've got a little bit of half-and-half here stir this up real well to get out any of the clumps of of powdered sugar so I'm gonna put a couple more hits the cinnamon inside there and then at this point I think we've got a winner and we'll pop a couple inside here and then what we want to do is we want to wait for one site to become brown as soon as it's brown I'll go ahead and we flip it you should take at least a couple of minutes for it to brown if it happens within a minute or so it means that the temperature is just too hot so most people don't put a thermostat inside there to check but you want to be around 350 maybe 375 something like that the oil temperature I think at this point I've got it I turned it down a little bit so let's take this out of here try to get some fat off of there and put it on a drying rack so it does not hold on to all of this oil and fat and I might have enough for one or two more here after that you know I've still got some other ones cooking but generally what I'll do is that one of the largest ones I'll cut in half just to make sure that the inside has been cooked all the way and it's not too doughy or anything just to make sure generally you'll know if they're undercooked because they're gonna seem like they weigh a lot more than maybe they should just because a lot of the water is still inside there so basically if you come in and you cut into it what you should see is something like that okay that's what you should see but the glaze what we're going to do is we're gonna pour the glaze over the tops of these I still have a couple more cooking so every time I go to Tucson and I go to Dunkin Donuts to get some of their coffee I was asked my uncle you want me get you something you always says yeah give me an apple fritter and a diet coke and I don't understand why you would get one and the other it's like you know it's like give me something that's low-calorie and two sticks of butter but there we go guys apple fritters and I make them at home you saw it didn't take a lot of ingredients doesn't take a long time anyway until next time I'll talk to you later", "KB__fVfHSiw": "[Music] hmm [Music] ah [Music] ugh [Music] huh [Music] so just got done with a leg workout um pretty decent uh just was tired like sleepy the entire time probably because i was stressing over my car not starting it's working fine now but or and the freaking shower incident which is still not fixed and probably won't be fixed until monday so i guess cold showers will make good youtube content i'm just thinking about how painful that's gonna be i used to take cold showers all the time because i thought i was gonna help with fat loss but it doesn't trust me i've tried for like a year but yeah we're gonna see if my car still works please baby jesus yeah so it's definitely the cold that's been like not allowing it to start it killed my battery so i had to change it and that in turn made me bend over my the hood of my car for a good three hours no okay not like three hours but like more like an hour because i have to like reach in like really deep that's what she said into like to get all the bolts out and my lower back's been hurting so bad so that's sick but yeah i can't believe i'm saying it's warm and it's 22 degrees outside it was negative 17 when my car wasn't working the midwest is awesome so today i'm going to kansas city so you guys will see dylan again in this video aka my bff i don't know if we're gonna eat there i'm assuming we're not so i might bring a snack or something but right now it's time for breakfast [Music] we're gonna get into some of this stuff in the last longer but we're gonna need anyway so we can go ahead and add it [Music] what's up guys welcome to the next day um it's currently 2 p.m i just got off work it is sunday my shower's still not working i have a question for you guys do you see that pot right there that is a freaking stove pot in my bathtub do you want to know why that's there it's because my freaking hot water isn't working still it's been like three days why would they come and fix it i literally had to boil water in that little pot and squat down and wash myself that way it wasn't very effective but it got the job done but it was probably one of the stupidest things i've ever done and our apartment gym the treadmill isn't working so i had to go to our school gym for cardio and i forgot they actually had showers so this actually might work out perfectly because i get there i do cardio and then i just take a shower and then i'm done that should work yes but right now i'm freaking starving so i'm gonna make some i'm gonna try to make homemade apple fritters all right so here are the apple fritters this one was air fried this one was pan-fried not actually fried just with a little bit of spray so i'm gonna give you a reaction real quick let me take a picture for this for instagram let's do the pan fried first it's a little softer than i would like it's really good but i put way too many apples in there cleanse the palette now the airfryer one this one actually looks more like an apple fritter yeah yeah that was way better the recipe made four apple fritters and all of them are around 175 calories each so i'll actually post that in the next video because i'm going to make a little bit of tweaks and then yeah i'll try to make them as close to the real thing as possible so i'm gonna eat all this and i'll see you after cardio what's up just got back from cardio uh just put in my laundry i have to make a bunch of food right now so i'll see you in a little bit all right i got my dinner it's like almost 9 p.m i got my greek yogurt and flour pizza and broken homemade chipotle burritos and rice and chicken and onions and peppers and lots of veggies so in a past video i mentioned that i work at sprouts farmers market and that's how i can eat all this because i've only had the french toast and mcgriddles and hot cakes for breakfast which i didn't record i was i was just trying to go to work and then i had those apple fritters and i hadn't eaten since then so this is going to be a huge meal so just waiting for my laundry in the dryer right now hot water still doesn't work but it did feel good to actually have a shower a hot shower at the rec center so until i get my shower situation fixed here might just keep doing that so yeah but i can't talk too long right now i gotta go do school work oh my god sweet lord baby jesus these are thick as hell oh my god oh they're soft too so a couple days ago one of my subs commented to try kenny fisher's oatmeal protein cookies and i made them tonight and i'm eating the entire recipe because i burned like almost 6 000 calories today which is pretty sick so i made all of it i think this is all like 1500 calories or something like that and it made like 10 12 made 16 cookies so i could only fit a dozen on the baking pan so i air fried four of them i'm gonna give you guys a taste test so let me let me put this on a plate here they are these are the air fried ones and these are the regular baked ones he made just regular what was it oatmeal raisin but i put in white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips because i like chocolate oatmeal raisin chocolate chips better so i'm going to show you or i'm going to taste the air fried one first see if there's a crunch kind of wow kenny if you ever watch this this is freaking delicious holy crap let's try the regular baked one nine out of ten i could have left them in a little bit longer but he did nine minutes i did ten so i don't know how that worked out but this is delicious um thank you to my sub who showed me this recipe i think the name was like josie zz or something like that i will link these down below if you have an air fryer try air frying it because it gives it a little crunchy outside i did it for 10 minutes at like 350 which is the same as the oven but you want you want to flip it halfway damn that's really good okay that was that's delicious nine and a half out of ten so it's like 10 45 right now and i have school tomorrow so i gotta wake up early so i'm gonna wrap the video up here i want to thank you guys so much for watching i know the last couple or few videos i was bitching a lot but i'm just going through something this week so please just give me a pass and i'll shave this too this is i know it's gross but yeah just going through one of those things in life so forgive me thank

will also have a little bit of almond milk and some vanilla in it as well and here we get started apple fritters all right I have diced my apples that's two apples diced cored peeled the whole thing and now we're gonna mix our dries and our liquids and fold in the apples okay so I have folded in the apples into the dough and this has added a little bit of moisture to dough so it's a perfect consistency for this we are making some yummy airfryer apple fritters low-calorie yay all right so what I do with my basket my air fryer basket is I have cut parchment paper to fit it and I have lightly very lightly brushed it with some olive oil very lightly I have brushed the entire thing all right entire paper now we're going to go ahead and take the apple fritter and I'm gonna take about 1/4 a cup for each apple fritter so right now I'm warming up my apple fritter I have it on airfryer at about 400 degrees and we're gonna warm it up just a couple who I needed clean see Maria made cheese quesadillas and here yesterday with nature and her cheese head stripped off and to the bottom of my airfryer and she did not clean it up so that's gonna be a nice lovely burn all right so my air fryer is warmed up I just give it a minute or two and we are going to put there only gonna cook for about mmm maybe five or six minutes like I said this exactly and this batter is gonna make ten apple fritters and I will freeze that they make perfect trees for like oh you want some apple fritters there you go we have some in the freezer just throw them out you can warm it up in your air food you can warm them up and the microwave I like mine warmed up in the airfryer okay so right now while those are in the airfryer I am browning some butter now when you brown butter you just want to get it bubbly and a little brown and this is going to make it nutty and yummy so I just have about two tablespoons in here means we want to keep the calories down and these apple fritters are about 160 160 calories per apple fritter so it's a nice breakfast with some coffee it's a nice breakfast treat and we use raw sugar I mean you try to keep it as healthy as possible without having too much sugar and without having too much boundaries so we're just going to nice and bubbly so what we're going to do is let it get a little brown [Music] oh my goodness it is turning brown and it is smelling delicious smells like popcorn yeah it's kind of getting a little brown there so this is browning better guys these are smelling so good I went ahead and switched it to the bottom rack because it was kind of making me nervous you know I think the top rack would have been too much for these babies can't wait to see them all right here we go you smell good homemade apple fritters oh they smell so good oh my gosh all right so what I've done was I made the glaze right here this is a little bit of almond milk I had a half a cup of powdered sugar my browned butter and some vanilla and I have just know wow it's early so this is not almond butter this is almond milk powdered sugar this is almond milk powdered sugar brown butter and a little bit of an ala but I think I'm gonna have some more almond milk just a dab little dab little dad [Music] we're gonna talk this over here and we are going to put it on my air fryer now I forgot to tell you that before I put these in I did I did brush them really lightly with some oil to get a little bit of the Christie table so don't forget to do that if you decide Natalie why should I have another batch tonight because we're gonna make transform to a plate right there it is people apple fritter oh yeah crispy Brown delish so I have to tell you that Maria just came in she just woke up and she's like are the apple fritters done I said yes and

favorite doughnut so I'm really excited my name is I am my husband Don and I punish the place it's been my husband sized family for over 30 years old fashioned way it takes a long time to make anyway we have to cut it by hand Simon just takes time to make it basically you can see the we are putting effort to it it's rewarding thank you we get to meet so many people it is fun that's not it so happy to be eating doughnuts right now yes really good done it but I feel like it even better if I was able to get it fresh that's where the magic is you check out Bob's Donuts Twitter account to get an idea of when the donuts are hot and fresh and ready this is a maple-glazed butter milk they're in it literally fresh out of the fryer I can see the glaze hardening in my hand this is it's so fresh really good actually really delicious it's got the teh meanest so you can almost taste the buttermilk in the dough but it's still Airy it doesn't feel very dense and there's some generous glaze oh no I think this is pretty much like a perfectly executed buttermilk doughnut chocolate french cooler is one of my favorite doughnuts of all time Wow this is a really light and airy but very crisp around the edges like most like a churro delicious it's chocolate glaze that they make that it's good to eat a dozen of these they're so light so just pop them in and just keep eating them so good so good I have been anxiously awaiting this apple fritter following the Twitter account waiting for when it would refresh totally worth it the glaze is so fresh it's so crispy and warm and cinnamon tea is always caramelized and how right sugary it is mmm a little bit gooey oh this is a piece of doughnut heaven it was good before it's exceptional now hungry for more San Francisco bites check out these other videos", "lcq-ZNM299A": "[Music] you", "II2gnuhe0NY": "hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with apple hand pies that's right i'm gonna show you my patented method for making perfect hand pies also known as turnovers and i know you're thinking those look too perfect to be homemade i bet those are store-bought well thank you that is the best compliment you can get for these things it means you made them so real they look fake and even though i'm gonna fill mine with apple this techniques gonna work with any filling you like so let me show you how this works it's surprisingly easy so like i said i went with an apple filling so i'm gonna peel some apples I know some of you prefer the Perry knife method I really think a peeler works better for these I go around the top like that and then I make nice big wide peels around the side and for me that's easiest way to peel an apple I want you're gonna do a ton then you need one of those cool tourney things okay so once the apples peeled we're going to go ahead and quarter that and then we're gonna take the core out which is pretty easy you can do it this way just hold the Apple and pull the paring knife towards your thumb like that being very careful to stop before it goes into your thumb and if you're slightly less coordinated this is a good method just put it on its side and make a little 45-degree cut like that and that works too so once you take the core out we're gonna take each quarter cut it into three pieces and then cut it into chunks for forehand pies to large apples should be enough mine were kind of smaller I did three so I had a little extra filling but that's fine at that point I put a couple tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat until it got a beautiful toasty Brown so just keep an eye on it and when that foam gets a nice little golden nutty brown color go ahead and throw in your apples we're gonna give them a little pinch of salt give a little stir in that hot butter I'm also gonna add some white sugar and just a little touch of brown sugar and then at this point I made a conscious decision to go with a soft filling so people like to make their pies and turnovers with raw apples just tossing it with the sugar and just relying on the baking time to cook the Apple here I was going for something much softer almost like an apple jam or an apple butter okay so I cooked my nice and soft those little chunks of Apple will kind of swell up and break down swell up swell up and break down and once they got to that point I dumped in a nice healthy dose of cinnamon I'm gonna mix that in and by the way I wish you could smell the aroma just such an incredible bonus you get to smell this stuff as it cooks it's really half the fun and then last but not least I put in a little tiny splash of water just to deglaze the pan a little bit soften these apples up just a little more because like I said I really want an apple buttery jammy apple sauce type filling not a firm piece of Apple we're gonna bite into alright just personal preference you only want to cook yours for a minute or not at all go ahead that's perfectly legit but anyway to summarize you're gonna cook your apples in butter sugar and cinnamon until they're soft as you like so I went all the way to the soft and sticky stage so once that's done I'm gonna transfer that onto a plate to cool while we roll out our dough speaking of which here it is you're gonna need some pie dough and I will tell you at this point that the one I'm using here is a new secret recipe called butter crust that I'm going to unveil next week so you're gonna stay tuned for that it was unbelievable so we're gonna take about 4 ounces of whatever dough you're using enough to make about an 8 inch round it doesn't have to be exact these are hand pies nobody's gonna measure your hand pie okay and also don't worry about perfect circles perfect circles are annoying get it close it just needs to be circle ish and once you do have an 8 inch circle is shaped piece of dough we're gonna go ahead and spoon in about 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of filling all right right near the center we're gonna fold over the dough but we're gonna fold it over about an inch short just like that we're gonna tap it down around the filling with our fingertips nice and firmly that is the first of three levels of crust security the second is gonna be this I want you to go around and just fold over the overlap just like that all right nice and tight all the way around and once that's been folded over and pressed down we're gonna go to the third phase which is the crimping and I know they say crimp and ain't easy but that's so not true crimping is easy all right take the thumb and forefinger of one hand press it in and push in between with the forefinger of your other hand and you will have a perfect so good it looks fake crimped crust so you're pushing with two fingers and you're pressing in-between with the other your thumb is moving into the indentation that your forefinger just made and it really is that easy so once you're folded and fully crimped we're gonna transfer these onto a lined baking sheet and then we're ready for the egg wash some beaten egg with a little bit of milk I'm going to pan down generously and then we're also gonna sprinkle these with sugar if you're feeling savory of course you'll skip this step or you substitute something like a finely grated Parmesan cheese or maybe some herbs and spices something like that and then once they are sugared we're gonna go ahead and put three ventilation holes in the top and this is key if you don't make those holes the steam will not be able to escape your pie will rupture you'll lose all those delicious caramel juices from the middle and your oven could possibly explode all right once we've achieved proper ventilation we're gonna go ahead and pop those in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 25 minutes to a half-hour until they look browned crispy and gorgeous look at those just a beautiful specimen of a ham pie I really want to eat one right now but they're so molten-hot inside do not try it let them sit for 15 minutes you will enjoy it much much more and after that though all bets are off I've been into that thing and I was so happy like I said I went with a very soft almost like an apple jam or apple butter filling but again if you want the chunks of Apple like a traditional apple pie filling go for it and you can see here the extreme flakiness of that dough that is the new butter crust pie dough I'm going to show you next week but like I said no matter what doe you use no matter what fillings you use this technique should work perfectly all right so I really hope you give this a try head over to food wishes com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music] you", "rR6aU8mMJno": "hi welcome back to my mom life if you're new here welcome i'm jordan and today i am showing you how to make homemade apple fritters [Music] today i am taking part in a really fun collab it is called fall food friday and it's hosted by fallon from moss family tv i love her channel i've been watching her for years she has such a sweet family so i'm gonna link her channel down below i'm sure you know who she is but if you don't check out the link down below for fallon's channel and yes i'm so excited to be participating in this she does this um she's been doing it for a few years i'm not sure how many now but what she does is every friday in the month of either october or september she'll do a fall food video so i'm going to be sharing with you this month some fall food videos so i hope that you stay tuned and check out all of the videos that i have for you this month today i am going to be making homemade apple fritters these are pretty easy to throw together not nothing too complicated or hard so i will show you the ingredients and then we'll get to frying these apple fritters okay i have my ingredients out here i'm just gonna go over them quickly and then i will have either on the screen or um in the description box well definitely in the description box the recipe written out for you but you are going to need some cinnamon some baking powder salt a little bit of brown sugar white sugar i have a cup and a half of diced granny smith apples those are the apples that i'm going to be using um you could use any apple i just like the tartness that granny smith apples give and then i have two tablespoons of melted butter and you want those or you want that to cool so that it doesn't cook the eggs that we're going to put in our batter and then i have some vanilla one cup of milk i have some flour in this bowl two cups of flour and then we will need two eggs so i will set you up and we'll get to putting it all together the first step is to add half a teaspoon of cinnamon to your diced apples so i peeled and diced these apples beforehand um just just a minute ago actually so you just want them in small little pieces like this so i'm going to toss my one and a half cups of apples with that cinnamon okay and now we will set that aside and move on to this bowl in this bowl i have two cups of flour and i'm going to add in my sugar so i have my white sugar all right and then our brown sugar the baking powder that seems like a lot of baking powder we're gonna just trust the recipe and then we will need some salt and then the last thing before we mix this up is just another half teaspoon of cinnamon okay now i'm just going to mix all of this together these are like our dry ingredients before we add um anything to the flour mixture we're going to whisk up our eggs in a separate bowl it says to whisk them until they're pale yellow and frothy [Music] that looks about right it's pale yellow and frothy so we will move our milk over here i have one cup of milk and to the milk i'm going to add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and then our egg mixture [Music] i'm just gonna mix that up then we will add in our two tablespoons of melted butter and once you mix all of that together it is time to combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients so move this bowl over now what you want to do is add in your wet ingredients and mix mix this until it's about halfway combined and then we will add in our apples [Music] okay everything looks nice and combined so now what we are going to do is take this over to the stove and i have a cast iron skillet with some oil in it and we are going to fry these fritters up okay i have a plate with some napkins on it and i'm gonna set that to the side so that when when they are done frying i can place them on that to drain some of the oil off of them and i have a cookie scoop to place our batter into our oil so i just have about i don't know maybe two inches of oil in my cast iron skillet and you could use any skillet but this is what i usually fry in and i've had it heating and a trick to know if your oil is ready to go is to take a the end of a wooden spoon and when you put it in your oil if it bubbles like this then you know that your oil is hot and it is ready to go so i have it on medium heat i'll probably turn it a little lower because it looks pretty hot and i'm going to just place one scoop i'm going to make them kind of small so i'm just going to do one scoop perfritter and you do not want to overcrowd your pan so i'm just going to do four at a time but these are smaller than what the recipe suggests so if you make them any bigger than this you might want to just do three at a time depending on the size of your skillet i guess and we're just gonna let these brown up it doesn't take very long at all but you definitely want to make sure that you get them cooked through so i'm just gonna kind of push them down a little bit my oil is pretty hot so that's why they're cooking so fast but i have i turned it down so it'll slow down [Music] okay these are ready once they are nice and golden brown all over they are ready to come out so i'm just going to pop them on this plate and let some of that oil drain off and then keep frying up our fritters [Music] okay so to finish off our apple fritters i have just a simple glaze here it's just a cup of powdered sugar with a couple tablespoons of milk and a splash of vanilla extract so i whisked it up and now i am just dipping our fritters in the glaze like that and this is what they will look like when they are done it smells so good in my kitchen right now look at that thank you so much for watching my video today if you liked seeing how to make these homemade apple fritters then please give my video a thumbs up and if you're new here i would love for you to subscribe and stick around and thank you again to fallon for hosting this fall food friday collab i am so excited to be participating this year and i hope that you stick around to see what other fall food videos i have for you coming this month and i will see you in my next video bye guys [Music] you", "3omSvOzMmkc": "hey everyone welcome back to the channel we've got matt having a whole bunch of sweets today i went and picked up pretty much all these from my favorite bakery there's a whole bunch here so i'm not going to go over them all right away i'm just going to name them off as i eat them but i'm not even sure which i want to start with because i know they're already good because i've already had them all already but before i start i'm going to pour myself some tea of course because i can't have sweets and desserts without some tea i think i'm going to actually save the apple fritter for last because that's what they're known for is having the best apple fritters in town all right so there we go now that my tea is poured let me decide i think i'm going to start with some of these these cannoli over here so i have one chocolate and one vanilla cannoli it got a little bit cracked though so i hope it doesn't fall apart as i eat it hmm hmm it almost tastes like chocolate pudding in the inside maybe that is what it is maybe this will be like vanilla pudding there's the vanilla one uh pieces all over myself of course those are good i think i like the vanilla one more than the chocolate one though i'm more of a vanilla guy for sure but what am i going to go into next i think i want to have maybe out of these two i think i'm going to try the so i have an eclair here now an eclair and a cream puff i think we go with the eclair first and then have the cream puff second later on there we go oh big full 360 view whoa don't drop it though oh my gosh i have a ton of cream filling in them oh where am i gonna put it i just got a bunch of the cream on myself [Music] oh my gosh that's messy it's so full it just wants to squeeze out every time i bite it hmm there's no way i'm not eating this messy for sure it's like pretty much impossible i tried but it just wasn't happening hmm um i don't know how you'd eat that thing nicely oh no i want to eat that like at a party or something i'm just gonna have to worry about all the stuff i drop on myself later until after the video is done too because i'm dropping so much down there okay so let's go on to the peanut butter patty so this one like a lot of these desserts i actually feature in a lot of my like home video videos even though i know don't i don't do that many of those lately but i'll usually have these like this guy for dessert in those videos a lot of the times this is one of my favorites from that bakery this one reminds me a lot of like a reese's a reese's pieces cup except with like a hard outside instead of like soft which actually i think i may i think i might like that more than a reese's cup just with the crunchy outside and the soft inside i think it gives like a nice contrast to it um i definitely would not be able to do this without a cup of tea for sure okay what do i want to move on to next i'm gonna go through this pretty fast i just love sweets and i go through sweets so easily let's go with the oreo truffle this is another one i've had in my past videos too the thing is it doesn't really remind me of anything oreo-ish it's just really chocolatey to me but it's still just really good so i really like it i guess it's kind of similar to the like outside chocolate part of an oreo so chocolatey though anyway slim want to come over here in the video i'm not sure maybe i can entice them with one of these things or not okay so let's try some of the macarons the thing about this whole thing was it was like six desserts for 14 or something and actually like two of these i got from another bakery because i they didn't have butter tarts at this bakery but everything else i got so there's six for 14 and just one i want to get all three of these macarons because i want a different color of each but it put me at like 13 items so it was like one over having the deal because it was six for fourteen dollars so i ended up paying like 30 bucks because it was like whatever instead of getting to the mall for 28 i had to pay the extra just one of these was like 275 or something um that was really good let's have this teal one now so oh those are really good i actually only had their macaroons once before so i didn't really remember what they tasted like those are really really good though i'm surprised like i mean i'm not surprised this is a really good bakery but these might be end up being like my favorite thing of all these i don't know those are just really super tasty holy i'm pleasantly surprised like i don't remember being that good last time i had it okay so i need to talk up on my tv i don't even know how much hopefully they have enough for this entire video i mean i don't have much left but okay so a few videos ago i was talking about canadian foods and so i actually went and made sure to get a couple canadian desserts here so that would be the so i have the butter tarts and a nanaimo bar there we go so these are canadian so here's an oh my name is falling apart on me oh no it actually broke on me earlier but it's like different layers of chocolate on the top and then custard in the middle and then i'm not even sure what the bottom is maybe one of my fellow canadians can explain it better in the comments what it's made out of i've just sort of always eaten nanaimo bars without knowing what they're made of that's really like a christmas dessert in my family we have those a lot during christmas oh that's hot okay so let's have the butter tarts then so like i said i had to go to a different bakery just to get the butter tarts because this is the one thing my favorite bakery did not have which they do make them but they did not have them at the time i was in there and i was like well i really wanted to have them i felt the video was gonna be incomplete without butter tarts and then when i went to that bakery i'm like well i'm here now so i bet i might as well get two instead of just one so i got one plain and one raisin and that's a good butter tart though too from this other bakery so it's like this cup of dough kind of thing and it's filled with like it's like brown sugar and butter kind of thing filling oh my gosh pulling everywhere though i definitely prefer the butter tart over the nanaimo bar for sure i think the butter tarts superior i'm sure some not some people from nanaimo might get angry though they might disagree with me um it's so good hmm oh okay oh that is hard too so these two guys here they're i also i also feature them in my videos too for dessert i have these guys a lot so a peanut butter ball and a rum ball and i know this guy's gonna be super peanut buttery it's almost like peanut butter cookie dough or something just pure peanut butter oh my gosh okay so there we go the rum ball i like these guys a lot too these are really good i guess there's actually supposed to be rum in there oh it doesn't really taste rummy to me i'm sure like the rum burns off in the cooking process um oh yeah okay i'm definitely going through a lot of tea for sure i think i got maybe one cups worth left in there which might just be enough to finish this get me through these two last big guys let's go along with the cream puff then i was just gonna be as messy as that eclair was this is just filled with cream oh my god it's gonna go everywhere yeah i guess slim just did not want to join us today he like literally didn't even stick around for a minute this time around he just looked like he had other business to attend to he just took right off and went somewhere else like i said he's usually at least like sitting right over there watching me even if he's not in the video but i don't know like i said he just went somewhere he had something to do i guess sort of like making sure he's not actually behind me as i say that just being really quiet hmm i actually think i like the eclair more than that cream puff i'm not sure why they're not that much different really except that claire has chocolate on top of maybe the chocolate added a nice little touch to it i'm not sure so let's get on to this apple fritter like i said they're so my this bakery i go to they're known for having the best apple fritters in town and usually when i walk into this bakery that's the first thing they'll actually ask me is like getting an apple fritter and sometimes i'll be like i'll feel bad because i'll be like oh no and they'll kind of like sound disappointed when i say that but i'm not getting not getting an apple fritter that these are really like they're they're good value too they're like they're cheap and they're big like that's a big apple fritter and that is dense too very slim let's see if i can entice them with an apple fritter come on oh yeah he's good oh you know that yeah i know you want that apple fritter no just gonna sniff it not even a little bit there you go apple fritter no oh well thanks at least for showing your face there you go this is gosh so thick and dense it's gonna weigh in my stomach so heavy after i'm finished yes there you go there you go i know what you want okay oh let's finish this guy off some hair is floating around oh gosh so [Music] um there we go oh my gosh that was a lot of sugar for sure that apple fritter was a lot to handle at the end that was like those things are big and those are heavy that's a big high oh my god that's a lot of apple fritter for sure like that's probably twice the size it's like of a normal apple fritter you get like i know another place say like tim hortons or something around here which is really good for its value though it was like 275 or something but if you're gonna get one of those it's like that's almost all you need but at least if you're a normal person that's like a lot of food in there and a lot of sugar for sure but i haven't actually had one of their apple fritters in a long time all the times i've gone in there recently i've always just got like a two or three of their little desserts kind of thing for my supper kind of videos so i enjoyed that because like i said i haven't had that in a long time oh that was a lot of sugar that's gonna be like my sugar video for like maybe another month like i usually say because i only i can only handle one of these videos every so often eating that eating that much sugar is just like way too hard on the body for sure even compared to like any of my other videos where i eat a lot of food just when it's just pure sugar like that i'm gonna be like i'm gonna have a sugar high for a while now i'm probably gonna keep you up all night or something i hope you guys enjoyed that video give it a like if you did subscribe to keep seeing me eat more food like that i hope to see you guys in the next video until then peace out", "c-VpsyL7Ub0": "(calm music) Hi, I'm Becky Striepe\nfrom Glue & Glitter and today we are gonna\nmake these super delicious, super easy vegan apple fritters and we're gonna make\nthem in the air fryer. I love this recipe, my\nkid loves this recipe. He loves it because it's\ncrunchy, sweet and delicious. I love it because it takes\njust a few minutes to make and just a few ingredients that we usually actually have on hand. Before we get to the recipe, I wanna introduce you to my air fryer. This is the ZenChef Pro XXL and ZenChef is sponsoring this recipe. Thank you, ZenChef. If you follow my blog or my\nYouTube channel, chances are you've heard me talk about\nthis air fryer before. I love it. Even if they weren't a sponsor, this would be my favorite air\nfryer that I've ever owned. It's nice and big at 5.8 quarts. There's plenty of room to\ncook for my family of three plus a little bit of leftovers for one of our lunches the next day. It's also easy to clean, it's easy to use. I just love it so much. I think you will too. All right, so enough about my air fryer. Let's make some fritters. Like I said, there's\nonly a few ingredients and the first thing that you're gonna need to make your apple fritters is an apple. I would choose any sweet,\ncrunchy apple that you like. Don't go with something mealy\nlike a Red Delicious though. Go with an apple that\nyou would wanna snack on and we're just gonna slice it and it's not even gonna\ntake the whole apple. (calm music) The next thing we're gonna do\nis make some cinnamon sugar. Let me grab a bowl. So to make cinnamon sugar, the first thing that you need is sugar. We'll just scoop out\none tablespoon of sugar and then one level teaspoon of cinnamon and then you don't actually\nhave to use a whisk for this but a metal fork on a\nceramic bowl is really loud so I'm using this whisk\njust for quietness. Feel free to use a fork to\nmix up your cinnamon sugar. The next thing that we need is the secret ingredient for this recipe and that is a tube of\ntinned crescent rolls. I'm sure you've seen these\nin the refrigerator section at the grocery store. They're really easy to find. A lot of even the conventional brands are accidentally vegan so\njust check the ingredients, look for, usually it's dairy like milk but sometimes they'll contain egg. Just keep checking the ingredients. There are always a ton of options and what you're actually ideally\nlooking for is a four pack. See how small this one is in my hand? If you can't find a\nfour pack, that's okay. You can just open an\neight pack, cut it in half and save that other half for another time. All right, so it pops open. We're just gonna slice this up into four equal size pieces and then start with your first piece and you wanna kinda\nflatten it out like this. I kind of form it into\na little cup like this and then just grab a little bit of apple. I like to be ambitious. Some of this apple's\ngonna probably fall out and that's okay and just kind of start working\nthe apple into the dough. So I like to kinda get it\nall in the middle like that and then just flatten it out and the dough will kind of\nfill in as you flatten it. Once you have got your fritter formed, drop it into the cinnamon sugar and roll it around to coat it really well. There's actually gonna\nbe extra so don't be shy about getting a nice\ngenerous coating on there and then it's time to\nline the air fryer basket so it'll be ready to\nput these fritters in. Let's pull the basket out. Slide this stuff out of the way. Really, I should have lined\nthe basket first but I forgot. So here's the basket\nand what you're gonna do is take a piece of parchment\npaper and you're gonna cut it so that it covers most of\nthe inside of the basket but doesn't go up the sides. It's okay if little\ncorners go up the sides but you don't wanna cover\nthe sides of the basket and you wanna leave a little\nbit of room around the edges so that air can circulate. So I'm just eyeballing it. We might need to do some trimming down. This one looks smaller. So that's pretty good and\nI'll just trim it to here. Once your basket is lined, put\nthat first fritter in there and then we're gonna repeat this process with the rest of the dough and most of the rest of the apples. You probably aren't gonna\nuse all of that apple. (calm music) Okay, great, so as you can see, you've got your four apple\nfritters in the basket and they're spaced out a little bit so if they do decide to\nexpand in the air fryer, there's room for them to do that and now we're just gonna\nput it in the air fryer, cook it for six minutes at 370 and we're back. So it's been six minutes\nand it's time to flip. When I flip stuff in my air fryer, I like to use these rubber tongs because I can't tell you how\nmany times I've burned myself flipping things in the air fryer before I started using these. You don't have to use rubber tongs but you definitely do not\nwanna use something metal to flip things in the air fryer. Even when you have this\nbit of parchment paper here on the bottom, you still\nrisk scratching your basket and if you scratch it then the nonstick is gonna work as well. So definitely use something\nthat's rubber or wood. Don't use metal. So we're just gonna\ngive these a little flip so they cook evenly. And we're back again. So these are all done cooking\nand they're ready to serve. Just like when you were flipping, I recommend that you use your tongs because I would hate\nfor you to burn yourself just before you were about to\neat delicious apple fritters. So let me grab my plate and you're just gonna pull them right out. I like to flip them flat side down. I feel like they just\nlook better that way. Now, you can serve these just as is but usually when you get an apple fritter, it includes some kind of an icing, maybe some kind of a\npowdered sugar on top. So for this recipe, because I wanted to limit the ingredients, instead of making an icing from scratch, we're just gonna use maple syrup on top and then if you wanna get really decadent, sprinkle some of that leftover\ncinnamon sugar on top too. I hope that I answered all of\nyour questions in the video. If you have any questions or\ncomments that I didn't address, feel free to drop a comment below. I'm always happy to help. Happy cooking.

"uWbJeHduYk4": "[Music] i've always been a baker but now people know it [Music] so today i'm gonna be making apple fritters and although i have made apple fritters in the in the past um it was when i first started baking so i still wasn't well known in techniques and how to really make things so i'm making them um this time friend really likes them it's one of his favorite donuts so i'm excited to make it [Music] so the very first thing i'm gonna do is start peeling my apples and i'm gonna peel two apples for this specific recipe and i'm just going to um cut my apples one more time just since just in smaller pieces and then i'm going to use my ninja and grate them just so they're not so big and they're easier to fold into my dough okay so how about we start on those dry ingredients so in my mixing bowl i'm gonna add one and a half cups of flour quarter cup of sugar two teaspoons of baking powder half teaspoon of salt two teaspoons of cinnamon and just using my hands because i like using my hands i'm going to mix in all my dry ingredients together try to get them in good and i will continue by adding half cup of apple sauce and i'm just gonna go ahead and mix that in and lastly i will add half cup of plant-based milk [Music] i'm not gonna lie the dough is a little wet it's a little too gooey for my own taste but i'm just gonna go with the recipe and not add anything else and the last thing i'm gonna do is fold in my apples so i am going to be frying my apple fritters in oil so i'm gonna add about two inches of oil into my pot and then i'm going to scoop out about 1 3 cup of my dough and start frying my apple fritters okay these actually look really good once you put them in the in the oil i thought they were gonna kind of fall apart in the oil but i'm glad that they're still intact so i'm really excited they look really good and you do want to fry your donut on each side for about a minute um just keep checking it keep keep flipping it i don't really like to give specific instructions when frying stuff just go with it you know you you know when something's about to start burning oh that looks really good and the color is perfect i'm really excited i bet you they're gonna taste delicious [Music] oh yummy i am so excited to try these with the glaze [Music] so this is a very simple glaze that i'm going to be using for my fritters so it's super simple simple pimple so in my bowl i'm gonna add three cups of powdered sugar one third cup of plant-based milk and half teaspoon of vanilla and i'm just going to whisk all of my ingredients until i end up with my delicious glaze my apologies i thought i filmed myself dipping my fritters in my glaze but i didn't but all you're gonna do is dip them and end up with a glazed delicious apple fritter wow

goodness possible coffin of possible goodness no no no the coffin of possible goodness this is going to be the cinnamon roll review cue the intro what is up everyone it is the endorsement and it is time for another review this is where i try something and tell you if you should like it or not i can be very persuasive all right we have some warnings with this video caution hot in fuego uh i say frio no i'll say color yeah i'm bilingual all right so yeah i've already reviewed the uh blueberry muffin uh from mccafe uh the brand new item and i've also reviewed the apple fritter so this is what we got going today the final uh brand new product adam the woo this is the cinnamon roll check it out right there in all of its uh iced glory uh so this was the most expensive of the three i have to double check the price on this i wanna say it was 249 it might be 279 but we will definitely uh stack check that yeah we don't want it to be a a rookie move you know what i'm saying uh so we're just going to go into the skate man style i'm not using a knife before they gave me a knife and fork but we are outside in the elements and you know what happens when you're in the elements caveman style let's go brand new mccafe cinnamon roll mcdonald's let's go all right i think the rain and the sky is about to open up in the rain is about to come uh but what i uh reacted to there uh the cream cheese uh frosting right there is something i've never tasted before it's almost a cross between like cream cheese and like marshmallow if that makes any sense now i've eaten my weight in a cinnabon cinnabon bonsai shout out ricky martin or uh what's the other song all right i know it's on the tip of my tongue it'll come to me uh but yeah this does um i don't know the flavor of that cream cheese frosting is what kind of threw me off and this one as well as the other two is a very dense uh pastry uh i want it a little more airy and a little more light and a little more flaky but this thing is good i think it's lacking a little bit on the cinnamon i think this frosting kind of overwhelms and you're seeing not much of the cinnamon except in the uh swirls right there so second bite all right here we go here we go yeah cinnamon roll needing more cinnamon check it out yeah all right i guess that's all i can really say about that i'm a little disappointed in that it was a little too dense for me i did not have enough cinnamon for me uh but the one good part was i enjoyed the flavor of that cream cheese frosting very much i'm a fan of marshmallow and that icing definitely has a marshmallow vibe i'm probably way off on that because they do call it a cream cheese icing but yeah so i like this uh but i guess i was just a little disappointed i saved it for last because they always say save the best for last so in my head i'm like cinnamon roll last it's going to be great um it's okay uh and i give mcdonald's some credit for kind of releasing three new bakery items the line at the uh drive-thru for breakfast was crazy it was about uh 15 deep uh over at mcdonald's and i haven't had a breakfast at mcdonald's uh a lot in the past six months or so so i'm not sure if that's a normal occurrence uh but maybe these three brand new items are bringing people in i don't know so uh yeah that's all i got to say about that uh let's give it a rating shall we on a scale of 1 to 100 with one meaning don't even waste your money and 100 being the promised land of i'm going to get the brand new mccafe cinnamon roll from mcdonald's a rating of wow a little disappointed but um 80. i'm going to give that a straight up 80. that's an eight and a zero together coming together to form an 80. that's an 8 out of 10 for all you keeping score at home um i liked it just didn't love it john lovitz uh but yeah so there you go another review in the books please like comment share and subscribe also please do not forget to check me out on instagram and twitter that is social media

fritter and now the cinnamon roll thank you for joining me and we'll see you soon with some more reviews bye all right bonus footage i said in the first video in the blueberry muffin video i asked

cinnamon roll and which one came out on top let me know in the comments below and uh yeah nice little uh contest no prize no prize just the knowledge that uh you're smart you're smarter than me because i picked the cinnamon roll and i don't think that came out on top so there you go uh", "FxxP1IHZ630": "hi guys today I'll show you how to make apple fritters these are a quick and easy snack or dessert all the ingredients and measurements are in a link right below this video I've peeled and cut up my apples into small chunks heat up a little butter in a pan add the apples pinch of salt and saute for a few minutes leave them in a single layer and they'll get some color on them add sugar ground cinnamon makes just until the sugar melts remove the apples from the pan and put them aside to cool down heat up enough oil to fry the fritters I'm using a vegetable oil to make the batter to a bowl add all purpose flour baking powder salt and sugar mix this up for the wet ingredients we'll need whole milk a large egg oil whisk this pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients make a smooth batter add the cooled apples mix it in will drop tablespoons of batter into the hot oil will coat the fritters and cinnamon sugar to a bowl add sugar and ground cinnamon just mix it up if you don't want to use cinnamon sugar you can always coat the fritters and powdered sugar the oil is hot now we can fry the apple fritters drop them by the tablespoon they will puff up and you want the insights to cook try to spread them a little when you pour the batter just lay them across the oil flip them over when they're golden brown they cook very quickly you can drag them right into the cinnamon sugar you can see the soft apple inside the middle is cooked it's a little crispy on the outside it's so good and it was very quick to make because they're smaller and a little bit flatter they cook properly inside the apples are soft and have flavor because we sauteed them first if you don't like your fritters to sweet coat only one side of the fritters with a cinnamon sugar sometimes I eat them plain without any sugar on top since we added sugar to the batter the fritters are already a little bit sweet I love to eat these hot fritters with a cup of tea or coffee since they cook in about two minutes you're gonna whip these up very quickly make these and let me know how you like them

with part two of the epic canadian candy box yeah this is an epic box that was sent to us by katie and andy last week we tried all the snacks or the crisps and if they're anything to go by i can't wait to try them so excited they picked out so many good snacks and i think so many of them were right up our street yeah and things we hadn't tried from canada so i can't wait for this box it looks so delicious i was thinking before we start shall we do another couple guesses because i really enjoyed that thank you katie and andy if you didn't watch the video last week definitely click the link up there and you can watch the first half we will send this little booklet which is manitoba isms a dictionary and basically it's explaining what some of the work yeah sentences and things you say and we had a little guess and you were so good at that i got a couple right yeah so i was only really guessing don't read them all otherwise you know i'm gonna do one here for you okay what is a d a d is it a type of person in canada manitoba specifically no it's a term used in hockey for when a player fakes an opponent out of position i'll do one more okay what is a oh that's like um at the end of a sentence you go a like right canadian slang often used at the end of a sentence to elicit agreement for example it snowed a lot last night and we have said so many times that you guys in canada say hey and people say they don't say that but it's in and i get that maybe not every part of canada but like a lot of the people we know from canada say i don't know yeah but also i think we say a here as well especially in the north but it's a slightly different it's not a it's like a a a okay what is a bdi um it's someone who's got like really small little dark eyes no it's a bridge driving a classic retro driving located near a bridge that features ice cream and other sweet treats i'd love to go there what's a garbage mitts garbage mitts uh they're the gloves you wear when you go put your rubbish out because it's so cold it says a type of mitt worn in winter that looks similar to the ones worn by waste collectors the thing is you get so cold in canada if you were like a bin man yeah the fact that you're in and out it must be quite damaging to your skin so they must really wrap up remember we spoke to james who lives in manitoba and he'd done some work on the roads i think he said yeah and he said about having like a whole onesie type yeah and like his beard was crusty because it's like iced yeah it's not funny could you imagine it was so grassy your beard just like just froze over and you just like what happens to me sometimes that my beard feels like wet after i've been out in the cold because of the condensation so then that wet must like freeze if it's cold enough anyway shall we crack on with this awesome box what should we start with kate should we go omg yes now we have tried something from omg i feel like we haven't i really recognize this branding but i don't think we've tried both of those so we've got milk chocolatey clusters and vanilla fudge clusters and these are both made in winnipeg and manitoba so mine are vanilla fudge clusters with almonds and toffee these ones are milk chocolate clusters with almonds and toffee they're the same but milky white cheers cheers well that's a big one hmm i only recently realized how often i say and me say wow well i'm still eating before i can actually talk talk it's like the way i react and so you can either have a good mm-hmm or a bad or inquisitive um hopefully i can even try these are much sweeter these ones aren't they when you go to someone's house around easter time in england and they've made rice crispy treats right but with a generic chocolate that reminds me of lorna used to make the chocolate i really like those because it didn't say on the outside but they've got a really nice bit of biscuit in yeah there's biscuit and isn't there almost reminds me a little bit of like a very rough more chunky tiffin like a chocolate tiffin really nice i really like these yeah that's a really good vanilla fudge yeah i don't know what it was like the fact that you tried these first but these are my number one and then they've got a nice sweetness and um like you say vanilla fudge almost sometimes has no flavor yeah whereas that actually has something and it was creamy it was actually kind of filled my mouth like white chocolate uh what are you giving those out tim i'm gonna give them a nine out of ten i really enjoyed them i think they'd be really good with a cup of tea i would still prefer the milk chocolate over the white i'm going white nine milk eight okay i think we have something else that's kind of the same sort of vibe and that's utophia this is a really cool package so it's handcrafted toffee yeah caramel artisanal cashews buttery toffee and swirl chocolate gluten free made in winnipeg manitoba the first batches were made in the creator's home kitchen and sold at craft markets through the holiday season since then the company has expanded through manitoba saskatchewan and ontario that's so cool that it was actually made from home and now they're like a big brand this look at this house oh that looks nice it looks amazing oh wow i thought it was going to be like a i think it is like a brit yeah it's brittle wow that's fancy that's really nice doesn't it love the swirly pattern on top even though it's really hard to break yeah not for your team i thought we were really going to break our teeth oh wow it almost turns into a chewy caramel mmm it's funny how it's so brittle when you bite it it's chewy [Music] this is so good right really creamy and rich almost like an english mmm so do you know why another reason why i love that so much because it's cashews oh instead of peanuts and i feel like cashews are much more like creamier and milder and crumbly and crumbly yeah whereas sometimes peanuts can be a little bit yeah do you get what i mean i have grown to like peanuts but that is absolutely delicious the chocolate on top was so good and the fact that it turned more chewy afterwards these are 10 out of 10 what about for you yeah 10 out of 10. if you can get your hands on those definitely buy some of those the thing is there's so many things with people peanuts so it's nice when there's a different night okay that was awesome great start to the video should we do those big turks because i feel like they're kind of similar aren't they there now we have tried those before but not in this bag oh they're turkish delight i thought these were like clusters you know when we've had a big turk bar was it not like a mr big no is it a turkish delight a turkish delight wrapped in oh and this is mini versions that's cool why let us know down below are you a turkish delight fan oh these are so cute i wish we had like a mini version we don't really get much um we used to get cadbury's turkish delight but you can't really find that anymore no what's the one you get now fries they do yeah i love that they're small and your turkish likes always much harder than ours not harder just chewier it's like a jelly sweetener isn't it you know what that reminds me of yeah marvelous creations yeah because that's why i don't like our turkish delight from what i remember it's quite perfumed and a bit soft more like a jelly that's really nice that's like a sweet wow that's a big win isn't it what are you going to give them out of 10 10 i think i will as well actually and i think i preferred it in mini form really than the bathroom i loved the bar like i said i thought the bar was like a master bag i can't remember it oh that was so good so we've got two things that are mint do you remember these yes the russian mints this is delecto canadian classics and i have finally matured i can now say i am a mint shock fan oh well done i've really got there you know i used to watch this program called super nanny and basically is this where you get all your life advice basically she said a child needs to try something 14 times before they know they don't like something really and obviously there will be times where they love it immediately but and on the 13th time you realize you like milk chocolate it just shows that like sometimes you have to just try things more and more it's like olives i never used to like that but i really wanted to like olives to look fancy i guess it depends what it is okay ganong delecto canadian classics pept creams established in 1873 ganong is canada's oldest independently family owned and operated chocolate company all products are manufactured in scents stephen new brunswick so yeah i can't believe i'm the one saying can we try the mint chocolate but with it being peppermint i feel like i feel like i'm still more of a mild um mint cream person cheers these are so cute they're like little chocolate drops not the chocolate buttons um since 1873. pepper creams chocolate excellence establish establi or canada i don't know why you always sound like a footballer would you say that so it is from a scale of mint chocolate it's more minty isn't it because it's peppermint it's nice but i do think when it's like a fondant tea cream mint chocolate things are so nice they're the perfect like after dinner chocolate on them oh that's so good right or even just on a thursday afternoon yeah alright why thursday so it's a good day isn't it chocolate um it's almost the weekend just getting you through monday start the week no i think they'd just easily be as good on a tuesday morning and what i like is that they're minis quite nice and small they're so good just to pop in and just have a refresh yeah okay so we've got two modern things oh cool those ones we haven't tried before these are just the salted chocolates are they these are yes i believe so what are you giving those pepper creams i'm gonna give them a nine out of ten yeah i'm gonna give them nine and a half i don't actually know i'll give them a nine because i'm pretty sure these are ten that's what i was going to say i think these are better but they are really good i love these little boxes they're cool aren't they they're kind of dated in a way yeah i kind of really like that winnipeg's first chocolate making business opened in 1959 russian mints from morden's of winnipeg won top prize for best chocolate piece at the world fair in new orleans in 1984. well i'm not surprised because they were fabulous yeah um we always say new orleans but don't some people go new orleans yeah also when we got these from julie they had all melted so we might actually now see what they should look like nice fabulous much too good for children much too good for alex hmm oh you're actually quite totally different experience but actually what you know a hard bit in the middle i thought it'd be soft you can see that there's like a shell of chocolate but that there in the middle is obviously a different slightly different texture isn't it but i really like crazy it's a completely different yeah experience i love the bite and obviously there's a lot of oil in there because last time we saw it all seeped out and it was all on the package as well but it's like held in there yeah that's really cool isn't it and we have the assorted chocolate oh no this really is [Music] much too good for children oh my words this is literally much to god for children god now he's there much too good for children you need to attack a bit more much too good for children give me another note all right now you need to go much too good for children then you actually need to like grab one afterwards much too good for children yes that's better there we go but there's nothing that says well i fancy look at this one this is like a little chocolate square but it looks like it might have bits and nuts yeah this is like a marble creation [Music] that got a flavor in it that's not fruity it almost tastes like palma violets that's so crazy it's fruity i might try google like a caramel coffee nuts yeah pink and delight hmm these are all very good i'll have tried there's literally nothing that i can oh is that like a peppermint cream yeah look at that it's like a patty that's so thick oh is that like strawberry [Music] this mint one's amazing i don't know what the flavor look crazy how different you could change yeah whoa i'm loving that cream it's delicious this cream here is like a cream egg this is such a nice experience they're delicious it's just not the done thing you wouldn't just get a box of chocolates like this and just have a bite of one bite of all of them would you this is so cool i'm really enjoying them they're so delicious you're right i think that's a strawberry cream or raspberry that's just a chocolate block try that these are so good do you have a favorite in there oh my god is that caramel yeah caramel think that one oh that raspberry maybe so good i love the mint ones but this selection has been insane and this was what i was hoping out of the russell stover box yeah and the kind of russell stover kind of let us down a bit didn't it yeah their assorted box isn't as good as their individual is that individual whereas these boxes are delicious yeah wow these have been really good this patty is so good so good you throw it wow that's really good isn't it that was such a good experience i'm super excited about this we've got some really awesome looking gummies and one of the other frank items so in our first box we tried a lot of frank chips and we found out that uh it's a it's a product that's sold in canadian entire which is a canadian hardware automotive leisure and home goods chain um so they have recently introduced canadians to frank their private label brand of confectionary and home products they have punny tag lines and be sure to read the caption from the back so do you want to read that and this says frank says hello dolly and these are dolly mix jelly fondant candy that's so smart this says you had me at hello or was it the colorful pieces of candy that made my taste buds sing call me old-fashioned but there's something extra sweet about dolly that's good isn't it i didn't realize dolly mixtures were a thing in canada as well my favorite dolly mixtures are these jellies oh yeah and like the um these pink squares oh yeah then my least favorite dolly mixture is the brown one yeah these are good they smell great like these things are like fondant like on a cake isn't it it's basically just sugar isn't it they're slightly harder than the ones yeah they feel quite and smaller they're not overly sweet a nice flavor what do you think though because we have so many like dolly mixtures here then they don't taste exactly the same so it is a bit funny tasting do you know what i mean yeah because you see them and you expect them to taste one way but they don't but they are good they are very good and very nice yeah but it's funny how different like the same idea do you want to go maynards or twizzlers uh maynards this is maynard's tropical swedish berries oh they feel nice yeah look at the colors they're like milky that's not what i was expecting they're opaque i was expecting them to be um i wonder if they're mixed translucent we've got tropical island passion fruit pina colada peachy punch which one do you want i'm gonna go passion fruit i'm gonna go beachy punch and then we're gonna go pina colada right here we'll go passion fruit the tropical is really nice the orange there's a beachy punch i would have to try them all they're really nice texture oh the tropicals love oh no the passion fruits are lovely there's the beachy punch kind of cherry no not really like when you press them they kind of feel like they'd be a bit hard but they've got a really nice bite and it's got a tube but it's not the chew that sticks in your teeth it's in my teeth but it's coming out they are very good not what i was expecting because looking at those i don't think the photos look like what they look like they're so milky i think they've just made them look shinier because that's more appealing so i was just expecting them to be those clear kind of jellies but they are delicious absolutely delicious what are you giving those we give them a nine out of ten yeah i'm gonna give them a nine out of ten they're pretty up there with some of the best sweets we've tried twizzlers gummies nouveau and what's it say here this says made in canada made in canada mango and strawberry oh and pineapple and strawberry now this is why i'm passionate sure sorry that's three times because i saw that down there and then i saw one up there and then i saw one over there sorry this is what i wanted to know because twizzlers are massive in america so can you get these twizzlers gummies in america too i wonder if they're as big in canada well i think you need a tongue twister yeah try the sweet tongue twister taste of twizzlers tongue twisters gummies try the sweet tongue twisting taste of twizzler's tongue tongue twisting gummies that is really try the sweet tongue twisting taste of twizzler's tongue twisting gummies let me see if i can go faster try the sweet tongue twisting taste of twizzlers tongue twisting gummies that really reminds me there's this really funny take top video but this woman is saying she struggles with like talking sometimes and there's this thing which is one sock cutter he cut socks two sock cutters they cut socks three sock cutters anyway she ends up putting all these other words in as you can guess i always said one of them there but it was really funny oh that's a lovely flavor so far these are all the same oh two different flavors there green pineapple and strawberry that's funny you don't have to mix that purple and red is passion fruit and strawberry these are so much better than twizzlers they are aren't they frizzers should just make these although i'm sure there's people who do like them what's people who like licorice oh it's like a mouth with the twister poking out oh my word i thought it was a um a shell yes i did oh yeah like a conch yeah and it like kind of the crab comes down away yeah don't look at my tail what one do you prefer oh they're all kind of the same to me i think the strawberry mango which was the first mango and strawberry is delicious yeah they're they're very mild in flavor but they're so delicious they are i think i'm giving those 10 out of 10. i'm going to they were really delicious i'll give them a 7 out of 10. yeah i'd much prefer these really no i didn't really i much prefer those yeah i prefer the flavors the chew and what's so good about this is i like every single flavor pineapple and strawberry i liked every single flavor of this mango shall we no i know but that is fab we'll have to agree to disagree we'll have to disagree okay so what would you like to do next finish this week yeah let's finish the suites we've got nutty club nutty club so it's your club no wonder we've got these because you're part of that club aren't you you got your membership card now this is the bag the type of bag i talk about when we've had like the idaho spud things like over here something like this always comes across as like it's from a cheaper brand i've seen anything in the bag like this really you can't go to corner shop as much i don't go to corner shops so these are lemon drops and raspberry drops nutty club scotch bath gate limited began in winnipeg manitoba in 1903 as importers and manufacturer agents as part of an expansion do you mind as part of an expansion in the 1930s they opened offices warehouses and factories across canada and introduced nutty club their brand of confectionaries that's like um canadian tire yeah doing something else what i really like is that the red ones are raspberry [Music] these if we could go anywhere would be perfect for a flight you know for that moment when you take off or land and you need something to suck on so your ears don't pop i really enjoy though that's a really nice lemon really nice raspberry flavor it's not too like artificial it really tastes like is it quite sharp or is that mm-hmm well it starts off quite mild delicious raspberries candy man you're a different part of the song man i thought you were i thought you were ready for candy man candy man oh raspberry that's really good there's some of the best lemon drops i've had really the flavor was really good it's funny like you said when you see something in a package like that and the branding is a bit old-school you think are these going to be any good they look like the kind of thing you get at fair not necessarily sure how good the quality of them is but the flavour is really really delicious okay moving on to some snacks yes timmy's yeah let's get him out tim hortons apple fritter that's a good flavor yeah so is this like a breakfast bar um chewy granola bar prepared in canada made with canadian oats and these say new so i'm wondering if this is a new flavor or if it's a new bar it's interesting they do these kind of products because i suppose if you're a big fan of tim hortons like you'd probably see this in the shop and actually get them yeah especially if it was next to the coffee you're already picking up oh my word see that says bain yes yeah there's something that the kardashians always get and they're called like bain yet yeah and the translation is chewy so i wonder if that's like partly why they're called that is it good hmm i thought it was going to be really hard and questions well it's been yet hmm it's really nice i used to love the quaker oats no the chewy bars yeah because obviously this isn't like a sweet really no it's kind of between a sweet and a snack but it's got a really nice apple fritter flavor hasn't it i think apple's a good flavor to do in something like this because in the morning as an adult you don't want anything to like um fake fruit you know apple feels quite natural yeah do you get what i'm trying to say i think i've got an idea you know like pop-tarts one of the ingredients and this is called fancy molasses they're actually really good i usually don't go for like granola bars but i think that's mainly one too healthy for me which we've learned they're not actually that healthy but number two they're usually so kind of just like brittle and like dry yeah whereas that was chewy and delicious yeah okay shall we move on to biscuits yes let's we've got some girl scout cookies which is exciting and we've got dad's oatmeal chocolate chip cookie are they called girl scouts in canada though because here it says guides they're guides aren't they girl guides cookies that's good these look nice though don't they everything she wants to be poor quell a revs girl guide cookies girl guides of canada chocolate and vanilla these are sold every summer in the fall slash winter they sell chocolate mint cookies which are my fave unfortunately they're not being sold right now but i'll be sure to send you a box once they are on your teeth isn't that funny because our girl guides over here don't do this do they no they don't in on the continent of north america and they don't really fundraise for themselves if that makes or anything i really like how there's two flavors in here yeah that's cool isn't it good idea because then you can have a vanilla one if you prefer and i can have a chocolate one let us know down below if you were a canadian girl guide i was a cub and then i was a scout and i was a brownie do you remember your your honor right should i do it again yeah the brownie guide law i promise that i'll do my best to love my god to serve my queen and my country to help other people and to keep a brownie guideline to keep the brownie guide law well done a brownie guide and then it goes on to the other one i think the law is a brownie guide does i can't remember that one car that's sad and do you still uphold it now do you yeah yeah yeah every day i was basically um kicked out of brownies because i got too old that's when you go to guys yeah but i didn't want to go to guys why i was really shy as a child and like yeah i enjoyed the things when i was there but the thought of a girl camp was really scary to me and one time one time we slept in this like massive hole did i tell you this and my bed got pulled up your bed got pulled out with me on it one of the older girls i'm pretty sure hollywood's there and she'll back me up the bed got pulled out with you so you're on like these camper beds what's up him was that buddy mean bullying you're bullying you they pulled my bed because you were young it's the youngest so they pulled it into where maybe because they liked you maybe i used to like come to me i used to like cubs and scouts because um no they had a football team oh really so it was just an excuse to play football all the time yeah well i think i enjoyed going like to the camps and like getting to stay in tents and yeah you know right it's just outdoorsy things yeah that's fun when you're like i did really enjoy it in the end but i think that was kind of near the beginning and i think when you've got an older sister as well because they know your sister and things like that do you know what i mean yeah that chocolate one is really good yeah completely different to an oreo but doing a bit of that no do you want a better chocolate one yeah i might do well maybe the icing in there is so nice mmm nothing nicer hefty biscuit even though it's a cream icing it really tastes like icing doesn't it yeah that's what i was going to say i think they're so different from oreos because i think the biscuit on an oreo is very sweet whereas on these the biscuit is just very plain and biscuity yeah and it's all about the filling the filling in the white one is delicious and creamy and the chocolatey one is so it's like a chocolate buttercream it's delicious the icing in the vanilla ones really like got a lovely sweetness to it but not like you say with the biscuits not overpowering they're really good nice chunks well done girls well done cars i don't think they made them they sold them though and it's thanks to them well done ladies what are you giving those them i'm gonna give them a nine and a half out of ten i don't think they're as good as oreos but they are excellent that's the thing i'll probably just give them an eight in some ways i'm a bit scared that i might prefer one of those chocolate ones to a bourbon oh yeah they're really good these are dads these are from christine christie oh yeah we um what was it we tried we had some from them last time this is dad's oatmeal chocolate chip no artificial flavors or colors eight portion packs two cookies per pack for all the information since 1929 we have been baking dad's oatmeal cookies with quality ingredients and the goodness of rolled oats these cookies are a tasty snack that can be enjoyed at any time of day and look they obviously make something else try our try the delicious fudge cream cookies from christine collection they're not dad's though says here we've been baking dad's oatmeal cookies because he can't be bothered and put them in himself everyone dad might be different yeah some people's dad might be really like yeah yeah so they're crunchy oatmeal are they our dad will only make something if someone else won't do it remember when he wanted to get into sourdough i bought all this stuff and he was talking about it but yeah what he actually wanted was someone else to make it yeah he hasn't made any oatmeal cookies but he has done a few attempts at sourdough and no you still won't see our dad until we reach 1 million subscribers so click the subscribe button subscribing i'm gonna say i think the girl guides are better yeah i do really like these and actually for like a packaged up biscuit they're really good they're not as hard as i thought they were going to be they have a slight chew in the middle the chocolate chips they were quite um strong i like the texture it's giving it's almost like a carrot caramelized um flavor i think it's coming from the oats yeah it's like well you like oatmeal and raisin don't you yeah i'm probably only going to give those a six or seven i'll give them an 8 out of 10. right i really like them they are good though i do enjoy the branding okay and then our last biscuit to dry is something called a milk bone i think this is for dog's care i don't think so are you sure what you were hoping i would say that or you were going to do the pump i'm doing the pun trying to make you think i don't realize that oh so you were setting me up yeah for the yeah did i do it well yeah because you actually you were like i don't think they're dog biscuits really no what i'm trying to say is you was like i'm pretty sure they're dog biscuits and so you fell for it because yeah well look at him you know what i knew i was oh i'm undone good night i'm just so i'm all over the place because i'm cracking myself up i can't stop laughing we haven't even had that much sugar have we okay so katie and andy say because we could never forget sweet bob and penny our dog amelia loves these now i have already opened these because when we get our boxes bob sometimes always just sits there doesn't he and um because he always thinks something's for him and this time or something i think because quite a few times people have sent us dog treats so i think now when the boxes arrive he thinks are there dog treats yeah now our dogs do enjoy things like this but because they know there's other dog treats that we have that are kind of like bacon soft things what they do is they usually put it in their mouth kind of chuck it to the side and then they'll come back to it later so shall we get bob and penny yeah they probably won't eat it but they will eat them later yeah yeah bob is here and he's here too [Music] hi penny how are you i haven't seen you all day where have you been and i said last time bob was on he needs a haircut and he still hasn't had one he still needs one penny's had a bit of a haircut good boy penny's had a haircut bob's going next right you ready bob i need you want a treat it's time to perform bob do you want this same mum bob say mom bob

into that okay bob say hi to all of your lovely fans and say hi to amelia amelia yeah and garrick the gecko say hello bobs he's all a bit stunned because he's been i went into the other room and we've woken him up bob he's out i was like you want to treat me though oh you are so lovely bob aren't you poor bob hasn't been the best he um has been struggling to walk but he's been having some tablets and he's so much better now isn't he oh well done pops good boy bob say hi oh i love him he doesn't love me back but yes right bye so thank you so much for including bob and penny that's so lovely and sweet okay and then last but not least we have cherry blossoms finish up the only way we can't forget about this would you want to do that now yeah squirt some of that in your water blueberry razz i was going to say ross blueberry ross and this is crystal you know like chicago give them the old razzle dazzle give them the old razzle dazzle was it enough tim foil thing before so we have tried many of these things yeah but and i'm pretty sure it was a cherry blossom but i know the other ones we've tried were from america yeah we have had a queen i don't remember coming in massive box and in the foil i don't remember either do you remember this one because it's got like the nutty outside this smells amazing oh my word wow that's a thick boy look at that that is crazy it's nice because you have the nutty chocolate nuts and the chocolate which is very earthy and then you get the nice sweet syrup it's good isn't it good combo and then there's also a bit of fondant cream in there but that's nice isn't it you like that mm-hmm you've looked look like you found your equivalent of an oyster chocolate oyster oh that's really good that is so cool isn't that funny like it seems to be a really big thing in like canada and america like the cherry in the middle was like a pop of mmm considering i've never like been a fan of like cherry desserts like cherry pie in that that's actually really delicious i think because it's so runny it almost is like a dessert not like a chocolate well at first you think oh that's quite small for like a whole thing but then you get out it's massive yeah that's so decadent isn't it okay also just to let you know how i usually enjoy mine is i usually squirt it into the bottom and then i pour fizzy water because i like them as fizzy drinks look at that color that's a good color isn't it and in this it looks like a witch's brew especially in that which is fresh [Music] [Laughter] barracuda barracuda right oh that is really delicious it's got great flavor always when i've got them before i've never had this brand before obviously but when i've got the ones from america i've always gone for more the um strawberry lemonades and things like that i've never had a blueberry one yeah that's really delicious actually that is a really great flavor isn't it and sometimes i find with these things they've got like an almost drying on the tongue fla um texture yeah like because they're quite synthetic but actually this one is really good really good and what's good with these is you can make it as strong or as weak as you want and that's really nice i'm definitely going to enjoy that with some fizzy water ah that was nice little finisher off with that drink because we did try drinks in the last video but we forgot about that one yeah oh katie and andy thank you so much for that insane box part two was just as good as part one yeah definitely if you could only keep one half would you be team snack or team sweet on team savoury this was really nice especially because there was beer in the first half yeah true true five six seven eight oh i forgot about the show i forgot the shoulder [Music] yeah although i was enjoying the bit of tap but i was gonna go [Music] [Laughter] sure [Laughter] turned around [Laughter] i don't remember the career [Laughter] um my forehead hurts yeah okay treat of the week treat of the week um i think my treat of the week is gonna have to be oh i know the modern and i think mine has to be these or believe it or not oh no you did the big toe these oh yeah that was they were phenomenal doesn't that

just want you all to know that I love you all so very much life without Jesus Christ is lifeless I love you stay tuned may God richly bless you please do not forget to Like and subscribe to my channel bye bye on today's episode you will be making my delicious apple fritters recipe and this recipe is so so simple I'm gonna take about maybe three or four simple steps in making this okay so here I have my chopped apples and what I did with these is that I melted a tablespoon of butter and then I pour four chopped apples in there with one tablespoon of brown sugar and I cooked it for about four minutes and now it's ready as you can see and also in this container I do have four cup of all-purpose flour a tablespoon of ginger a tablespoon of nutmeg a tablespoon of baking powder a tablespoon of salt and I believe that's it here I have 1 cup of sugar I have 3 tablespoons of melted butter I'm gonna use 1 cup of milk 3 large eggs and this is the container which we will be using for the wet ingredients mixture okay if you are interested in learning how to make this wonderful rice if you please stay tuned and we take it step by step like I stated before what I do love all of you with the love of God please do if you are a big fan of cinnamon you can add a tablespoon of cinnamon which I've already done that so let's move on in making our ingredients the first thing I'm gonna pour in here will be our three large eggs our 1 cup of sugar and then I'm gonna mix this too I'll go ahead and have it all mixed up all of this mixing together you can go ahead and put in our 1 cup of milk and at the same time for in our 3 tablespoons of our melted butter okay I'll go ahead and completely mix this and come back and show you the final result move on to them and everything is mixed together let's go ahead and dump in our up holes sauteed apples if you will and let's mix that completely so the second step is all these spices and octopus flour and salt we are just going to mix everything together and go ahead and pour in our egg mixture so like I said before this making is really really simple [Music] let's go ahead and simply mix all of these together and once they're completely mix you come back and sty frying them okay continue to keep watching so the consistency should be something like this okay a bit sticky and stretchy and clicking tester so here I'm heating up the i/o and with the frying process obviously you need your oil and it's gonna be deep frying I have here some paper towel to absorb the oil once we scoop it out of the oil and I have my scooping stick and my skewer which I'm gonna be using to maneuver the fritters in the oil so please stay tuned as we start so now we can start frying let's go ahead and spit them out of the oil they already go ahead and continue frying the rest and then we show you the final result okay so with our final step I have four tablespoons of confectioners sugar or powdered sugar as some of you might know it and I'm just going to sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon and then a tablespoon full of milk and I'm just gonna mix it all together and drizzle it on top of our apple fritters don't they look beautiful so let's go ahead and mix it and then drizzle it on top of it [Music] [Music]", "60n6m26-Yq8": "Apple fritters with ginger\nbeer batter.

kitchen today we're making fried pies [Music] now this is a really old really simple really basic recipe you can use any fruit in it but i'm using apple today and i'm going to link the video where i did fried apples in here because that's what i'm using in this that is another super simple super basic super easy recipe you want to start with four to five cups of apples you just add some butter and some sugar and some cinnamon and cook them until they're tender but i'll put that video in here so you have all those measurements and everything and you know exactly how to make the fried apples if you don't want to do apples you can do cherry peach strawberry blackberry just anything and you can shortcut this by using pie filling in them if you want to you can get you know any store-bought pie filling or if you have canned pie filling that you've made at home any of that will work in this and you either want to slice or cut your apples up in little bitty cubes before you cook them or you want to bust them up after you cook them and you can use anything one of these you can use a potato masher you could use a whisk you could even take a butter knife and just slice through there and cut them up but you want to get them in little pieces because great big pieces of fruit and a little bitty pie if one pulls out half of your pie is not going to have any fruit left in it so go ahead and bust those up or cut them up before you cook them okay now for the pastry you it's basically a biscuit with egg in it i've got about two cups of self-rising flour here if you only have all-purpose you can add a little bacon powder and salt to it and it'll work just fine i'll put those measurements in the description of the video so you have those you can sift your flour or you can take a whisk and whisk it up that'll get the lumps out and it'll put a little air in it you need one egg because i said it's basically a biscuit with egg you need about a half a cup of milk you could also use buttermilk in this if you wanted just whatever kind of milk and you need a quarter of a cup of fat now i'm using butter you can use butter you can use lard you can use shortening whatever you want i like the flavor of the butter and you can even fry these in butter but if you fry them in butter the butter burns and you're going to have to clean that burn butter out of your pan every time before you add another pie to it or it will taste burned so it's really hard to fry them butter i like the flavor and if i was just making one or two for me and bread sometimes i do fry them in butter and the only other thing you need is enough oil to fry them in and you can use any oil you can use you can also fry them in shortening or lard entirely up to you again but you want about a quarter of an inch in your pan and then when you add a couple fried pies to that it's going to bring them up past the middle of the pie and that's what you want now for the crust i'm going to start by cutting my butter into my flour and you can use your hands for this you can use a pastry knife pastry blade pastry blade which is basically just some wires with a handle on it and you cut it in like this and i had one of those and it broke and when it broke i discovered that a whisk worked just about as good you want to mix it until it looks kind of like sand and i have i softened my butter a little bit i usually at least have it at room temperature and i know a lot of folks say you know freeze it and cut it in and stuff like that my granny never froze her butter when she was making biscuits or anything else it's just much easier to mix it in if it's softened so you don't need to worry about freezing it you don't need to make your life difficult and you can use your hands to mix this in you just kind of pinch it until it looks kind of sandy like this right here and that's all there is to that okay and the next step is i'm gonna mix my egg and my milk together and i'm gonna take me a fork and just kind of whisk that up a little bit um i don't want that whole egg in there and you could have just mixed the egg up by itself and then added the egg in the milk but you do want to make sure you get that egg pretty well uh mixed up like i said you don't want the whole egg in your dough and then you just pour your liquid into your flour mixture and now all i'm going to do is fold this together and again you can do this with your hands if you want to i usually use a spoon or a spatula because when i get the super sticky dough on my hands i have to take time to clean it off in order to be able to handle the dough and i think it's just easier to mix this with something a spatula or spoon and either want will work now this is a pretty sticky dough it's stickier than biscuit dough and it's a little more delicate and harder to handle because you're going to be rolling it out so thin but after you get it kind of turned into a dough ball flower your work surface and this mat here i'll tell y'all about these mats alex actually got this for me and it grips the countertop it's a dough mat it's got all these little gauges on it and stuff so you can tell how big around you're making your pastry which is nice and it doesn't slide around like the regular vinyl mats that i was using you want to be pretty generous with your flour when you spread it out because like i said this is sticky and you're going to work this a little bit more than you do biscuit dough but you're still not going to go crazy this is not um yeast bread you want to make sure you use plenty of flour or you'll have it stuck everywhere and just knead this a few times until it gets to a point where it's not too sticky to work with add more flour if you need to to get it to that point okay that's not too bad there i'm going to add a little more flour because it is sticking okay once you get it to the point where you can work with it you're going to cut it in eight pieces this is enough to make eight pies so just cut it in half if you don't have one of these dough blades i do recommend getting one of them you can get them at the dollar tree and it's just a piece of folding metal with a handle on it it's not super sharp but because the way it's made it cuts through the dough really nice and cut them in half again and cut them in half again until you have eight pieces now here's my best tip for you kind of turn these into little balls and set them aside and let them rest for a few minutes they are much easier to work with if they have rested for a few minutes and i know a lot of folks say you know you can't leave um dough that has baking powder in it you know that doesn't that's not yeast dough a lot of people think that will mess your baking powder up it won't and you don't even have to form them in little balls it just makes it easier if you form them in little balls before you start rolling them out just however form them up and then set them aside and i've got some dough over here that has been resting already i've even got some here that i've already rolled out i'm going to tell you about that a dough blade is also going to help here when we start to roll these out because it's going to tend to stick to the surface no matter what kind of surface you're using and you want to clean off any pieces before you start rolling them out that are on there because that will cause the dough to stick once you roll it out and it is a very delicate dough it's a biscuit that you're making a sixteenth of an inch thick you can almost see through it you're gonna get it that thin put some flour down plenty of it and then you're just gonna roll your dough out until it gets to be about seven eight inches um you can mash these out completely with your hands if you want to um they'll you can mash them right on out if you don't have a rolling pin it works just fine or you can use a rolling pin and you just want to roll them out kind of slow going from the center until you get it big enough when you get about halfway there you want to pick it up and check and make sure it's not sticking because as you roll it out and you mash the flower out it will tend to start sticking okay that's plenty big enough right there now when you get to this point go ahead and turn your skillet on because you want to preheat your oil you want to have your oil good and hot before you put these in your pan now we're going to um just i don't know a few teaspoons of fruit in here maybe three teaspoons or so it's kind of up to you but when i'm eating a fruit pie i want some fruit in it you don't want to overfill them because you have to be able to get your crust sealed around them but again you want to put enough in i mean a fruit pie that's all crust is just no good and i know we've all had fruit pies with no fruit in them i've probably got at least three tablespoons in there and once you get your fruit in well you want to take your finger and take a little bit of water and go around the edge and what this is going to do is this is going to help your crust seal and you can get fancy and brush it on and stuff like that but your fingers will work just fine just moisten it up a little bit fold your crust over carefully and then again take your fingers and kind of pinch it together first that's step number one and you can see here i have a lot of extra crust that's okay we're not going to leave that kind of get your pie in a position where you can work with it and take just a regular old kitchen fork and go around the edge and finish sealing it up and once you get it sealed up take your regular old kitchen fork and go around the edge and kind of even it out take off some of that extra crust because all that extra crust out there will tend to burn when you're frying it and it won't be good it won't just be like crispy crust it'll burn you can also get those cute little um dough things and you put your dough in and it mashes it it's actually hand pie molds if you wanted to get some of those and you don't have to do all the fork stuff you just roll your dough out put it in there put your feeling and lift lid over and it mashes them flat for you okay and that's all there is to sealing one up and this is where your dough blade really comes in handy because you can move them around with it and you can also lift them up and put them in a hot oil with it so i definitely recommend getting one of these for a dollar it's um kind of a it's a really handy kitchen gadget you can use a little piece of the dough that you cut off the edge of your pie to check your oil so that you know when it gets hot some of y'all are going to notice that i was running a little low on pie filling there and you're also going to notice that i've already used my skillet well there's a reason for that this is actually the second time i filmed this video today um the first time i did not cut my microphone on which meant there was absolutely no sound whatsoever on the video and i noticed it as i was ending the video so all y'all who uh tell me about how forgetful you are you got nothing on me i mean i do this same process over and over again and how in the world i managed to get through setting everything up and checking everything because i check it all a couple of times i mean the process is turn the cameras on for back memory cards put batteries in the microphone both the receiver and the transmitter tape the microphone on me then i check all the lights and i go back and i check everything turn all the cameras on turn the microphones on check to make sure all the cameras are turned on check to make sure the microphones turned on all that stuff did all that never turned the microphones on and did not check to make sure the microphones were working when i was checking to make sure the cameras were working why i don't know actually i do know and i'm gonna tell y'all why i did it too okay my oil is not quite hot it's bubbling you can see here that it's bubbling a little bit but not a whole lot we want it to get a little bit hotter than this we want it to really be bubbling around that piece of dough there all right so now it's bubbling good you can see here how it's really sizzling around that dough that's what we want and we'll get this out of here because we don't want it burning in there you want your heat kind of on about medium you might have to turn it down a little bit but you want the fry of the pies to continue to fry at a good rate but you don't want them to burn so real carefully slide your pies in your oil and you want a nice sizzle like that when you add them in there but make sure you don't drop them because you don't want to burn yourself and you can see how when i added the pies the oil rolls up and it's well past the center of my pie that's what you want you won't have enough oil to do that now i'm not going to bore you all by continuing to roll out fried pies and stuff them until i do ate fried pies because that would take for forever for poor bread to edit and it would bore mostly all the tears you make all 8 of them the exact same way and you can top them a lot of different ways you can make a glaze this is the same glaze that i used in the apple fritters it's nothing but um powdered sugar and a few drops of vanilla and enough milk to make it into a liquid you just want it where it's barely pourable it's probably not got a tablespoon of milk in it about half cup powdered sugar you can just sprinkle powdered sugar on them or you can mix up some cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle that on them while they're hot you can also add cinnamon into the glaze if you want to and do a cinnamon glaze on them but when the glaze is cool it dries and it's very slick and shiny and you can hold it in your hand it doesn't get all over you it's not sticky or anything and if you put the cinnamon on the pies while they're hot a lot of it will stick not all of it but a lot of it will and again you can hold it in your hand and it won't get all over the place now you want to keep an eye on these because they are only going to cook three to four minutes per side and they are already ready to turn when you turn them again be super careful because you don't want to get splattered with that hot oil well i said that i know why i did the whole video without turning on my microphone i also when i was setting up to re-video this i spilled a whole thing full of cinnamon and sugar i was sitting it back over here after i cleaned everything up from the first video and dumped it in the floor and it went everywhere now i wanted to give it up and just not do anything at all today but i had one of those little aha moments the other day one of those little christian truths that just kind of pop out of the bible at you i was reading in jeremiah jeremiah 17 7-8 starts out blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the lord is now that the way that is worded the lord he doesn't just hope in the lord the lord is his hope and that makes a difference um the way it's worded we hope for a lot of things but when our hope is the lord it's a real hope and that verse or that chapter goes on to describe that man whose hope is the lord as being like a tree that is planted by the water if a tree is planted on the bank of a river its roots go down in the river and it doesn't matter how hot it gets its leaves don't wilt they stay green and lush no matter how hot it is it doesn't pay any attention to the heat and even in the years when there are droughts that tree doesn't change it continues to grow because it's getting its water from the river not from the rain it's not something that is dependent upon the season or the time the lord is steady he's always there that hope is always real no matter what else is going on and that it goes on to tell us that even in times of drought that tree continues to bear fruit so what that said to me is that even in bad times god's people those people who truly have the lord as their hope then they continue to flourish they continue to be blessed because god's blessing isn't contingent upon whether or not it rains or whether or not the economy goes up or down or inflation goes up or down or what's going on in the world god's people are always blessed because their hope is constant their hope is real and they hope and a living god and that's why i filmed this video without sound and that's why i spilled cinnamon and sugar all over the kitchen because when you have something that god wants you to share or something that god wants you to do quite often satan will attack it and he'll attack it to the point where you want to throw your hands up and give up don't give up when satan starts attacking you wipe up the flower mess and start over sweep up the sugar and keep going oh boy these look good this one right here is probably the most perfect fried apple pie ever made now you can drain these on paper towels if you want to i don't i never drain anything like this on a paper towel because the paper towel gets moist and soggy both from the grease and from the heat and when that happens it's going to make your pie moist and soggy and it's not going to be good so i drain them on a rack um you can get racks pretty cheap and you can get them anywhere uh you could even pull a rack out of your oven or if you've got a small countertop oven most of them the racks in them will work for cooling racks too so if you're shorter racks use a rack out of your little countertop oven or toaster oven if you've got one iraq out of an air fryer will work any kind of rack will work for a cooling rack and i do like them better like i said drain on a rack because they don't get soggy it doesn't make the pastry soggy the glaze i've already got that one glazed of course from where i did the other video you can put the glaze on when they are hot or cold um if you put it on while it's hot it's gonna tend to be a little bit thinner because it's gonna actually the pie will actually melt it and it'll run um you can dip them spoon them pour it brush it however you want to get it on there if my bowl was a little bit bigger i would just dip it because that's the easiest way to do it and i actually chose this bowl because i thought it would be big enough but it's not but that's all you do to glaze them and the powder or the cinnamon sugar you just sprinkle on if you want the powdered sugar on them it is best to wait until they're cool because the hot grease will absorb a lot of it and it'll take a lot more but you just sprinkle it on and you could actually mix a little cinnamon in with the powdered sugar too if you wanted to for extra flavor but it's really just that in that simple and like i said it's a super basic recipe you can use any flavor fruit you want you can use the canned store-bought pie filling and you can use canned biscuits to do this get the big ones you know the ones that are about this big around and don't get the flaky ones because you're going to have trouble rolling those flaky ones out do the buttermilk or the home style not the layer ones if you want to use a canned biscuit and you could probably use just your favorite biscuit recipe but the egg kind of helps bind the crust a little bit better and it also makes the crust a little bit lighter i have tried them both ways and these are delicious they're a super quick treat they fry in just a couple of minutes and it's something that you don't have every day it's certainly one of those things that you're probably going to remember your grandma making when you were a kid so it's one of those things that could kind of bring back memories and they're good for all year long you you're not going to heat up your kitchen a whole lot when you're making them because you're frying them you're not baking them and it's even a recipe that you could take camping with you if you wanted to especially if you did the canned biscuits you know you could just mash them out and let the kids do it use a plastic plate or something and mash them out on the plastic plate and let all the kids make one while they're camping and you don't have grease splatter all over your kitchen if you do it outside but that's just some ideas with these it's an old-fashioned delicious treat and it's easy to pick them up and eat them they're good hot or cold they're best warm but you can wrap them up and put them in a lunch box or take them on a picnic before we go um i did check the mail and i got some cards oh my goodness and this pretty one's got grease splattered on it this one is from donna and i'm gonna have to hold them donna has a ministry and i'm gonna ask her if she would to uh post her address i don't wanna post it but it's called sword of the spirit ministries and what they do is they recycle christian books and bibles especially they take ones that maybe you're not using and give them to other people so if donna wants to post her address maybe where people can send books to or maybe even donate to it if they want to and also she's in west virginia don i don't know if you're interested but i have a hundreds of paperback bibles that we had for our ministry that we had years ago and i'm actually looking for somebody who can use those so if you're interested in paperback bibles i've got hundreds of those leave a comment get in touch with me and i'd love to get those to you and i got another card from marianne and marianne has sent me other cards it's a beautiful easter card it has forsythia on it and ever since we have been in this house like 23 years every year i have said i was gonna plant some forsythia in the spring because i love those yellow flowers first thing in the spring and i still have it this year i'm planting some before it's too late but in it she says happy spring and boy don't i know it after this winter and this last year of being locked up i have got cabin fever and spring fever so bad i can't stand it the two of them together might kill me and i also got a very nice letter and a gift from melinda in texas and i i want to say hi to melinda before i leave melinda is a child of god she is just such a sweet sweet lady and she has truly blessed me melinda and her family would really appreciate your prayers if you would add them to your prayer list i know she would appreciate it and so would i so i want to thank you all so much for joining us the hillbilly kitchen if you have not already please don't forget to click like and subscribe before you leave and until next time remember to put god [Music] first [Music] you", "YzW-2lJCM-U": "all right how's it going guys little different video today i had a few requests from some people to learn tim's run on acoustic guitar and they said you should find someone who knows how to play guitar well guess what i know how to play guitar so i'm going to teach you how to play it today and then i'm going to sing it for you once at the end here let's get into it so it's a pretty easy song to play especially with your capo here capo on fret 5 and the chords are going to be c f a minor g some of the easiest chords to play and they just repeat through the whole song let me show you guys the shapes of those quickly so for c it's a from top e string to bottom e string it goes zero three two zero one zero that's your c now for the f chord we are zero zero three two one zero next thing you do from playing that f is you're just gonna slide this finger right here back down to the second fret and that becomes a minor so that is 0 0 2 2 1 0 a minor and now for g this is how i play my g i normally play 3 2 0 0 3 muted and some people will play their g like this [Music] with a finger holding down the third fret on the last two strings here or some people play it with their pinky as well [Music] but just for ease of playing so that i can switch quickly from the c and then i just shuffle right up to the g like that all i have to do is pop my these two fingers up a fret and then drop my pinky it's a little less bright sounding than this uh this g but it's so much easier to play that i don't mind it and it just seems to be what i end up going with most of the time now in terms of strumming pattern for the song here in the beginning uh in the intro sort of part there's just sort of uh and how i'm recreating that is just with a starting on c because the c the progression again is c f a minor g it's just a down strum on the top few strings and then using this index finger to get an up strum on the bottom few strings and then you would go through those chords kind of like this [Music] something like that and then for the rest of the song i normally just go with some sort of up down swing for me strum pattern seems to be pretty much a personal preference for this one um it doesn't really make or break the song when i'm building up to something um say i'm singing the pre-chorus and i'm going life's alright in the red in the white oh north if you know what i mean in the second part of the pre-chorus i might switch to just a quicker down strum so i might go like a if i need a brew or just something to do well but you know i mean i'm headed on a team and oh sorry i'm headed on something like that um because that helps build up and just sort of add a little bit of dynamic presence to the performance you don't want it to be the same thing the whole way through and really quickly before i get to playing i wanted to just add that if you don't have a capo and you want to play i'm just looking at the transposed chords i have here going down it just drops it into the key of g which is also a pretty easy chord to a pretty easy key to play in and the chords are going to be g c e minor [Music] and then d you already know how to play the g and the c the e minor is just zero two two zero zero zero and then the d is zero zero zero two three two and it's pretty easy if you are confused by those chords at all look up a little chart online just type in d major chord on guitar and it'll show you exactly what fingers to put where you'll be good to go but that being said if you play acoustic guitar i would say that a capo is the most important thing for you to grab it's just incredibly useful for songwriting and i'm gonna put a link to one on amazon if you want it they're like i don't know 15 bucks or something definitely worth the investment go check it out all right without further ado here is a acoustic run of tim's run i hope you guys enjoy keep in mind i have not practiced whatsoever so i'll probably mess up a few times but uh hope you guys enjoy it learn it play it impress all your friends [Music] what a year boy it sucked we could use a pick-me-up let's go friggin rice let's go and i think i know just the spot where the coffee is always fresh and hot and the donuts oh don't get me started on those donuts laughs alright in the red and the white up north if you know what i mean if i need a brew or just something to do [Music] tell me if you want [Music] i'll have a double chocolate honey dip 25 pack of tim bits and a breakfast biscuit actually you know i'm making two biscuits ice cap with a chocolate milk a boston cream and a bagel belt and i can't forget four double doubles for the folks back home laughs all right in the red and the [Music] white [Music] let me know what you want [Music] crueler apple fritter vanilla dip with extra sprinkles a couple of those sour cream glazed and don't forget old-fashioned plain peach drink with a farmer's wrap and hockey carts a couple packs and whatever the guy behind me will have it's on me [Music] all right hope you guys enjoyed that hope you learned a thing or two and if you have any questions please comment down below if you'd like to learn any of my other songs on guitar please uh let me know because i i love teaching and i love playing guitar and if i'm teaching some people to play guitar that would make me really happy um go check out tim's run i'll put a link to it somewhere in here and if you haven't already go sign up for the hoser gang the link for that is in the description all sorts of exclusive content behind the scenes free merch and uh what's the other thing oh yeah shout outs in my videos and uh yeah hope you enjoyed it drop a sub with the bell all that good stuff i'll see you guys in the next one", "l6FJks7wGaQ": "the good life full of fun seems to be the hey guys welcome to my kitchen exciting day today always an exciting day at Joe's kitchen we are gonna make one of my favorite little things by little memories back when I was a kid and my grandmother my mother used to make apple fritters I love apple fritters so we're in Cazenovia New York it's mid-september it's just starting to give that feel that sense that smell of fall so I'm really excited about that because it's my favorite time of year when it comes to foods and traditions and holidays so today I'm excited because we thought we'd get a jump I'm one of those favorite little recipes well most favorite traditions in our family so we're gonna make apple fritters so what do we got going to here one is we've got four apples so I already started I'll show you how I cut them but I took four apples peeled them you know cored and peeled them and I hit it with lemon so you're gonna see the insides just starting to turn brown but if you hit them with a little lemon or you can use an alcohol it'll prevent them from browning oxidizing is what's really happening okay so we got four apples peeled and then we want to make a batter and then we want to cover it obviously so what I've got for the batter is I've got about one and a quarter to one and a half cups of flour I've got just over a half a cup of milk okay whole milk then I've got an egg one whole egg I almost screwed up there because I wanted to share with you we got something a little different going out we got one whole egg and then I've got two egg whites and I already whipped them so what I did is some of the lemon juice that I used to put over the apples I put in the egg white so if some of you guys saw our videos before with the egg whites if you put an acid in there like cream of tartar it cooks the egg it denatures the protein so if you use the lemon juice which is a big thing that they would use in Italy because lemons are you know certainly prevalent throughout the throughout the country especially in the south you put a little lemon in the egg white and it'll dead acid from the lemon it gives it a nice flavor and it it didn't ages approaches to a white one hole a I've got a quarter teaspoon of baking powder baking powder sometimes they repeat things because I screw it up so I'll just say that's no and I've got a quarter teaspoon of salt sand salt I've got an eighth of a teaspoon yes it's true one of my favorite little spices there that's nutmeg gotta have nutmeg if you're talking about an dive got a half of a teaspoon of really good quality vanilla okay so what we're gonna make is we're gonna make a batter and then we're gonna take the the apple also to say hey take the Apple we're gonna batter it right and then we're gonna fry it right and then right when it comes out we're gonna put it on the rack and then we're gonna take it right out we're gonna put it in some sugar and cinnamon so what I did here is I have one cup of granulated sugar and I got about a tablespoon and a quarter of Oz cinnamon really good quality settlement all right and that great doesn't that solve an testicle oh my god now as far as olive oil oil goes it's not an ingredient in here but don't be shy jump on our website or Facebook you go right on Amazon and grab her Vito Joe's extra virgin olive oil right from the Puglia region you can see that beautiful green color from the fruit absolutely delicious and those are my two kids so every once well somebody asked me like who's feed on Joe and Vito is my youngest son and Joey is my oldest son who's actually going to culinary school in Milan Italy he's starting in a couple weeks or really excited about that so that being said let's get started I'm gonna grab my bowl here I'm gonna grab my bowl all right and I just got a strainer and I'm gonna if you will fluff up my flour that's the general rule little trick you can do here just hit it what that does is it gets out any lumps just gets a little air in there so you just gonna sift your flour okay and you're not worried about anything being in there necessarily but at least your hope that so we got some great music today it's one of those beautiful and the summer feel the fall you know you want to have soup I was talking about soup today with my camera person so she was all excited about making a soup today but instead we decided to make my apple fritters now I'm gonna tell you there's a little bit of an extra secret tree coming at the end of this video for those of you guys that are gonna hang out so okay so alright so there's our flower and then what we want to do is we want to make sure what are the really important ingredients that you want to make sure is well incorporated and that your baking powder so your baking powder gives it lift okay and when I say that what it does is it creates bubbles so one of the examples I was used cuz it's a perfect one chemically is like there's no not me oh you ever met your you or your kids ever make the the volcano right with a baking powder in the in the vinegar and I was like the scoop of tramble up that egg before I put it so I'm just gonna mix everything really well here usually a fork it you know with the dry ingredients and some of you guys are thinking that but there's such a small amount of flour in here it's not gonna really make a big difference okay so I'm gonna put this in here so if you get that vinegar and baking soda and then you're just gonna fold that in there you go now what all this does and creates those balls in the volcano right trying to finish my thought so what all this does my camera person is laughing at me I haven't even had any coffee today I'm telling that's so exciting this is so what all this does is you're trying to create a really light light batter that's crispy right so the bubbles that are going to be created by your baking powder that soda baking powder right they'll give it a lift and then the egg whites will give it you it'll give it that aerated field which will make it crispy if it's a light it gets really crispy and that's what you want now I've got the oil going behind me what I did today is just a traditional vegetable oil all right and then I'm just gonna I'm just gonna fold it in and mix it in okay and then what I'm going to do is once I get it almost mixed fully I'm gonna just I'm just gonna let it set and then I'm gonna mix it again what it does is that often hydrates your flour people don't realize a lot of times when they're making different recipes you want the moisture to actually get into the flour especially when you're making pastas and certain things so it's nice to let you'll hear people say let the dough rest what's happening really you're let some the gluten rest but you're actually letting the flour become hydrated so then when you get back to it boy it's so and I'm gonna have to add just a touch more maybe not but see how nice and light that is so I'm gonna let that set off to the side okay so I'm gonna put this over here and then what I'm gonna do is take that last Apple just to give you an idea so I peeled it and then you want you know a quarter of an inch to 3/8 of an inch and one of the tricks you can do on an Apple is just rotate the Apple a little bit because what you'll find an apple is firmer and sometimes it'll split so when you get it across like you'll feel it like you feel that resistance in there just turn the app a little bit and you roll it and then as you get through it you won't split feel beautiful that is look at that oh it smells good I love apples my mother a lot of times just on one of those days we're having a tough day my mother would always pull up a plate of freshly cut apples sprinkle them with sugar and cinnamon is always a good Carver with a little lemon juice or orange juice Oh tell you one of the things we were thinking about we're gonna put together here in the next week or so is a blueberry pie oh one of my favorite absolutely favorite kyes and we make a really nice one so well sometimes we make a crumble on top sometimes we take a couple cut out the dough and put them on top just make it look me ooh so fresh you know and then you got that eleven juice in there so I'm just gonna mix it in that lemon juice right this is such a fun fast easy recipe so that's all cover see they're not turning brown at all oh you smell the lemon oh man that's good it's clean crisp I love that okay so let me put that into my mess here let me clean my work surface now I'm gonna bring the batter over all right and let's take a look at that so there's our batter and see just in those I don't know what it was like five minutes see how nice and light that is let's drop the ball so excited so it's perfect perfect consistency but you want it to stick so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just with the power TV I'm gonna shut up for a second we're gonna come over to the kitchen I'm gonna set everything up there because what I want to do is batter it and then I want to get it right in the fryer for all of us okay and then I'll show you how to sweeten it after and like I said I got a little surprise for the end it's gonna be absolutely delicious all right I'll talk to you guys in a second hey guys I just want to show you some really quick and that is a little trick from my grandmother so what we would always do is take a little dough you want to check the temperature of the oil right so you can start to see it now so what my grandmother always do is take whatever she's frying she'd put on a spoon and then she'd set it in there and you want to see a little action so what's happening right now is it just started to warm up it's not quite where I want it yet and so I'm just gonna pull this off to the side give it another minute or so check it again and I want to see that wet dough the moisture in there it's gonna bubble out and that's gonna give you a nice Kris you don't want to chew hot because then it'll brown and black and too quickly and it won't cook the inside of the Apple so so it's gonna you got to find that sweet spot all right Kay so I just want to test it again so when you look there I don't know if you guys can see that you see how she's starting to happen right there all right so look at that so you got those nice bulbs and see how that's bubbling up inside so that's the moisture but it's also you'll see how it starts to get bigger right and that's that baking beautiful look at that that's absolutely perfect so there's our baking powder you put too much it'll get too puffy so and you'll see it'll usually double the triple in size oh it's perfect okay so I'm right where I want to be so really easy I'm gonna take a nap all right and I'm gonna pop it right in there okay beautiful just make sure you're coated well right and that's it and then set it right in there this is a messy job for your head no doubt about it so we're having fun over here make a joke so so I'm gonna pop a few in here right and go that view if the consistency of the batter is perfect so one of the things you want to just keep an eye on when you're making these is you just want the batter to be coated both sides you don't want it thick on one side and you know thin on another so what I do is I get it I just get it in there submerge it right in there really well right and sometimes I've seen people flour almond those are a bad idea but sometimes what happens you get too much you started to get too much on them you know and you don't want to put too much other because then it takes away you got to try to find that ideally the perfect voice so well you could smell the nutmeg and the milk and then you know you get that smell of that frying salt so I'm just putting a couple at a time just let that oil absorb the temp so it doesn't dry you know I don't wanna put five or six in there all at once beautiful great sounds of music it always reminds me of my dad down the restaurant we always had my dad always had a radio playing in the background sort of my grandmother so so now when I cook I almost doesn't feel natural or normal unless I have a little music they would have loved Pandora cuz they could have picked their favorite artists like we use town my grandmother would love that so I'm gonna let those cook just for a minute and I'm gonna flip them I'll show you exactly what they look like to back in a minute all right guys I just want to show you really quick you see how the batter is just starting to crisp up there all right so it's not brown enough on that backside which is fine like you said you want to rush it if you want the Apple to be cooked inside you see how it starting to puff up then I'll puff on both sides and it's nice and you can feel that nice crisp on the outside I'm gonna cook bar which is great so like I said if you have to oil too hot it'll cook it so quick on the outside that you don't cook the Apple on the inside you're gonna find that sweet spot just keep checking it out all right and this is fun I'll say the smell in here not only is it awesome reminds me of my grandmother's kitchen absolutely phenomenal you can smell just just the hint of nutmeg with the cinnamon over here the sure absolutely great I'll tell you I got that little treat in the end it's gonna just set it right off would you guys smell in here I'll talk to you guys in a minute all right so what we're at is to just get into that Brown right and that beautiful see that nice golden brown just flip them over all is it now it's really certain go so now they again the outside is getting nice and crispy and crunchy you got that egg white

dark brown little bits in there oh-ho-ho that's good stuff so I'm gonna let these go for PubMed so we've probably had about three minutes on the backside this side of probably about a min and a half

I'm moving quicker because I don't want those other ones to burn right so here let me do a couple more it's so funny when I do this my grandmother had an old cast iron pan exactly like this so when I do it you know it's not just the smell or what we're making it stuff it's just the look of it all you know it just brings me back my grandmother Carolina is from northern Italy right near Milan and a real neat story my son's going to culinary school right in the same village is great-grandfather from that amazing my grandfather was in the army Italian army and my grandmother was actually a nurse like a nursing assistant they mat fell in love and after the war they you know there was nothing going on there in Italy so they moved they moved the United States had some cousins near Syracuse and you know hoping for a better life hoping for a better way American Dreams so so really great stories it's really neat when Mike after my grandmother passed away my dad it took a while for him to build up the courage to you know go in the house and go through things and we ran across their books where they were learning English they were trying to get their American citizenship so my father said they weren't done as they learned English they said they weren't allowed to speak they weren't allowed to speak Italian in the house because they wanted to learn they wanted learn English she'll become America so kind of exciting all right so I'm gonna finish the rest of these apples okay and then when I've done these are gonna cool like I said my mouth was water I'm gonna play them oh my god they're gonna be absolutely delicious and like I said I got a little extra surprise treat which is just gonna send it from awesome to absolutely fabulous and fantastic I'll talk to you guys in a minute you guys ready done to them toda look at that huh when you get hot fritters my mother used to take that with the hot fritters and put a big glob of vanilla ice cream on there oh so these are great so you know if they cool down a little bit and don't get me wrong you can always use the vanilla ice cream but to try to reheat them I mean it's okay but nothing ever taste as good is when they come right up so I want to get a little clump up you can see that the battery oh my god it's so perfect right well then I'm gonna take cuz it's you could see the ice cream melting right now you don't want too much ice cream right and you got the cinnamon and the hot you ready oh my god just to smell the Apple the Nutmeg the vanilla it's so perfect at front of the batter on the warm Apple and Simon with Doug the apple cinnamon mixing the sugar and the vanilla I just had to hint and nutmeg and you can't even really taste the salt but there's just that hint you got to put that salt in that batter just to give it a hint of like I almost like a saline feel just so it brings out the sweetness even more oh my god absolutely delicious this is fantastic what I'm gonna have to do is have a camera person along with my son take that away because unfortunately just sit there like watch TV and I'll eat the whole thing before you know you to reach across do you ever do that with cookies or like oh

burton eddie for evil.com today i want to talk to you guys about fritters it's personally my favorite snack anything fried is delicious to me and you can't go wrong so let's fry up some apples here let's get started right now I'm gonna start with my KitchenAid mixer here and on the lowest setting I'm going to whip with the whisk attachment two eggs so drop those in there and start with it right here I have six ounces of apple juice my uncle has six ounces of white wine any kind of wine will do Chardonnay Riesling anything you prefer down the lowest setting we're gonna add our dry ingredients here I have half an orange that I zested and then I have 1 pinch of salt and 12 ounces of flour all-purpose flour is fine pretty slowly add this in increments now it's sort of like a lumpy paste so I'm gonna kick my speed up one notch and work out all the ones let the machine do all the work for you and that's it our batter is done take it off the machine you can see it's almost dough like this is a great consistency if you use a carbonated white wine it'll add a little more air to it so that's when you see the little bubbles but don't worry that's perfectly fine so my pot here I have what's called either a candy thermometer or deep fry thermometer and I have some canola oil in here you don't need much you don't even have to go halfway up the pot only fill the pot up about a quarter of the way and heat the oil up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit here I have some apple wedges that I cut I like the skin on them but some people prefer no skin and also you can absolutely peel them just cut them into fairly thick wedges okay let's go over to our fryer so now that my oil has come to temp at 350 degrees Fahrenheit we can start dipping our apple wedges and our fritter batter he's give it a nice liberal coating so as I'm dipping these I noticed that my oil got a little too hot and went from 350 to 400 so instead of just stopping it and just guarding all my oil a quick tip to save it is to just add a little bit more canola oil and we'll bring the temperature down so let's dip a couple more it's a messy job but somebody's got to do it so now that our fritters have drained and cooled off just a little bit let's finish these off with a little bit of cinnamon and sugar I have two cups of sugar a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of salt if you like a lot of cinnamon feel free to go heavy-handed on the cinnamon so keeping them warm is the best way to serve them so just line them up here on the plate just dip them in brush off the excess sugar all right guys that's it these are gorgeous fritters I can't wait to sink my teeth into these I'm Heather Bird any catch me next time on eHow Calm take care guys", "4oVWZ_m3DX8": "one of the sweetest Hanukkah traditions is Sukanya which is a jelly filled donut served during the holiday I have a version here that's much simpler it's not a yeast dough like the original and it's not jam filled instead it's studded with apples very easy to make start with 2 cups of all-purpose flour to that add a teaspoon of coarse salt and 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar and 2 and a quarter teaspoons of baking powder this is our leavening along with the eggs to get that nice light fluffy donut with that crispy exterior that all gets whisked together quite simply to aerate and then for the wet ingredients we have 3/4 of a cup of whole milk 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract be sure it's pure vanilla extract and not the imitation stuff and 2 large eggs they should be at room temperature if you planned ahead with beef together just until they're combined and set these aside while you work on your apples we're looking for about 3 cups of diced Apple use a McIntosh a Gala aroma any sweet Crisp Apple will do here the peel is a little tough so we don't want that in our donuts and I have breaking news to make your life a little easier you do not have to core your apples you can very simply cut around the core and while you're doing this your oil should be heating that does take a while you'll want a couple of inches of oil in a deep pot and let it come to 350 degrees apples oxidize very quickly so you'll want to do this just before you put your batter together and not cut them up ahead of time just pour the wet ingredients right into the center of the dry ingredients we don't want to overwork this batter so just fold the wet into the dry with a spatula and apples right in and just fold these in to combine until they all seem evenly distributed our oil is up to 350 degrees and ready for our dough and I also have a rimmed baking sheet lined with a cooling rack that our fried donuts will go on too so if you have a handy little scoop this is ideal these ice cream scoops drop these in carefully I have about 2 inches of oil in here I'm using safflower oil which I like but you can use any neutral vegetable oil you don't want to crowd the oil because the temperature will drop too much so just keep an eye on your thermometer and be sure that it's not dropping below about 320 degrees having your oil a little too hot is definitely better than having it a little too cold if it's not hot enough you're just gonna have a pale soggy oily tasting donut and that's not a good idea these will need about three to four minutes per batch until the outside is crispy golden brown the inside will be nice and soft and fluffy but cooked through you can see they're taking on a nice golden color and they're starting to puff up this one looks beautiful to me so I'm gonna pull that one aside our fritters are fried and crispy a beautiful light dose studded with the little bits of apple and then just before you're gonna serve them a nice shower of confectioner sugar go wild you can't have enough powdered sugar on top of a donut you'll be making these again and again they're absolutely divine", "gsxcpcgzaAc": "hi Phyllis er southern frugal comm well it's late Sunday afternoon it's getting dark and it's been raining kind of off and on all day and we're getting ready to make some we'll call them apple fritters or I'm going to call them my grandmother's or my grandma's apple fritters because now I'll give you a little story behind all this my grandparents sets my mother's mother and father had a home that they inherited from my great grandmother and she had planted an apple orchard just out of little ways from their house and it was they look like Golden Delicious apples only they weren't quite Golden Delicious apples there were some other kind because you know you just can't find an apple that tastes as good as those tasted and so my grandmother would canvass every year and we would have to go out and pick up the apples from under the tree or either shake the live and then get those that bill naturally they didn't want us picking them off the tree and they would always be full of worms and bugs holes and out all under the tree there'd be so many apples that were rotten and it'd be Yellowjackets flying around and all that so we hated picking up those apples but a lot of neighbors and other relatives would come and get those apples every year and so we would be sitting around peeling apples forever to said grandma could can a whole bunch of them and so she would Khanum most of the time in the little I guess that would be a pint no was that a pint anyway it would hold 16 ounces I don't know my measurements can y'all tell anyway some of them she would can in courts and so on a rainy afternoon in the summertime grandma let's say let's go fix some apple fritters now she called him apple fritters they were more like a filter no turnovers sort of a halfway between a fritter and a I don't know my sister says she calls them she called them fritters and I think she did too so anyway we're going to try to make those today now she would make those with sometimes with leftover biscuit dough when she'd made biscuits and then she would just go ahead and make some apple fritters too so sometimes she would make them by just making up the biscuit tight dough in the afternoon and that way she could fix about six at one time she'd have like three skillets going at the same time and so what we would do is help her - we didn't really help her that much all but we thought we were helping her because she'd let us press the edges together and all that in anyway sometimes when she was frying them they might break apart and you know have a big crack on them or something and but they would still be delicious usually always on a rainy afternoon in the summertime is when she made those so anyway we're going to do our best to copy those so again it wasn't a pie crust though it was a biscuit dough and they were made with self-rising Wow so I've already cooked some apples I'll show those to you now I used granny smith apples and I cooked them in just a little bit of water they really were kind of steamed and then I'll put them in a little strainer - you know a big part of the water out now when I was cooking them I didn't put any cinnamon in them no sugar nothing then that's exactly the way grandma Kantar apples she didn't add another thing just the apples and a little water and that would be what she would use to make the apple fritters all right so we're going to make the dough now y'all y'all bear with me okay alright so we've got about two and a half cups of sifted self-rising flour and today I'm going to add my guess is that's about maybe three tablespoons of shortening and I'm using Crisco and so I'm going to just act like I'm making biscuits I'm going to also use whole buttermilk so we're just going to kind of get that all the Crisco all kind of mashed up in there and you don't want to use much three tablespoons at the most alright so we've got it kind of all squished up into the flour and then we're going to add the buttermilk we're going to make sort of a somewhat of a stiff batter not not really a salt better like you would make biscuits so I mean I don't know what the measurement would be it's just more like a feel for it and that looks like about enough right there so making a stiff a little dough here well I need add just a little more now I'm only going to make four whoops so yeah I might have too much dough to make four but that's what we're going to make now they were big okay I mean it was almost like a meal when you had one of her apple fritters that they were oh oh very very good and especially because we would eat them while they were still warm sometimes they were hot okay so I've gotten all of this flour and Crisco mixture kind of taken up into the dough it's like he turning around like that to get up all of that flour okay so I'm just going to kind of try it around a little bit get it to come together all right so that's a little bit thicker than biscuit dough so that I'm going to do now is just kind of eyeball it and divide it into four different pieces and you'll see that I'll just break them apart like that and then roll each one into kind of a little Bowl all right so now we're ready rolling pin it up all right we'll set this over to one side and get some of this off my hand don't want to have to clean it too much because it's just going to get messy again okay so now we're going to dust our work surface with a whole bunch of flour and this is the part where me and my sister would help to megaphones okay so now we're going to mash that out like we were making a pie crust get plenty of flour on it you can actually just do this with your hands or you could roll them out so we're going to do all four at one time now it's a little bit softer than a regular pie crust would be simply because we added the buttermilk to only put some flour on that national out you know I guess these would be called old-fashioned apple turnovers Navy okay so now we're gonna roll them out just a little bit more make them kind of oblong like this and down a little bit if that went down a little bit okay so they're kind of problem now all right now we're going to put our apples on probably right in the middle so down pretty L well-drained now come on like that get these arranged better once I get all of it on there and I cooked I think this was five five maybe six apples it might be a little bit too much try to use all the apples you know I can tell you that my grandmother made these they were really homeless considered a meal they were so big now the next thing is to get them positioned on here remember we didn't add any Oh turn you around a little bit to conceal more of them there we go all right so we didn't add any sugar at all cooking the apples because grandma always Kandor apples and didn't add one thing but water so we're going to put a little sentiment on the top of each one now my grandmother had a big country table in her kitchen and we would make them on the table right now we're going to sprinkle it sugar over the apples where we put the cinnamon maybe a couple of teaspoons in each one maybe even as much as a table scoop spoon because these apples are definitely not sweet I hope I don't have too many apples hopefully I don't all right the next thing she did was add little small Pat's of butter she would pitch off the butter and just kind of table it all around and the butter is going to come into play again when we start frying these I hope I hadn't got too many apples on this maybe I can stretch that flour hopefully I can so because this is self-rising flour when I start frying them to go pump up kind of like biscuits do you know in the oven or even fried biscuits and that would be the closest thing to compare it to it's like fried biscuits with apples in the middle of them okay now what we're going to do is fold them over and so what I want to do is get that Apple down a little bit because if we don't want the Apple coming out even though sometimes grandma's apples would come out of hers but they were still so good okay let me wash my hands real quick we will continue this so hold on okay I got my hands all cleaned up and so now we're going to try to fold this dough over these apples and they should be a little tricky because this dough is not like a pie crust so we're just going to catch them together like that and then the job that me and my sister had was to take the fork and mash that together and sometimes we didn't do all that good a job mash those two ends together and I think I can mash that out just a little bit and get a little flatter see holes come in it real easy because it's not really a pie crust oh all right we got this one ready all right all right I'm going to get the other three ready well why don't we do one more on camera see if I can turn this around a little bit make sure you got plenty of flour on your surface all right so let's stretch it over stretch this a little bit to see it tore stretch it over like that be real careful when you're mashing it together because it will split the dough all right now we're going to take the fork and mash those little ends together use my left hand over here okay mash it out just a little bit making sure none of my app will come spewing out making sure that there's plenty of flour under that alright so there's the second one see how big they are compared to my hand they're really big I mean they would really kind of make a meal and she didn't really put any little opening for the steam to come out until she had flipped them over in the pan some we do these other two and we'll be back and get the skillets ready and we'll show you how they're fried alright I'm going to move all of this on to a big cutting board or a pan would work too so I can all get my skillets ready so I'm going to use two skillets there we are I'll show you what they look like oops and one of them's already weeping out a little bit of apple juice that's okay alright so we're going to get our skillets on here I'm going to use a little bit of Crisco starting out and then we'll be using butter alright we'll be back when the skillets get ready alright our skillets are hot and we're ready to put the apple fritters right in and I'm going to use the smaller skillet for the small room and again the heat is on medium and any flour that's on them that's perfectly okay pop them right down and we started out with about probably two tablespoons of shortening and each skillet now these are going to pop up some because this is self rising flour all right so we're gonna let these cook for just a little while I'm going to be trying them over so hold on I have turned my boner down to medium-low now I'm going to add some gutter each skillet the turn America even though will probably turn over yet another time that this is the tricky part because they're not completely planted to bear in this way let that butter get I thought I was going to cook all into it and we'll make a wormhole like a little let some of the steam out all right so I'm going to turn the back ones and we'll be back when these are done all right now that I flipped the mold off a little hole on the top of each one let some of the steam out and of course a weapon quite quick enough on this one it kind of split on one end but that's okay because grandma's did that sometimes too so dab a butter on the other side of them and kind of spread that out and again I'm cooking a little medium load now just spread that see I've got a little hole can y'all see that it's right there a little itty bitty hole in the top of each one of them all right we'll let these cook a little longer I'm going to flip them over yet again get them a little more Brown on the other side and we'll be back and show you what they look like all right I have to flip these over again and they're just about gone one of them did break just like my grandmother's did y'all see that one end of it broke off but anyway they're doing a little sizzling now because some of that apple juice is from the apples that's coming out a little bit on the bottom but anyway that's what they're supposed to do all right when I take these up we'll be back alright I took the apple fritters up here's what it looks like see how it kind of cracked a little good in there and some of that Apple just kind of seeped out a little bit there's the other one and then here's the one that broke I cut that into so you could see the inside of it here's all the Apple and the outside is real buttery and crispy they are delicious real country apple fritters is what I would call and these are some really big ones but when grandmother made them and she was making them with leftover biscuit dough of course they weren't this big but you can see why this would pretty much be a meal so this is going to be our supper tonight all right we will see y'all next time", "RFo0XV0sSaQ": "it's totally crazy this year Chanukah is the same time as Thanksgiving that's never happened before at least not in my lifetime it's kind of fun because you get along and think something all mashed up together and today I'm making a little bit different type for Hanukkah it's fried just like latkes but it's apple fritters maybe it's like a cross between an apple pie and a Hanukkah tree maybe I don't know I have two cups of buttermilk in here and I just added two large eggs to that add four teaspoons of oil it's a tablespoon plus a teaspoon of vegetable oil not olive oil four teaspoons of vegetable oil whisk it together you're making a little bit of a loose batter almost like a tempura batter set that aside for a second and make your dry ingredients 2 cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon of fine salt 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of baking powder this is the dry ingredients together I'm just gonna use my same whisk because eventually it's all gonna get combined anyway and then the dry goes into the way I mean or the other way around as opposed doesn't matter that's your batter extremely extremely easy right basically just like making pancakes and before I said it was like a tempura batter but it's actually kind of a bit thicker than that basically these will nicely coat your apple rings for fry shall we fry I have four apples here peel core and then cut into half-inch slices really really easy slice the apples half an inch thick green apples are great they have a nice balance of Tang eNOS and hardiness they hold their shape party this might not be the right word but other baking apples would work as well just something firm don't use an apple like a Macintosh it'll probably fall apart or at the very least get too mushy I have about two cups of oil heating in this pan it should be about 350 375 if you're using a thermometer dip your Apple rings in the batter making sure they're nicely coated and then transfer to the hot oil you want to cook it until it's golden brown on both sides and cook through they'll take about four minutes total you may need to adjust the heat as they're frying because as you add cold things like Apple into the hot oil it could cool it down so adjust the heat accordingly so that it's nice and hot when you add successive batches once I added first look like they're closed turn them over cook them on the second side and they look a lot like donuts don't they but there's Apple on the inside that's pretty cool guys cook it on the second side so it's also golden lift them out you can use a slotted spoon whatever works for you I think the tongs have a little more control and on to paper towels I like to turn them over one and then just let them drain frying is fun so just keep adding batches and cooking and frying and talk to your friends and family and eating enjoying your Thanksgiving / Hanukkah you told they're all done on my paper towel-lined tray I also have a half a cup of sugar and 3/4 of a teaspoon of cinnamon to toss my finished fritters in while they're still warm take them and coat them in the cinnamon sugar quite honestly for something fried I was expecting these to be a little bit more difficult but they're extremely easy and really really festive the second batch is ready I'm going to drain them too so fast the fastest Treat ever I would take a bite but I'm pretty sure that they're extremely hot on the inside so I'm just gonna have to wait a few minutes and so will you if you make them even though I know it's gonna be really hard these are like little golden discs of deliciousness you are not gonna believe how easy they are it's really fun make a batch for Hanukkah or any day because they're that easy you don't need to wait for a special occasion I certainly go they look like doughnuts hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe

of do this you know John get me a tripod anyway here's a video a quick cooking video this is for my super famous they're famous you know amongst my family juicy apple fritters now some people make their dough and they use biscuits and they roll it out and all that Fryman grease and all that uh-huh we don't have time for all that boobie ladies no we got we need to make time for so in and other stuff so I make this a lot home I go camping and I make them when they want something sweet and it's quick what you need is a can of pie filling okay and of course I get the apple pie filling you can use any kind of pie filling if you don't want apple peach would might be pretty good but apples my favorite pie filling kroger brand Walmart brands whatever's the cheapest now when you get them diplomat into a bottle save you can because you and save your spoon let you speak Matt in they come in wedges say they're the coming wedges so what you did it is you can take a potato masher or you can you've got some kind of little chopper I've got a little chopper and I just get in there nice chocolate like I said you can use a potato masher don't make them like mashed potatoes but just chop them up into little bite-sized bits takes about that long right there okay that's how you do that my feeling is sweet trust me trust me no no good as I could about just a little like a third of a cup of brown sugar in there okay that's all I do and then you know we ain't gonna measure anything unless we're really doing some baking but I'm gonna show y'all how to do some baking without measuring too i buy the cheap vanilla you ain't gonna buy the extract unless it's fit for cost for it and sometimes even if it's specific I still buy the dollar general vanilla and just pour you a little shot in there just just like that right there okay now make these and you get them at Walmart for $9 is it what is a signature riddle and that's this thing right here y'all that's this thing right here see it it's like a waffle iron except it's for sandwiches see that okay and while I mix them in I'm getting that hot and we're not using biscuit day we're not using torte egg we're using bread and I like to buy the sandwich square bread but I didn't have any tonight I just had a round top bread and the waffle the the sandwich maker takes four slices of bread two on the bottom and two on the top and I butter one side of the bread Bluebonnet margarine tastes just like butter four sticks of butter is almost $4 four sticks of Bluebonnet is like a dollar 39 sometimes it's on sale for $0.99 and it's just as good and I also have two Land O'Lakes pure and creamy it's it's way cheaper than butter so I use those to butter your bread mix this up here with your sugar and you're a little bit of vanilla now you ain't got to do this but I think it gives them a better a little bit of flavor and you can use the the already ground nut bag in the little just shake it in there but I like to buy my nutmeg this is the microplane sharpest razors I just like to break me a little nutmeg over in my axles it makes them go this is the right to right line it makes a good it is bad that's so good that's all just take your butter soccer in see if I can do this here now I'm gonna lay that buttered side down see that butter side down and I just put it in there now take my same spoon you don't want to overfill them see how that's gonna move and I put about three teaspoon fulls in there you go I'm not going to say y'all that's a Paula Deen thing I need to say friends to a half maybe a little bit more than that okay put the tops on butter side up see this like you go make a grilled cheese sandwich the butters gonna be on the outside then you close that bad boy down and snap it we wait until the light goes out and it takes just a few minutes this is kind of good idea on my bag I've got to figure out a better way to film but this is gonna be really fun I got a lot to show y'all I have a lot to share and anyway when when these get done I'm gonna end it on this note when these keep done the lighter go out on your own your sandwich maker there already be Pripet for you but you usually have to take your little serrated like steak knife and just cut them on and I'll lay them over on the plate like a pretty little plate or just lay them out on tin foil it don't matter especially if you're camping and if you have powdered sugar you can just take your little hand and just sprinkle some over there and let them cool a minute Eagleman honey your husband would give you a double dose of love that night the light went out what's it look like mmm and let her to get in look at that y'all know it's great so what I do let's just go ahead and show you just a minute there really come on

shot my way so my whip is the fitness tracker i use so this tracks my entire workout um which i use week four i'll put my link on my description if you want to check that out you get 30 pounds off when you make a purchase so you know you can thank me later don't forget if you like the video make sure you leave a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe uh i'm gonna going to do some more warm-ups now and get on with the training [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] i feel like a granddad i go upstairs i'm like oh god my knees oh great battery's dying a goal is just to travel more and enjoy all the hard work i think we get too wrapped up in working hard and gathering as much money as possible to save for when we're old uh we may know 60 70s we forget to live and enjoy life as at the present and i think that's what lockdown's i think taught a lot of us [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] uh [Music] [Music] my god i hate barbies i call them death draws for a reason absolutely hate them emoms are a great way to build discipline because once that clock counts down to one minute you go oh man [Music] this workout every three minutes fifteen cow ski um and ascending uh snatches as well with this ski it's also ascending so add one calorie every round so the weight goes up by five kilos every round as well i haven't done snatches in a long time so this is a good way to get me back into it [Music] so [Music] [Music] so this workout is one that's quite deceptive when you start it feels really easy and then that's the way it gets heavier that's when uh you it will you will need the rest and uh technique so ideally i'm trying to make sure they're all uh good reps and i'm not failing as much but again when you start to get tired it will start to affect the snatches um and the rest period seems a lot oh shorter on let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] ah oh to be honest i haven't done 100 under fatigue in a while um that's the thing guys so olympic weightlifters 100 is a warm-up weight but for myself it's not it's uh it's tough especially when you are under 15 but with a lot of crossfit workouts some of them might have you doing snatches when you're slightly under fatigue so um it's just learning just done and also building confidence uh yeah so some people have asked me about the crossway open and i'm not really doing it i decided not to do the open because i didn't need that pressure i had too much pressure going on with work my mindset my head space wasn't in the right place and i didn't need something else to add that much pressure because i decided not to put that pressure on myself and i'll still do the workouts but um keep it to myself at my own pace at um and not try and compare scores and stuff like that because that's one thing that i found that i was doing a lot even after did doing the first one i said ah i don't care what i do and then i started seeing other people's scores and i started to feel like crap basically so i think fitness has been a serious part of my life and um i think i've been too hard on myself and taking it too seriously feeling that i always have to train i always have to look a certain way um i always have to present myself in a certain way and i think i'm ready to just kind of do what do me that's that's where i'm at at the moment i think lockdown has probably made a lot of us think about what we're going to do with our lives i used to love training on my own and now i miss the environment of people being in the gym training with people i think i thought i was an introvert but i think the the last year's taught me that i'm not as much of an introvert as i used to used to be before the old me would have loved this because like i'm i like being alone i like being on my own but i think like i i think i'm as i get older and i have realized that i'm actually i guess i'm still an introvert but i actually do like people [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come on uh oh my god well that was fun oh man i have a love-hate relationship with training like this i love the feeling afterwards i hate the feeling when i'm doing them especially when it starts to get spicy yeah that's my uh full day of training um today's training anyway it's not always this crazy but it's always fun to show you the hard stuff and i've shown you different types of the training i do so uh yeah i just like to mix it up and show everybody kind of what i do what my own training looks like uh yeah also i need some suggestions um so when i go to um so my plan is maybe south korea first i need lists of things to do and then um japan when it opens up i want to go to a safari i'm thinking kenya i need your help i need some suggestions so i want to do a lot of traveling um if you have countries you can recommend places to go what to do um that would be awesome uh yeah i'm excited for it i'm actually i can't wait to to do it now that i'm fully i'm a fully fledged brit i don't have a i don't have to battle with visas anymore it's uh it's a weird time for all of us um and i hope you're all doing well i'm trying to bring as much diversity into my page and uh yeah show you some training show you some stuff that you can learn and as well show you what i'm doing for myself also feel rough as anything i haven't had breakfast apart from protein bar so i'm going to get some food right now i'm starving uh thank you so much for watching don't forget to leave a thumbs up that helps me out massively don't forget to subscribe peace out [Music] oh bye", "q9Cux6Ed20g": "after being in gyms for over 20 years now i'm pretty much at the point of supporting life imprisonment for people who do this people who what's up guys sean aliwani realscienceathletics.com in this video today we're going to be going over 20 things people commonly do in the gym things that you yourself might be doing right now during your own workouts but that are ultimately mistakes you should avoid and this is going to be a mixed bag that includes certain exercises that you'll most likely be best off to steer clear of exercises that are effective but that people very commonly do wrong and i'm even going to throw in a few gym etiquette mistakes here as well so i've got 20 points to cover here let me know down below in the comments which ones you think are the very worst or if there's anything else that you would add to this list if you're new here then make sure to hit that subscribe button below and turn on notifications to stay up to date on future videos and let's jump into it alright mistake number one on the list one that might ruffle some feathers right off the bat because it's a really popular exercise and that is front raises now it's not that front raises are gonna hurt you but in the majority of cases they're just unnecessary because most lifters already get more than enough front delt stimulation through all of their basic chest and shoulder pressing exercises and their front delts are already over developed in comparison to the side and rear heads which are a lot more important for achieving that round sort of capped shoulder look so if you insist on doing front raises then that's ultimately up to you but aside from a very small percentage of cases you're probably just wasting your time and effort overall number two is a bosu ball squat or pretty much a bosu ball anything whether it's standing on a bosu ball and doing curls or overhead presses or using it for chest presses or push-ups or whatever else okay this doesn't improve the functionality of the exercise it doesn't increase muscle stimulation or really do anything useful at all for that matter all it really does is put you in a less stable position and reduces the amount of force that you can generate against the weight so forget the bosu ball you don't need it just perform your exercises on a solid steady surface number three is reverse grip triceps extensions using a reverse grip has no beneficial effect on the activation of your triceps it doesn't hit the triceps any differently or in some special unique way and there's really just no advantage to it however there is a disadvantage which is that it puts your grip into a weaker position and makes the exercise more awkward to perform if you want to maximize the stress on your triceps there's no reason to not use a standard neutral or pronated grip and you can just use the grip that feels most comfortable for you number four is flaring your elbows out during chest pressing exercises when you flare your elbows directly out to your sides at 90 degrees or even worse you position your elbows behind your body you're going to be putting a lot of stress on your shoulder joints that can definitely add up over time so instead make sure to tuck your elbows in slightly at roughly a 75 degree angle number five is using excessive spotter assistance during your sets so i see this all the time in the gym where someone loads up way more weight that they can handle and then their spotter has their hands on the bar and is pretty much helping them out on every single rep of the exercise now this makes absolutely no sense at all to do if your spotter has to assist you right from the get-go then the weight is just too heavy and you need to lighten it up and use a weight that you can handle on your own through a full range of motion not only do you look like a complete goofball when you train this way but it also increases your chances for injury and it prevents you from accurately tracking progressive overload because you can't specifically measure how much weight you're lifting versus how much the spotter is lifting so aside from the odd time here and there where a spotter might assist you on the last rep of an exercise you should be doing all of the reps on your own number six is the cable squat so this is an exercise that women tend to gravitate towards um and i pretty commonly see it being shown in a lot of these instagram booty workouts and youtube glute building tutorials and i see it being done in the gym all the time as well the problem with this exercise is that the line of resistance is pulling in the wrong direction and it's actually putting very minimal tension on your quads and glutes because it's basically just pulling your body forward towards the machine if you actually want to train your quads using a cable machine then you need to be standing right up close to the machine so that the resistance is pulling in the right direction but that said cables are generally just not the best tool for quad training overall and there are just much better exercises to choose from number seven a gym etiquette mistake and that is lifting it directly in front of the dumbbell rack when you stand right in front of the dumbbells doing your curls or your shoulder raises or whatever else you're blocking other people from getting in and then they have to stand there waiting for you to finish before they can get to the dumbbells so very simply grab the dumbbells you need take a couple steps back and leave enough room for people to get in and out of the rack if you're enjoying this video so far don't forget to hit that like button below to let me know i really appreciate the support and number eight is standing dumbbell external rotations so a lot of people use this as a shoulder warm-up i even see more experienced lifters doing this too and personal trainers you know training their clients using this exercise but this movement really makes no sense at all because if you want to stimulate the rotator cuff then the resistance needs to be pulling from the side whereas with dumbbells the gravity is pulling straight down toward the floor and so you're basically just isometrically contracting your biceps and your front delts now external rotations are a great warm-up movement but to actually warm up your shoulders with this you need to use a cable or a resistance band or you can do it with dumbbells but you need to be lying on your side number nine is the behind the neck pull down so not only does this exercise put your shoulders into an awkward excessively externally rotated position but there's really no advantage to it either in comparison to a standard pull down to your upper chest now i'm not saying that you're guaranteed to get hurt doing this but there's just no good reason to do lat pull-downs this way in the first place it's riskier but with no real reward number 10 is plate exercises which is another common trend that you'll find on instagram these days because hey there's only so many barbell and dumbbell exercises that you can show to your audience so might as well get creative purely for the sake of being creative even if there's no inherent advantage to the exercise which in this case there isn't plates are just more awkward to grip they make it harder to apply progressive overload it's great for clicks and views from beginning lifters who don't know better because of the novelty factor but ultimately there's really no point to this all right number 11 is performing leg presses with your hands on your knees this is another bizarre lifting technique that i see in the gym all the time if you have to press with your hands on your knees in order to lift the weight then the weight is just too heavy in the first place or maybe the weight isn't too heavy and you're just making the exercise easier for yourself and reducing its effectiveness not to mention that for proper leg pressing form you want to be holding on to the handles so that your lower back stays firmly planted in the seat with your hands on your knees your lower back is going to be a lot more likely to roll backward and that's going to increase your chances for injury you know you'd never do dumbbell curls and then use your opposite arm to help out on every single rep and so there's no reason to do leg presses that way either number 12 is combo exercises whether it's a squat into a lateral raise or a lunge into an overhead press or a row into a biceps curl so these movements might look cool for instagram and they might seem innovative and unique on the surface but there's really just no good reason to do your exercises in this way and that's because your strength is going to differ depending on the movement pattern that you're performing and sometimes very significantly if you're combining compounds and isolations together and so using the same weight for two different movements like this really makes no sense since one of those movements is going to end up being under trained relative to the other so instead just do one movement use the appropriate resistance that you can handle for that specific movement and then do the next movement separately and use the appropriate resistance that you can handle for that one alternating back and forth between different movement patterns and the same exercise there's really no point to that okay number 13 another gym etiquette mistake and that is super setting between multiple pieces of gym equipment at the same time now if the gym is quiet and you know you're using machines that don't get a lot of traffic then it's probably not a big deal but otherwise don't be the guy who loads up the leg press drapes his towel over the seat and then walks to the other side of the gym to claim some other piece of equipment or even multiple pieces of equipment then super sets back and forth between all of them there's no real advantage to super sets in the first place other than potentially as a time saver and it's just really bad etiquette if you're forcing someone else to wait for you to complete your sequence of three sets of three different exercises before they can get to the equipment that you're using number 14 is excessively heavy lateral raises so lateral raises are a great exercise to target the side delts but they do put the shoulder into a more vulnerable position overall and so you want to stick with more moderate weight for slightly higher reps on these now you might be fine for the short term but it will eventually catch up grabbing onto a pair of heavy dumbbells and heaving them around using a ton of momentum is a very bad idea okay you don't need to be doing 50 pound lateral raises to effectively stimulate shoulder gains so focus on technique and control with these i would never go less than about eight reps per set in perfect form and more like 10 to 12 reps per set and higher that's probably going to be ideal most of the time number 15 is dumbbell triceps kickbacks now if you really like this exercise i'm not saying you can't do it it does work your triceps to a certain extent but i think there are just much better options overall dumbbell kickbacks have an awkward resistance curve where at the bottom they're really easy and there's almost no tension at all on the triceps and then as you kick the weight back it all of a sudden becomes a lot harder so it's easiest in the position where your triceps are the strongest and then it's hardest in the position where your triceps are the weakest if you're going to do kickbacks then i would suggest using cables because that's going to allow for a much more natural resistance curve and you'll just find that it feels smoother and more natural overall number 16 is upright rows using an excessive range of motion so pulling the weight all the way up to your neck with your elbows up toward your ears so if you're gonna do upright rows at all in most cases the weight should ideally be pulled no higher than to the point where your elbows are in line with your shoulders and you should be using moderate weight for slightly higher reps otherwise you're really running the risk for injury since full range of motion upright rows for most people put their shoulders into an awkward internally rotated position and using really heavy weights just adds to the stress now some people out there can do full range of motion upright rows with no problem but for the majority it's probably something you're going to be best off to avoid number 17 is the rolling dumbbell shrug now this doesn't seem to be as common in gyms as it used to be but it's where someone performs a shrug and then rolls their shoulders in a circular motion either backward or forward now ultimately there's no point to this because the resistance is pulling down in a straight line and so the only way to actually work your traps is by moving your shoulders straight up and down rolling your shoulders around just isn't adding anything to the exercise all right number 18 gym etiquette again the one that drives me the most insane by far and that's people who don't re-rack their weights after being in gyms for over 20 years now i'm pretty much at the point of supporting life imprisonment for people who do this people who blatantly load up barbells or dumbbells or whatever else perform their sets and then just walk away leaving the weights for somebody else to clean up now i understand that the laws of physics are highly complex and not yet fully understood but from a probability standpoint weight plates generally don't spontaneously re-rack themselves without human intervention so there is no excuse here don't be that guy if you were capable of loading up the bar then you're capable of unloading it as well re-racking your weights is basic common courtesy number 19 is the standing plate press now this exercise might really feel like it's hitting your chest hard but that's only because of the fact that you're forcefully squeezing your hands together you can get the same effect by sitting there with no weight at all and doing the same thing in reality the standing plate press doesn't work your chest effectively because the resistance is pulling in the wrong direction it needs to be pulling back toward your body but instead it's pulling straight down toward the floor meaning that it's basically just an isometric contraction for the front delts if you really want to do plate presses then they need to be done lying down but standard free weight presses are definitely going to be superior either way and finally number 20 is side bends using a weight in both hands now i'm not really a fan of side bends in the first place because i think they're just much better exercises to train your obliques if that's an area that you want to train in the first place for example cable wood choppers or twisting rope crunches those are going to be much better exercises in my view but side bends are especially bad if you're holding a weight in both hands because the weight on one side acts as a counterbalance to the other and so you're not really getting much of a training effect at all you're basically just aimlessly moving your body from side to side and more or less completely wasting your time so those are the 20 mistakes i've got for you today i could easily list off 100 more of these if i really sat down and took the time there's just so much misleading

gonna lie the final outcome of this grow was top shelf flour that was frosted up caked up looking like it's gonna teach you a lesson kind of buds anyways this is how i grew that frost [Music] she's my what this is my 5x5 gorilla grow tent and currently it's dirty it needs to be cleaned which honestly is more work than you might think i'm going to be starting with the fans which all need to be pulled down and brought outside to be cleaned the ac infinity carbon filter which i had in the tent already is only six months old and it's chugging along and by that i mean it's working fine today i'm going to wash the filter and remount the filter to the six inch inline fan the tent itself is pretty mucked up as well and i like to start every run with a fresh clean grow room so i'm wiping all the 10 walls and the floors down with the bleach sanitizing spray and i'm going to be starting you know with a clean slate and i have a brand new led to install this led grow light is the grower's choice roi 720. it's a 47 inch square behemoth and it fits this 5x5 [Music] perfectly this led will provide great wall-to-wall coverage and with the gas pedal right to the floor this led can boast a large 800 watts of horsepower which glass down with 2.6 micro micromoles per joule of efficacy in other words she's a commercial grade fixture made for anyone trying to maximize her operation commercially or residentially now growers choice they also send me like the optional master controller which gives the benefit of truly dialing in the grow light the control master even has a boost mode option which allows the led to go past 800 watts that my friends is a lot of horsepower for one led the controller seems like a nifty addition but gonna be honest the dimmer supplied on the fixtures enough automation and watts i'll need i would mount the controller somewhere but honestly running out of spots to mount [ __ ] in this room so we have some cocoa mixed with some 444 all purpose we're doing that at three tablespoons per one gallon of medium we started with a one and a half gallon pot filled that up just so we know exactly how much medium how much cocoa we have and then we uh put in about five tablespoons of four four four all-purpose and as you can see we had some leftover living soil which would have more 444 some bloom and some worm castings all mixed in super dry but we mixed it all together and now we got a good starting mix for getting our seedlings going which will take care of them for a solid three weeks and then we can transplant into bigger pots so very easy way of gardening i decided to leave the 5x5 empty temporarily and began vegging a handful of different strains in my 4x2 tent [Music] after a few weeks i transplanted them all into one and a half gallon pots using organic worm castings and 444 all purpose from gaia green organics a few more weeks passed the vegging and i decided to fire up the roi 720 and move some plants over into the [Music] 5x5 [Music] so today i'm gonna be defoliating and also cleaning up the lower skirts of the plants in both tents [Music] i'm gonna be topping these plants for the second time in the 5x5 and i'm using a little bit of low stress training to create a wider bushier plant structure [Music] at this point the current plan is to just get the 4x2 into flower since i do have enough canopy coverage now and in the meantime i'm going to continue vegging in the 5x5 until the plants well gain a lot more size i'm downstairs in my transplant pit and i'm about to prepare my star to flower super soil mix for the plants in the 4x2 tent i'm starting with a full bag of fresh cocoa and i'm adding in the ultimate microbial dense organic ingredient available organic worm castings then for the full spectrum of the npk ratio the plants will want during flower i'm using a 50 50 mix of both the 444 all purpose and the 2a4 bloom from gaia green organics these plants went from one and a half gallon pots into three gallon pots and now i'm gonna get them placed into the four by two and i need to weave them through the trellis netting in about a week this ten's light cycle will be changed from eighteen and six to twelve hours on and 12 hours off to induce the flower cycle most of the heavy lifting is done for this tent other than some canopy maintenance and making sure the plants are watered when they feel dry i can pretty much cruise until week four or five a flower when it's time to give the plants their final feeding now the 5x5 is far from being on cruise control in fact it's not doing so well it's just over nine weeks of edge and two of the plants have been moved to another grow leaving just two plants [Music] one frozen fuel which is a tahoe og crops with banana buttercups and one ocean fruit both of which are from square one genetics [Music] these two plants are going to have to fill this 5x5 grow tent from wall to wall and well like i said at this current point both plants aren't doing too great ultimately the medium is deplenished vital nutrients and i'd also say they're starting to outgrow their pots the plants are yellowing and the stems are hard rigid and purple both of which are clear signs that these plants aren't in the best of shape now the 4x2 on the other hand is looking pretty darn good it's the start of the second week of flower and today well i'm doing a little work on the canopy and i'm defoliating [Music] currently in both tents the temperature is in the mid 70s and well the relative humidity is hovering between 40 and 50 percent progressing into week 10 and well obviously things are exacerbated these plants require a new pot fresh medium full of rich nutrients and a few more weeks to get back to their beautiful green cells [Music] the ocean fruit on the right is going to be more work to bring back but truth be told i've brought cigarette plants back to full health and i should probably mention the frozen fuel on the left sports a wicked stem split i know it looks gnarly it happened when i was tying the branches down it's um it's all healed now [Applause] and well back on downstairs in my transplant pit i need to amend my cocoa with some slow release nutrients i'm adding in 25 of organic worm castings to the amount of medium i'm using now this is a superfood well it's actually super poo but it's super food for plants it's packed with all the vital essentials for perfect plant health minerals like nitrogen phosphorus magnesium potassium and calcium and truly there's even more than that i just don't want to bore you with it all however the best part of worm castings and why i think it's so important to deploy as a recovery tool is because all the minerals and nutrients are immediately available to the plant which obviously is drastically going to help these plants get back to snuff what does that make sense anyways moving on now other slow-release fertilizers will have to be broken down by the soil before the plants can uptake the nutrients now for the start of flower i've been using a simple 50 50 ratio of both the 444 all purpose and 2a4 bloom between this and the worm castings the plants will have a full spectrum of npk and the bounce back of these plants well should be interesting to say the very least i figured i'm gonna need some big pots for this two plant run my hopes is that these plants explode and well fill up the five by five i haven't used 10 gallon pots in quite some time typically i flower in five or seven gallon pots and well i happen to have 10 gallon pots in both fabric and plastic [Music] i'm deciding to use the plastic 10 gallon pots for this run my thinking is that if i have any shot in hell of actually filling this tent out it's going to be by tying branches down and opening these plants up and while the plastic pots are just easier to use if i'm going to be tying branches down [Music] now before transplanting i'm going to prune the roots to help with any root bound issues i'm also applying some mycorrhizae to the roots and the medium to produce some mycelium this mycelium is going to help connect the plant's root system allowing for a much more efficient operation of water and nutrient uptake [Music] walk darkness nearly drowned me sunlight alone don't it burn my eyes [Music] this valley is much too deep in this mountain so very high well my cup is nearly empty i got such a long long way to go my cup is nearly empty got such a such a long long way to go [Music] i got to lay down here and rest before i can take another step down where the darkness nearly drowned me this light burned my eyes this valley is much too deep in this mountain so very high i gotta lay down here [Music] i got such a long [Music] so it's week 10 of veg the plants have been transplanted into their final pots i have the roi e720 set to 50 which is 350 watts and it's about 26 inches away from the trellis height i managed to tie all the branches down on both plants to really open the plants up and i've installed the trellis netting which i'll be putting to use in the next few weeks the plants have been watered so for now the rest of the work is actually going to be left up to the microbes in the medium hopefully in as short as seven days i'll start to see an improvement in health on both plants currently it is week 11 of the veg stage which i know sounds ridiculous but things are looking up for this two plant grow both the plants are showing signs of improvement after just seven days of being transplanted over the next week or so these plants will continue to improve green up and just become a lot healthier the plants have grown towards the led so today i'm gonna do some light canopy maintenance before bringing the trellis down into the canopy and weaving the plants through the plants grow taller i'm going to have to continue tucking them outwards towards the 10 walls to maximize the coverage and well the obvious increase my overall yield potential [Music] [Music] these plants are as old as gandalf the wizard and well they have pre-flower pistols bursting out at every node section these plants want to flower so within the next week or so i'll be changing the light schedule on the roi e720 to 12 hours on and 12 hours off i'll also be increasing the watts for the start of flower to 75 which is 478 watts [Music] so heading on in to the first week of flower for this garden and well things are finally while they're looking up the plants are looking greener and they're also looking healthier they go hand in hand and that's by the passing day things are just getting better with the plants in a better state the growth rate has been increased and it's now becoming routine to come through the canopy and tuck back down the branches that are growing up fast now the root system well it's becoming full and robust and that means well it the plants are sucking up more water than ever currently the plants seem to be drying out every other day and i'm watering the 10 gallon pots with about 6 liters of water and that's without any runoff [Music] and now that the plants aren't so stressed the stems are turning from purple back to green [Music] could be [Music] i found some relief [Music] [Music] okay well i made it to the middle of flower it's currently week five and the plants have rebounded they are currently in good health this tent is operating smoothly with the tent closed the environment has remained in the mid to high 70s um for anyone using celsius that's around 24 to 26 celsius on average and while with the dehumidifier running 24 7 the relative humidity is staying in the low 40s the plants are starting to express their flower development and show some of the bud formations they are going to be growing into the frozen fuel on the left is throwing out longer and well more white pistols while the ocean fruit is showing its compact bud formation type which is true to its genetics and while both strains seem to have that potential frost factor today i have some work to take care of i'm turning off the fans and i am going to be top dressing the plants over the past few weeks the medium has slowly been depleted of rich nutrients by top dressing i'm replenishing the medium's deposits of rich nutrients i'm using organic worm castings obviously and the 2a4 bloom since i'm in the thick of things i mean since i'm in the middle of flower the plants are in a higher demand of phosphorus and less of nitrogen so that's why i'm only using the 2a4 bloom with the castings [Music] now truth be told i haven't brewed a tea since early 2020 but i have been using organic worm castings heavily in my mediums mix although it never hurts add in a tea from time to time it's the middle a week five a flower and today well i'm turning the roi e720 up to 100 of power full blast which is 720 watts because i'm not using the master controller and the led is currently around 20 22 inches from most of the flowers in this canopy today i'm also going to be rummaging through the canopy for one final round that sounded weird i'm defoliating anything i feel his blocking prime sights are just good light access to the lower canopy this is the last bit of work i'll have to worry about until it's time to harvest other than you know watering the plants when they are dry i'm pretty much just going to be patiently waiting for harvest [Music] well it's week seven the end of flower is getting closer [Music] to see where i'm at with these strains i need to take a closer look at the resin development this frozen fuel has the infamous banana buttercup crossed into her genetics and it's been proven to turn anything into a major frost factor the trichomes on the frozen fuel are not showing any signs of amber the ocean fruit is also from square one genetics and it's also starting to produce some nice color considering how sick looking this plant was i say this plant is doing quite well the trellis this round well it proved more helpful than usual by tucking branches down i've managed to extend my coverage and just create a lot more bud sites and i gotta say between both these plants there's quite the smell aromatizing from this room [Music] i got a job in the valley but today [Music] i need a day and part of me thinks i ain't ever gonna make it back home [Music] it's been nine weeks of flower and i can almost taste the end i sure as [ __ ] can smell it [Music] this frozen fuel in particular is looking like well high octane premium gas the trichomes are currently all cloudy with some amber if i had to give a percentage i'd say five to ten percent not very much i like to harvest my flowers with a small amount of amber i find the more cloudy trichomes i harvest the flowers with the better the color and quality i can get when making hash and it's also typically when the flowers are at their peak strength in terms of cannabinoids cannabinoids no cannabinoids there you go so i think the day of chop is just a couple days away but before that fun i'm gonna have to give these plants some time in the dark before having to take this entire garden down it's been a few months since i've really had some above average elite flowers in my jars my guess is my impatience is making me chop this garden down perhaps a few days early i'm not too far off though the plants for the most part have started fading somewhat i was to make the hanging process even easier for the drying stage i'm chopping the plants down in multiple branches this is just so i can easily hang the plants with my clothes hangers i'm also removing any of the large or dead fan leaves but to be frank or to be tom i like to leave most of it on so it extends my drying phase [Music] [Music] [Music] normally i dry in this room however currently the 8x2 closet is in action and well when those lights are on they end up leaking into the room which you know obviously isn't ideal for drying this is the first time drying the plants inside the 5x5 gorilla grow tent so this should be interesting i'm gonna place some fans on the floor of the tent and i'm also leaving the ac infinity inline fan on to keep the odors inside the tent and of course to help from the air going stale [Music] now this drive wasn't as smooth sailing as some of my other runs in the past usually where i live i'm faced with a higher relative humidity which actually helps my drying phase but currently it's the middle of winter and this week has been brutally cold and the humidity is near non-existent so i should have deployed my humidifier to use in this room which easily would have increased the humidity and added some dates to the dry but my closet grow was finishing up and i didn't want the humidity to spike the closet grow during the last few weeks of flower where the buds are really gonna benefit from the lower humidity so i just said well i said [ __ ] it i won't use it for most of this drying phase the temperature in the tent was 65 to 68 fahrenheit which is okay but the relative humidity was only 50 percent the entire eight days of the dry which is not where i like to have it a slower drive around 10 to 14 days is the sweet spot i like to aim for and lower temps in the 60s and the relative humidity of around 60 percent is often going to give the best results i find but sometimes it's easier said than done with the flowers all dry the stems snapping and the leaves all brittle to the touch it is time for the manicuring process and well i'm going to be using the old-fashioned hand trimming method you may have heard of it i don't know it's becoming outdated i know there's machines bags brushes and motorized trimmers that are used for trimming now but for myself i just need some fiskars [Music] [Music] i have been growing a lot from seed and while i just have not been keeping mother plants as of recently but i do think that will be changing both the frozen fuel and ocean fruit did end up being major frost factors some would maybe say straight up terpinators no i'm joking no one says that anyways i'm very happy with them but ultimately these still weren't phenos i felt worthy to be kept as a mom i think i can do better honestly i'm that conceited i'm already on the hunt and i just have might have just did that [ __ ] that one up i'm already on the hunt and i just might have found not one but two prize phenos worth keeping and well both of them will require a revenge process because my sorry ass well didn't take clones but that is all for a future video [Music] the yield wasn't nearly as impressive as the quality of flowers [Music] i ended up with just shy of one pound of flowers and jars [Music] and almost well an entire pound of small buds and trim it is some frosted-up material so i will be making some hash from that in the near future i have my 8x2 closet to take down next and then after that i have my 4x4 to take down both grows have some impressive phenos of some new strains i really hope you enjoyed this video sorry it was so long please like and comment because that's a big help that's why and well thanks for growing with me and i'll talk to you in the comments oh and subscribe bro if you're not already okay see you later jobin [Music] i don't feel [Music] i don't think i don't give them you", "eszOf6sr0XE": "[Music] time for bed [Music] [Music] all right kiddos earmuffs on [Music] good morning guys welcome to the video come on in so i'm just in the middle of making some breakfast right now so i'm making some breakfast stuffed peppers so about 15 minutes before you guys showed up i cut two bell peppers in half spring a little bit of salt and pepper put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes which leads us to right now so when you put the peppers in the oven you're exciting them so they're gonna come out just a little bit wet so as you guys can see right here there they are look at that little pool of water in there we're gonna get rid of that right now before we stop okay now it's time to build these bad boys so i'm gonna start off with a little bit of cheddar cheese so i got this old fort cheddar cheese i have 90 grams in here so just a little bit in each one at the bottom good and i would add a little bit of chives at the bottom of each one just a little sprinkle good and just like last night's portuguese breakfast we're gonna crack a raw egg right in the middle of each one there we go and now we're going to add some turkey bacon so just like me the stuffed pepper is accepting of all different types of meat so use sausage use ground turkey use whatever you want to do so i just have some turkey bacon i cut up four strips for four bell peppers i'm gonna evenly sprinkle them throughout the peppers as well okay now we're gonna add a little bit more cheese because you can never have too much cheese am i right guys i'm right and then last but not least a little bit more chive on top of the cheese and then a little bit of salt and pepper i'm gonna put them back into the oven at 350 degrees for an additional 15 minutes and that is the breakfast peppers super delicious super easy to make and very very very good for meal prep too so this is breakfast for the next two days all right so the peppers are almost done so i actually bumped my calories up to 2800 from 2500 the cut is over and i'm feeling good and i feel like it was a pretty successful cut so a lot of you guys actually asked me how do i approach a calorie deficit so i actually look at calories as money it's like once it's like going to the mall you have a thousand dollars on your wallet you can choose to spend it evenly at 10 different stores 100 per store or you can choose to spend it how you want to you can do like like a lighter breakfast a bigger dinner just like spending a hundred dollars seven hundred dollars at one store whatever you want to do at the same time you don't want to throw away your money you don't want to throw your calories so you want to make proper choices you want to like spend it stupidly of course every now and then you're going to spend your money make a stupid purchase in this case being food and that's okay that's totally fine it's part of life i encourage you guys to do that because that's just being a human but as long as most of the time you're within your budget you're not taking out loans you're gonna be okay so that's what i usually like to do stick with your calories you know you have to work with spend it evenly and spend it properly throughout the day and you can't go wrong [Music] are you ever shocked with the work that you produce this is one of those moments for me so i know the voices in my head are not real but man they got some good ideas so i took the fattest daddy on the pan right now and to get ready to see this cross section here oh baby so this is gonna please all you keto folks out there delicious nutritious super filling as well high in fat high in protein pretty much no carbs in here other than the peppers eggs cheese bacon pretty much the whole entire breakfast experience in here let's go in so good you do not even need bread like the pepper just does it so this is going to be my pre-workout meal i'm going to head to the gym and i'll show you guys my new chest back and biceps routine that i just made since the gyms have reopened so i'm excited for it it's very similar to my old stuff just with a little bit different of an approach and i'll show you guys exactly what i do [Music] [Music] so i'm going to be alternating today between chest and back so chest back chest back finish off with some biceps so i'm gonna do three sets eight to ten incline bench presses the first movement so with my programming going forward i'd never go beyond three sets i don't see the need to do four or five sets because if you make every set every rep camp three sets is all you really need so three sets eight 10 in clan patch [Music] one so i have 215 pounds on the bar going for three sets of 10 which is funny because when i was training back at home incline bench press 215 pounds i got three sets of 12. no problem so it just shows you like depending on where you're training like there's so many different variables you know like the weights could actually be different the bar is different the padding on the bench is different the incline is different so you know if you go to a different gym you're not as strong as where you typically train don't let that discourage you and many different factors can come into play there so just keep on pretty much my goal this week is just to fill out the last two two sets so i just stayed with 10 reps the first set i could have got 12 there it was actually pretty easy so next set i just want to add a rep this following set just add two reps and then the next week i come in go to 220 keep working in that process so don't try to force it if i know i could've got 12 there don't go for that you know you want to save that energy for the following sets [Music] so the next movement we are doing is the one arm dead stop row so there's two reasons why i'm doing it from a dead stop the first one being is that you can overload the movement a little bit more and use heavier weight and the second one being is that it eliminates the stretch reflex of the muscle making the concentric part of the motion just a little bit harder so usually with the one-arm row you can really cheat the movement up and you have a lot of swinging a lot of weight but this really humbles you okay so i'm using straps to eliminate any like the grip because i feel like my grip is the one that fails before my actual back so just gonna use some straps i put my foot out to the side i'm gonna wrap it and then for the starting of every movement the top of the dumbbell is gonna be facing the floor and then we're gonna pull up one a guy reset down [Music] two [Applause] [Music] there we go so now we're moving on to the chest again with the last thing we're doing flat dumbbell press three sets 10 to 12 reps so on this chest day i'll do barbell for the incline and then flat with dumbbells the next chest day i'll do flat barbell incline with dumbbells so really trying to get my strength back with the dumbbells because they have just plummeted since the gym suppose so i'm gonna go three sets ten to twelve reps hundred pounds and we'll see what happens here [Music] [Applause] so last thing we're going to do for the back is the machine high row 3 sets 10 to 12 reps so when i train back i do one pull down in one row and whenever i do a row i always target the upper back so i don't know if you guys saw but when i was pulling the dumbbell i was literally pulling like up here just to focus on the upper back and then whenever i do the last is just to focus on the lats so three sets 10 to 12 reps [Music] all right guys so that's gonna wrap up the back and chest workout so my back is fried right now only two movements but if you do them right that's all you need so now we're gonna go and do some barbell curls and then finish off with two sets of row hammers i'm gonna be doing three sets 10 to 12 reps so usually for arms i'll push it literally to failure every single set rp 910 uh just for other movements like chest back main movements i'll kind of keep like one or two in reserve but usually for the arms and like lateral raises accessory movements i'll usually push it pretty close to failure [Music] all right guys that is gonna wrap up the workout we got an appointment in like a little over half an hour we'll figure out a post-workout meal i'll catch you guys soon so i'm at the gas station right now and i was getting some gas and the plan was to go to starbucks get the egg white bites but then i saw this which is a pizza vending machine so i was like let's do that for the post-workout snack so i've never tried this before there's nobody working in here and it's just kind of like a vending machine with pizza so it sounds pretty cool all right so we're gonna choose which pizza so we're not going with cheese because that's for kids and sad people uh i'm a barbecue chicken man so i have the option oh yeah the calories so it's for a quarter of the pizzas 420 calories jesus okay so i'm probably gonna eat half of it your barbecue chicken pizza's on its way it's like a little progress bar i wish my progress bar was that slow and then i think it comes out here it's like a little pizza glory hole come to daddy something's going on in there oh hello am i supposed to grab here it's a little bit for foreplay right now oh thank you well that's pretty cool look at that so it comes out like that so we're gonna go do a little taste test in the car okay so time for the big reveal and there we go that looks like quite the cheese forward pizza here so apparently i guess all of them come uncut or they just know who they're serving you know what i mean because any pizza is a personal pizza if you are you know depressed and willing enough so i guess i'm just going to honor this thing and kind of fold it like a nice little pizza blunt it looks to be quite light on the sauce which is a mistake that's had me sleeping on the couch before and uh so there's barbecue sauce in here and i have no idea what to expect because g hues is the only the only one i opened wide for [Music] wow that's a sharp cheese it's kind of like a gruyere kind of thing i don't even know if there's actually any sauce on here take a look that's a very very rich pizza the fact that only quarter of this is 420 calories is actually it should probably be illegal but i mean overall it's pretty good i mean it came from a machine but just like a good salad i think the dough is tossed [Music] would i have it again i mean probably not over out of ten want to give it maybe like a five out of ten not bad all right guys so i'm here with jackie at the acupaid footage and we're going to try some cupping today so apparently it's like a long-standing asian form of alternative medicine it's been around a really long time so like thousands of years they've been using this medicine and it's actually in a lot of other cultures as well okay so yeah it's supposed to the cupping the suction muscles stimulate your skin and your muscles and brings like blood to like the troubled areas yeah so basically yeah so increase the circulation um some people believe that it helps get rid of toxicity um but it helps to relieve a lot of muscle tension and also what we do is cupping massage so when we move those cups around we actually stretch up the fascia it's an odd shape i feel like i need to be like kind of like this or something you know i mean so this should all feel fairly comfortable okay oh whoa oh okay what's that like this is just an odd feeling okay yeah oh yeah that's much better how does that feel good okay [Music] so the more stagnation in an area the darker the color is going to be so for example someone who is inactive maybe they're a smoker you're going to get some really really dark color okay the other thing though is that the harder you do the cupping and the longer you do the cupping you can end up with some dark color um so with you though we're seeing like some dark so i wouldn't be surprised because of all the working out you're doing yeah you know you're going to have a little congestion in there oh whoa what's that like very weird very weird yeah okay you can feel like the boss will like relax yeah so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to do some cupping massage so i'm going to actually cause a little bit of suction okay and i'm actually just going to move this through so this will actually fade some of the color anyway oh it feels so good but this helps to stretch the fascial layer so i really like to do this especially you know because you're using your body so much yeah oh okay and again i just want it to be comfortable okay yeah i'm just gonna stretch that out a little bit the other thing that's kind of neat about any of these types of like cupping or gua sha is they've done studies they've actually found that actually boost your immune system it's all done all done oh wow i felt really different than i'm used to wow the suction the suction thing felt like you're like i feel like a baby cub being held in my mom's it was cool though yeah yeah but i feel really itchy right now yeah it does make you a little bit itchy sometimes yeah thank you so much oh you're welcome yeah so that was the cupping appointment very very interesting felt a lot different than the human hand i'm getting some ideas right now but the last time i experienced that much suction was when i was 16 and my parents just got a new vacuum but she did say for the next couple days to a week after i'm look like i was you know sexually exploring what it'd be like to be with the squid but it is what it is hopefully it helps and uh yeah try it out take a look at what a subscriber sent me aaron brooks look at this it's ollie as a stuffed animal come on look at that oh my boy it literally looks exactly like messes like it has this like kind of like look and like everything he's so beautiful that's crazy oh my god you are so talented so as you guys know that we did the ali's gym launch and that thing killed it like the amount of support that we got was insane like these these crew necks the first round of them sold out in like under three minutes or something like that uh so because of that we were able to donate a lot of money to spca actually five thousand dollars in ollie's name so the plan was uh to actually go and like to the actual location and present them with a check but we can't do that because of covid so what we're actually gonna do is want to zoom call with cali she works with spca and we're going to surprise her with the 5 000 check to show her what we did hi cali hey will how are you i'm good how are you thank you for taking the time oh ollie was a big he he shared my channel with me and loved him a lot and a lot of other people loved him a lot so um when he passed we wanted to do something in his honor so we did the ali's gym merch and the goal was to raise money for the the spca in his name and because of the crazy support um i wanted to present you with a big five thousand dollar check um from me and uh my subscriber family behind the camera there yeah amazing and you know what will i i can't thank you and and all of your amazing supporters enough um you know getting getting all of your folks together to help fundraise of course in ollie's memory and and to help recognize the work that we're doing at the ontario spca really does mean a lot to us and and when we receive donations uh like this it's it's just gonna help us continue the work that we do each and every day and you know we have um dogs cats all sorts of small animals as well that come into our care and for us it's our main priority to be able to help them donations like this it's just incredible and and we'll be able to keep helping more animals in ollie's honor so thank you so much [Music] so katie and i have made a pact to treat our tongues to various different types of cuisine because if we don't we'll have pizza every single night for dinner although i had pizza for lunch today you stinker i did yeah so anyway we're at a middle eastern place right now and i got the mixed grill so when there's three different types of meat that's dangling in front of you i can't just pick one i gotta take them all down so here i got uh the mixed grill some tabbouleh on the side a spiced pita some kofta which is ground beef some beef and then a chicken kebab which looks to be very very small but don't be ashamed of a small kebab i mean small meat small world then we got some garlic dipping sauce some hummus so the total calories according to the menu was 970 calories so pretty similar to what i actually have at home so yeah that's my dinner [Music] so you've seen my morning routine but a lot of you guys have been asking will what is your nighttime routine so i'm gonna show you guys what i do it's very simple and not something i recommend but i'm gonna show you what goes down when the sun goes down well not everything the most exciting part of the night is anabolic ice cream time every single night around what like 8 30 9. yeah 8 39 o'clock we both make one she has a hobbit form the little tiny bowl here and i have the whole entire blender so 275 calories topped off with some walden farms and some pb2 on the side so it's like nine o'clock right now i have a coffee so yes this is not something you should do it's pretty late will affect your sleep and also it dehydrates me for tonight which is not ideal in terms of my back if you guys want to update it's actually pretty sore and i don't know how it looks right now how's it located does it look pretty bruised i can't really tell can you see yeah like yeah it looks pretty weird but oh coffee and this one everywhere yeah it looks pretty weird feel feels sore you can definitely feel like the muscles are loose like the blood's kind of flowing a bit but yeah we usually have our anabolic ice cream and watch some youtube until she goes to bed because she goes to bed super early at 10 30 at night that's pretty late that's not late that's not late at all after i brush my teeth wash my face i'll come into the goat room and i'll start doing some work until pretty late into the night like 1am sometimes as late as 2am i know it's not the best thing to do especially before bed with all the screen time but it's what i have to do especially with what i do being like filming all day i don't have the time to sit and kind of go on the computer so this is the time when everyone else is asleep you know kind of research plan and edit videos i also kind of just sit back and kind of reflect on my day think about what was good in my day and not every day is going to be good but there is something good in every day it could be something as little as the cup of coffee that you have but you got to appreciate the small things and today was a really good one you know it felt really good to be able to make that donation in ollie's honor um it meant a lot and would not have been able to do that without you guys and this is what doing this is all about helped you that a lot more just want to thank you guys very very much that means so much to me so thank you so i am going to wrap up the video here going to get to do some work right now so if you guys enjoyed the video make sure to drop it a like subscribe to the channel if you're new and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] you", "tJnzi9TgA2k": "[Music] this was during our visit to my auntie and uncles homestead check out all those apples and we came home with a lot of them so we're going to be making some apple bread this recipe is for three loaves or one 13 by nine for the streusel topping you will need one quarter cup cold butter half a cup flour one quarter cup brown sugar plus two teaspoon and half a teaspoon ground cinnamon combine and cut the ingredients in a bowl with a pastry knife or fork until clumpy and set aside [Music] in a separate bowl combine 3 cups flour 1 teaspoon baking powder one teaspoon baking soda one teaspoon salt and one and a half teaspoons ground cinnamon you will need three cups diced apples in another bowl whisk three eggs then add 1 cup vegetable oil 1 cup sugar and whisk together fold in the 3 cups of

a preheated oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 35 to 45 minutes until the top of the bread is golden brown or when the toothpick comes out clean let it cool for 10 minutes and enjoy let me know if you give this a try i think you will love it thanks for joining me today everyone have a great day and happy gardening", "UhgTlIdlacM": "today kevin and i are going to be trying five new pillsbury soft baked cookies uh these are the sugar with drizzled icing these are confetti and these are chocolate chip these are peanut butter with chocolate drizzle and these are butterscotch chocolate chips butterscotch yeah butterscotch chocolate chips so these uh were 298 at walmart they're we have only seen them at walmart uh have not seen them in any other store so if you find them somewhere else you could let us know uh but walmart is where you're going to find them and we have found them in two different places we found them in the cookie owl and we also found them in the seasonal display where they have like the cake mixes for easter they also had the chocolate chip or in that area you can also order them online from if you go to walmart.com because some of these weren't actually on the shelf so i came home and i ordered them online and they delivered them to my front door so they had them there in the back of the store but they hadn't put them out on the shelf yet so it was interesting how that happened too so but they should be able to you should be able to order them online so these are the sugar with drizzled icing two cookies are 140 calories there are nine servings so 18 cookies and i like this [Applause] that doesn't make that noise yes it does say yeah you know they show pink on the front but i hadn't really paid attention it looked like a white at a quick glance those are a lot smaller than i was thinking and um it's actually pink drizzle just smells really sweet these uh the website is pillsbury.com that's a very small cookie for only getting two for what is it seven to each yeah that's a small food it's really not much bigger than an oreo isn't it so i guess that makes sense that tastes okay but it's very very bland i mean it's it's okay i really don't even care for it it's very chewy you know there's a is there something in there is there a little chemical like flavor to you yeah there's some funkiness in there so i don't care for them i don't know if it's the drizzle on top i think it's the cookie i think it's the cookie itself i don't like sugar cookies anyway so they all taste bad to me so but they don't taste like this um normally like if you have a loft house sugar cookie it does not taste like this yeah it does have a little bit of a chemical there's a funkiness to it that i it's hard to describe it's just it's almost like um and these are brand new cookies but it's almost like it's gone off that's the kind of funkiness that i'm getting from it so i would not buy those skills to me it tastes more uh doughy flour like text [Applause] absolutely not as a matter of fact i would probably put those in my pile the bag pile uh these smell incredible [Applause] these have a much better smell i mean the the just the okay smell these really really really good good whiff of the funkiness yeah they're just like flowering yeah smell this yeah they smell like vanilla it smells like vanilla it smells sweet the sugar cookies literally smell like like flour dough these are fewer calories the confetti ones are it says made with real butter a blend of real butter and shortening two cookies are 130 calories of the confetti so this is the lowest calorie one of the bunch that we're gonna be trying [Applause] it's definitely better oh to me it's still very bland but yeah it still has a vanilla good vanilla flavor that is what other companies would describe as birthday cake yeah i agree it's a strong vanilla it's vanilla those are those are okay for me to me it's amazing the the night and day difference between the two cookies i mean literally it's night and day it is completely different completely different experience those confetti cookies have such a great vanilla flavor now see i would get those all the time yeah they are very strong vanilla just they're kind of plain for me i don't like just things and that's except ice cream then i like vanilla i don't know the texture of these is they're soft baked cookies they say that on the package that's exactly what they are they're very very soft yeah they're kind of chewy to them getting the first two one or two out it's hard oh this is uh 140 calories so these are the same calories as the first one to shrug and these are chocolate chip i love the added texture of the chocolate chips you get the old um chocolate kick oh those are very good they're good i will like a regular cookie has some butteriness to them these don't really have that butteriness to them but they're good i could eat that whole package yeah they're good and they're not they don't seem overly sweet either the chocolate is good and just the added texture of that makes it very pleasurable for me to eat and so those would be dangerous to me because i'm going to keep wanting more yeah and i bet you could heat those in the microwave for a few seconds and it would be incredible yeah yeah those are good okay now what do you want to try first uh the peanut butter i think it's gonna be plain plainer than you think peanut butter okay these are the highest calorie ones these are um it's got peanut butter two is 150 calories automatically i have a lot of calories going i could just dump them out getting the first one maybe a little fingers yeah that's what i'm thinking your little more fingers no i meant like a child uh these are peanut butter with chocolatey drizzle let me smell them i'm still not sure who they smell i'm not sure i like the texture yet oh i do i like the texture oh i could just smell them all day they smell really good you get that little sugar crystals on the top you get that texture that tastes like your typical um peanut butter cookie i think i think i like the two peanut butter cookies better but those are good you like these they're good these are my favorite so none of these have blown me away i love peanut butter and a lot of peanut butter cookies like the ones you're talking about i'm surprised you say that because honestly to me the ones in the tube they're good but they don't have a strong peanut butter flavor i don't think these do either see i do i really do taste just about like those to me they're very yep they do but they're a little bit more intense maybe a little bit and they're sweet and you do get that the sugar yeah the little crystals it's i think that is delicious that's much better than what i expected them i like that a lot and lastly we have butterscotch and chocolate chip and we're going back on calories to two cookies or 140. you just get out you were better off than i was really not much to look at you got a couple of butterscotch chips chocolate chips in it really smell the peanut butter smell the best too though they smell so good if you like peanut butter not like those lost the chocolate chip no you can't lose the chip um i like those because they they have a really sweet flavor to them even have a little saltiness to them i don't know why but it seems like they do those are good the chocolate chip i could eat the peanut butter hoodie the other ones um i'd probably so these are your favorite yeah okay um the ones of course i've made it very clear the sugar the sugar cookies i'll be surprised honestly if those make it because some people might like that flavor it's just like i said it just this just tastes like raw dough to me to me the competition is with these four right here that's where the competition is and even the vanilla ones the confetti ones are good they're just vanilla but they have a good strong vanilla yeah they really are like a it would be described as birthday cake confetti cupcake it's it's vanilla uh so your favorite i heard you're definitely the butterscotch butterscotch and then what hmm probably the chocolate chip okay so we're just completely opposite well we're not completely opposite because my favorite's gonna be peanut butter love the peanut butter and then my second will be better butterscotch i think i think some of the sweeter ones third was going to be chocolate chip and the last is confetti but this shows me something i like the ones best with all the stuff in it so any added texture i really like the added texture the confetti don't have that they have a great flavor but they don't have necessarily the texture that these do the chunky pieces so i just really like the ones with the chunky pieces but now the confetti ones have a lot of uh colorful confetti in them and i didn't taste anything no i think he dies or anything like that no these are okay for me like i said i'm not blown away by any of them truth be told if i was going to say okay go pick a cookie out i wouldn't pick these out of y'all i would ten times rather have these than um what is that the the chips chips ahoy i would too because boy are in our experience are always hard i know other people said they're not these taste better though they do the um i don't know like i said i don't know that i would i would choose these over other ones i cookies i wouldn't pick these i would there's other ones i would pick instead right yeah well that's understandable there's a lot of cookies out there so that's something these are these are okay for me they're definitely soft batch because there's not really a bunch of soft batch out there because we looked at one time for soft batch and couldn't find any these are definitely a good baked cookies yeah these are very soft definitely soft batch is the brand yes um so this is really the only ones out there if you like a chewier softer cookie then these are these are definitely worth trying out and like i said i absolutely think they would be wonderful if you put them in the microwave for just a couple seconds if you have time uh because i think they would be terrific warmed up that's true so we'll have a picture for you at the end and thanks for watching [Music] so you", "tob-YG4rNjQ": "so i've been a yamcha let's talk about it [Music] what's up saiyan army welcome to the video so what you're seeing on your screen now is yesterday's lego workout starting this workout off with a kind of hack squat variation that i made up basically it's a single leg hack squat it's almost like a step up but it feels a lot better and i'm doing a lot of unilateral work with my legs and just with my whole body as i'll talk about later on in the video but anyways let's get into the topic of this video and that is why i am a fraud so for those of you guys who have been following me since like my new york days if you guys have been around since then i really appreciate you guys but you guys know that my weight always stayed around the same around 170 to 175 ish if i got like super chubby or super bulk mode then it was like 180 pounds but then i barely had any abs but usually around 170 to 175 when i went to cut down for cons and stuff i go 170 maybe a little bit lighter 168 just to get really lean but when i'm training like normal it's usually around 170 or 175 fluctuating now you guys know that it's been a rough couple of years it's been almost two years since i injured my arm and had to get surgery and all that and took like a year to recover then after that like this past year i was dealing with back issues from that chiropractor visit that totally just wrecked my back for the whole year and i'm still not really touching anything lower back wise and just even after that just injury after injury after injury and it's just been a very frustrating year a lot of it's just my fault because i've just been going yamcha mode not yamcha well i feel like yamcha mode but i've just been going vegeta mode in the gym like my body needs to rest need to rest and my mind just is like no effort i must keep ascending i must keep training and i think a lot of that is because of you know what i preach on this channel like you you guys have been following me for a while know that i keep it real with you guys and something i don't talk to you guys a lot about is whenever i'm feeling down or whenever i'm you know i just don't like talking about negative stuff like i want to be the guy on youtube that's always uplifting and encouraging you guys always ascending that's what i always preach on this channel and to be honest that's not what i've been doing the motivator has been feeling unmotivated and yeah some of it is because i made the transition with the channel when i moved back to go more anime style so like i didn't really have to focus as much on the fitness side even though i was and a lot of times the fitness side i felt like i was just pushing out videos just to push them out and i wasn't really progressing like i wanted to so this is gonna be like my video to just keep me accountable so basically what kind of like flipped the switch for me was i just jumped on the scale today and i'm wearing it at about 160 pounds which is crazy because about like back when i was in new york and i was like 170 175 i thought if i was going to compete i would get to like the low the high 150s as far as weight goes just to shred down for a competition and yeah i've lost like a significant amount of muscle a lot of you guys have noticed as well and i think it's one of those things where like i have a lot of clients that are very embarrassed to like send me their progress pictures they're like oh damn like this was so embarrassing to send like i haven't weighed myself in like six months and i didn't know i weighed this heavy and i completely understand where they're coming from now because it's like i haven't weighed myself in probably like four or five months something like that i've been weighing myself in a super long time and a lot of it is because i knew that i have been degressing and i just didn't want it to be real when you jump on the scale and you know you know sometimes you think your scale's broken or not but my skill the scale is accurate and it's real and nobody wants to go backwards in life no one no one wants to go backwards in anything they do and that's just the case here so in this video i just want to keep it real with you guys and just go over well one just keep myself accountable to you know ascending again like i feel like a yamcha right now and i hate it and i need to ascend again but right now like my first thing that i want to focus on is healing my wrist um my wrist right now is the only thing that's injured right now but it's been an injury that's been nagging me for like six plus weeks now i haven't done any heavy benching or overhead pressing for the past six weeks so that's gone i've been trying to like use a brace and the brace has been just making my wrist worse like i've just been going going to vegeta mode on it and every time i do like a push workout i just re-injure it more and it just takes longer to heal when i just need to give it time and that's my fault like if you look you can still see like bruises from the last time that i had my my push workout which was like two weeks ago and yeah my strength is really low right now i'm on the smith machine only press incline pressing at 185 and 185 feels a lot heavier than it should so we're gonna just pick it back up again like i said my first thing that i'm gonna do is let my wrist heal i've altered my workouts i'm doing an upper lower split right now just because i can't do like a full-on push workout so i add i am adding push exercises into my upper workout but it's only mostly like back focus i'm doing lats focus and thickness focus workouts and also for my legs i'm separating them with quads and hamstrings so what you're seeing on the screen now is a quad dominant workout so it will be nice as well i have been neglecting legs or not hitting legs as hard as i'd like to so it'd be nice to just really dial down and focus on it hitting it three days a week i will touch up in another video on you know my new training split and what i'm currently doing to just rebuild everything but like i said first thing first is i gotta stop going vegeta on my wrist and just let it heal go a little yamcha mode for a little bit take a couple of steps back to take you know take two steps back to take three steps forward and as far as diet goes my diet has actually been pretty good i've been getting in you know enough protein every day and enough calories every single day i could probably increase it just a little bit but i want to wait until my wrist heals once it does i will be doing more full day of eating more vlogs and stuff for you guys just to show you guys how i'm gonna recap i don't really know how it's gonna work i know when i first injured my arm and it shrank to like literally nothing and when i recalm it blew up just really fast like once it started working out and using it again it blew up really quickly so i don't think it's going to be the same situation i definitely think i need to get my strength back and start eating a little bit more but like like i said once my wrist heals that's what will happen something that i also haven't i haven't really told much people i think i've told like two people this and that is like about my my injury and just every the effects after the injury and again it goes back to just me not wanting to talk about negative stuff and just me wanting to be down you know ever since the injury i was always about always ascending and just getting back to my original form and i just never wanted to talk about anything just bad and to be honest my arm does not feel the same as it did like i've never had surgery before so i don't know if this is something typical for you guys um i'm not sure if you guys any of you guys watching have had surgery in your legs arms elbows whatever shoulders but my arm does not feel the same it feels like i lost something in the mind muscle connection it doesn't feel like i can fully engage my left side and it sucks because i'm fully left-handed like i do everything with my left hand it's my dominant side and it just feels like there's some kind of detachment so that's why i'm doing a lot of unilateral type movements these days is because like when i'm even pressing i can feel that my left side isn't as engaged as my right side and yes it could be also my wrists and the injuries and whatever i could be subconsciously you know trying to baby my left side as well so that could be part of it but also it hasn't just been my left arm it's been my left foot i remember i injured my left foot i ended my left hand my now it's my left wrist and it's my left lower back as well that was plaguing me here all last year as well so it's just i don't know if it stems from that issue and for those guys who dealt with injuries i got surgery and stuff maybe you guys can chime in down below but yeah ever since i had my surgery on my left side it just feels like my whole left side has not felt right and i'm hoping as time goes by i mean it's only been it's been two years and obviously i was hoping things would go a lot better since then but you know when i draw the line in the sand today we're gonna pick yourself back up as i always preach on the channel you know no matter how many times you get knocked down always pick yourself up that's how saiyans get stronger that's how we grow that's how we ascend okay and i am down i am this is by far the worst physique i've ever had on youtube or on this channel and i'll do a vlog and i'll show you guys my physique and show you guys my measurements and all that stuff so stay tuned for that but yeah this is me at my worst and i just appreciate all you guys for being here appreciate all you guys for all the support and love and we're gonna ascend again i promise you guys the physique will come back the ultra instinct will come back and it'll be a good time and i hope you guys will ascend with me i'm gonna end the video here appreciate you guys for watching see you guys in the next one for those guys that

your views why don't you just leave it while you leaning on this hill you gotta get the truth if you wanna leave the field i know that ain't the savior the scriptures not the one they invented son of man who was injured buried all for the sinners holy spirit my witness i could talk to them endless might have looked like me but there's none of my fitness they want to hit me cause i'm on the road tell my little girl this ain't only roll we can never i know is um", "Mdlwv_l-6lk": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you how to make \nMoist Cinnamon Apple Bread. This cinnamon apple quick bread is super easy to make and perfect for fall apple season. Now a lot of recipes use vegetable oil \nto keep their quick bread moist, but not today. We are actually going to start off with \n1 cup of apple sauce. Pour that into a mixing bowl and add in 3 eggs, as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Get that in and whisk it all together. You want to whisk that just enough \nto break up the egg yolks, then we're going to add in 1 cup of brown sugar, and we'll also add in 1 cup of white granulated sugar, then I'm just going to whisk this together \nuntil it's mixed in. That should dissolve fairly quickly. Then I promised cinnamon apple bread, so we'll add in 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, followed by 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt, and give this a quick stir. Then I'm going to switch from a whisk to a rubber spatula because we're going to add in some flour, which will thicken things up. So I'll go ahead and dump in 3 cups of all-purpose flour and mix that right in. Last we're going to fold in some diced apple. Today I'm using a green granny smith apple because the tartness makes a great  balance against the sweetness, and Granny Smith apples bake up quite nicely. We want to add in about 3 cups of diced apple, and I keep the dice fairly small, and just fold that into the batter. Next we're going to pour our batter into \ntwo lightly greased bread pans. These have both been sprayed with \nnonstick cooking spray, and I'm just going to divide the batter between the two as evenly as I can get it. Don't worry about getting it perfectly even. Close is good enough. Next we're going to bake these in a \n300 degree oven for 90 minutes. Clearly the term quick bread doesn't refer to \nthe baking time on this since it takes an hour and a half to bake this bread through completely. What it refers to is the time that it takes \nto get your bread into the oven. Since this recipe doesn't have any yeast \nit doesn't require rising time, which means it's quick to get your bread into the oven. Hence: quick bread. Now I have a tip for you: if the top of your loaf is getting too brown, simply lay a piece of aluminum foil loosely over the top. This will prevent the tops of the loaves\nfrom getting too brown. Now once your bread loaves are cooked through completely, leave them in the pan for about 10 - 15 minutes \nto cool off just a little bit before removing them from the pans to cool completely. You can always eat this while it's still warm, and you can cool it completely and store\nit in an airtight container for about 3-5 days. Thanks for watching.

quarters cup of milk and a quarter cup of heavy cream this time i put half a cup of the milk three quarters of a cup of heavy cream really and i and when i did the um the noodle when i took them out i put butter with them like we do if we eat them just to glaze them with a little salt and then i still put a little bit of butter when it was cooking and i only cooked it for half the time in there but i put it on the broiler the whole time not like covering it i want to see what it's like what's it um like tomorrow i think i like it better because it's still moist yeah and it has the topping to it and it has a flavor that flavor comes from the sharp cheddar and the butter cooking in it you know that you want some what is it no good thank you i like to take the tomato and put it with it you know what i mean how are you about caillou me and jersey obama went to the store and i think we went there we were going to buy well we went to two stores we go to a big outlet for bulkier stuff so we were going there to buy steak so we bought instead of one stick you bought two different types of steak and then what did you what else did you get over there yeah yeah oh you got the half and half you got the eggs and oh i got the i got the cheese i got the two pounds of cheese for the macaroni the macaroni and cheese and uh then we went to publix i think we got something else when we were there too but then we went to publix and we went in the publix only for like three things and we came out with probably 20 20 things and nothing that is i mean it all stuff that tastes good but it's nothing that i could say is good for you but we are so hungry because this is like our this is my first meal of the day probably my only meal of the day actually um because i slept i slept i woke up at like nine o'clock this morning and then i was gonna go to work and i didn't go to work and then i laid there until like one and then i was like i'm gonna take a nap and i took a nap and i fell asleep for four hours close to four hours but i'm looking forward to the dessert thanks for the bg rs was your phone down you must have your thinker now this question is this thing is watching what you say that to him the brother and sisters huh oh yeah i've seen him do this turn the sandwich boom bite turn it and then the other half eaten with grandma's like tuna i remember on kyle unkai [Music] out she's a beautiful woman that lady that one coyote remember when we watched you going yoga yeah i took him yesterday yeah i left him right next to the cake that i gave you when did you do that before we went out how was it oh so like i was sleeping i was gonna yeah you know i think when i came out here before i remember that i must have pulled them over or you pulled them over because we were going to eat or something i didn't even touch them they were buried in with my thing over here [Applause] i'm full might just call you more okay i want to order one of those above things i never really realized that people use those until i worked at that house in oviedo right yeah you'd be amazed how many uh bugs fly in when i was watching that show the other day you know with the people that live off grid they recycle they put everything in their garden like is there for their mulch stuff yeah so everything like food everything they put in there and there's like you know how it is if you really know what's going on it's like these horticultural people they try to say like stuff to him like oh you shouldn't be doing this or that and he's like i hate to disagree with you but you look you watch our garden in about a year or six months what it's like and uh because like when you bury the tree and then you put like the other you shred the bark yeah and you put it through the trees that are already that were cut down or they were rotted or whatever they're gonna rot and decompose then they put the dirt over it so when it starts to decompose all that nutrition goes into the to make the soil you know what i mean that's why years ago like say like take a farmer right when people farm they might this time they might plant like say garlic and roses because garlic actually enhances roses you know what i mean and then it does it does something it depletes the nutrients from one thing but other things grow off of the other nutrients that it's put into the soil so then they might grow corn you know what i mean and they constantly would always turn the ground over because you're if you do that you're always getting uh nutrients into the soil i always changed your crop but you just have to know what the right crop is to put in next you know i'm done mother with that i think i'm gonna have to have some lemon cake and a cup of coffee you know there was a little dog in the in the food store yeah it was one of those ones like joe's dog my friend um he was real kind like this big walking right with the guy older color what do you think guys time to have a little dessert dessert in the desert [Music] it looks like we bought a lot here is this the potato yeah that was in the oven they took it out it looks like we bought a lot of stuff over there but we really didn't buy that much stuff yeah but like the the chips and all they'll stay good for quite a while the uh you don't think they'll be around too long what do you want me to do with that keep well we'll put that in a bowl or something we could probably separate it though and then when i have macaroni and cheese tomorrow i'll put it in the um pan stir fry it a little not stir fry it into the uh a scoop of the macaroni and cheese you know what i'm saying this thing here i don't know if you guys had this over there i growing when broke me growing up um the older people older they're really not older people just older than me they um always love lemon stuff and that was huge years ago but i really never really liked lemon stuff but there's a few things that are lemon that are really really good in this company here entamons they make a very very good uh iced cake and it's a limited edition which means that they only make it certain times a year they'll bring it out for say a month or something maybe two take it away bring it back that just boosts sales because they know it's so good see how they change these boxes a little looks like [Applause] [Music] i usually just rip the thing open you can do on either side now oh really but this is really good it's good you see that this actually it's not i think it's too much light yeah yeah that lemon cake you want this to cut it um he had a fork please hmm that one's fine what do you want now what yeah and uh i need something to put it on you notice they're smaller see the tray yeah it's half the width these these things used to be thicker everybody's trying to survive i guess they should never cut their limited edition you know like that this is only my first piece i used to eat the whole cake tomatoes onion thank you you're a gentle woman and a scholar macaroni and cheese very yeah it's good i think they used half the cake and half the icing cut me a little piece please thank you uh is that water boiling yet that's my trick that's my trick you just always catch on to it that's a good question i don't remember when it the came um my body's warming up foreign oh good up you like it yeah it's pretty good right it's different it's not like the real like lemony lemony like over over like overkill trust me you there who's there did you eat some breakfast yeah it's already 10 o'clock a.m i guess you didn't at some point in your childhood you when your friends went outside to play together for the last time to know what i knew i think about this quite a lot when i put on there i liked it i was always riding my bike i'm playing baseball basketball or football with the boys football is my favorite it uh was rich kolowski is the one that was friends with life around here come on are you spelling somebody was he was an assistant criminal division manager at malmo's county county [Applause] he was a former pti director consists of a criminal division market of san diego provincial officer in roman county my dad must know [Music] nice see that stuff i can only i can eat it and then i remember they used to make a um an orange cake like that me and kelly we were um we went out to dinner but we went out to dinner and then yeah and then had come home we were sleeping and i remember hearing her get up and there was like had been one one piece of banana cake or something and i just started when she got in there i started laughing come on [Music] they're always fresh nothing they're always crashing there's donuts um i wouldn't say that i don't like them um i mean they're good but they're not something that i really care if i ever had it but if they were there and it was the only thing to eat i would eat it you know like those uh mini crumb cakes they're good the um i like the apple fritter from here um when i'm having coffee because it's it's drier and it's not a lot of sugar to it it's just i like it together [Music] grandpa the other day fortunately [Music] you had the best parents [Music] yep [Music] what was that tonight it's funny isn't it how all that stuff's starting up again oh uh oh we think about every step you take to get into a new [Applause] we'll tell you what if i had my gun on me and uh and i saw that i'd go right next door and i'd kill the guy i have that training now you know what i mean [Music] shooting that he saw got the girls down they ran and hit upstairs and a coupon for an hour in the coats and they were communicating with my daughter through this phone texting and then the cops came in through the roof and protecting them now out the back they got out and they would they you know it's going to be pretty hard for them to live with that thing when you hear from them what's going through your mind is right there when you hear something what's my pressures and then i get really angry and i i feel like it was you know every every city is susceptible but there's there's a way in which i would think you know really acting tough and strong and their kids are more resilient than you think shaking i i'm so glad they're safe and it's not okay that we don't have better gun controls that's right [Music] it's not just as such a bank too for them i'm really concerned for their medal of emotional health they're they're great kids and they're super solid they're great parents but this is going to be uncomfortable in the middle of your fall inside all the time for it you know but just because you have a nice community and do something yeah that's that is true true that's one thing in volusia county where they always train with that i had that training two times within three months i think the guy that was doing the shooting good [Music] it children so uh so uh [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] so [Music] yolanda how are you yolanda how's your um how's your channel everything good there so so [Music] okay [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] sweet i think it's probably best doing it that way too so even when you warm it up it's probably better right [Music] that's like that's why when i put uh what do you call it uh the tomato like the skirt it actually keeps it gets it moist [Music] no i had coffee mug i just finished it i'll tell you that i don't know why my head was cut up here on the top but i um it like hurt in my and my i was thinking for a while like i wonder if i had a kick in my head you know they can embed themselves in your head and uh i didn't even think to look at it but then like there's like a soreness down all the way from there all the way down here into my sinus where i told you my it hurt there yeah it's probably not it's probably not something that's together just a coincidence but my it hurt here so what i did is when i went to shower i took i put some peroxide on there and then i took the scrub brush and i scrubbed i scrubbed it and then was able to actually get the scab off of it and then put uh i put rocks on again but then i put alcohol and now it's there but it's not scabbed up and it's uh it doesn't hurt as much [Music] so [Music] that police officer got killed huh that's where you that's where you roll in with that gun like the daytona top hat and just destroy it because those guns let me tell you just like the m16 we used to train with if i was here and you were standing in the middle of that cul-de-sac i could put one right in your forehead oh yeah that's how accurate they are we just updated that shooting we're getting ready to [Music] female chief [Music] that's what you carry [Music] that will take no less than five days nice two hours [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Applause] oh [Music] uh [Music] this my dad has a picture here but that has a picture here um it says look it says forgot to damn i forgot to lift the lid oh crap and he's sitting on the toilet yeah all right so i wrote a thing here look at it look at the thing come no oh no so my dad's call number when he was captain was 116. so i said hazardous area back when back when you were captain headquarters 116. oh he's 10-8 in the back that means he's in service everyone else is 10-7 rest in peace 10-7 means out of service", "BnkuFXaH75Q": "today we are going to mcdonald's we're going to try the shamrock shake which is completely new for me the shamrock shake the shamrock mcflurry i've never had any of them so we're going to go to this mcdonald's and go through the drive-through and we'll take you with us um yeah i might get a small shamrock shake um an oreo shamrock a small oil shamrock mcflurry and a medium fry and i have uh gift cards for each one of these are coupons or whatever i got coupons for each one no uh yeah please if you don't mind thank you very much have a good day thank you okay we have our shamrock shake right here these are all small and then we have our shamrock shake mcflurry and then the fries the fries are actually medium medium fries yes the shamrock shake mcflurry has a oreo cookie okay so we got the receipt but what's funny is is it all zeros it's zero zero zero because we use gift cards that were sent to us this was compliments of mcdonald's they sent me gift cards and so that's a good thing though because i've never had either of these before and i've never tried it with a french fry and apparently trying it with a french fry is a thing the total though had we gotten two small uh desserts and the medium fry it would have been 807. so and i haven't had a mcdonald's french fry and probably they're good hearts they're getting hot and fresh so they're not as salty as sometimes i feel bad about eating with the birds on the hood of the car those birds will live all they're gonna do is poop on it if we have any left we'll give them some um so what do you think i just think we should just try the plain shamrock shake first pull up frost okay i didn't start it oh you know milkshakes are almost really really thick that one is more green at the top than it is on the bottom like they didn't mix it really good was it a minty no not at all so you have to go and just tastes like a really good milkshake though it's very sweet do you think it tastes minty no no i didn't get any milk and the cup it's hard to see but the side of a cup has like a snowflake go towards the top like right here where the green is oh okay did you get map when you did that it's not a super strong minty flare i thought i always remember them being stronger no it's not strong at all mm-hmm no it's good yeah it's good but it's not it's just i mean i to do taste the amount once i got it from a different angle yeah but it's just not a really strong now were they saying to try a french fry in this just dip one right in take the lid off this like seems like totally just wrong to me to dip a french fry in this yeah good job get you a couple french fries get those shorter ones where you can really get in there now you got mostly whipped cream they're short ones that are kind of stiff those are the best ones these i posted a picture of a a box of goodies that mcdonald's sent me and somebody had asked me because i asked the question what do you dip your fries in and um somebody said what do you dip your fries in tammy and i said i don't dip my fries in anything honestly no i never have because i genuinely like the taste of the fries themselves and i don't want to cover it up for me um it just covers up the flavor they really this is a very good shake i think this is just going to make a mess wow oh it has cookies going everywhere yeah they just stuck the cookies on top let me see if i can put the thing back on you took the lid off let's see if i can work around the lid i'll tell you what though you could go through that quickly because that's i mean it's a dessert it's wonderful and if you're worried about too much mint you wouldn't have to worry about it with this because no it's not overpowering at all but if you get it in the right spot you can taste it and so is this the same thing but just with oreo cookie it's supposed to be a mint ice cream okay with oreo on top okay it looks like it's very hard to eat well they didn't mix i don't know if you can see what he's doing there there we go you can see the struggle they could they didn't mix the oreos in it's just like it's on top it's literally they've put it on top maybe that's just the way it's done this spoon is really cool though because it has a hole right i think you can like literally so you could drink it up through that yeah i like your dick so i don't get any milk yeah you didn't get any mint this is all oreo and vanilla okay this is just oreo yeah yeah there's a little oreo on the top which is good they give you plenty of it i don't see any mint in any of this you can't do that until you melt it no um there no but i'm saying i went down to the very very bottom and there's no mount did the receipt say because i did ask for a oreo shamrock mcflurry we got an oreo mcflurry yeah they just put the oreo we didn't get a shamrock mcflurry well according to this thing yeah they wouldn't have been minty anyway oh that's a shame though because that's what we came here for i said that i said it i think sometimes i get in such a hurry that they hear what they want to hear all right we decided to go through draw through again i mean i need a small shamrock oreo mcflurry all we have is the mcflurry i mean the uh shakes you oh you don't have the the mcflurry version okay thank you you're welcome well you saw we went through drive through again we tried and yeah and they uh they did not have the uh shamrock shake oreo mcflurry they only have the oreo version and the we are actually in the next town over because our local mcdonald's we tried to get the shamrock shake from there and uh their machine was broken so they couldn't even make them there i do have saved the oreo mcflurry is good i haven't had a mcflurry in years i don't know that i had i might have had a bite of one years ago but i don't know that i've had a whole one it is good it yes the thing about it is is where they put the cookies on the top um in this like dome shape it just it's very it it's hard to get it out um it's it's a little messy because i tried it without the dome and you really get cookie overwhelmed out of the two i prefer the shamrock shake flavor wise i do because it's um to me but it's mostly vanilla i love the flavor yes i love the flavor of the vanilla milkshake and you're getting a lot of that you're getting a little bit of milk but mainly it's vanilla milkshake and i like a good old-fashioned vanilla milkshake anyway it's very sweet whereas the uh the mcflurry um i would just prefer other things over that that just uh the uh the oreo it's very good but um it is a challenge to eat and this is not a challenge at all i prefer milkshakes most of the time anyway yeah oh yeah kevin loves a good vanilla milkshake um i didn't think the mint was very strong though no the mint wasn't very strong it's not as strong as i remember it being but so that's i think that's the reason why i liked it so much is because it wasn't that strong i i remember it being much much stronger yeah so if you've been able to try the oreo shamrock shake mcflurry you'll have to let us know if if it has the same mint is it that same level because if it is it's probably really good and the thing is is oreo makes mint cookies yeah they could put mint cookies in the the oreo well the picture looked like it was a green ice cream oh yeah let me see who's on there yeah yes yes so this is and our shake's not that green either this is on the the gift card that they sent me so that is what yeah it has a green base to it so that is what it's supposed to look like if you can get it so um so a thank you to mcdonald's i doubt mcdonald's has watched this but if they are just know some of your restaurants don't have yeah and we yeah we went to twos to get you know we've gone to two different we've had bad luck at both of them yeah we have we tried uh so but we i love the experience i love getting to try something new so i hope you all enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "wUy3v-SerEk": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

time to pastor sam thank you randy thank you jaja yeah let's let's keep ourselves together in prayer and join with me in praying together by repeating after me our heavenly father this morning we wait upon you and we confess ourselves to be an anxious people spring is here and we want to get out we want to see your creation but more we want to see your glory but still we wait we wait upon you with our offerings and our praise we wait upon you with our attention to your word help us this morning to be patient as we wait to know our needs are fulfilled our desires are found in christ alone in whose name we pray amen as easter quickly comes upon us i want to i want to switch gears from exodus we there's a natural break in exodus at the end of jethro and i want to jump ahead to mark's gospel chapter 11. and next week is traditionally known as palm sunday and it's the celebration of christ's entry to jerusalem but jesus entered jerusalem a number of times because he never actually stayed the night he repeatedly came to jerusalem each morning each day and then in the evening went back out and stayed with friends in bethany his first entry we have recorded for us in mark's gospel chapter 11 verses 1 to 11 and i'd like to read that for you now mark chapter 11 verse 1 begins now when they drew near to jerusalem to bethage and bethany at the mount of olives jesus sent two of his disciples and said to them go into the village in front and immediately as you enter it you will find a cult tied on which no one has ever sat untie it and bring it if anyone says to you why are you doing this say the lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately and they went away and found the colt tied at a door outside in the street and they untied it and some of those standing there said to them what are you doing untying the colt and they told them what jesus had said and they let and they brought the cult to jesus threw the cloaks on it and he sat on it and many spread their cloaks on the road and others spread leafy branches that they might that they had cut from the fields and those who went before and those who followed were shouting hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming of the kingdom of our father david hosanna in the highest and he entered jerusalem and went into the temple and when he looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to bethany with the 12. now i have a picture yes spring is here time for a little sunscreen mark's gospel is written to the roman church and the roman church actually would have had been living they had living memory of emperors having their triumphs julius caesar was only a generation into history at the time and this was written and so many in rome still had memory of what it is for a king an imperiator to come in and display himself and to declare himself great before his people to be celebrated by his own jesus comes to us not red in the face but still he comes to us boldly jesus comes in a way that is in some ways more audacious more bold because we all know familiar pathways the road that led into rome was known by every roman it was famous it was famous that all roads led to rome but as all the roads that in the empire led to rome they found themselves all joining into one particular road likewise jerusalem had only a couple roads actually leading into it cities need protection and so they had to couldn't have too many entryways most of us know familiar pathways knows most of us know familiar roads i i have a a friend a really good buddy and we've been kind of started emailing back and forth after you know a bit of quiet we usually get a little quieter over the winter months when we just put our heads down and go to work and do the routines summer comes and we get a little anxious we want to we get together and talk or hang out do the things that we do and he mentioned how he missed going to work and i've heard other people too saying how they miss the routine of simply getting up in the morning getting themselves dressed and going to work and i thought about it driving my son to work or driving my son to school as i'm on my way to work and [Music] i know the way now pretty well he's been going to in his second year of junior high he's been at the same school for two years i know most of the turns i won't know most the lights most of us know our way to work we know the streets we know the turns we know the lights but do you know the color the light's going to be i confess i hope it's green it's most often red do i know the people sometimes i look around at my red light and i see familiar faces because like me they have this similar place to go with a similar schedule from time to time i see similar faces but i don't know them do you know the people you're driving to work with most of us would confess we know the streets we know the turns but we don't know what color the light's going to be we don't know the people that we commute with we certainly don't know what they're thinking what they've chosen for a radio station that morning the number of sugars they put in their coffee jesus is so audacious in this passage that he tells his disciples two of them to go into a town and he tells them not just what road to take what he tells them where to find a particular animal on a particular day where it will be particularly tied who will be particularly sitting next to it what those people will be saying i'm sure when those two disciples left they thought okay sure some in general instructions but why does he give us exact words to say to these people don't can't we just come up with something ourselves jesus suddenly after years of giving general instructions now becomes so detail-oriented he has to give them word-for-word how to answer because he knows word-for-word what will be said to them because these two disciples might be many things but they're not hoarse jesus knows exactly what's going to happen in a world that has so many contingencies there's no contingencies for jesus while caesar played god jesus reveals god in ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 paul writes even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy blameless before him in love he predestined us for adoption as sons through jesus christ according to the purpose of his will christ by his will orders things before the creation of the world he knows every contingency every possibility there is nothing he doesn't know this is an infinite level of outcomes and beyond that it's an infinite level of possible outcomes because these people could have easily simply said instead of why are you doing this said what are you doing he knows precisely every syllable that comes out of their mouths so often we'll concede in our daily lives that god knows us but we often only think that god knows us the way that we know the way to work that we he knows the streets and he knows the light the turns but we forget he not only knows what the light is he knows every possibility of what that light could be we see three colors we know okay yeah it could be red green or yellow but when it comes to us in our hearts when it comes to the words of our mouth it's not red green or yellow there's an infinite contingency and christ knows them all and this allows him to give them these words it allows him to give him these instructions you go up to this town and he gives them directions exactly what to do this is the level of knowledge that jesus reveals and this is a divine knowledge this is a divine foreknowledge that knows everything that's going to happen before it happens because he knows every possibility that could happen and he's known this from before creation he takes all of that knowledge and then he decides what will happen his will ephesians tells us is the defining factor all that knowledge is great it's great to know all the possibilities when i walk into tim hortons and i see the donuts i like to know all the possibilities you really have to evaluate them carefully but then the one you choose which one do you choose choice is so hard do you choose boston cream do you go with something a little more flamboyant the birthday cake myself i'm more of a traditionalist i go for the apple fritter simply because it's big you can enjoy it longer but some of us like a cherry twist which one will you choose you choose the very best of course no one chooses what they don't like christ the very best isn't always the easiest jesus chooses all the details he chooses who he's traveling with he chooses the cult to ride on is the cult the best thing to ride on no it's an underage juvenile donkey it's not the greatest ride out there the picture of caesar that i showed you at the start he came he's in a chariot made of gold with four perfectly white without spot stallions pulling it there are better things to ride he could have rode in a litter you know basically a very flamboyant stretcher and have some people carry him along that was not unheard of in those days he could have rode in a wagon a chariot he could have rode on a horse he could have rode on a donkey that is full grown but the will of jesus is detailed even down to the colt even down to the number of coats that are put on that coat that he would sit on even down to the words that people would say his will is detailed his his will is detailed his will is also powerful it's able to overcome in isaiah 53 verse 10 yet it was the will of the lord to crush him he has put him to grief when his soul makes an offering for guilt he shall see his offspring he shall prolong his days the will of the lord shall prosper in his hand god's will isn't always easy most of us know that the best thing isn't always the easiest thing there are times where the easy way really is the worst way we've all done school projects where we said you know what i don't have to work hard on this and we just get it done when it comes back it doesn't always have the best mark why because we've taken shortcuts we've done it the easy way where we should have read three sources we read one where we should have gotten good reliable resources we did a quick google search and took the first website that popped up the easy way isn't always the best way and when people ask me about the will of god god for knowing things and what about the difficulties of life this is something we have to bear in mind because the easy way is not something that god takes god's proven that he takes the very best way and the very best way does involve pain it involve pain for himself in mark's gospel in the earlier chapters we are shown christ three times told the apostles what's coming and it wasn't easy christ tries to prepare them for the difficulty for the heart that's ahead of them and while this is a triumphal entry most of us have that heading in our bibles this was not an easy entry into jerusalem in another gospel christ is given account of having tears shed on this entry and so while god's god knows everything beforehand and he wills the very best in all its detail it is a powerful will it is a will that overcomes difficulty that's not afraid of it that's not afraid of pain and suffering but knows how to turn the evils of this world into something glorious it's not easy to hear the cries hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming of the kingdom of father david hosanna in the highest when you know what lies ahead and because heinz scientist 2020 we know that the cross lies ahead for jesus but the people singing these praises don't know that the apostles walking alongside of him as his most trusted and closest companions don't know that and so the will of christ works through that difficulty because it is powerful it is powerful to accept worship in exodus chapter 20 verse 3 we have the 10 commandments and the first of that is first of those is you shall have no other gods before me and yet in luke's gospel when the pharisees and the jewish leaders tell him to discipline and correct to silence those who are saying these words jesus answers them i tell you if if these were silent the very stones would cry out that's in luke chapter 19 verses verse 40. it's not easy to accept this worship knowing how momentary it is that it's going to last just for this brief time and then very quickly be forgotten and then again turned turned into scorn and turned into who is this man who does he think he is and yet jesus without blessing receives this worship graciously he takes it he takes it with all the genuine heart of those who are giving it this morning we we sing we pray we give our attention to scripture god knows that on monday when we're pulling ourselves out of bed we're warming up our computers maybe to work from home and it feels like we've gone so quickly back into just another ordinary day god seems to retreat into the background of our lives god graciously receives our worship as we bring it knowing it for all its fallibility all its weaknesses all its limits he still receives it he's also right in receiving it no one else can receive it king herod in the book of acts is recorded as receiving worship where people say ah he's like a god and in his pride he loves it and he takes it all in he soaks it all in and as he's soaking it all in outcome worms the man starts exploding and spewing out eaten from the inside out because he dared receive divine worship as just a man christ in all righteousness receives his worship he's already shown us even in the simple act of telling them to get his conveyance this cult he's already showed his divinity he accepts our kingship the roy and the roman triumph that the readers of mark were used to was a full day event it was a full day event that started off as a ju as a as a celebration through the whole city the height of the celebration was a parade and the parade started off with with wagons with floats you know you've we've all kind of i don't know some of us remember christmas parades you got wagons and they decorate them all up you know they cover them over with well if it's the rose bowl they cover them all over with roses but usually we don't we're not quite that extravagant and we decorate them we decorate them for whatever it is we're celebrating if it's canada day we throw canada flags all over the wagons and they're pulled along through town if it's christmas we put christmas decorations on them in the same way we play music through a parade and they would play music as well these wagons were displays of their kings glory the military triumphs he had the kings that he overcame the nations and the cultures that now served rome they were displays of accomplishment take a look see what i have done you need to know because rome's accomplishments were done far away and so the average person in rome had no idea what the war was about it was just some war in some far-off place the empire's growing expanding great sounds good but no one actually knows where these places are but when you're imperitor the word we get emperor from comes back with his army and with his trophies and his treasures and he's parading giraffes and hippos and strange creatures you've never seen before wow then you're impressed hey that's something that's impressive and then after all that display of what he's done now you know why he's so important then he comes and yes he will come on a golden chariot pulled by four white horses the very finest horses that rome has to offer he will have his face painted red his face is painted red because that's the color of jupiter's face king of the gods because for this day that is who he is he's channeling the spirit of the gods through himself on top of that he would have a crown a golden laurel crown letting you know that he's also got the god apollo on his side and behind him stands another man holding another crown above his head can't seem to pile enough crowns on this head he would wear purple on every stitch of clothing where normally it was reserved for as just a stripe for a senator showing that they paid tribute to the gods as the council met no now he would clothe himself in it he would wrap himself in the color of the gods paint it on his face wave it above his head everything he could get and then he would compare himself to those who come after him because after him came his armies the men he used to accomplish all these deeds and these men were the lowest sort of people because that day they displayed himself not as noble soldiers of the empire not the noble men of rome they would sing the trashiest broadest songs that they knew they would insult everyone and everything they would salt insult the army that marched behind caesar insulted him to his face they'd insulted all the people of rome and the entire world around them this is the kingship the declaration that the roman church knew and instead mark writes for them from zechariah chapter 9 verse 9 rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout aloud o daughter of jerusalem behold your king is coming to you righteous and having salvation is he humble and mounted on a donkey on a colt the full of a donkey instead of all that they get a simple man make it a simple god one who is full of all modesty and yet a donkey while being modest is the animal of fruitfulness when you have crops to bring in you don't bring your war horse you bring a donkey because donkeys can carry heavy heavy loads they're incredible animals they're terribly sturdy they don't fall down easily and so when you have a rich produce and you're overflowing in your abundance this is what need you this is the animal you need to carry it and christ is overwhelming in his abundance and so he needs a sturdy animal he has a donkey a cult a foal to carry him because for all his fullness and all the wealth of christ that we see in the in his foreknowledge and in his divinity and in his worship we also see a modesty christ comes into the temple jerusalem went into the temple and when he had looked around at everything as it was already late he went out to bethany with the 12. as great as he is he's still submitting himself to time in all his infinite knowledge and all his infinite will the glory he receives he is modest to accept himself getting there late not late in terms of he should have been there earlier but late in the day that he is a short amount of time christ was with us briefly in terms of human lives he didn't live to be an old man he wasn't 70 or 80 years old he wasn't one of these people from okinawa who lived to be 120. he lived a brief life every moment where it was supposed to be but it wasn't a long time chapter 3 verse 1-3 tells us how he cares so much for his temple romans chapter 5 verse 6 tells us how he came for while we were weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly he came at the proper time he manages time very well and it was late in the day he comes to the temple he looks around and then he goes back to bethany he has impeccable timing the same way he has his place his place was out in bethany it wasn't in jerusalem he wasn't there to build a political career he wasn't there to meet with the leaders jewish or roman instead where does he stay he stays in bethany he stays with friends the place of jesus is with those who love him jesus dwells with his church with his people this is why he does go to the temple isaiah chapter 6 verse 7 says my house the temple will be a place a house of prayer psalm 146 verse 1 one of these psalms of ascent psalms that were sung as they went up to jerusalem says i will dwell in my people i will dwell in the praises of my people where does god dwell he dwells with those who love him those who with paul in timothy chapter 3 verse 16 can say great indeed we confess is the mystery of godliness he was manifested in the flesh vindicated by the spirit seen by angels proclaimed among the nations believed on in the world taken up in glory this is where he dwells as easter comes upon us where are we going to dwell are we going to dwell in a culture that has turned easter into just another reason to sell chocolate or into a rite of spring a turning in our attitudes where we want to get out because we do have to think about where it is we're going to place ourselves do we place ourselves as we go through life with jesus who knows every turn who's worked it out and willed it for us in our lives who accepts our worship will our place be following behind him as our king or will we or will we be those who forget about him who the next day ask who is this and what is he doing upsetting our lives causing all this stir why can't he just keep to his own place this easter christ invites us to dwell with him let's pray heavenly father we thank you we thank you that with you we have a place no matter how many times we've turned away from that place no matter how uncomfortable that place might be still call us to it still you welcome us back to it still you unfold it and show it to us more and more each day we pray father for the grace that your spirit might pour grace upon our lives to bring us to this place where we could know you where we can love you we can worship you we can grow in that knowledge that love that worship that easter would not simply be a season but it would be a place where we remain we prowl this in christ's name amen okay thank you pastor sam uh for today's message um easter is coming and it's um something we that i i feel for myself at least and encourage everyone to just prepare our hearts for it remember um you know we could go to our day-to-day lives and uh forgetting and it's a whirlwind there a lot of busyness especially you know uh i'm feeling right now with with work and a lot of things going on um that is good to come and focus back on on christ on in certain times and to meditate on him um today's uh today's message um something to take to heart is is just the humility of christ and something that we've learned lately yes in levi and with moses and and um to understand the character of of god and character that he is um you know he he he can choose to to come and and ride on on you know even a lion or an elephant or something that looks majestic but he chose he chose he chose a cult um and you know just just remind me of the scripture that we um we we know very well in in philippians your attitude should be the same as that of of christ jesus who being in the very nature of god did not consider equality with god something to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on the cross so as we remember this coming easter that uh just to remember his love for us and and why he came and let us continue to worship and lift him up on high response on unconditional love [Music] for redemption lord your loss was is of my praise [Music] offering my sacrifice all [Music] i [Music] foreign is [Music] offering up my sacrifice my soul with songs of praise thank you lord for your conditional love let us read the doxology to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy to the only god our savior be glory majesty power and authority

products work for you easy recipes on the breakdown you", "1QUDUWlM-EM": "people's apples are delicious they're all year round but when fall comes I must say that I get to craving apple dishes anything using apples and this is exactly what happened with this apple cake that I'm making right now I have four granny smith apples that I've peeled and cored I had I always have fruit in a big basket in my kitchen on the table third of a cup of sugar by the way and one day I had about two apples left and you know what happens they were no longer in eating condition they're a little kind of crusty dried and we needed a dessert the teaspoon of cinnamon by the way and I didn't have a recipe and I feel like dealing with a recipe so what did I do I just whipped something together and that's what this is and it worked so I'm sharing it with you because it's one of those recipes that are foolproof you're going to love it you're going to use it you can make it with pears you can make it with peaches you can make it with anything but it really has its origin in the fall I forgot my lemon juice I want the juice of one lemon which you should pretty much put in before you put in the cinnamon and the sugar but it's okay it helps not only bring out a nice flavor in the apples but also if you're cutting a bunch of a bunch of apples in advance it prevents them from browning because the lemon juice the little acidity from the lemon juice coats the apples but that's okay we've saved it we're fine and I was going to give it one more stir put them aside and they can get all coated and macerated with that cinnamon lemon sugar we'll put that over here and now we'll get started on the simplest cake in the world I have a stick of softened butter I'm putting it a cup of sugar that's it for starters then get your mixer going and get the butter and the sugar creamy and while that's happening I'm going to make the dry mixture in another bowl one cup of flour and you know you should level it out we are baking after all a teaspoon and a half of baking powder so we'll just shake that and then Oh eyeball that a little bit why not and a teaspoon of salt a nice teaspoon of salt that's all we need and instead of sifting it together I'm just gonna whisk it together the easiest way to get your dry ingredients all incorporated and that's ready to go last but not least we have our eggs and vanilla again this is just the simplest little cake you can see how I how I got kind of excited that I might be able to do it myself I'm just gonna turn this off for a second because that's all creamed beautifully and I'm breaking these eggs into One Bowl a few little rules of baking that you might as well adhere to I don't want eggshells in my beautiful batter since I've gotten it started already so I'm going to put the two eggs in here get them starting to mix together you don't want to over mix it and then two good teaspoons of vanilla we have that lemon juice we have the nice tart apples so the couple teaspoons of vanilla will really bring in a beautiful flavor with the cinnamon too all right just for one second I'm just gonna bring this up not too much okay that's good and I'm going to lift this up and just scrape down the sides a little bit to make sure that I have all the butter and the eggs all organized together and that's it now I'm just going to put my dry ingredients in which I've already combined here just dump them in again nothing fancy about this batter close it up and then we want to just mix to combine start out low so the flour doesn't go all over the place make sure that the wet gets mixed in with the flour and then let's just lift it up that's it you have finished your batter in fact if you didn't have a mixer like this you could just do it my hand now if I was alone yes I would start licking the mixer I can't help it old habits die hard and if somebody was here with me who belonged to my family who was sitting in the other room and they heard a mixer and they knew I was baking they'd be eating this too all right now one quick little mix with the spatula all right there you go now I have prepared an 8x8 inch baking pan here it's got butter and then it has some parchment paper one of my favorite little baking tools actually any tool I keep parchment in the cupboard and I use it for a number of things all right now we have not only a mixing bowl but we also have the paddle for somebody to nibble on so I'm just going to smooth this out it doesn't look like a lot of batter but it's going to puff up when it once it has the apples on it just smooth it evenly and the thing that the parchment does is hide from it doesn't stick is that you can so easily lift the whole thing out if you just want to cut it in squares all right little finger action here to get the batter off and next thing I do before I get my cake into a 375 degree oven cooks for a good 45 minutes but here's where I might try to be just a little bit fancy ish just to make it look a little bit harder than it really is is that it will start to take the apples and just shingle them in one direction and I like to do the outsides in the same direction and then I go down the center with a completely different pattern and then the batter puffs up around it the scent in your house is just the essence of fall so when I finish this I'm going to just pop this into that oven it'll be all ready it's a snack it's a dessert it's a breakfast it's anything you want it to be oh yeah it looks beautiful that's exactly what you want to see carefully remove it from the oven it makes me happy when I smell cinnamon and apples together it's nothing but good memories such a simple simple simple recipe brings so much pleasure and don't forget you can use pears or you could use any other kind of fruit just make sure that you cook it a little bit longer than you think because the the fruit brings a lot of moisture", "lspfXzx8XQw": "let me see hey huh is it still dark yeah i don't know what i'm doing y'all but i hope y'all can see that yeah they can see it just encased it but you got the world famous pancakes and crepes and the burgers what a burger is that

morning welcome to Debbie's back porch so glad to have you with us my sister-in-law brought me some dehydrated apples the Apple house up in the North Georgia Mountains and I made some apple fritters so now it feels like summer's over autumns here everything's right with the world here are the ingredients you can pause and write them down and hey while you're at it I'd appreciate it if you'd hit the like button the thumbs up and subscribe and if you hit the bell up at the top then you'll get a notification every time I post a new video now let's get cooking so what she brought me was eight ounce packages she brought me a couple if you want to use fresh apples you can I'll tell you how to do that but for right now we're going to use about four ounces about half of this 8 ounce pack now if you're using fresh apples you want about 3 cups diced very fairly small about a half an inch and you want to saute them in just a little butter just until they start to get soft you want them to stay in chunks but these won't fry a long enough to soften up so soften them before you start now I'm gonna chop these up enough so that when they rehydrate they're gonna be in little chunks and you know there's no science on this just just chop them up and I'm gonna rehydrate these kind of slowly because this is fairly early and I'm not cooking these until dinner so if you chop them it it speeds that up just a little bit and I'm putting these in a pan so that I'll have enough room to cover them with water if you want to do this more quickly you can put hot water in it and put it on the stove and bring them to a boil and then let them sit for an hour so in the hot water turned off so I'm juicing a half lemon here the lemon will help them retain their color and it helps in the acid helps in the batter that I'm just gonna cover these with hot water and put the lid on and let him sit and rehydrate if you choose to do this on the stove be sure you don't cook all the water out this will take two two maybe three hours and I'm back it's almost dinnertime my apples are ready I've measured one and a half cups all-purpose flour I'm adding about a half teaspoon full of salt and I'm gonna add two teaspoons of baking powder here my helpers giving me the milk there you go and then we'll just mix this together with 1/2 cup of whatever sweetener you're using I'm using Splenda you can use sugar then I'm gonna mix the dry ingredients together then I'm gonna drain my apples and I've kind of got this out of order but I think it will still make sense to you and I'm retaining that liquid that Apple II lemony liquid and I'm gonna put it in with my 2/3 cup buttermilk now you want to start with 2/3 cup buttermilk if you don't have enough of the Apple water you'll add a little bit more water but mine worked out just perfect so that I have one cup total now this is how it got out of order I have some more dry ingredients that's a half teaspoon full of 7 cinnamon and then I'm gonna grate in a half of fresh nutmeg if you don't have fresh nutmeg about a quarter teaspoon full of dried nutmeg and you know if you've never used fresh nutmeg you want to try that so I'm just gonna kind of make a little well and add my milk and apple ii lemony juice and mix those together and you know you can use your mixer if you want to it's just not necessary some things are easier to wash than it is to clean up the blender the mixer that's my one egg beaten and it's pretty stiff but it's gonna loosen up and you just mix it until it's all blended in together and you don't have any lumps and that will only take you a minute or so and it's pretty easy and this is the consistency of cake batter and we're going to fold in our apples until they're all mixed in and you know this worked out to about three to three and a half cups of apples as I say if you're working with fresh you want to start with about three cups squeeze the lemon juice over it saute them until you have they're starting to soften and you have a little water little juice at the bottom and now meet you at the stove I have about a quarter to a half inch of oil it's actually lard but you can use oil I'm testing it you see I dropped a little bit of batter in there and it sizzles right away and then I'll drop my batter with the apples in and I'm gonna kind of make these big and flat it'll only hold three in the skillet if you make them a little smaller you could put four and they're gonna cook pretty quickly about a minute to a minute and a half on one side then we'll flip it and cook them about the same on the other and you know it's gonna vary if you need to clip them again you can but we're gonna observe the rules of frying you put it in you leave it alone for at least a minute if you have a good pan and it's the right temperature your fritters will turn loose from the bottom of the pan and they'll be ready to flip you know how when you're making pancakes you see bubbles start to form in the middle where they're coming up and popping and you know it's time to turn them then well the same is true of these fritters and we've got those bubbles coming up in the middle and we're gonna flip it over and I press them down just a little bit you want to make sure these get done all the way through and that sort of flattens them out just a little bit there we go about another minute and a half and I may have gone just a little long we'll check it and see there may be a - done on that side well they're a little browner than I would have liked they won't be magazine perfect but there'd be so yummy it's not they're not burned but they're a little dinner than I would normally cook them so I'm gonna take these out put them on my rack over a paper towel so that they don't drain so they don't sit in the wet paper towel and then I'm gonna cook the rest of these and plate them up and we'll have dinner I've made a little thin glaze that's two tablespoons full of Splenda quarter teaspoon full of cornstarch and enough water to mix it together about two tablespoons full and I'm gonna just drizzle that over you can certainly make a gurgly if you like which is just sugar with enough warm water to melt it and let me give this a bite and look at the inside now these are like cake inside with apples in them it's like a small apple cake and they're just yummy you know this is a fall meal you can taste the cinnamon you can smell the apples and it makes a great dessert it would even make a great breakfast with a little maple syrup instead of the glaze and you can dress them up any way you like thank you for joining us on Debbie's back porch hope to see you again tomorrow", "_OsYqUJVF1w": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make what I call my apple and cranberry bread it's easy to make it's so delicious perfect for fall so let me take you already ingredients so we can get started you'll need some all-purpose flour plain old sugar some grated apples sweetened cranberries is your dry eggs vegetable oil some whole milk baking powder salt cinnamon an orange some vanilla extract and a few additional ingredients to make a cash rusul topping for it which I'll show you in just a few minutes but now let's get started the first thing you want to do is get your oven preheated to 350 the second thing you want do is take a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan spray it with nonstick spray lay the bottom with parchment paper you're good to go alright so let's mix up the dry ingredients first now I'm going to add my cinnamon and my salt and baking powder to my flour give this a stir now if you don't want to use dried cranberries you don't have to if you don't want to use orange zest you don't have to you know these are just things that I love an apple pie because I want to make apple pie you know I always add a little bit of orange zest I always add cinnamon so I figured you know you can't I can't go wrong with those ingredients so that's why I do it but by all means use whatever spices you like and if you do make this recipe and change it up a bit post a picture of my facebook wall just let me know what you put in it you know I want to make the same thing so now let's get working on the wet ingredients in this big jug I'm gonna put in my vegetable oil you could put in unsalted butter softened at room temperature if you wanted to its instead of the vegetable oil I've been adding vegetable oil lately to the touch to my batters because I really feel like the vegetable oil just gives you a lighter consistency to the lighter texture doesn't necessarily taste any different to me it just tastes you know its lighter while the butter gives you a little bit more of a buttery sweet taste and but I know it makes you cakes a little bit more dense which it's totally fine because it tastes delicious so the eggs sugar vanilla good amount and some orange zest now I'm just going to grate this in a half of an orange I'd say I think that'll do I don't want it to be too overpowering so now I'm just going to take my Halfmoon whisk and just give this a head start before I add in the apples looks good I'm going to add them right in get them all out of there now I just used some Honey Crisp apples because that's just what I have on hand any apple will do you know I always like to keep things like this on hand all folding winter sort of leaking out apples and pears and and you know any any moment if I've got some pie crust in the fridge and I've got some fresh fruit I can make a crostata I can make apple bread I need something if I've got guests coming over so take that tip it definitely helps now I'm just going to pour my wet ingredients into my dry I've also reserved just a little bit of the dry ingredients and I mix it with my cranberries because that's you know that's my little trick to make sure that they kind of say evened out throughout the batter instead of sinking all the way to the bottom is that one be fine I'm just going to now switch to my mixer here and just mix until it's all together so it's all nicely combined that looks awesome so now I'm just going to switch to my spatula I'm going to add in my cranberries and then just fold them in I don't want to you know I don't want to use my mixture because I want to stir these in as gently as possible because I don't want to overwork the flour and develop the gluten because then it will make the apple bread sort of a traditionally white bread texture which is dense and doughy which is great and say you know nice loaf of ciabatta or something like that but with this you want to be moist and soft so don't overwork the batter that's really important so now that you got that done just pour into your 1985 loaf pan like I've got and then just try and get it as even as possible and it all out of there I love this loaf pan I've had this loaf pan since I probably moved to the States so we're talking more or less about 14 years that's why I said get get it get it going because it never fails me I've had that for so long and it's just works wonders so now to make the topping what I've got here some brown sugar tiny pinch of cinnamon and salt and some all-purpose flour I'm just going to give this a head start with a spoon just to kind of mix those dry ingredients together a bit and then that's good enough and then I'm going to put in some cold unsalted butter and I'm using a pastry cutter you can use a fork it'll do it exactly the same thing and just cut it in until the butter is just cut into smaller pieces and it's just you know evenly spread out throughout the dry ingredients that looks great out and now lastly I'm going to fold in some walnuts you don't have to if you don't want to do so just some chopped walnuts love walnuts and I like the crunch that it provides so like I said if you don't want to don't but I'm going to and I'm just going to take this mixture and sprinkle it all over the top and some of it will melt down into the batter some of it will crisp up on top it's pretty much gonna do whatever it you know it wants to do but I can guarantee you it's going to taste amazing so and then you've got that evenly throughout the top I'm going to pop this into the oven it's a 350 for around an hour or until it's completely cooked and easiest way to tell it to take a toothpick or a skewer or a dry piece of spaghetti insert it into the center and if it comes out clean without any wet batter and then you know it's done and then you want to let it cool for a while before you serve it and I'll show you what it looks like once it's done my Apple bread baked for about an hour and I've let it cool for around 20 minutes and I just put it on this platter it's time to dig in I'm going to tell you it smells incredible in here like the whole kitchen just smells of apple and cinnamon and orange nothing wrong with that oh just going to give this a little taste I'm going to take this piece right here the crunchy topping mmm that is delicious it's got like a really good flavor like an apple pie flavor mmm go back for more if you want to get this recipe you know where to get it

easy and delicious Apple Cake. It's an old family reciped that\ncomes out perfect every time. It's easy because You simply prepare 3 parts to the recipe and\nthen you assemble it all in the pan. Let me show you the 3 parts:\nFirst we have the Dry Ingredients, we'll use 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 1/2 cups\nof sugar, 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 4 tablespoons of butter or margarine. Second part of the recipe are the Wet Ingredients which consists of 1 Cup of Milk, 2 eggs and 1 tsp of vanilla Extract. Finally the 3rd part of the recipe is the\nApple Filling, I like to use 2 sour apples like Granny Smith, a tablespoon of lemon juice,\n1 tablespoon of sugar,and a half of a teaspoon of cinnamon. So lets get started with the first part of\nthe recipe: the dry ingredients: in a medium bowl, I put flour, sugar, and baking powder and then I give it a good mix with a wire whisk. Next I add the cubed butter, preferably cold, And then I squeeze the butter into the flour with my fingers until it's well mixed and all the big pieces of butter disappear, leaving the flour a little bit more yellow in color and grainy.   OK, this is what it\nshould look like and we set it aside, in the upper right corner of the screen Now comes the second part of the recipe: the Wet Ingredients. In a smaller bowl I place 2 eggs ,\nand they need to be beaten for a good 3 to 5 minutes, until they turn a lighter yellow\ncolor and they are completely blended. This step is VERY important because you don't want chunks of egg yolk or chunks of egg white in your cake. I speed up the video a little bit. This is what it should look like, lighter\nin color and frothy. Now I add the vanilla, and I beat some more. Finally I add the milk slowly while I continue beating so it all gets well blended. Once I'm done, I set the bowl on the upper\nmiddle part of the screen. Finally here comes the 3rd part of the recipe: the Apple Filling. In a medium bowl, the first ingredient I add\nis the lemon juice. Next I start peeling and slicing the first\ngreen apple. As you can see the slices should be about a fourth of an inch thick at its\nouter edge. Quickly I give the apples a stir with the\nlemon juice until they are well coated; this prevents the apples from turning brown. Now I do the same with the second apple, peeling\nand slicing it, and giving it a good stir with the lemon juice. Once it's all coated with lemon juice, I add\nthe cinnamon, and the sugar, and I continue stirring until everything is coated Alright, so this is the Apple Filling, and I'll set it aside on the upper left corner of the screen. I preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. And I have the 3 parts of my cake here in front of me;\nthe dry ingredients, the wet ingredients, and the apple filling. And I prepare my baking dish, I butter it and I flour it. And we're ready to assemble: I grab the dry ingredients and I run a knife a little less than halfway down the dry ingredients. This smaller portion will be the bottom layer of my cake. I lightly spoon this smaller portion of dry\ningredients into the baking dish. Once this is complete, I lightly even it out with a fork, And when I even it out, I try not to  press it down. The second part of the assembly of the cake is  adding the apple filling, in this case the apple slices coated with cinnamon and sugar. I like to place them a bit on top of each\nother so there are plenty of apples in each serving. This is what it should look like at the end. And no need to press the apples down. And now we are at the third part of the assembly: we add the remainder of the dry ingredients on top of the apple filling, again I spoon the dry ingredients lightly\nover the apples, making sure I coat everything, and without pressing the dry ingredients down at all. I give the baking dish a good jiggle and the cake evens out and the dry ingredients fall into the cracks of all the apple slices. The fourth and final part of the assembly\nof the cake is to add the wet ingredients, but first I give it a good stir and then I\npour gently over the entire cake. At this point, it's VERY important to let\nthe cake sit for 10 minutes so the liquids can get all soaked up into the dry ingredients. This is what it should look like and off to the oven it goes for 55 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Here's the baked cake, very nice! I like to let it cool in the same dish for about 45 minutes before serving. Alright, I'm ready to serve, here I go. Look at all those apples well baked and nicely packed in the center layer of the cake. You can see that the cake is moist, and the batter was well blended without ever beating the wet and dry ingredients together. I'm ready to give it a taste, and believe me, this cake tastes as delicious as it looks. Every piece is packed with apples. Absolutely delicious I'm going to have to go for another piece.

today we're going to show you a simple and delicious apple pie recipe and I think that you'll like it so I hope that you give it a try and let me know if you do so let's get to baking and thanks for joining us today here are the Honey Crisp apples that we harvested we harvested about just under three five-gallon buckets full so at least 50 60 pounds this but box is very heavy we have some in the refrigerator as well most of these that are the imperfect ones some have scabs some holes on them so this will be used for cooking baking still very good though you can split eat this as isn't just cut off the bad parts so my aunt and uncle does not use any pesticides or chemicals so therefore they don't always get perfect apples but we do we did get a lot of really nice-looking ones these are so delicious so crispy and juicy so we're going to be baking some apple bread today [Music] so first we're going to combine our dry ingredients I have six cups of flour in this bowl we're going to put two teaspoons of baking powder two teaspoons of baking soda [Music] two teaspoons of salt and three teaspoons of ground cinnamon [Music] yeah I just mix it together or you can use a whisk how I usually do it and set that aside in a separate bowl you're going to combine two cups of vegetable oil which already have in this bowl here with to NAV cups of granulated sugar you can use three cups if we're using tart apples Honey Crisp apples are very sweet as it's already step together we're going to add six eggs to you take them first and whisk that together we're going to go ahead and add our diced apples and I've got 6 cups of diced apples here you can use up to between I mean 7 to 8 apples depending on the size some of these were small let me take your spatula or one of Smith's and just combine it together now we're going to add our flour mixture you can do half at a time here play I'm making a big batch [Music] so once you have all your ingredients combined you can just scoop it out and put them in your control pans I sprayed it with vegetable oil just make sure you place equal amounts on each pan so they bake evenly these are ready to go in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown we made 11 loaves or bread today the first batch I made 5 because I put more batter in each pan so second batch I made 6 you can tell them a little shorter than the first batch taller loaves of bread there so I hope that you guys give this a try thanks for watching everyone have a great day [Music]", "HcxiI8AjE-s": "that was the stupidest thing that all these corporate guys thought that they were going to come into business you don't know even know who you're advertising to you're advertising to people you're advertising their [ __ ] soccer moms they don't buy weed they buy a pan every six weeks right that's not who you have to go after you're going after all the wrong people so it's like going into something not even knowing who the people are you're selling to and then trying to market to everybody and then the people in the cannabis community are all that's lame [Music] so what is good iris tv today we are back bringing you some more of

you're broke at first like for a year 18 months you don't make any money you do it for cheap and you do it because you want to make it work right you're not like trying to take the money right away you know because that's what happens you take people that take the money first they always crumble in 2016 i started putting fresh baked it wasn't even a company yet but it was because i started growing some exotics like the cookies the fritters [ __ ] like that so i started moving away from the ogs and it was all like everything had like a cookie or a pastry kind of name you know so that's why i started paying fresh bakes so we just turned it into a trademark and turn it into the brand yeah this is uh it's been a long it's been a long time we waited two years for this so now that it's now that it's working it's like it actually worked better than we thought it would like we had no idea they were gonna work this good we did it and i thought you know two pounds a lot around two pounds of light and then with all these trays it's like almost three pounds of light now yeah it's crazy so much better yeah these will stay in here for about three weeks from this stage when they're like this big flower you know but all this gets hand watered also that's why they're that's why they're you know like when you hand water them they're healthy you put them like that it's like it stays the same you know it doesn't fall over like you do everything automated and it flops over because everything's weaker the cannabis community will they'll pick what the top brand is all you gotta do is get it out in the market you know they'll figure out they'll figure out what's good and what's not it's official like fresh big like [ __ ] jar like first batch right now like officially underneath 2018 i think yeah i think it was two that's where we found you guys was that complex conflict was like the first debut yeah i wish you didn't pack all the fresh baked boxes what what did you do we packed them all for delivery oh you did um i run packaging i do instagram i have a ton of awesome girls that help me with everything and they're they're awesome dude [ __ ] off my dad really holds all of us to you know a really high bar because he's super into quality and making sure everything's perfect so we double triple check everything we sort through everything we grade everything a certain way i mean so it gets distributed evenly so this is mac this was just trimmed so this hasn't been fully graded yet um we'll go through it we'll separate any kind of smalls that have been kind of left behind and we'll use these for pre-rolls and then we'll package all the bags and the mediums into our jars so have you just always had like wheat around you your whole life yeah since i can remember i mean i remember when i was little eating breakfast at the table then there's like 30 40 pounds of weed just chilling so i mean i've been around it since i can remember working with family is crazy it's i guess i can't explain it but people who work with family probably understand it's it's a totally different environment i think it's cool too because i feel like everything that goes on in here i have his best intention because it's his company i mean i've been around it my whole life so i've watched him build it from like a closet to this yeah i did he started in a closet like my sister and shared a bedroom we were broke my dad worked in a freezer for a long time we would trim in the kitchen when uh they were sleeping all night like trimming because i didn't trust anybody to do it you know i'd spray my kids off febreze at the door my babysitter my babysitter my sister assistant i like your mommy exactly everybody's gotta have a mommy now she's just good she's taking care of me by the time i have kids it's gonna be like a [ __ ] cake walk no [ __ ] problem i've been doing this all my life until i watch them real quick actually so here's where all the [ __ ] the beginning of life starts we have all our clones got two trays worth of clones in here and then we take all our cuts and we always have a steady supply of clones that we keep in the fridge and we'll see [Music] nice little tray of fritter clones i started off as a trimmer working for bobby and i started trimming him for about two or three months until i asked out his daughter in front of him fired me that night fired me that night fired amanda that night too basically amanda came and moved in with me for the next few months slowly over time my bobby started to like me and he called me one day i was like hey avery come over and uh let me punch you in the face let my dog attack you and i'll let you date my daughter the driver of it over there i'm like all right punch me in the face just don't hit my nose i don't want to get surgery again on it and he's like ah you're cool i just wanted to see if you had the balls to come over here and do that and then uh you know the rest is history after that i started working for him and then just was the only one that really paid attention to listen to how he does everything everything he's done he's done the same way since the beginning once you learn that process and get that down everything's a lot easier i got thrown into a hundred like row eight months later had a another what two to three hundred like row right next door thought i was watching for the uh two or three years and then the circle opened and then this place is open so now i'm over here running this place over here and it's a it's a [ __ ] dream come true working with my girlfriend and her dad and everyone in the family aspect everyone's got the best intentions everyone has each other's backs we all work really good as a team it makes it work it's not even like going to work i actually enjoy coming here i prefer being here than being at home so i'm with my friends and family it's a lot of fun and you get to do what you love and smoke the best [ __ ] weed it doesn't get any better than this like the difference between your guys's flower you guys hand water everything that's right i do everything by hand it's the only way to garden and do it right everybody that says we have craft cannabis but everything's on timers let's not craft cannabis that's why weed sucks now in the wheat market because everybody's out automated you know anybody anybody that says oh yeah small batches crap cannabis you're doing [ __ ] it doesn't matter if you're doing a 20 lighter or 80 lighter if you're doing automatic watering it's not small batch it's still automated you know i think a lot of the the corporate people are just trying to find a shortcut and it's never going to be like that yeah not if you're going to do it right in sports in sports gardening anything if you don't like it you're not going to be good at it and you can't just find people that that say they like it and be like oh this guy's gonna figure it out it's not they're not gonna figure it out it's not not possible and then you get the corporate people and they're like they think they're smarter than us because we're in the weed business like guy waste 350 million dollars he's still broke you haven't just you haven't figured out how to make weed work when you have millions of dollars it's never going to happen when it costs 200 bucks to sell a hundred dollars worth of weed you're dumb ass you know what i mean i was trying not to say it but you know everybody knows who that is just about this that apple yeah yeah that's that's what the number one thing is to have good weed is to figure out how to process it because you can ruin it in the processing this is more of like an art to dry it cure it than to grow it the most important part there's like a thousand different things if one thing's off it's not gonna work and that's what these guys haven't figured out and you you hire an engineer but if he hasn't if he hasn't worked in the weed game it doesn't matter what what college you went to because he doesn't know what he's doing you know you wouldn't hire a guy you wouldn't hire a guy from the alcohol industry to work in the weed industry and you wouldn't hire a weed guy to go work in the alcohol industry like i wouldn't go make wine and six months later be like i used to grow weed i grew the best wheat i'm gonna [ __ ] make the best wine [ __ ] it's never gonna work it'll all change i think people will catch up but i think it's going to take a couple years and you know what the reason one of the reasons why nobody has there's there hasn't been anything like on a large scale where anybody can keep the quality so there's there's no there's no place for it to start that seems to be the most like consistent problem is like all these brands trying to scale so big and just like you go big before you figure out how to do it yeah if you figure out how to do 300 lights and 200 lights and do it a [ __ ] boutique quality you can do a thousand likes 2 000 lights you can you can replicate it that was the stupidest thing that all these corporate guys thought that they were gonna come into business you don't know even know who you're advertising to you're advertising to people you're advertising their [ __ ] soccer moms they don't buy weed they buy a pan every six weeks right that's not who you have to go after you're going after all the wrong people so it's like going into something not even knowing who the people are you're selling to and then trying to market to everybody and then the people in the canvas community are all that's lame we have a couple more girls that we're setting up hopefully they'll all be done before 2020 we have a lab that's being built in long beach so we'll have a type 7 so should be by the end of the year we should be cranking like completely vertically integrated with a lab all of our own stuff so we have we have two distros this should be we should be up and running all the way by the end of 2020.

it's served all day all right let's do it oh yeah oh yeah i'm getting that vibe of cinnabon\u00a0\nright now but it's not quite as sweet believe it\u00a0\u00a0 or not so i'm really surprised by that because\u00a0\nit looks like it's going to be very very sweet\u00a0\u00a0 lots of gooey goodness on the inside and\u00a0\nthe layers of that pastry dough are in there\u00a0\u00a0 nice and buttery a little bit on\u00a0\nthe flaky side but man that icing\u00a0\u00a0 is awesome the cream cheese icing is\u00a0\noff the chain let's go for another bite look at the bottom of this one are you getting\u00a0\nhungry yet because this is absolutely satisfying\u00a0\u00a0 a major sweet tooth right now guys the icing is\u00a0\namazing on top of all the gooey cinnamon goodness\u00a0\u00a0 and again the flaky goodness that i'm getting\u00a0\nthe butteriness of it all is really insane and\u00a0\u00a0 of course the very middle is the capper right\u00a0\nover there this is just a very very delicious\u00a0\u00a0 item right now and i'm glad i'm starting off\u00a0\nwith this because it is crazy delicious and on\u00a0\u00a0 top of it being crazy delicious the price isn't\u00a0\nbad i mean the typical cinnabon is about five\u00a0\u00a0 bucks or so so at $2.69 you're getting something\u00a0\nthat's maybe just a little bit smaller overall\u00a0\u00a0 but man does it satisfy the itch of what this\u00a0\nhas so super delicious let's go for another bite man i'm so in love with this icing right now\u00a0\nit's so good you know as good as this is right\u00a0\u00a0 now i may have to swing on back to give that\u00a0\napple fritter and the blueberry muffin a shot\u00a0\u00a0 as well they had those in the case when i was\u00a0\nthere picking this one up and it did actually\u00a0\u00a0 look really really tasty so i wanted to start off\u00a0\nwith this naturally because like i said cinnamon\u00a0\u00a0 rolls are one of my favorites and i'm so glad\u00a0\nthat i did the quality is amazing on this all\u00a0\u00a0 right so i think you can tell i'm pretty much\u00a0\nenjoying this right now guys i mean the gooeyness\u00a0\u00a0 is pretty much on point the quality is pretty\u00a0\namazing for what it is the price is decent as\u00a0\u00a0 well a little under three bucks you really can't\u00a0\nbeat that let's go for one more bite we'll finish\u00a0\u00a0 this one up after the rating and i'll give you one\u00a0\nmore close-up but guys super delicious let's do it right down the middle of this one so you can see\u00a0\nthat nice little cascade of icing right there guys\u00a0\u00a0 lots of gooey goodness and like i said the quality\u00a0\nspeaks for itself as you can see it's very sizable\u00a0\u00a0 and i have to admit the icing is a\u00a0\nmajor highlight on top of the cinnamon\u00a0\u00a0 nice and gooey and of course if you want to\u00a0\neat this with a fork and a knife nothing wrong\u00a0\u00a0 with that but you really gotta go gangster with\u00a0\nit to really enjoy it as far as i'm concerned\u00a0\u00a0 this is really really great so with that said i'm\u00a0\ngonna have to give the all-new cinnamon roll here\u00a0\u00a0 at mcdonald's a rock solid 10 out of 10 this\u00a0\nabsolutely delivered right out the gate guys\u00a0\u00a0 and it's going to be very hard to top this one\u00a0\nfor sure because of the quality of what i just\u00a0\u00a0 had right now it's not as sweet as you think\u00a0\nit's going to be considering how much icing and\u00a0\u00a0 cinnamon is in that but the balance just works\u00a0\nwith everything and again that buttery flaky\u00a0\u00a0 dough that it's made out of is such a beautiful\u00a0\nsituation it's very hearty when you bite into it\u00a0\u00a0 and just super satisfying and hey like i said if\u00a0\nyou want to use this with a knife and a fork go\u00a0\u00a0 for it but honestly go gangster with it pick it up\u00a0\ndive into it enjoy it it's totally worth your time\u00a0\u00a0 alright so now the obvious question are you\u00a0\ngonna be giving this one a shot personally for me\u00a0\u00a0 i don't see how you can considering you've made it\u00a0\nthis far into the review you have to jump on over\u00a0\u00a0 to mickey d's and give this one a go and when you\u00a0\ndo drop some comments down below let me know what\u00a0\u00a0 you thought of it and actually was it the same\u00a0\nprice for you when you got it $2.69 or so drop those\u00a0\u00a0 comments down below and definitely let me know and\u00a0\nwith that this is Ian K closing out another high\u00a0\u00a0

some Lumpy's flowers that's right this particular flavour here is the Cali berry coming in at 23.82 THC and we picked this up at Garden of Eden and Haworth Garden of Eden I want to take a little a little I guess he recalled a quote straight from their website right here Lumpy's flower calm here we go this lady looks and probably smells as amazing as the actress from which the name was derived from the aroma from this bud is sweet smell of fruit berries with a gasp undertone the colors on this bud is a 50/50 mix of lively green with a rich purple much like the actress once smoked the inhale is smooth and really flavorful with a deep berry undertone a true bombshell this lady won second place at the Central Valley High Times Cup in 2018 in the hyper category whoa I don't know about any of that all I know is it reeks right now it reeks of grapes it reeks like dogs walls the crazy purple okay you went straight to it right right before we sat down to do this review I was getting the close-ups of this weed and as soon as I open the jars it just started reeking like that crazy thick dankey like purpley fruity 2012 elemental wellness dog's waltz on steroids I looked at it and I was like it kind of looks like it it looks a little better I'm gonna be honest but it smells almost just like it that one dog's waltz was help me out here purple Urkel and a can some type of Kendra's dog I think I'm pretty sure it's purple Oracle and Trez dog that was the dog's waltz that we used to get way back in the day like he was saying some elemental wellness anyway enough [ __ ] and we probably should get to smoke in here yeah I definitely want to smoke some of this [ __ ] well a little bit about one piece from what we could find you know they're obviously a California brand they'd been around for quite some time now 15 years they originated out of wine country up in Northern California definitely a good brand they obviously you know got quite a big following I got around eighty four thousand followers on Instagram and Counting and yeah I mean definitely blown up on the scene lightweight you know these days what I really like about them I'm trying to of their other strains if you look at their menu online and most likely if you've tried a few different flavors of theirs before you're gonna notice they grow a lot of purples and if you've been watching this show for a while you know we're a fan of that oh yeah I mean we love our grapes we get a steady dose of grapes over here we were just talking but not that long ago on the podcast about how we want that really really good great to come back yeah I mean you know we definitely search for our grapes but these days I feel like it's just a lot of cookies and cookie crosses in gelato like that's it's not the same time I have the color but it's not the same this honestly has the color of some like straight or you know but it really does remind me of the Daleks waltz it's got that same turf but to me it's on steroids like it reeks like the dogs walls to me was always saying that smells good but I wish it was a lot louder you know I wish it was like punching this I still taste it like I took that bong right probably a couple minutes ago at least and it's still heavy on my palate like it's a thick flavor but it is so smooth job there's almost no lung expansion on this at all for me no way yeah I think it probably has to do a little bit with how thick you pack your bowl too yeah but that one was just perfect amount of airflow perfect amount of diffusion honestly like you can take nice big rips of this [ __ ] and it's smooth oh yeah I really like the texture of this weed you know Nikki has is the stick test for sure it's really uh you know I would say my favorite features of this weed are you know the looks but the smell and the taste really come through to like I love when a when weed can can taste like it smells you know not all we does that I decided before the number one thing I go off of more than anything else when I'm shopping for we to smell yeah I miss smell but sometimes it doesn't taste like it's smell that's true just because it smells good it doesn't mean it's gonna taste not as good as it smells this one I feel like delivers sometimes I just get that pretend oh that like smells hella good but then it just doesn't come through on the flavor you know this reminds me of like a grape soda mm-hmm you know yeah like yeah this should be part group so I mean I like the name don't get me wrong can we do a strainer of you on some group yeah from up north now this smells way more like grape soda than that that's the only reason I say it I don't mean I mean I like ha I like Cali berry but this really just smells so like great be [ __ ] funky I don't know it's like literally like a great candy guys it smells like a great candy if you can get your hands on some of this I highly suggest it are you going with the rating on this one overall all right to rate this overall I'm gonna have to give this a solid 9 I'm gonna give it a 9 strictly for its smell and its taste just the way that they correspond to each other I love when we you know like I said taste like it smells this delivers that and it's packing a punch at almost twenty four percent so I'm gonna give it a nine yeah I think that's a pretty fair rating I'm super curious to know what the genetics are in this one as far as I know they don't really you know share publicly what the genetics are on most of their strains you know maybe they mentioned it before on IG but yeah I've been curious to know what some of these different flavors what the actual genetics of these of these cultivars are right I mean as these you know new strands come out you know it's our job to find out so if you know and put it down in the comments if you know anything about Cali Barry from Lumpy's you know we're gonna continue to search but yeah right now the genetics are kind of unknown but definitely some perp and we're loving it yeah it's really really good I definitely feel my eyes getting heavy yeah honestly man I don't really know what could be better about this weed the smell is there for me for sure right Mel is 10 out of 10 I love the way it looks you know it's written the notes have a really really nice structure to it they're not super blown out but they are nice and dense super well trimmed got that crazy stick factor going on the taste is there it's really smooth I definitely want to roll but joint and see how it smokes in a joint definitely but I think this might be a ten out of ten for me ten yeah I'm really [ __ ] like this weed and you know I'm back in the day dogs waltz was one of my favorite it's like that was one of those strains that you know usually when we were shopping at dispensaries at that point in time we would just buy those expensive $65 aids just to review different things on the show but that was one of those ones I would keep going back to paying that price and buying those aids of that [ __ ] you know for 60 bucks every now and then like repeatedly and that was one of the few strings I could say that for this reminds me of that more than any other oh me too it's like dogs waltz on steroids hey guys you don't get tense from this guy too often you know this [ __ ] some fire I do want to say before we end this video the packaging is definitely on point I do want to point that out you know respect is definitely earned right there absolutely I was good I'm glad you brought that up because I did want to mention that in this video and I totally would have forgot about it that was actually a big factor for why we just bought this [ __ ] yeah when we went to the dispensary they had all kinds of different flowers from different brands some we had never heard of some we had no wanting to try like lumpy stuff but they had really nice packaging where you can see the weed there's a ton of area here where you could see the weed it's not like it used to be where you know you go in and they show you a big jar of it and you get to smell it and you kind of you know get a get a feel for what the mud actually smells like looks like feels like even just by looking at it you can't smell it and in some cases you can't see it now because other companies had you know completely paid like [ __ ] covered by snake jars or they had there are some that glass jars you know they spent the extra money on three glass jars with the endo label all the way around right I really like the way their labeling looks the way the branding is on here and for the consumer at this point just to be able to see the weed this this well that's good definitely huh I mean you know one piece is definitely making a little wave in the industry right now so shout out to Lumpy's this is Cali Barry I'm Danny for the ccc for another string review like and subscribe down there do all that down there somewhere and we will be back next week for another strain review yes stay tuned to the CCC I'm Shane and I'm Danny again and we heard out again I'm at the liquor store getting low blows to the skull hit the back in the ship", "NCfvjO5ecMI": "you are my cinnamon rolls my tasty cinnamon rolls i'm here for you yeah i'm here for you oh my tasty cinnamon rolls my lovely cinnamon rolls i'm here for you oh i am here for you [Music] howdy fellow foodie friends hoosier daddy here thanks for joining me so i am here today at mcdonald's because they have released a few new items on their breakfast menu they have a cinnamon roll a blueberry muffin and an apple fritter but i'm here to try out the cinnamon roll because hardee's also has a cinnamon roll on their menu i tried that about a month ago when it came out and i did a little mini review at the end of one of my other videos so i thought we would go ahead and give the hearty cinnamon roll a proper review and pit it up against mcdonald's new cinnamon roll we're gonna see which one is better now before we get started if you like food reviews and food challenges and all kinds of food related content like that make sure you hit the subscribe button down below along with the notification bell so you don't miss out on any of my future content so mcdonald's new cinnamon roll just came out today along with their other new breakfast items and hearty cinnamon rolls already been out for a while but they are both very similar mcdonald's is 560 calories and it is 2.99 hardee's is only 520 calories and it is 2.79 so very similar in price and calories let's see what they look like okay so when you look at them side by side they're very different hardy's put theirs in a big box so it makes it look smaller and actually it is significantly smaller than the mcdonald's version and hardee's was kind of skimpy with their icing what the heck mcdonald's definitely a lot more generous but it does look like that almost it kind of reminds me of the icing that comes on a honey bun now if you are a fan of this channel you already know that i'm a big fan of hearties especially their breakfast i think their breakfast is probably my favorite compared to all the other fast food places but mcdonald's is pretty good too so i'm gonna try to judge these objectively and fairly and give you the fairest assessment that i can now i will tell you holding them up side by side mcdonald's does feel a little denser and a little heavier they both gave me forks and knives but i'm just gonna go and move my hands so starting out with hardee's skimpy on the icing more of a square looking cinnamon roll let's give it a taste cheers that's good about like i remember it tastes like your pretty standard cinnamon roll nothing spectacular i my suspicions are correct the icing doesn't taste like it's a cream cheese icing if it does have any it's just very faint it's mostly just a plain sweet icing i mean it's still good when it's moist the dough is flaky it's it's good it tastes like your standard cinnamon roll but let's see if mcdonald's is any better this one honestly does look a lot better it looks like a thicker cream cheese icing on it it kind of reminds me of cinnabon icing it doesn't smell like it but it does look kind of like it that thicker tastier icing so let's give this one a shot cheers okay it looked a lot different actually doesn't taste too different it's good that's good i'm surprised honestly i didn't have real high hopes for this but that's good so the the dough is pretty similar just a good standard cinnamon roll though a little flaky and buttery the icing is where i'm getting a big difference this does have a stronger cream cheese flavor so i'm going to have to try them side by side because the cinnamon flavor tastes about the same the dough tastes about the same but mcdonald's was a lot more generous with icing and icing i think tastes better okay hmm as much as i hate to admit it i think i gotta give this one to mcdonald's mcdonald's you're the winner yay but don't get me wrong hardee's is still good both of these are really similar this is really close and i think they were both made really well there's not a big difference i mean the biggest difference is really the icing if you like a stronger cream cheese flavor and you like a lot more icing get the mcdonald's if you like more of just the sweet plain icing get the hardy's one now i will tell you if you go to hardee's and you don't like them skimpy on icing like that ask them for a little extra i'm sure they will happily oblige yeah all both of these are really good i don't remember if i rated the hardy's one before but i probably give this one about 8.9 and i give the mcdonald's one probably about a 9.2 so they're both officially endorsed by hoosier daddy so if you're near mcdonald's or near hardy's and you want a cinnamon roll they both have them and they're both good so go ahead and go try one tell them who's your daddy sent you i don't know if they'll know what you're talking about but hey it's worth a shot and uh don't forget to hit that like button down below subscribe to the channel share this out with your friends all that good stuff and i will see you again next time thanks bye you", "2axuTjYRYEM": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a big beautiful bud of something called Obama runts and it's from five Society and chokes up and I had a really run to get this flower I was very lucky someone posted under the Daily Post on weed entertainment that Obama runts was gonna be at museums or embers delivery service in Van Nuys and I was able to call over there in the morning get the manager on the phone and he was able to hold me one eighth of Obama runts and I ran down there as he was leaving and I actually got one of them today we're gonna review it and you can see this flower just looks unbelievable and we're gonna load one more little scooper of Obama runts into paper cups straw these are haul all man-made so they're exactly fitted to this cup and we're gonna tamper so it's about the same amount as a bong yet and we're gonna load this right into vapor Cup and you can see I've got vapor Cup set to 330 degrees and about a minute and a half this cup is gonna release the water vapor from the Obama runts and you know it's almost a little scary we've tried maybe eight eight strains of different runts and some of them were killers like can'tit grunts or two pink runts we're really really really strong flowers Hawaiian runts but Obama runts is the one that everyone's talking about right now so we're all excited to try it this is a limited drop to get this flower you really had to run with the Bulls so it's very exciting so you could see that oh oh bomber runs comes in this jar and it's got pictures of Obama himself done like Andy Warhol on it and you can see it says Obama runts it's by far society hand jokes up and this flower is a heavy hitter 33% THC and it's no easy feat to do that so you know fire society really is looking to take one of their premier flowers put it the Obama branding right and this flower is a beautiful looking bud so let's check it out so you can see vapor cup right now as you can see the vapor right in the straw right there I mean it's in curl that's how you know when it's ready to go when you have all the condensation like that so let's check it out you have Obama runts by five Society jokes up at 330 degrees this is the brand new drop let's see if the runts Obama run stock the game being a little careful in the first one you never know this cup makes such unbelievable flavor I'm telling you people are watching these videos every day and you're thinking about whether to pull the trigger on one of the cups you're making a big mistake man this thing is incredible it's really game changing technology change of way of the path of how to use marijuana it's incredible so this flower has absolutely a great cure it's like the meat falls off the bones and I'm telling you this is sticky wonderful this flower was given the love the flavor is smooth it's got a powdery weedy taste at the beginning it's OG ish meaning it's got that Poong the pungent taste well this hunts looking for the best and every day I tried pretty much a different flower and this is one of the few flowers I had a run to go get it so what did we think of Obama runs we're looking for the best well this flower was good it wasn't so heavy it was an even feeling and I thought it was a cruiser and also it's clear and cruising and clear is a good combination I'm given Obama runs in 875 it didn't get the nine cuz it didn't grin me out but this is a really good flower and I would say for someone who likes runts the Obama wrench is definitely a try it's not crazy like some of the other runs like Hannity crunch or some of those other really strong words I would say Obama ranks is a little bit more clear-headed a little bit more reasonable and maybe this I thought was gonna rain good on the runts monkey a strange scale if you like runts I definitely think you should try the Obama runs but one thing you should know this flower was expensive and I don't know if I would spend that much money on it over time this thing will be in the market and the price will come down and I just think that some of these dispensaries are gouging on these new drops I appreciate the chance to get the flower so I'm not talking bad about anyone but there's got to be some limitation on what flowers cost it's unfair because when you go and you're gonna say okay I'm gonna buy Obama runs today you don't know if it's good or not good in the jar but I'm gonna tell everyone on Whedon entertainment what I thought Obama runs it's an 875 it's a super strong flower and worth the try I'm the doctor you want to see paper cup this item right here you can see it on vapor Cup calm and I'm telling you this is a game-changing thing come home every day and enjoy life as good as it can be vapor Cup is awesome the flavor is through the roof and everyone who gets it emails me and says oh my god it's an awesome and it is awesome if you're looking for strains go to wheat entertainment calm those strains Plus this cup will stone you to the bone enjoy life get a vapor Cup thanks for joining in if you like the videos please subscribe I'm the doctor thanks for joining in party on my friends [Music]", "Z1gBjAS82tU": "[Music] [Music] foreign good

just really wanna push you this morning to do that for us i really appreciate it but now we're gonna get back into our time of giving and this is our time of worshiping so i want you to prepare your hearts right now [Music] okay forget about the announcements well don't forget to rsvp but besides that i want you i want you to start preparing your hearts because this is our time to get back into worship we're going to worship in our giving and then we're going to go back into a time of prayer and song but just start to prepare your hearts in isaiah 29 the lord warns us because he says that the people were just worshiping with their lips they were just coming close to god with their mouths and they were honoring with their lips but their hearts were far from him we can sing we can worship we can honor god with our lips but where's our hearts because it says where your treasure is there your heart will be also so where's your treasure this morning are we going to put god first are you going to put god first where is your heart and so this morning i just i ask you to look inside and say where's my heart am i just here because that's what i was told to do because it says in the next next verse in that isaiah 29 it says they were worshiping god based on what they learned what what humans had taught them on how to worship we need to get away from that we need to worship based on where our hearts are at if our hearts are with god if our treasure is with god then we're going to worship god in full surrender and and that's not just with our mouths that's with our finances because if your treasure lies there then your heart lies there and your heart isn't here with god in worship and so this morning just just take a look inside and say god where's my heart and and don't feel obligated to give give out of a place of thankfulness because because your heart says god you've been so good to me thank you for what you're doing in my life and what you're going to do in my life because i may not see it right now but i know you're working in my life even when i don't see it you're working in my life and so we're going to worship god in our giving right now and so if you'll take your gift in your hand we're gonna pray over it because it is god's and we want it to go where god wants it to go so if you'll take your gift in your hand and pray with me and worship with me father thank you for this opportunity you are a good father and this morning we worship you in our giving we absolutely worship you in our giving and i pray that you reveal in my heart in all of our hearts god where our treasure lies where where our heart is is our heart with you god and if it's not i pray that you correct us and that you that you just land on us in this worship and that you just you just encourage us to go the right direction you are a good father and father this morning we just we give to you and and we we thank you and it's not out of a place of obligation but out of a place of thankfulness we pray that you would bless the gift and bless the giver in jesus name amen amen you can worship in your giving bridge and we're going to go back into this time of worship in our song and we're going to sing about how good god is and if you'll stand with me the goodness of our father the goodness of our god because he is so good and our heart is going to be right with him we just prayed it we just prayed it and our our heart is going to be right there with god so don't worship based on what you've learned or or what you see other people doing worship because god has been so good in your life and if you need prayer for something we're going to have a prayer up here in front for you don't leave here without getting prayer for what you need prayer for come to the front if you're comfortable coming to the front please come to the front and get prayer for what you need during this last song but we're going to worship god [Music] [Music] until i lay my [Music] of the goodness [Music] every breath that i am you are is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] goodness [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] day [Music] oh [Music] [Music] with every breath that i am [Music] oh [Music] oh i am ready you feel like your heart is ready i feel like i'm ready for for god to do something wonderful and i feel like god's gonna do the miraculous i'm gonna say this multiple times today but the miracles of god are reserved for those who show up and i'm going to show you through scripture in scripture over and over and over and over and over and over again how the miraculous happens for those who say i want to encounter god i want to i want to be together in the assembly and i want to watch god show up in my life and i believe that there is a longing for god today i don't think people came in here saying oh i just need a building no no i think people came in here to say let's magnify god because i need god to show up in my life like never before because god is good oh if you believe god is good let's give them a praise stay standing i'm going to read the word to you and just a piece of it that we've been taking our text from for this series called culture and i'm talking about church culture everybody say church culture [Music] and right here it says in luke chapter one let's read verse 24 25. that's a good launching pattern now after those days his wife elizabeth conceived did you know that the believing is the first part conception is your second part and we're going to walk through that because it first needs to start with maybe a thought and every thought that you continue to say this is what i'm going to think on that thought becomes easier to think about that thought becomes an easier place to dwell on and so the some of the thoughts how many want to clear your thoughts up like the more you think about it the easier it is to think about it so if you just continue to the bible says take captive every thought why because it's gonna be easier the second time around you think about it and instead of thinking about all the wrong things i need to believe and then conceive another thing and so it says she conceived and she hid herself for five months saying thus the lord has dealt with me in the days when he looked on me to take away to take away to take away my reproach another version the new king or the old king james says my disgrace my shame lord i pray that you take away somebody's shame today somebody's disgraced today and not just with anybody but among people i know that grace and mercy and forgiveness are already free and available and accessible to each and every one of us god no matter what we've done and where we've been but lord help us lord to live in another level of favor stature lord and i pray that you would remove the disgrace remove the mark of shame remove that that that shame lord that's been on us that other people see us through that lens of and lord i thank you god that some people are gonna start seeing us through the lens of grace people are going to start seeing us through a lens of mercy people are going to start seeing us through a lens of god's favor and goodness on my life and i thank you lord for what you have done and what you're about to do in jesus name amen amen amen amen before you're seated before you're seated i want you to find here and online i want you to find three people give them a big high five and tell them something good is about to [Music] happen okay all right sit down get quiet because i got a lot of preaching and doing a short amount of time to do it just kidding get out your bibles in your notebooks we take good notes at this church because we take what god is saying to us seriously and i'm looking at a bunch of world changers come on slap your neighbors say you're a world changer with some emphasis and if you didn't get slap slap somebody say you should have slapped me i'm a world changer you know i think that we need to change our context of how we talk about ourselves and each other i'm gonna say that one more time i think we need to change the way we talk about ourselves and the way we talk about each other because i i'm gonna say some verbiage that's gonna that may make some people feel very uncomfortable and i'll tell you why here in a second this is the best church in arizona 60 60 got excited and let me tell you why because we feel that that's prideful to say let me let me just let me correct some thought process if we think that's prideful to say then we truly somewhere inside of us think that it's somewhere along the lines we're the ones who built it when you talk about oh i don't want to brag about how intelligent i am you then are assuming the responsibility that you're the one who made yourself intelligent i don't want to talk about how gifted i am how buff i am how strong i am look half of the reason you look the way you look is more than half 90 is genetics isn't that right glenn it's just your it's your makeup some of you act like you chose your skin you didn't choose it you didn't choose your mind you didn't choose your eq iq or aq you didn't choose any of those things they were gifted to you and when you brag about god's gifting in your life you're talking about how good god is but when you say i don't wanna brag i just don't want to and you minimize it you shrink not only the gift but the giver of the gift and therefore i see that's why we see problems as bigger than us because we see i'm unlock somebody's heart and mind right now because you see yourself as smaller and because you see yourself as oh we're just i'm just just a good old boy i'm just a country man i'm not nothing i'm nothing big okay put it down for a little bit your false humility because that's not helping you and it's not helping your future it's okay to think you're good it's okay to think you're strong it's okay to think you're talented you're gifted i think our worship team is by far the best worship team anywhere and they're incredible why because that's what god gifted us i didn't go out there and be like hey did i recruit where's where's our worst they all disappeared i didn't go find benji right i didn't go i didn't go searching out and try to fight no god said here you go i'mma bless you i'ma bless you with people in your life and i'm gonna try to help some married folk around here score some points if you can listen i'm gonna bless you with people in your life that are better than you amen like that i was trying to set you up some of you guys and girls they say amen amen we're we we need to we need to be okay and be comfortable with understanding that god's goodness is his goodness and when we're talking about church culture we're gonna have to shape some of the way we think and talk and the way we come into church and the way we act in church and the way we believe in church and the way we see church because a lot of it is through a a terrible lens of flesh of the enemy of hurt and pain when we talk about church culture we think crazy culture we think you know like i think snoop dogg or i can't remember who said it like if you need god go to or if you need help go to church it's church is a crutch right it talks about how you know like church is just a crutch and churches just for those who are weak i no i i can't live without church and without god and people there are there's there are beliefs and doctrines that say i don't need church to have a relationship with god and i'm here to tell you that the k in the whole canon of scripture the assembly came together because jesus died so that you can come together and become the body of christ we'll get there in a minute we'll get there in a minute let me start off and let's go to verse six and we read this last week and they were both righteous before god talking about elizabeth and zacharias the ones who were about to give birth to john walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord be blameless but they had no child because elizabeth was barren and they were both well advanced in years so it was that while he was serving as a priest before god in the order of his division according to the custom of the priesthood his lot fell to burn incense when he went to the temple of the lord which means prayer and worship we talked a lot about that last week and the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense somebody say assemble assemble maybe your mind goes to avengers and you think assemble maybe your mind goes to uh the anchorman news team a symbol and they which is funny because they were all right there to begin with they're like just a walk away and and you know this verse right here talks about how to come together everybody say come together i want to paint an illustration for you because the the bible talks about how not only that jesus died so that we could become the body of christ assembled but it's we become the ecclesia the ecclesia means out of and called to so i'm coming out of who i used to be and where i used to be and what i used to do and now i'm being called to a place where we come together so jesus died so that i could we could come together we have a nation a wonderful red white and blue amazing american nation that we have the freedom of god to gather and worship together in spirit and in truth and and i don't look i i bleed red white and blue i love america okay i love it love it but at the same time as much as america has done for us christ has done so much more and i love america but i love jesus more and i love the fact that no matter what our nation does or turns or goes to i love our i love my savior because my savior whether we got a nation that says i can worship or says i can't worship i still will worship because christ is the one who paid the price for me to worship and i can come together assemble because all of this that we're about to read today all of this happened at church there was a miracle that was about to happen there's breakthrough that's about to happen there's something good that was about to happen and it happened because we were at church and i they came together and they were all worshiping they were all praying they were all in one accord god wants us to come together maybe you're online and you haven't felt comfortable coming together invite somebody in your home don't do church alone write that down never do church alone you can't do church alone it's impossible to do church alone the bible says where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am in the midst of them you need together now let me share a little my wife and i she's pregnant right and i love that and she gets to she says she wants to do something and that's what we're going to do she said she wants to eat something and that's what we're going to eat and so the other day we were doing she was like i want to do a puzzle now just so you know i'm not a puzzle guy anybody else with me i'm not i'm like who wants to sit down for two hours and like oh my god all these little puzzles and all these little p i don't want to do that but i'm a strategist anybody a strategist i'm like okay let's tackle this logically no no not artistically because you can you can you can approach a puzzle artistically but i'm not approaching it but i want to accomplish this in a record time so let's get this done and let's make this happen and so we we popped out this 500 piece puzzle that's big for me so i'm like oh my gosh all these little pieces and i was like okay so what the good part is you can see it's all donuts and it was these little donuts and it had all these different colors and and it had all these different little sprinkles and some had like lines and everybody had their own kind of little little flavor and so i was like okay this is what we're going to do we're going to divide up all the puzzle pieces according to their color all right so then i divided up all the i took all the fun out of puzzle making so i just decided we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna we're gonna pile all these and we're gonna make a we're gonna make a color here color hair color here and then i'm like oh this one has sprinkles you can tell it's little sprinkles oh this one has lines okay we're gonna put lines over here okay we're gonna do this and i started kind of assorting them and then i was like okay these have lines these have corners and stuff and i'm breaking it all down dude we got that puzzle knocked out and they were all in their own little piles and then we started assembling the pile together and to make the beautiful puzzle and i feel like god started painting a picture of what the body of christ looks like sometimes is that we come in this box where we all are diverse we all come from different back some of y'all got sprinkles right some of you got you're just you got lines you don't e park people where are my dhoni park people over here you got my sprinkle people and continental where are you guys at we all got every we all got different flavors we're all from different places and we got different shapes and sizes and we got different tastes and we got different there's a lot of differences but then all of a sudden we start kind of kind of clumping we start getting piled together like with people who are like and i'm with the right people but some of us are in the right pile but you're not in the right place and we start getting piled up and you think getting piled up with the people who are like you like i hang out with a lot of good country boys and you're in the right pile but you're not a part of the puzzle and and we start getting clumped in with the right piles because we find people who are like us and we find people who agree with us and we find people who are like-minded and feel and they and they got sprinkles too and i'm a sprinkle kind of guy and or i got lines or i'm just a plain donut i'm a you know i'm not even a donut i'm an apple fritter right whatever you are you got your own flavor thing going and when you get with your people you get in your pile and then you think my part is done and that's what's happened in christianity is that we're around other people say i believe in god and i'm a christian we got a lot of people who say they're christians but very few people who are a part of making the puzzle complete because i just want to be in the pile but i don't want to be a part of the picture and let me just paint it for you i'm a christian but i don't go to church i'm a christian but i don't show up for prayer i'm a christian but i don't i and we like we want to claim that we want to have our badge of what we are but we don't want to play the part that we were meant to play and so many of us we wonder why our life isn't complete and not fitting correctly it's because you're not in the puzzle baby you're over here in your own little pile and you got your own little circle and you're four and no more and you haven't become a part of the assembly and i don't know who i'm speaking to but i feel like i'm preaching the choir this morning all you guys are here today and i just want to continue to encourage you that miracles are reserved for those who show up and a part of the picture because when you get your place and we start placing and we start getting our peace and all of a sudden god just doesn't have us in we're not just the right peace we're in the right place let me show it to you in scripture in acts chapter 2 we see the outpouring of the holy spirit in the upper room why because they were the right people and they were in the right place and there was a blessing that was poured out that was just for them you go all the way back and you go now all go with me to elijah and elijah was about to call down fire from heaven on mount carmel and elijah's going to call fire down while he gets the false prophets on the other side he's got all the people everybody comes up to the top of the mountain but now the people aren't just in the right place they're in the wrong position so now they're piled up right they they're like i'm on the mountain too and oh i'm i'm up i'm up here too but they're over there with the false prophets and elijah says the key phrase he says how long will you falter between two opinions between god's word and your word between their word and my word between what god wants you to do and what you feel like doing and god is saying hey look coming to church every sunday might be a sacrifice but that's exactly what it's meant to be hey coming to the other side might be difficult it might cost you but that's what it's called because when you pay the price then you've earned the right for the miracle to happen in your life and all of a sudden when all elijah gets them all on the right side fire gets called down from heaven and there's a revival that turns the whole nation around and then the rain cloud comes and when the rain cloud comes all of a sudden the whole land is blessed why because the people came together in the right place and in the right position and i believe that god is calling us to get us ready for the right place in the right position because when they were all together listen to this all of a sudden then the angel of the lord appeared to him standing on the right side of the altar of incense the right meaning authority when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said to him do not be afraid zacharias for your prayer is heard and your wife elizabeth will bear you a son and you shall call his name john i want you to underline that because i don't think you know how powerful that is and you will have joy and you will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth and then he begins to declare and this is so powerful let me tell you why because when the people were gathered together the right place in the right position all of a sudden the angel of god showed up we see the opposite happen on palm sunday palm sunday's next week and you know what happens they were in the right place in the wrong position i wanted i showed up because jesus was there but i was worshiping him for what i wanted instead of who he was and so they got in the right place in the right position and if you would get in the right place in the right position there's a miracle that will happen in your life oh there's a miracle i'm on a talk let me just talk to the 10 people who actually want a miracle in your life in your marriage and your finances because we sang all these songs and we worship and we pray and you came to church today why did you come to church today slap your neighbor and say why did you come today why'd you show up today are you waiting for pastor landon to say the phrase you want the scripture you like or you what are you waiting for what do you did you come to church today for your flesh or for your spirit because there are some things that if we show up and get in the right place in the right position i am going to get set for a miracle because the angel of the lord appeared in his life the angel showed up and zacharias was shocked as the band comes and gets ready to help me close this service i'm going to just close with this this piece right here you need to come church culture should be an expectant culture we should be a culture that shows up to church and says oh my goodness i'm coming to worship and i'm coming to pray when you when you're flesh let me just give you a key can i give you a key to unlock everything in your life when you feel like not coming to church that's the best time to come to church when you don't feel like raised in your hands that's the best time to raise your hands when you don't feel like clapping these people aren't clapping because they got the feeling or because i'm paying them to they're clapping because they they understand i'm gonna get an agreement because there is a corporate blessing that comes with those who get in agreement that's why the bible says and let the people say amen let it be done in my life to come into a place of agreement because church culture should be an agreement culture and when you come into an agreement culture you could come into an expectant culture was shocked because he prayed and god actually showed up oh i showed up to church and it felt like he was preaching right at me and i never went back again that guy ever talked to me like that that's exactly why you came here because you came here so that the worship could speak right to your situation so the preaching could speak right to your situation so it could challenge you out of your stiffness and pride so it could check you and challenge you and change you god is bringing an angel of the lord to show up in your life to say hey there's greater things there's good things there's something good is about to happen a miracle is about to happen oh you don't believe it but i'm about to show you god's got a miracle okay calm down i'm just talking i i feel like god has a beer last sunday people come down and pray and i preached kind of gave you the tagline you better come expecting and now we had a line and every service only a few people came down today maybe god answered all the prayers but i had uh i had some people come down and got prayed for and this week i heard one report after another let me tell you one of them i prayed for a lady who in this church she'll be here next service she was gonna go have surgery on her knee and she had like some torn stuff and some damage and all that kind of stuff so she said hey will you pray for me i got a surgery it's happening this week so i said okay let's pray for you we prayed for her knee we prayed for her body we prayed for her heart prayed for her life pray for her family i said god show up do a miracle she went to the doctor she said you know what i feel like something's different she just she started speaking in faith and she walked back to her chair nate and she was like i just feel like god's healing you know what i'm just going to say god healed me i'm gonna and she's marching around and she starts jumping during worship and she was like i believe god's gonna heal me i believe god's gonna heal me she she went to the doctor and she got her mri and she got her scan and i have the doctor's report on my phone of the picture she sent to me and it says right here it says there are no torns no tears no damage no nothing everything is he everything is good oh something good is about to happen everything's all good if you don't believe in a god of miracles that's why you're not clapping your hands but i clap my hands because i know that my god is a god of miracles signs and wonders and i come expecting god to move i come expecting god to shift something in my life i come expecting during worship [Music] i come expecting oh oh i i feel like i feel like god wants to change something in your life stay standing because i'ma preach this last little piece to you while you're standing because i feel like you need to be standing like they were assembled around i'm not preaching this message because this message is just a good message and and i heard it no no i've lived it zacharias and elizabeth were old in years and hadn't had children were barren and weren't able to i know what it means to go years without god answering the prayer and still showing up every sunday still showing up every prayer service i know what it means to come in and not feel it and show up to church and say i just don't feel it today i just don't feel it today i know what it means to fight through my flesh and say no i will sir as for me and my house we will serve the lord and i kept pushing and i kept coming and i kept showing up at zacharias let me just ask you a question raise your hand in here if you knew emily prior to when we made the announcement that we're pregnant raise your hand if you do keep your hand up if you knew that we struggled trying to have kids look at all the people just in this one put your hands down zacharias was running the temple in worship for everybody you think they knew zacharias i bet there's a bunch of people out there who knew that zach i bet some of them were out there not praying for themselves but maybe praying [Music] and all of a sudden the angel of the lord showed up to zacharias and shocked him and said zacharias was afraid he said don't be afraid i've come to give you glad tidings of joy i've got a good message something good is about to happen in your life and all of a sudden a miracle took place why because the people were gathered together and i guarantee zechariah wasn't the only one praying and the angel of the lord showed up and he said i want to name him john now zacharias will become mute later on in the text and when the lord muted him i asked lord why would you mute him he's a you just told me he's a great man and he's doing what you're asking to do why would you shut his mouth why would you tell him to shut up why would you mute him it's because he muted him because he said zacharias i'm going to do a miracle in your life and i'm not going to let you mess it up because what you might say will mess this up but i'm going to silence you for it sometimes god will put you in a place of silence so that you can't mess up what he's about to do because if you know scripture you know where i'm going if you know theology and doctrine you know that the priesthood would name their children according to their family and he would get another priesthood name and his son would be named after a priest and the same order in which they had continued for hundreds and thousands of years and so god said no no no i don't want you to name him according to what was i'm gonna re i'm gonna do something new according to what will be something good is about to happen something new is about to happen something fresh is about to happen and god is saying church culture needs to be a culture where you quit naming the future according to your past but you're going to name the future with a declaration of god according to what could be what will be what shall be and what god says in your life give god some praise if you believe what the lord is speaking to you today been naming it i've done the same thing i've done the same thing how many walked into 2021 and you were like all over again i and i got frustrated i got really mad economy oh it's getting higher so i'm thinking it's just going to pop right how many anybody else am i the only person that's only well i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop i'm waiting for things that like oh what is it what is our president doing now why would he do that and and you think of that and you're thinking and i'm looking at all these things and all of a sudden i'm like we're just going to get the same old same old and i'm like no lord you know what i rebuke my flesh i pray that you silence and shut me up oh somebody needs to pray that in their life god shut me up let silence my mouth so i don't mess up the miracle you're about to do when god wants to bring something new that you cannot shape because you have no point of reference for it you need to be silent and let the holy spirit make intercession for you and a declaration for you because church should be a church culture of declaration and that's why the angel of the lord began to speak and say hey i'm going to tell you how great john will be i'm going to tell you how great this year will be i'm gonna tell you how great your new life will be your new marriage will be somebody's about to get a whole new something good in their life and god let god be the god who speaks to you and through you in this service that's why i wanted to keep you standing because right now we're about to declare i'm not going to pray a prayer for you you need to speak here and online if you came with somebody and your spouse your your girlfriend your boyfriend if you came with your family your kids grab a hold of whoever you came with if you come with anybody grab your own hand okay i'm with you grab the holy spirit because what you're about to do is link onto and declare what only god could speak and i want you to declare it over your family i want you to declare it over your finances i want you to speak it over your future i want you to we don't need just pastor landon saying hey the church will grow god will do it flagstaff will thrive arizona will change america will turn their heart back to god doesn't need to just be me it needs to be the people of god surrounded in the assembly saying hey we're going to gather together and we're going to declare the good word of the lord oh begin to speak at church speak at church forget about everybody else close your eyes and begin to say god will make me thrive god will bless me god will bless my marriage and my children god will bless this school year god will bless every area of my life i will thrive and there's a new thing a new way a new dimension a new glory a new victory coming my way something good is about to happen something good is about to happen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh man i wish i could keep preaching i'll have to do it in the next couple services but i i need you to continue to fight through it be deaf according to the enemy and be open according to the spirit some of you need to pray i pray that the words of everybody else would fall on deaf ears in my life and i pray that my words would fall short and i would let the glory of god speak through me stop defining everything according to where you came from and who you think you are if zacharias was allowed to speak he would have just named him and they'd have kept on going with the same old same old but he needed a john i wish i could just preach just about the name of john the meaning of his name this is powerful when you understand that that this means jehovah's grace which means jehovah grace is the unmerited favor of god and that's amazing but at the same time do you know what jehovah means it means to bring into existence what what did not exist so jo when you say jehovah jehovah god i pray that you would bring into existence what i have yet to see what i have yet to feel john literally became the manifestation of bringing something into existence that had never been and he declared him his this is his name i shall bring it and not just anything i'm bringing grace that is sufficient oh lord we thank you for today and we thank you for your word that's gone on good ground i pray that you would speak it to your people let our church culture change to a church culture that not only prays and worships but a church culture god that comes expecting expecting god to show up not shocked when he does and the church culture that knows how to assemble not scatter not remain in our piles and say we've made it but lord come into a place of agreement god where we're in the right place and we're in the right position and lord we thank you god that you're going to reshape some things for us and you're going to remove some false doctrines some old ways some bad habits and old thinking because that stinking thinking can't move forward into a bright future and lord i thank you god that you're reshaping a new paradigm and i pray that you bless each and every one of your children called by your name created in your image lord in your likeness you bore them and i thank you god that because of that we have the same power to create church culture needs to be a creating culture church culture needs to see the miracle signs and wonders of god follow church culture should be a culture that comes in and says something new something good is about to happen and it might as well happen today i thank you god i thank you if you need a miracle or healing in your life with every head bowed in every eye closed here and online i want you to raise your hand right now and i'm going to pray for you and you're going to get that miracle and that that healing pray raise your hand in faith raise your hand in faith if you can't even raise your hand you're definitely not going to get it but i think that god wants you to do something in the natural that will parallel in the supernatural and bless you so with every hand raised in heart open oh lord in jesus name look at all these hands lord i thank you god for every hand that's raised god we're not going to see one or two or three god you're the god of multiplication so i pray for hundreds hundreds of answers and miracles and healings to follow this sunday we're gonna walk into palm sunday rejoicing not because of what was but because what you just did and lord i thank you i'm not gonna celebrate you just because of what i said in scripture about palm sunday i'm gonna celebrate you what you just did in my life and lord i thank you there's gonna be a celebration next sunday there's gonna be a cry next sunday there's gonna be a cheer next sunday because there's going to be answered prayers we are your children called by your name and something good is on the way and i thank you god lord that a healing touch somebody's got a problem in their shoulder right now and i pray right now that you heal their shoulder whoever i'm speaking to just put your hand on your shoulder and i am praying god for a healing in that shoulder right now and lord i thank you god lord that somebody whoever has an issue in their mind somebody's got a battle in your mind and you feel the battle of depression and doubt and discouragement right now i pray for healing and transformation to happen in your mind somebody who's praying for a miracle in your finances you don't need a stimulus check you need the spirit of god and if you get the spirit of god in your finances you shall never go without because he shall meet all your needs according to his riches and his glory in the name of jesus the shout and give god some praise if you receive it oh hallelujah yeah amen amen amen amen amen i'm gonna conclude this next week i don't think we're done y'all haven't even heard about how john the bible says that john came out and they were all amazed which is another message and then how john not only was amazed but then john went from the temple and went home remember when i said you it's one thing to believe then it's another thing to conceive john had to go take it home for it to go from believing to you got to be here next week palm sunday is going to be a sunday where we unlock and just go from something i believe to something a conception has taken place and something is about to give birth in our life and god's about to do it and we're going to see it happen that's that's church culture if you like that kind of church culture are you with me let's build a right church culture let's speak this declaration be dismissed have an incredible week rsvp and i'll see you palm sunday i am a bridge builder this is my season

again for another stray interview type video we're actually gonna turn this into a little bit of a smoke sesh just cuz we didn't feel like rolling a joint of this we wanted to smoke this for the strain review today we are checking out this tiramisu from backpack boys we've actually been smoking on this for the last couple of weeks we're down on some of the smaller nodes here in these bags but as you guys can see in these close-ups here there were no shortage of nice big fat note we got this [ __ ] no shortage of purp either all purple this is all purple weed right here it does have a little bit of those chunky stems bitter old chunky nugs if you dive into the smell it's kind of like a buttery vanilla smell I'm gonna crack my bag right here yeah definitely a contrasting turf profile on that one we are pairing that with this lift ticket you guys are may have seen us smoke a couple of these on the podcast and mention them briefly basically this is who makes these loud pack I believe is the one who makes these this one is Wonder Bread flour so basically it's their lemon citrine flour mm-hmm rolled in an oozy kay lift ticket and what the lift ticket is is basically infused bass joint right here that is supposed to be infused glass tip pre-roll with live resin infused rolling paper I'm really really really interested because I know more about what the live resin infused means they love to use those funny words that like you know don't really mean it just means something much simpler you know but it just makes the language sound like way more complicated I don't know why it bothers me for some good reason I'm just weird about [ __ ] well you know I know why I bother Z because I can tell you that that's I I don't know how you could unless you're rolling in like libraries in the paper how do you infuse a paper do that there's distillate sprayed on a rice paper or whatever kind of paper it is so so far from my experience smoking these the only difference I've really noticed is they definitely do smoke longer right when we smoke these on the podcast I feel like we're a traditional joint if I'm sitting you're smoking a joint this size to my head this is gonna last me maybe 10 12 minutes 15 minutes at the longest when we smoke those joints I feel like they lasted ten minutes longer 25 30 minutes maybe it is like black licorice kinda that's pretty far mm-hmm you get a black liquorice thing yes interesting I've always anybody been getting that from you but I got like a very like chocolatey thing on smell right just like a creamy chocolatey but there's not like a pastry thing I get the vanilla more on those tastes ya smell for this tiramisu yeah it looks amazing yeah for sure it's definitely fired it's definitely purple definitely darker the structure on it is amazing obviously um it's a very vigorous powerful plant very very dense nugs the big ones the small ones it looks like it would be a joy to grow for sure and I gotta say with the looks on this one mm-hmm if you like big fat nose of dark purple weeb yeah this is the one for you this is the one for you if that's what I'm looking for from from this type of a strain so the genetics on this our wedding cake and gelato so once again another gelato cross as we keep saying so many times yep it's the [ __ ] but fired nonetheless honestly gelato you know never ceases to insure you please me you know I can't say that it doesn't a lot of fire a lot of these as much as we kind of like dog the way the industry is now for I guess the way it's always been there's just always one hype strain that's kind of rotating and stays popular for a while and as of that it gets bread and crossed with a lot of the next wave of you know new strains so for a long time everything was mixed with purp and then everything was mixed with OG and then you know now everything is mixed with gelato but kind of almost the best of both worlds you know back to perc let's get it back to pur that's what we wanted this actually tastes pretty good I'm not gonna lie I like the glass tip it doesn't taste bad for a pre-roll definitely on the opposite end of the spectrum though I'm getting like a straight tangey skittle ii oh it's probably the O's ek coming through I think it's I think that lemon citrus limit like a citrus super that's what HRC type of flavor yeah it's like a lemon G that's what's interesting is with these is like so this is an oozy K lift ticket a few of the other thing we smoked five or six of these already most of the other ones we had were Ozzy Kate lift tickets but there was some that was like a gelato flower with the gelato lift tickets so there's all kinds of combinations sometimes it's the same flower as the same live resin in the paper or whatever and that sometimes it's different combinations so that's kind of cool this is fire I'm not gonna live yeah it tastes pretty good I feel like okay it's not fire let me back good that's not fired it's fire for a pre-roll which is the same lunch we've always hated on freerolls I feel like we definitely can't hate on that quite as much if for no other reason I feel like they smoke a little bit longer and give me a little bit higher I keep hitting it I mean it does have that lemon flavor and it's not too harsh it's okay it's tickle in the back of my throat like every rule but at least it's not making it like scratch and then it make me cough the glass tip is a nice you know added feature if I had to rate this on a pre-roll skill this is a 10-4 pre-roll I hate pre-roll so I haven't made a video I made a video about it one time Hey Bruce I do feel like the packaging may be a little bit excessive with these but I guess they want to package it in glass to maintain like the flavor you know I should have gotten the information on what the retail price of these is so we could kind of give that comparison to other pre-rolled joints and kind of get a better grasp of what the overall market is for pre-roll is like we said we don't really smoke them like ever so I don't it's it's the attention it's the best pre-roll that I've had you know and there's no shame in saying that I don't smoke free rules all the time but the glass tape is a nice touch for a pre-roll it's fire obviously a funky feel tip I'm sure is it mm-hmm I'm sure it'd be real spring I'm sure it's overpriced but it's a good pre-roll so shout out whoo loud pack that's who makes them shout out powered by loud pack loud peasy yeah definitely interesting so I think it's basically this particular one is one of Brett flower cross with a loud pack oszi lit take over there got soul our packs making yeah I think a lot of pack like packages it I think basically they just basically collaborate with different brands who will I give them flower and then they do all the rest is my understanding as of now I could be wrong subject it's an interesting idea it I'd like to see you know this is an upgrade from your Trudy I know free roll joint which in some cases have been getting better over the years but have for the longest time always just kind of been [ __ ] like you take the weed that wasn't good enough to sell didn't look at or whatever or even smalls or something like that if you had a puffed up structure you know or some people put the [ __ ] shake at the bottom of in their pre rolls back to the tiramisu what's your favorite characteristic it I like the tiramisu just because it's a little bit it's a little bit different like it's kind of he kind of actually feels like an exotic smoke you look at the parents of it like this is I wouldn't say exotic in this sense of like this is so different than all the other stuff we come across all the time and get to smoke but just the way this smokes I like it it's really really really really creepy some of the gelatos that I've tried in the past but it's got like its own thing going on I don't know oh it's expensive that's for sure I really do like the smell of it the smell and the flavor on this one are really good I mean it looks great too I would say maybe not quite as strong as I was expecting yeah we've been smoking it like I said Wow to me I figured all this is gonna be like knockout night times right which I would say it's more of like a more relaxed nighttime smoke than daytime smoke but it's not pretty it's pretty in the middle for me honestly I might just be honest I might just be being a snob right now but nothing sticks out to me really too much on this weed I will say it's a looker for sure so my favorite thing about it is the look and it does have me pretty stone pretty sticky the outside of it not that sticky but inside of if you crack toast there definitely stay a factor it's super purpie very dark maybe it's just not matter yeah I mean stem to Bud ratio on this is is it's big stems but it's also about buds yeah you know it's pretty good overall if I were gonna rape this one I'm going like 9.5 on I'd say 9.5 on looks smell and taste and then the buzz on this one I'm gonna give like a 7.5 or an 8 so i'd say like 8 and 1/2 overall is pretty fair for this one for me all right I'm gonna go looks I mean it's hard to grow a weed it looks better than this almost I'm not gonna lie is pretty [ __ ] frosty has a little bit of those like lime green leaves in there and to give it like that really good like color contrast look super dark purple frosty I'm gonna give it a ten on the looks but it is lacking to me a little bit on the flavor and the smell just I just don't think it's my turf really tastes good kind of like is it does it remind you of the Mac how you're like that how you're like I can see I could totally see how this could be like a diner intense for somebody else and for what it is I guess it is but if I it's not something you want to smoke every day because flavor is so important it's just not for me that's the way the best way I'm gonna put it but you know that I'm gonna take that into consideration when I grade it so I guess I'm being a little biased I'm gonna grade this overall it's an eight it's a solid eight and yeah I mean it's fire it's just I would like to smoke something that tastes a little bit gas here and a little bit more punching I feel like the flavors a little dull yeah I'm always torn like that I feel like that sometimes too when we're doing these reviews I'm like should my personal preference is like play a part and my when I rate this at all right because they should and sometimes they should I don't know yeah I go back and forth sometimes I don't want to be biased and sometimes I want to be figure I don't know sometimes I'm like alright you know if there's if we haven't done anything else in our [ __ ] life up to this point if nothing else we smoked a lot of weed yeah I'd like to think I know at least a little bit a little bit right at this point in my life about what's good weed or at least what's good we have me the kind of weed that I like you know I would like to think that my biased opinion most people could at least agree on those friends you know yeah as long as you kind of I feel like we do a good job of talking about like our biases and like what the type of stuff that we like to smoke on a regular basis even though we do like I always need something that's super gassy and stable I always need something that's super like knockout nighttime like oh yeah the indica in this but I always need something new in the rotation to that I haven't tried before we're always looking for that new flavor yeah always always looking for new flavors so I don't know when we rape [ __ ] sometimes that comes into play I'm like a height wall is this a 10 or is it like a 7 because I don't I always ask myself at the end like would I pay for this would I buy this again would I would I seek this out to smoke this flavor this brand this whatever again right and when I ask myself that question I'm like with this particular one for me it's it's kind of a yeah yeah you know but it wouldn't be something in the regular rotation but it's something if I saw a good batch of again I would definitely try it again yeah like I mean I'm an 8 is definitely you know good enough to buy again for me I'm digging it maybe it's a little low but I'm sticking with it how about the lift ticket a little would you pay for one of those what would you think is fair what would you what would that have to cost for you to be interested a be and just to pique your interest in a shop they wouldn't I don't know I don't know I guess I'll take it as a hypothetical question but I'm not going into growing into a store if I desperately need weed and I'll just buy like you know a couple a to get the [ __ ] out what is a pre madhavan I looking at because I'm not even looking at the pre-rolls but I would expect a typical pre-roll to cost 8 to 15 dollars yeah that's that's funny that's the exact numbers I was gonna say but this is probably like 25 do you think that's fair you pay the extra you wouldn't I would say over pennies like I would pay like four dollars more for the [ __ ] glass tip and a little bit of distillate they sprayed on in or whatever here's the thing I like the fact that they're doing the collaborations with other brands and you know doing it that way if there was something really fire like if they collaborated with a big brand that we follow and support or whatever and they did a lift ticket of their weed that just took home a bunch of awards name the [ __ ] coke and is actually fired and then that brand post hey we're doing a collab with lift ticket we're dropping these here it's gonna be and they show you a picture and of [ __ ] wheat in processing and it's being fat choy Stubbs it's not a typical pre-roll material then I could get into it you know like I think something like this could be cool you think they're getting chillers vibrating short spreads no I don't I think I don't know if they're putting any better weed in these than they then your average pre-roll you know I can't after smoking this I can't say that definitively I bet you they're putting smalls and it and that ain't me talking [ __ ] that's just me knowing how the business rules you feel me yeah and I'm not hating on that because really what do you do with smalls now you supposed to I mean neither the extractives reacted or do that they go to extraction or you pre-roll or you so smalls that like a discounted rate you know yeah and you know depending on some viewable like the percentage that of yield was something extracts like your return on what that leftover stuff is after you take all the good buds out and package those as like retail flower there's always gonna be leftover and it's not waste because you don't most people are doing one of those three things with it it's just gonna make different sense depending on that particular product that particular strain right what you're gonna do with it yeah at least I hope that's how it's been for us yeah I mean you got to be getting what I mean people are wholesaling eights right now for like 20 bucks or something like that so if you were to put choice buds and pre-rolls you would have to so you know I don't wanna be math right now I'm not gonna get into it the lift ticket is pretty fire though it definitely would have to be more expensive I don't know I was trying to get at that but I don't know the math but it should yeah typically it's but that should be more and when you run a business like this like that's something you have to think about too you know on the backend it's like what not only like what will people actually what product will people want I got me high but what do we have to sell it for for them to actually want buy whatever they put on it whatever is infused in them I mean it got me higher than a regular pre-roll - I'll give it that and the few bonnets obviously the tiramisu maybe a little stronger than I was expecting I don't know what got me high now smoked that one quicker cuz we were like chiefing it yeah back and forth but I noticed the other times that we smoked these like a couple times on the podcast we had one to our head a couple times I just smoked one and they definitely I feel like smoke about us twice is twice as long yeah as another joint so take that for what it is I don't know after smoking a few of these my final conclusion is I would pay five to ten dollars more for a joint like this but depending on what it was and I'm not interested in them every time I paid twenty dollars max for that I'd like to pay like eighteen I mean what's the difference though a dub is the debit eighteen you get two bucks back come on I would agree I think that wait one gram so you got one gram of weed in here I mean maybe if somebody did like a little fatter one like 1.5 grams just that that's a $20 - I think but I don't know maybe that's what it might cost might cost cheaper I don't know we didn't do our homework but I would expect it to cost buyer like 25 bucks retail at least maybe even like 30 after tax yeah just because I know that the hype in the game right now people have asked us to do reviews on other stuff every once in a while we do get requests to do pre rolls and like other different edibles and like stuff like that this was like one of the most heavily requested like pre-roll definitely the most requested pre-roll and those are the more requested items who've had yeah if you're looking for like a what do you cry like a convenient smoke yeah it's gone bad it's good yeah it's good I wouldn't like if you had I would recommend it yeah if you didn't that you were going somewhere you need to smoke for an extended period of time we're gonna have time to roll up or do anything like that in between you didn't want bring a bunch of stuff with you I could definitely see how these are convenient perfect there's a perfect to get all yeah well I'm I don't know if it was that or that but I'm definitely where I wanted to be before we started this video it feels like sativa cuz I'm like I think it's the lipstick oh man yeah look there with the hashes I'm feeling like a nice even like balance though definitely got some body effects going definitely got some effects going upstairs I hope everybody out there it's why having something good - yeah I don't know if this was more of a review or more of a sesh video but definitely let us know down there in the comments what you guys would like to see us review on future videos yeah we will read those and we will do that other than that got anything else I'm just really high we spoke superb and it's not Sunday that's never a bad thing never back then alright guys have a good one we'll be back another time for another video until then wave your hands in the air and act like you don't care [Music]", "NpXd68a1GOU": "ollie i see you let me in man dude are you serious i'm like i'm like 12 body fat even brought your favorite champagne [Music] what is going on guys will here welcome to the video i've been enjoying my summer a little bit too much lately and don't get me wrong we should all be enjoying our summer but i have been eating a whole lot of crap like be good most of the time has not been in my 14 it's been showing in my physique so it's time to clean things up it's time to get back on the wagon so for the next 10 days i'm gonna try to get into the best shape that i possibly can 10 days it's not a lot of time it's not but you can do a whole lot so i'm gonna vlog the whole experience show you guys what i do the strategies that i'll implement and we'll see how shredded i can get so let's get into the first weigh-in [Music] so first thing is first we got to dictate how many calories are we going to be consuming so i maintain my body weight at 3000 calories now for a mini cut which we're going to be doing in this video you can be a little bit more aggressive because we're not going to be dieting for a whole lot of time so i'm going to be doing 2 300 to 2 400 calories so personally from experience i like to give myself a calorie range that way i'm a little bit more adherent to the diet that could be just me so in terms of macros i don't count macros you don't need to count macros i would just hit one gram of protein per pound of body weight get your fiber in and let your carbs and your fat just fall where they fall so i know i'm doing 2300 to 2400 calories how do i go about setting this up so some of you guys know some of you guys don't know but i actually stopped intermittent fasting mainly due to the fact that a i wanted to and b because i noticed i had better workouts even with just a little bit of something in my system so what i've actually been doing is something called macro fasting this is something i kind of just coined today and it's mainly that i just eat protein during the day and that is it so i'm still getting my protein feedings throughout the day so i'm eating things like yogurt cottage cheese egg whites protein powder uh chicken turkey all lean sources of protein but i'm still fasting the other macros the carbs and fat so when i get later into the day when i'm more hungry i have this buffer of tons of carbs tons of fat so when you want to go out to eat because let's face it getting a high protein meal you go to eat it just doesn't happen or it's extremely expensive so that way you don't have to worry about getting protein at a restaurant you can pretty much get whatever you want so with that said meal number one is gonna be a full container of egg whites with a little bit of broccoli here is my meal one of the days it's a full container of some egg whites with some broccoli then i'm gonna top it off with some salsa hot sauce and some mustard so i like to bake it like a frittata because it kind of puffs up makes it seem like you're eating a little bit more food so right away we are banging out 62 grams of protein 10 grams of carbs and zero grams of fat another great thing about the protein macro fasting is that it keeps your hunger down throughout the day you may notice that when you have a carb heavy meal or just carbs in general immediately after you eat you're hungry again that's because you have those massive blood sugar spikes so by sticking to just protein throughout the day you're keeping the blood sugar spikes minimal and your hunger is pretty stabilized throughout the day egg whites have to be the most filling food on the planet [Music] okay so i just got back from a grocery run and i picked up some of my essentials so i got a bunch of stuff here for salad because the next 10 days salad mode is activated hard and when it comes to salad the thing that kills you the most is the dressing so i just picked up a low calorie dressing so the boldhouse farms company has a lot of good ones so i got this creamy cheddar one that's 25 calories per tablespoon's the lowest one that they had so i went with that obviously you guys know i like ricotta so the light ricotta cheese from the salani brand is only 40 calories per four tablespoons really good on pizza and you guys know these turkey bratwurst sausages 90 calories 17 grams of protein two and a half grams of fat these are sick even by themselves with some mustard some bean sprouts i absolutely love barbecue sauce like barbecue chicken pizza is unreal so this g huge sugar-free barbecue sauce maple brown sugar flavor is really good so it's only 10 calories per serving which is two tablespoons and then i found these this is like a hidden gem in the freezer section at longo's if you guys are in canada it's these uh soup golden home super green ultra thin pizza crust so they're pretty good size compared to my hand right here and per pizza crust the whole entire thing you're looking at 360 calories and 12 grams of protein so tonight for dinner katie and i are splitting a pizza we usually have our own but calories and stuff so we're gonna have half a pizza and then fill up on a salad for some volume and that's dinner [Music] so it's only really sinking in right now that i only get to eat half of this pizza so i gotta learn to take my time and unfortunately pacing myself with with anything is extremely difficult but you got to look at it like this guys if you're sharing a meal with your girlfriend it's not like you're stealing your gains it's like you guys are sharing gains isn't that right katie yes [Music] [Applause] katie side my side which one would you eat mine's not even complete though come on for my pizza i put the cheese on the bottom right after the sauce then i add my veggies and my meat but katie does the veggies the meat everything first and then the cheese lasts is that weird i don't know what do you guys do so our dinner is all cooked and we each have this massive salad like look at the size of this bowl so a spring mix bean sprouts vegan meat mushrooms than that ranch dressing then we both have half a pizza here with barbecue sauce vegan cheese banana peppers green peppers we put a whole lot of green peppers on mine it's trying to turn me into a green pepper red onions and three ounces of rotisserie chicken so after this meal i still have four rice cakes to eat two tablespoons of peanut butter and a serving of greek yogurt and after that my total daily calories will be at 2328 and the macros are 271 grams of protein 199 grams of carbs and 55 grams of fat and i feel great i don't even feel like i'm dieting and my current step total is 13 798 so typically i shoot for around ten thousand a day minimum but when i'm dieting i like to shoot for around fifteen twenty thousand but we'll talk a lot more about steps tomorrow good morning everyone day number two is a beautiful morning and i'm on my morning walk so like i mentioned yesterday i usually shoot for 10 000 steps on a normal day but when i'm trying to die down i increase that total of 15 to 20 000 steps i personally find walking to be very effective and very underrated for fat loss it doesn't increase your appetite it's easy to recover from it actually burns a ton of calories and 180 pound person will burn around 100 calories per mile that they walk and 120 pound person will burn 65 calories per mile that they walk so usually people shoot for 10 000 steps because that equates to 5 miles so by me doing 15 to 20 000 steps i'm burning 750 to an extra 1 000 calories just by walking another very important factor to consider is your knee your non exercise activity thermogenesis this is the energy that you expend not from exercising or sleeping but just your day to day habits and the calorie rancher per day is massive so just by changing up a few things you can burn a lot of additional calories so some things that you can do are you know you can start parking further away when you do groceries or any sort of shopping you can put your headphones in and start walking around your house or the office for a work call start walking around your house when you're brushing your teeth you might be a fan of the the starfish position but you might have to get more familiar with the missionary position you know all these things add up it might sound like a little bit but over time over the months over the weeks it makes a huge difference you know like an inch isn't a lot but throw that on your dating profile and boom you're six feet tall [Music] oh hey guys you know earlier i talked about getting 15 to 20 000 steps a day for some people it's just not feasible you're stuck behind a desk you have other responsibilities to get to and you just don't have the time but thanks to today's video sponsor cross rope in under 30 minutes you can get a full body home workout done that's fun efficient affordable you can bring it anywhere with you all you got to do is download the app to your phone hook up your weighted skipping rope and you're good to go so the workout that i'm going to be doing is called no excuses it's 16 minutes long so there's literally no excuses that you can't do it so it's a beginner rated workout they have different levels of workers depending on how good you are at skipping so i'm going to click on it now and let's get started [Music] so you guys can see it's not just skipping it's everything full body workout full body blast change okay now we're moving on to block b so that was block a done so we're changing the rope over to the two pound rope just snap it on both sides there you you're good to go that's a gangster skipping rope guys you mean business in the playground with [Music] that so after the workout it gives you a workout summary so i burnt 290 calories aka a boston cream doughnut in just over 16 minutes so if you guys want to pick up a crossroad the link will be at the top of the description at crossroads.com will tennyson and get up to 40 off your first set i'm about to go out for dinner now with my family looking like i'm about to retire and trade in my gym membership for shuffleboard jeez but well aren't you on a diet are you gonna be able to track the calories in the macros of the meal you're about to get well yes i'm gonna die and no i won't be able to track the calories exactly to what i'm gonna get but the minute you do a diet that stops you from going out and experiencing things with your friends and family you are doing it wrong i used to do that i used to skip going out with my family and my friends because i didn't think i could track the macros to the tea and it doesn't need to be exact so that's why i like the macro fasting so my current calories for the day are at 823 calories i've had 129 grams of protein 62 grams of carbs and 8 grams of fat so i have this massive buffer of carbs and fat and as long as i don't just have table bread for dinner i'm going to hit my protein by default so i'm not saying go out get whatever the hell you want and just binge know what you got to work with just choose right choose smart and you'll be okay [Music] [Applause] often times when you're on a diet you're going to get to a point where you have a sweet tooth and you want to go out and get something and i'm no size queen but i'd rather not go to dairy queen then go and get a snack sized blizzard you guys feel me so i'm going to show you guys what i do to curb my sweet tooth that's very low in calories it's not as good as the dairy queen blizzard but it gets the job done so right here it's going to look like i'm sponsored by jello but i can assure you i'm not so the first thing is uh the sugar-free jello so these are only five calories per pack so it's only one gram of protein and i'll usually have these when i'm done with calories for the day this is like a last resort type of thing they are great another thing i'll do is some rice cakes so i love the caramel corn ones i like the chocolate chip ones so i'll go with that and then pro tip for the rice cakes and the jello is to top them off with a serving of greek yogurt mixed in with eight grams of fat-free sugar-free vanilla pudding mix so it tastes like icing and by topping these things off with that it's amazing so you guys have to try that another thing i'll do is i'll slice an apple into a bunch of slices and i'll dip it with these fat-free sugar-free jell-o pudding mixes so i like the dolce de leche ones and the double chocolate ones are really good too it's kind of like a like a mcdonald's happy meal type of thing that you get and then last but not least i have these yogurt bars you must be wondering will where is the low calorie ice cream where is the halo top so halo top gets to like 360 to 400 calories per pint which is quite a lot for a snack for a lot of people and i don't know about you but if i open up a hilltop and i don't eat the whole thing it's a lot like when a white man hears mr brights on the radio and doesn't sing along it just it doesn't happen so i usually go with these these are only 90 calories per bar and they tasted just as good if not even better so i'll do that so these are all very good quick options for a sweet tooth but if you guys have a little bit more time i'm gonna show you guys how to make some lemon ricotta protein crepes first up we are gonna do the lemon ricotta filling before we get on to the actual crepes so it might seem like quite the elaborate recipe but trust me all the components are done very quickly so we're just gonna blend everything here together so we're gonna start off with eight ounces of ricotta cheese i'm then going to add around two to four tablespoons of any milk of your choice i usually go with cashew milk because it's low in calories you might have to adjust as you blend if you want to get to be a little bit smoother so i'm going to add around two tablespoons to start that looks about good about a teaspoon of some vanilla good and about two tablespoons of some stevia mix or any zero calorie sweetener of your choice and guys when life gives you lemons you zest them zest of one full lemon is going in and that is it so we're just gonna blend this up until smooth and then that is our lemon ricotta filling [Music] i wish you guys could smell this let's get a little taste here [Music] so there it is [Music] oh my god so that's it for the filling so now it's on to the crepes okay so the batter is made it's only three ingredients so it's one scoop of protein powder i usually like to go with the vanilla protein powder just makes the most sense uh two tablespoons of cashew milk and then two eggs so here i have my handy dandy crepe maker if you guys don't have one which probably majority of you guys don't have one put it on a pan very quickly like one minute per side so i'm gonna start assembling these things so i'm gonna pour this batter onto a plate [Music] so all the components are done this took me five minutes to make so i have four grapes here and i didn't even use a quarter of the batter so this is a very low calorie high volume recipe so we're gonna put this all together now so i have my ricotta mix that was in the fridge i'm gonna add a nice heap scoop in each one and then give them a roll four beautiful looking crepes now you can top these off with whatever you guys want fresh berries but i like to microwave frozen berries it kind of has a little bit of like a syrup-ness to it and then i mix in one teaspoon of some stevia and it gives us a sweet kind of like compote jam i'm just gonna put that right on top and there we go guys that's some epic dessert okay let's give these a whirl here you eat this when you close your eyes and you feel like you're in a cafe in paris so good see guys we may not be able to travel right now with what's going on but doesn't mean your taste buds can't [Music] so i just wrapped up my workout so my calories have decreased quite a bit my cardio has increased quite a bit but my weight training always stays the exact same no matter what my goal is you want to train to build muscle even in a fat loss phase because guess what you can build muscle in a calorie deficit for some reason there's this misconception that people have that when you're on a deficit you've got to increase the reps decrease the weight start doing hit style training like skipping between your sets because you want to get that heart pumping you just want to feel like the calories burning and guys the only thing you'd be feeling is like sad when you lose all your gains and get skinny fat when you do that so train the exact same train hard train smart train heavy and train with a purpose a lot of times people want to die and go like okay because i'm gonna die i'm just gonna lose all my strength but if you feel like that you're gonna lose all your strength so again it's all in the mindset come in with a purpose come in like you're going to build some muscle because you can build some muscle like i just hit some rep pr's on the bench press say it's not because i'm on a diet my body's been like you know what we're not going to adapt to like that new stimulus today you know so it's kind of stupid [Music] katie and i were reminiscing going to a movie just having some nachos just going on a good old date night but obviously we can't do that so what we're going to do is bring date night to the house so we were watching a movie and making our own homemade nachos so if you have a craving for something like nachos don't just ignore it address the craving but in a smart way so it might not taste as good but in this situation it is because we are using instead of the nachos we are using some pop chips as the chips and per the whole entire bag looking at 380 calories for a lot of volume so we're going to top it off with some meat some cheese some veggies this would be so good check out this monstrosity of a pile of nachos here 772 calories very very filling so i have the whole entire bag of pop chips we got a bunch of veggies we got some vegan cheese vegan meat i added some chicken because i want some animal on my nachos on the side to dip we got some salsa here then i got some greek yogurt instead of sour cream that's like anabolic sour cream and then i got diet coke which is my drink of choice you guys do not want to drink your calories when i die it's just such a complete waste go with water go with powerade zero gatorade zero black coffee i mean water is probably the best choice i just tend to gravitate towards chemicals so going with a diet coke and that's dinner good morning everyone morning of day number eight so i woke up at 175.8 pounds which means i'm up 1.6 pounds from yesterday i know a lot of people would see that on the scale and be like crap time to drop the calories even more and unlock starvation mode but no guys it's not that big of a deal it's your body's natural occurrence to be shifting in weight every single day and usually it's just hydration levels it could also be things like stress it could be volume of food that you had artificial sweeteners like i had a ton of powerade zeros yesterday just to curb my appetite so that's probably what did the weigh in for me so i obviously didn't gain 1.6 pounds of fat in a day i didn't gain 1.6 pounds of muscle a day even though that'd be pretty damn sick so what i usually like to do is take all my weigh-ins for the week divide it by seven find the weekly average and that will be my weekly weigh and then hopefully as the weeks go by my weight goes down slightly so don't take day to day weigh-ins as like the true thing so today's cardio is gonna be orange theory at home so i rarely ever do the same form of cardio every single day i find it very important to keep things fresh keeping things new keep things exciting so that way you don't ever dread the cardio that you do so i track all of my cardio by the calories burned if you track it this way that way you have the freedom to kind of do whatever the hell you want if you want to go for a hike if you want to go for a swim bike ride or run if you're feeling like a marathon man throw on the open goal and just go to town so i only progress and add calories burned if i'm at a weight loss plateau so i'll either add calories add some steps or take away food but take away food is usually the last [Music] resort [Music] okay so i ended up getting some poke for lunch i love pokey on a diet it's very low in calories so i got two scoops of tuna on a bed of lettuce with a ton of other veggies and some pineapple because obviously so when i go to eat on a diet like to eliminate as much of the unknowns as i possibly can so eliminating the sauces taking away the fried foods because there's tons of oils that you can't really account for i don't like to use any sort of carbs because like for example if you go to chipotle you get a breedable with like rice depending on who is scooping that rice the calories might vary by a couple hundred whereas if you've got a salad bowl with the lettuce the calories may be like within 10 calories so it's pretty negligible so again when you go up be smart about it so if you keep it simple you can be fairly accurate with your estimations so i would estimate the calories of that pokey bowl to be around 350 calories and i'm fairly confident with my accuracy because i've been doing this for a very very very long time so if you're new to the whole calorie counting game just be extra cognizant when you're cooking meals at home to see what like eight ounces of meat looks like see how one cup of rice looks like just know your portion sizes so when you go out to eat you're pretty close to the real thing you can stay on track with your diet and eventually you'll just become secondhand so it is currently 11 p.m right now and i'm starving and my calories are done for the day so i kind of want to pick up the camera and talk about the fact that no matter how good you are making high volume low calorie recipes there's going to come a time on a diet where you're going to be hungry and you're going to want to overeat it's inevitable it's going to happen you got to embrace that hunger don't give in for short-term satisfaction think about your goals think about why you're doing what you're doing hunger comes and goes i can promise you guys that this is what separates people who get lean to very lean it's getting past those tough times so if you're hungry get your mind off the food go and do something else have some water and the hunger will go away okay so it is the morning of day 11 which means the 10 day transformation is finished so i stepped on the scale this morning at 173 pounds and i started the challenge off at 179.2 pounds which means i lost 6.2 pounds i know that sounds like a lot but in the first couple weeks of a diet you will drop a lot of weight i definitely noticed a big difference in my abdominal region and especially in my face definitely leaned out a lot there so a lot of people seem to think that when you go on a diet takes so long like months and months to start seeing results but it really doesn't if you know what you're doing you can start to see results pretty damn quick and once you know what to do all that's left is having that tunnel vision mentality all you see at the end of the tunnel is reaching your goals nothing else is getting in your way nobody is stopping you you execute every single day until you reach your goal so that is going to wrap up this video guys if you guys enjoyed it please give it a like subscribe the channel if you're new and i'll see you guys in the next one", "HZ4aCvghcLs": "what's going on youtube fam it's looney coming at you with another video as you guys can see this is the mask i was talking about that field gave me when i purchased a cartridge shout out to field dope mask appreciate it really nice so this is what i reviewed last video if you guys weren't aware definitely enjoying the product not talking about that one we're going to go ahead and be visiting a brand that we have uh already came across on this channel which is friendly [ __ ] farms excuse my language but we last time we uh had a little rodeo with their cured resin absolutely hated it and now we're going gonna go ahead and give them the benefit of the doubt and go ahead and try their live resin their actual live resin this is going to be the smoothie with a z total thc is coming in at 76.49 total cannabinoids at 79.86 so it's not that much uh not that much of a difference between the cannabinoids and the thc only three percent difference uh less than two percent in cbd packaged on 8 24 expires on 8 21 2022 so this is a it was a package relatively recent i already cut the box open just so i wouldn't have you know struggle with that on camera but obviously i haven't looked at the product yet they're a little saying you use it you know you deserve this i hope i do i didn't deserve the last one definitely didn't deserve the last one uh anyone that's not aware with friend uh about you know of anyone that's not aware of or know of friendly farms they're all true spectrum the whole live resin the whole real deal that's what they claim to be i'm gonna go ahead and see what their cartridge is looking like i've never had their live resin cartridges my first time so i've never had the strange smoothie and oh that is beautiful that looks nice look at this guys look at this beautiful live resin oil really nice they did a really good job so all right off the bat it's looking a lot better than the cured resin uh was looking smells really good like it smells smells very like uh very cannabis-y which it should you know it should smell like the smells smells real dab dab like it smells like real resin like real like resin is what i'm trying to say though obviously it's real resin but it smells like real like real resiny wow let's go ahead and take this garlic cookies off and attach the new and new one since i took this uh where was that little rubber piece damn so let's go throw it away idiot so i wanted to put this rubber piece on this cartridge right here on the bottom since i'm not using a cartridge no more that way to put it away keep it protected i highly recommend you guys to do that save those rubber pieces and use them all right screw it on this is the smoothie i have no idea what the crosses are what makes smoothie if you guys know go ahead and comment and let me know below i'm gonna go ahead and take this down to 2.8 because right now that's red is 3.7 blue was 3.3 plug oh no i don't want to preheat it one two three as green as 2.8 and they recommend you hitting you smoking vaping their product at anywhere between two volts and three volts so don't go above three don't go below two is what they're saying pretty much oh i'm so excited guys friendly farms i love their packaging black and yellow beautiful box packages is always nice they always have a they give you a little pamphlet with a bunch of random information on there if uh you guys can check out the other video on the gmo you know i'll show the pamphlet off doesn't really tell you much it's just pretty much re regurgitating what it tells you on the box that's pretty much what it is i'm going to try to get an aroma from this you guys already know the deal try to get aroma try to get a see if i can smell anything and taste anything before i vape the product let's take this off to do that i'll be honest so right i'm already having high hopes for this live resin cartridge and the reason being look at the headspace their headspace reminds me of ursus ursa has a lot of headspace just like theirs not a big deal but pretty much what i was saying is uh before i interrupted myself is most live resin cartridges most cartridges in general i don't get a very strong scent or aroma from the from doing this from the tip before vaping it this one excuse me this one has a very strong scent like i can smell it it smells like it smells like purple it smells purplish like it has given out that purple scent like so like a purple punch kind of scent wow all right that smells really good i'm actually wow this smells really good it has me kind of like wondering how it's going to taste you know cleanse my palate let's go in for it it's going for a pool cheers guys you guys got a friendly farms with you or any other cartridge you're smoking with you comment below let me know what you're smoking on take a hit with me and let's let's go ahead let's go in for this ride guys wow really good wow forgot to mention it's a hybrid really tasty wow tastes straight like a dab it tastes like it tastes like a purple smoothie like a weed purple smoothie that's oh lung expansion is there very intense uh cerebrally and um the relaxation the mellowness on the body is kicking in wow yo this this shit's uh this is uh some good ass [ __ ] this is some good ass [ __ ] oh my god that wow this isn't even my first smoke of the day either guys it's like it's in the afternoon for me right now probably 4 or 5 p.m right now and i've been smoking this garlic cookies uh you know i was i hit i hate it probably like three times today you know twice in the morning and then once in afternoon and so it's not my fruit this isn't my first smoke of the day not my first high of the day but it hit me as if it was like this smoothie live resin cartridge from friendly farms already from that initial pool from that initial hit already is better than his garlic cookies and garlic cookies is my favorite strain but i would rather pick up this this is more potent than this this is 82 percent this is 79 no this is 79 cannabinoids this friendly farms 76 thc 82 thc but this smacked me more than this did so whatever that means i don't know it might be just how potent the strain is but wow that was uh that was a very amazing surprising good hit excuse me all right let's go ahead and uh go for another one let's see if i get the same thing oh excuse me guys wow this thing actually uh it hit my throat uh my throat so you got me lit already hit my chest harder than usual usually um i can take these like nothing all right let's go go for another one that hit i said it's a hybrid it's an indica this is an indica but it hit me so hard in the head that i thought it was a hybrid wow so let me try to explain this to you guys the taste it tastes like something purple it has that very strong purple taste to it has a very strong live resin tone to it at the end upon exhale after you're finished hitting it you get that dab like that resin like a sensation like you taste it and then it's super smooth but on the exhale or rather on the inhale it hits you it's like a meal kicking you in the chest out of nowhere wow because it's smooth going down and then when you go it's like whoa you know it's like oh i don't know where it just hits you as you guys can see there's no bubbles it hasn't really gone down and uh and uh hasn't really gone down and uh the oil hasn't really uh decreased this has me faded guys you guys need to pick up this smoothie this smoothie um live resin from friendly farms you guys need to pick this up you guys need to pick up a friendly farm live resin in general this um ran me uh 60 bucks but and then with taxes it takes it up to 73 which kind that's like so much but honestly i see why the product is so expensive just because the quality is really there like it's this is some [ __ ] that i can literally hit one time put it put it down and i'm good i'm good to go just one hit is enough and you guys see i got the smoothie right i'd even mention but i'm about to i got another one coming for you guys hey this isn't uh sunset uh sherbert sunset sherbert i seen uh so this is smoothie which is a one i've never tried but sunset sherbert in a live resin cartridge four gram i can't wait to try that for you guys that one is uh coming in at 82.45 thc and 88 total cannabinoids so i'm gonna review that one for you guys uh probably after the ursa one after the after i review the ursa one but that's coming up so um in terms of what i uh expected from life from the friendly farms i'm not gonna lie i thought i had i didn't have high hopes for their live resin because i for some reason after trying the cured resin i just figured that the cured resin was gonna be similar the cured resin was super dark it tasted like straight soil like straight plants and oregano like like it even it almost it faintly tasted like weed but it tasted more like the soil that the wheat is planted and it was crazy i've never had any flavor like that in my life that's probably why i dislike this so much excuse me but this on the other hand this is like this rivals nug this beats field this kicks field right in its ass this is up there with ursa this is high quality good cannabis that you should be uh definitely consuming if you're somebody that that's looking for you know the top-notch [ __ ] the you know top-tier [ __ ] wow this um they had strawberry banana i almost got that one but the only reason why i didn't is because they had two different strawberry bananas one was a collab version which was friendly farms collabed with humboldt's finest and that that strawberry like a banana live resin cartridge full gram cartridge was at coming in at 90 thc 96 total cannabinoids and for some reason they have another strawberry banana but it's straight up just friendly farms and like like just like these just strawberry banana friendly farms and for some reason that live resin was at like 80 thc and 88 cannabinoids so so since it didn't have the most potent one i didn't grab it but i picked up this one instead and let me tell you i'm not disappointed whatsoever this [ __ ] exceeded my expectations and i'm looking forward to definitely trying the next one but let's go ahead for another hit and so i could uh describe it a little more for you guys because it does i see why it gets the name smoo smoothie because it's definitely smooth like it's smooth but then again i'm taking some fat ribs guys so that's probably why it's hitting me so hard and why it's uh hitting my chest so hard but let me take a normal hit and see how that goes wow so a normal hit like that you won't even feel it like it's so smooth like nothing absolutely nothing the taste it's hard to tell on the taste because those two fat ribs kind of have my mouth all like like not it doesn't feel like resiny but it's definitely like like i can like it's just smoke like you know you guys you guys know what i'm talking about after taking a hit that's what the water's for all right so i didn't get much flavor from that hip it was a small hit so let's take a big hit uh [Laughter] oh [Music] sorry guys sorry for any headphone users that crank up the volume wow that brought me to tears okay guys that uh what i just did there how i took three fat ribs i clicked the button three times i'd never do a blinker i like to do bigger hits than one blinker wow i also believe blinkers will eventually deteriorate your battery but that's besides the point anyways they got the cartridge uh kind of all warm and [ __ ] which i would expect but wow wow so normally i'm able to take three hits like that normally three hits like that and and blow out the smoke and i have a problem this had me choking as if i took a dab off of a rig that was insane i've never coughed like that off of a cartridge a cartridge what and it's not my first smoke of the day guys this is crazy i like i'm not ever reviewing another cartridge unless it's my first smoke of the day but i didn't want to hold i didn't want to put this video i didn't want to wait you know to review the product i was so excited to review it so i just got got to it but wow this [ __ ] is uh not only is it potent it's smooth it's tasty it hits the lungs at the same time of being smooth you can choose if you want a hit that's going to kill you or you can choose if you want to hit that's going to be smooth and you can go on about your day no problem all you got is just all depends on you taking a big hit or taking a small hit i'm hitting this at 2.8 volts any lower would be so much tastier i could only imagine and yeah you guys will probably could could uh so some of you guys have seen my other videos could say yeah why didn't you bring out the ursa uh ursa battery for this uh cartridge the reason being because i want to review that ursa battery using the ursus cartridge how it's supposed to not only that but they do say on friendly farms doesn't say on the box that you can use any voltage between two to three three is the max so 2.8 should be like if not perfect like you know if i would assume to 2.5 would be perfect but 2.8 is like you know two two below zero point two below the voltage uh limit so i think that's right around where you would want to be if not a little lower but i definitely would want to try this on a lower setting i probably will when i'm reviewing the ursa cartridge after i'm done talking about it reviewing it and doing my full review about the ursa i'll probably take a hit of one of these uh friendly farm cartridges uh probably most likely this one because i might have this one uh available to hit so i'm probably gonna try this one on the 1.9 volts and see how it is but so then this 2.8 perfect perfect hits perfect vapor production clouds i'm medicated as hell but i'm able to speak this is weird this is an indica for some reason i'm so faded in the head that i thought it was a hybrid so that's my that's another thing to say where in one of my other videos i mentioned how indicas and certain indica certain sativa certain hybrids certain strains affect everyone differently so even though this is labeled as an indica it's affecting me like a hybrid because i definitely feel relaxed i definitely feel the body sedated i feel my legs almost numb like it's amazing but i also feel extremely faded in the head and behind my eyes and right here in my temple area so it's very cerebral but in this very uh body height too it's very couch locked like they would say you know that's very it's definitely a couch lock i took three big hits so uh that's probably not going to be the normal dosage that you know you guys are probably going to be doing but if you guys want to experience what i'm experiencing then i would recommend to do the same thing take three big hits but i want to know comment below what you guys think about how my hits are because my friend uh my partner he always looks at me he'd be like damn do you take some big ads no wonder you run through your cards i don't feel like i run through my cards but let me know what you guys think about my hits are my hits normally or my head small do you guys take bigger hits do you guys take smaller hits like let me know what you guys i'm just curious is something that you know a little high thought but in terms of this cartridge man there's no complaints nothing i can say they can do better and i love the the tip the this tip is way better than this plastic tip that uh field has the this tip is perfect like you get like it just feels everything about it looks better feels better and it's just better quality the oil viscosity is perfect like it moves slowly very slowly like barely like exactly how like live resin would move is like it can uh hit it's crazy because it's like you can't watch it move up but as like i'll look away and then i'll look a look back a couple seconds later and then you'll see it uh at a different spot excuse me let's go i'm going to take another final hit for you guys wow i'm really enjoying this this is a big thumbs up i i i wish they had you guys going to hate me i wish they had this cartridge as a gmo and live resin instead of cured resin all right let's go for this final hit hope you guys enjoy your day like comment subscribe and pray for your boy wow this is the smoothie friendly farms you guys need to pick this one up let me know what you guys think i love it i think it's a really good uh really good product they did a good job with that one with that strain whatever it's crossed with let me let me know you guys know but anyone that's watched at this point you guys are the real true fans you guys are the ones my true supporters enjoy the rest of your day i hope you guys enjoy the video um i'm definitely looking forward to the next one let me know what you guys think uh i should do anything i should be

mind as well comment down below like subscribe anyone that's below the age of 18 please hop off the video if you haven't already and yeah i hope you guys enjoy you guys are the best and thanks for the support always loony reviews peace out", "PnOl5O2ZdcU": "maybe families rashaam here to do another ejuice review this time we're going to be looking at the brand new a loaded Apple cranapple juice but loaded the loaded glazed doughnut video seemed to be really popular on my channel so when I saw that loaded brought out another juice even though it's not quite within my flavor profile I figured you know what I love the first one you guys seem to love the first one so why not let's go ahead and do the second one this is going to be a complete unboxing for you I have not even opened this we're gonna be vaping this today on top of my recoil RDA on top I'm minikin 1.5 and a point 3 build single stainless tip use stainless steel fuse clapton from Yeti wire I love the packaging huge warnings on this and it's a clear let's see what else we can get off at 120 ml bottle the prices on high society supply are phenomenal three milligrams and nicotine all your warnings and don't see a VG PG on here but I will list all the information you need to know right over here as always but let's see how hard it is you get this cap off I know they're perforated but even with nails these are hard yeah you want teeth no I got lipstick all over this thing see if I can just make it yeah we're just gonna yank it what's cool about this is also you're gonna get a 15 ml unicorn bottle so you can take your juice on the go I can already smell this and it smells great oh oh it smells like Mott's apple juice with a little hint of Atherton s but still sweet interesting I've never had an apple juice babe so this would be a first nice clear liquid nice little long dripper let's get this nice and saturated make that quote angry didn't they do I like that the fact that I can put a little bit in the well let's go ahead and give this a rip and I'll let you guys know what I'm tasting interesting you definitely get a sweet apple juice but then on the backend unlike regular cranberry juice like if you were to drink it in a cup and where it's really super tart it kind of adds a like a granny smith apple type taste to this to this juice I really like it nice cloud production on that now the tartness did give me a little tingle in the back of my throat but not super overpowering it all it's not dry you get that sweetness on the back end it's a great refreshing type bait if you're looking for something that is different from the sweet notes this is just refreshing and something you can vape all day definitely take this one I think it would be phenomenal and a tank definitely two thumbs up for me I can almost say I like this better than the glazed doughnut and the glazed donut was good for me the the hint of sentiment of the glazed donut I couldn't beep it all day this one definitely is an all day vape especially I could see it in a tank so I hope you liked this quick review if you did please give it a thumbs up leave any questions or comments you have down below and as always I hope you're having an amazing day or night whenever you're watching this stay tuned to the next video and until then beep on [Music] you [Music]", "NDLBZCOEENo": "[Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music]

with a few other people as we open the word of god this morning and as we are in christ brought to the throne of grace to surround the throne and worship at the throne and learn and receive from god's throne his mercy and his love and his grace and his strength for this day and all days it is really good to be the church with you and uh i'm praying that this morning's glorious and wonderful it's spring yesterday was the vernal spring equinox uh and that is just a wonderful thing we've got peony shoots that are coming up out of the ground in our garden and lots of pretty little blossoms we got little itty bitty blossoms on our apricot tree all the signs of new life and that is what spring does it's spring is this new life springing forth out of what looks very very dead and done or orchestrated by god to show us that he can do that he brings new out of old he brings life out of death every single year of course he can so whatever it is you're facing whatever you're feeling is the heaviness of this world uh just know that christ is the ultimate spring and brings new life so i hope that is encouraging to you and you trust in that as we get into the word this morning we're going to be in the book of revelation chapter 5 here in a little bit but i got a few announcements uh i'll pray for us and then i'll put it back to the intro slide with our opening reading which is

connection and emotional stability and health you've made us to love and need love from one another and so uh we pray that you would um strengthen us during this time and get us through this time in a

hope and her joy in the truth of your gospel thank you jesus for saving her and being her savior and we pray that she would grow to know that and put her trust in you at a young age and lord we pray for our time and your word today give our hearts absorbency and receptivity where we would balk and resist speak kindly and gently to us as you do to to ready us and prepare us for your truth that in

[Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right get ready isaiah i'm sorry that was isaiah 61 that you just read and now we're going to turn to revelation 5. and if this is uh maybe one of your first times or the first time you've joined us for our revelation series you might be wondering as some of you have already heard and we've talked about this like what do you know that we don't know about why you're going through revelation and i don't know anything that you don't know we're going through revelation because it's in the word and we want to trust in the word of god and it is i think one of the most beautiful books of the bible um and and one of my hopes and prayers is that by going through it together like this it can become and we can see it for its beauty and find comfort in the word of god and not find fear and confusion or just straight up weirdness the reality is this last year has made it undeniable that uh stuff is broken around us that the world is not an easy place safe place righteous place holy place uh and there's a lot of evil and there's a lot of brokenness and there's a lot of sin and it's very very easy to feel overwhelmed by that and to begin to believe that wickedness wins and that it's impossible to to have hope throughout it and the book of revelation was was written late in the first century given to the apostle john to be delivered to the seven churches of um western turkey that we looked at weeks ago in order to give them and therefore us strong encouragement that as we look out at the world and we all say yep that's a mess we can have the truth of god brought to us in a way that reinforces over and over and over wickedness does not win brokenness does not conquer sin does not conquer or triumph but christ has triumphed and therefore we can have great hope in christ that we as his church will also triumph because of his conquering love so i'm going to read for us chapter 5 in its entirety verses 1 through 14 might be one of the most glory filled passages of the bible and i'm looking forward to walking through it and talking about it with you so let's just jump right in shall we uh revelation chapter 5 verses 1 through 14. you want to grab your bibles and follow along with me i will read i'm reading out of the english standard version um if you're curious all right chapter 5 verses 1 through 14. this is the word of god then i saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals and no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it and i began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it and one of the elders said to me weep no more behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals and between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders i saw a lamb standing as though it had been slain with seven horns and with seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth and he went and he took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne and when he had taken the scroll the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the lamb each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song saying worthy are you to take the scroll and open its seals for you were slain and by your blood you ransomed people for god from every tribe and language and people and nation and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our god and they shall reign on the earth then i looked and i heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing and i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea and all that is in them saying to him who sits on the throne and to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever and the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshipped oh lord help us to hear and receive to love and to obey your word today amen this might be the last bit of revelation that is mostly straightforward and not filled with a lot of strange things that have become quite controversial in other words next week we start looking at the seven seals that the lamb cracks open and we're talking about the four horsemen uh seals and trumpets and bowls the mark of the beast the beasts arrive out of the sea out of the land and the great abyss and the thousand years and all those things are yet to come so we got a lot of excitement to get into in the book of revelation hence the importance of being here last week we looked at how the throne of god is at the center of everything and all of the universe all of creation finds its beauty and its order with the throne of god at the very very center and now we're beginning to see um the glory not just of the throne of the center but of the love and the magnitude and the strength of the lamb of god who is jesus who makes real redemption before we get into all the stuff as pastor jairus called it the revelation-y stuff of revelation how wonderful and how important to be rooted deeply in chapters four and five please if there's if there's stuff about the book of revelation that makes you scratch your head or makes you want to run for the hills or never talk about it or whatever else just leave it alone and spend your time in chapters four and five just be there for as long as it takes to be reminded of this the only hope for restoring this sin ruined world is the conquering love of jesus the only hope the only effective healing restoring power to to take this sin ruined wicked evil oppressive hurtful unjust world and bring it back to beauty and order the only hope for that is the conquering love of jesus that's what we're looking at here in chapter five and the first thing we see is an insurmountable problem we have an insurmountable problem john says he saw the right hand of him who had seated on the throne a scroll that nobody could open well what's the scroll what are these seals and why is it so important that it's open well the scroll symbolizes the edict of god in other words the absolute sovereign redemption and reclamation plan of god over the entire cosmos cosmos of his creation everything was ruined by sin everything you know the universe is expanding things are falling apart stars deteriorate and die this is all the effect believe it or not of what happened in the garden of eden with adam and eve god's righteous rule was shunned and sin entered and began deteriorating so now the baseline rule of the universe is not things live but things die the scroll symbolizes the reclamation plan of god that carries with it all of his infinite absolute glorious authority you see if this scroll that john sees in the right hand of him who sits on the throne if this scroll remains sealed and unopened all of creation all of humanity remains consigned to condemnation and injustice nothing will be fixed it will simply be abandoned uh with no hope of recovery only a continual depressing spiral downward into oblivion and chaos if the scroll cannot be opened there is no justice there is no peace there is no restoration or healing or redemption there's nothing that is true and eternal what is in the scroll is the very word of the one who sits on the throne therefore it is irrevocable irreversible unappealable unarguable incontestable and final this this scroll is what will bring about justice and shalom peace and rest and beauty and wholeness and completion and return the beauty of chapter four all of creation in wholeness and perfect balance and peace around the throne of god it will return everything to that that's what's in the scroll that's why it's so important but it's sealed it's sealed with with what would have been you know uh when they sealed documents it was like a wax seal that was the insignia of the king himself so that's what it took to open the seal you couldn't just it wasn't a matter of well who's stronger than wax and can just break it no in order to break the king's seal you had to have the king's authority it wasn't just for anybody and this scroll is sealed by god himself so it requires two essential qualities in order to open it number one it requires authority and number two it requires power authority and power must be must be had by somebody in order to qualify to break the seals and open the scroll and by doing so the redemptive reclamation claims and edicts and declarations and laws of god will be released and opened up authority and power worth and ability someone must have the right to open the scroll and the ability to execute it to carry it out and so the angel cries who is worthy who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals because somebody has to be worthy somebody has to be powerful somebody has to be able and and we do this see there is there is within your heart and your soul and every heart and soul of every human on the planet deeply embedded into us are crying out for a return to beauty and order a crying out a longing for redemption we we know instinctively things are not as they are supposed to be and what we had in chapter four was a very vivid and glorious image of this is how things are supposed to be all of the cosmos all of the universe in creation beautiful in order around the throne but it's not that way and so a scroll must be opened and we cry out we long for that wholeness see this is the ongoing problem with humanity through the ages we look to so many others people things ideas to bring forth god's righteous judgment his justice his redemption to restore the shalom back to the cosmos we look to so many other things and they will all invariably and decisively and miserably fail because they do not have the authority and the power they are not worthy and they are not able so that this strong angel cries out who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals and look into it and look what it says and no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look inside of it no one in the universe has the authority or the ability no one has the worth nor the power to take open read and enact the divine plan of god's redemption and healing and restoration to assume otherwise to assume that there's somebody out there or some movement or some idea or some system that can in fact do that is an affront to god's holiness and therefore clarifies and magnifies the problem of our self-importance in other words it just digs our hole deeper this is why we weep with john this is why john weeps and why our souls weep and i began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll and look into it we have an insurmountable problem here a scroll must be opened if there's any hope of restoring back to beauty of actual eternal righteous holy justice and peace and rest in your heart and soul and in this world this is why we weep there is nothing on the earth that will overturn the injustice and the abuse and brokenness and exploitation and cruelty of the world nothing and nobody in creation can undo sin might this be gentle pastoral suggestion here might this be at the core of a lot of our anxiety and i don't mean systemic anxiety i mean my restless heart i mean my fidgetiness and my you know heaviness that keeps me awake sometimes and makes me feel unrest like what i know a lot of you experience that we are looking to something or looking to someone who will make real this restoration and finally fix everything but what we look to whether it's ourself or another person or some other power does not have the authority or the or enough power to open this scroll and enact god's judgment and his righteousness we have an insurmountable problem but here's the good news we have an invincible hero look at verse five i mean it's such a it's such a setup i mean poor john kind of i mean not really because he got to see stuff that was pretty amazing so i don't feel so bad for him but i do in this sense because here he was he's he's propped up to feel the weight of of hopelessness on the universe did you see the beauty of chapter four john wasn't that amazing oh that was oh my soul just released into joy and happiness without any effort and yet we know there's wickedness in this world and and the scroll has to be open that no one is found worthy and john weeps and the angel says i'm sorry and one of the elders said weep no more you can stop crying look there is somebody the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals we have an invincible hero and i looked and i saw standing a lamb standing as though it had been slain with seven horns and seven eyes and he went and he took the scroll from the one who sits on the throne this is the one this is the one who has been foretold for millennia he is the one who is at the center of the old testament the promised son that the true almighty king the true and eternal deliverer this is jesus the son of god the lion of the tribe of judah the root of king david the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world standing as though he had been slain this is him this is our hero now why is it why is that jesus is the only one qualified to open this scroll well let's look into that because this is important does jesus have what it takes does he have the authority does he have the power is he worthy and is he able only jesus only has the authority and the power to enact the plan of redemption and bring about justice and peace where there has been and is nothing but sin and enmity because he is the son of god he is co-equal in glory and nature though he was in every way equal with god he did not consider equality with god something to be grasped but made himself took on the nature of a servant became obedient to death on a cross jesus is the same in nature as god the father he has all the authority as the one who sits on the throne he is the the living word who spoke forth beauty over the chaos in genesis 1. he is the exact representation of the glory of god colossians 1 hebrews 1. these are beautiful passages in fact let's just let's just go there together we've got we got time here this is the apostle paul talking about jesus he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation that's a status statement he is the highest above all creation for by him and all things were created in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things were created through him and for him and he is before all things and in him all things hold together in him the fullness of god was pleased to dwell and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven making peace by the blood of his cross jesus is co-equal with god in glory and in nature he is god of course he has the authority of course he is worthy he is the one who conquered sin death and satan on the cross look at verse nine and we hear the reasoning they all cry out they're saying a new song worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals why why is he worthy for because you jesus you were slain slaughtered meaning like how a lamb is slaughtered for sacrifice and by your blood you ransomed people for god from every tribe and language and people and nation only jesus only jesus has the authority and worth power and ability only jesus has the pride he alone has the ransom price nobody else could pay for our sin i don't care how much blood you spill our blood is filled with guilt our blood is sinful christ's blood is holy and pure so it required a holy sacrifice to atone for our blood guilt and only jesus could do that and only jesus did do that he is our invincible hero now let us not as the church let us not labor under the misapprehension that we will bring forth the kingdom that we will rid the world of sin or we will implement his perfect shalom and sabbath rest on the earth we are not the hero of the story we are those who have been saved by the hero and therefore bear witness of his conquering love we are the saved we are the motley crew of reclaimed souls who come before him in faith and we share in his life and resurrection we share in his holiness and we proclaim to the world we have a hero jesus is the invincible hero it's not the government it's not some cause it's not the church the church isn't the hero no we're the saved we're the ones that got plucked out of sin and death by his power and by his grace that's what makes jesus worthy because of his holiness and his love and his sacrifice you see we christians do not believe in jesus because of cultural bias we don't believe in jesus uh because that's how we were raised we don't put all our hope in him because he best suits our personality preferences we don't worship him and labor to win others to faith because we seek to gain some kind of posture of power over others that's ridiculous we worship jesus because he alone has conquered he alone has conquered see we stand here at this point in history looking backwards looking backwards at the cross and say that happened john is doing the same john is seeing this vision of the scroll and one who comes up and says only he is worthy because he has conquered christ comes to take the scroll covered in his own blood looking as standing alive looking like he had been slain that happened it's it can't be undone the price has been paid there's nothing left for for you or for me to do in other to in order to win the favor of god in order to do something say please please can can can this open the scroll if i'm this well behaved if i'm this religious if i'm this active if i'm this compassionate if i'm this smart if i'm this wealthy if i'm this poor if i'm this generous will this do it no it's already been done he is our hero we're not waiting for him to conquer we're trusting that he has conquered behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that so that he can open the scroll and it's seven seals and so the remaining chapters of revelation everything we're looking forward to six seven eight nine all the scrolls the seals the the the seals and the trumpets and the bowls and all that stuff is jesus rolling out the scroll and showing that he caught he has conquered and therefore those who trust in him share in his triumph now he alone is worthy and able to break the seals and open the scroll that saves as mr beaver said the chronicles of narnia a lion witch in the wardrobe he's the king i tell you of course he's not safe but he is good and christ has done it he is worthy and so we have an incredible new life you and i who put our trust in jesus who trust in his conquering love we have an incredible new life the only hope for this sin ruined world is the conquering love of jesus you ran some people for god from every tribe and language and people and nation you made them a kingdom and priest to our god and they shall reign on the earth what a glorious and real life vision of a new humanity in jesus look we again this last week were shocked pro hopefully not too shocked because it's just all too common anymore to see hatred and and violence and murder carried out on people that are innocent uh who have done nothing and whether or not the murders uh that happened um oh now i'm forgetting where it happened but the massage parlor murders that we've been seeing about on the news whether that was racially motivated or not it highlights the reality that we as people are are so quick to divide ourselves into little camps by what we look like sound like where we're from whatever and and i want you to see in this vision of this new life that jesus has created and brought us into that he has brought from all different peoples all different colors all different cultures all different languages all different everything and made one people so church let me encourage us today what binds us together as the people of god has nothing to do with what language you speak has nothing to do with what color your skin is has nothing to do with how much you make uh what your profession is what your family name is it it has to do with jesus and so the conquering love of jesus on the cross is the only hope that we have to mend the brokenness in humanity when we turn to uh preference when we turn to race when we turn to wealth when we turn to everything about things about us to bring about uh justice and restoration it will fail christ is conquered so it doesn't matter in the sense of where you're from and what you look like you're my brother you're my sister and i need you and and i want you to need me and and we need jesus there is no hierarchy in in the church other than jesus is at the top and then there's the rest of us poor wicked sinners who've been saved by his grace that's good news and that's the beauty of what we see in the gospel only jesus is that what a glorious real-life vision of this new humanity in christ jesus has ransomed by his own blood every kind of people to be one people and a kingdom and priests to god and they shall reign on the earth do you feel discouraged i mean that we're not yet reigning well there's not much about being a christian at any point in history well a true i would say qualify that a true authentic born-again follower of jesus that should that should assimilate or reflect or try to duplicate the reigning powers of this earth we don't appear to be reigning and christians won't until until christ comes back this is why he says and they shall reign on the earth if you're feeling discouraged about that and you're feeling weak and overrun and that the world is taking over and that we're supposed to be this conquering people and yet we're bypassed and walked on and mistreated well cast all your doubts onto jesus and towards jesus because what he has made us to be is a kingdom and priests to our god and we shall reign on the earth here's what i want us to do in order to believe that do we see jesus do we see the the almighty kingship kingship of jesus christ in full operation today on this earth is this world and all its inhabitants restfully joyfully worshipping him and drawing all life from him no way not yet not yet and yet we absolutely believe that he is the king he is the ruler he is the deliverer he is the lion of judah he is the root of david and yet what we see in jesus is a lamb standing before the throne as though he had been slain and so we see ourselves church we're in christ we are on his trajectory we walk in his steps and his steps are marked by blood and sacrifice and weakness until we are his redeemed and so we shall reign on the earth on the same trajectory as our savior king we his church in this world will also now take on the posture and positions of lambs in fact we're gonna see in chapter six that the saints you know when the when the the fifth seal john saw all the martyrs weeping and crying out how long oh lord before you judge that they had been slaughtered they had been slain same word for their faith in jesus we follow his footsteps we will have the posture and position of lambs yet he gives us his destiny as lions jesus himself told us that the meek shall inherit the earth the humble shall be exalted the last shall be first and the lambs will be lying so put your hope and your faith in jesus look to him behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david and i looked and there was a lamb standing as though he had been slain and he took the scroll and everything in creation fell down and worshiped and said you are worthy and you are able because you by your blood ransomed people for god and made us to be a kingdom and priests who shall reign on the earth put your hope in christ he is the lion and the lamb he is the lion who is king over all and the lamb who made himself low for all who put their trust in him he is the lion who tramples down the enemy and he is the lamb who was trampled for our sake he is the lion who roars with the ferocity that causes the universe to tremble and he is the lamb who is silent and led to the slaughter of the cross that we deserved he is the lion whose glory is infinite and unrivaled and he is the lamb who took on the nature of a servant for us to give us his glory therefore the only hope for restoring this sin ruined world the only hope for you to experience restoration and healing and fullness and joy and hope in this life and for eternity is the conquering love of jesus lord you are worthy to take the scroll you were slain you ransomed me for god and you made me a kingdom and a priest to our god and i shall reign on the earth this is your song this is your song christian let your love for christ let your love for one another demonstrate to the world the power and the glory the authority and the ability the worth and the in the ability of christ he alone is opening that scroll it's happening today he's conquered and we trust in him let me pray for us and and then we'll close our time i encourage you to get on over to our youtube channel for uh for singing out the praises of god some great songs pastor jairus put on our playlist this morning that i trust will will unleash your heart as as we see here the the elders who are these angelic representatives of you and me the church sang a new song worthy are you to take the scroll and open its seals worthy is christ for he has ransomed you to god oh lord god we thank you for your your holiness and your righteousness that in your son jesus your justice has been satisfied your grace and your mercy have been released and poured out so that all all who put their trust in you will be showered with living water oh lord let this day of spring be a reminder that nothing can stop the power of life that springs forth from your living well oh lord give us hope this day that you have conquered and that your people your church will abide in you and shall reign on the earth not because we're doing everything right and we're overpowering everybody but no because we walk in humility we we balk and we resist taking the posture of a lamb and yep that's what we see in you o lord and it was your lamb qualities that won our redemption and your lion qualities that ensure us that it will never be taken away to your name be glory and honor and praise and worth and blessing forever and ever and ever and all of creation and all of the angels and all the rocks and the hills and the stones and the trees and the oceans and the winds and even us we all cry out amen glory glory in jesus name jesus name have a wonderful sunday everybody i love you very much and i miss you a lot and i can't wait to be together someday and sing the praises of god next week

of wiley elementary have been studying government and how citizens can make an impact on their home their school communities country and world since the outbreak of coronavirus has resulted in school closures self quarantining and social distancing we would like to find a way for our community to unite and show community spirit my name is charlie konoszewski what does it mean to make an impact well it depends on what impact you're trying to make the impact that the wiley crew was trying to make could eventually grow it might start out as an impact for our community then move on to our state to our country and on and on and on the impact would be social because it would help people realize that other people care we believe that everyone will learn from this impact we want people to be

myself okay okay sorry i will continue now okay my name is erin neiman we would like to start a movement called the community project to show love and support for the for each other as well as the environment during the coronavirus outbreak since dexter students are not able to physically participate in community events at this time we are asking the dexter city council to adopt a resolution to encourage community members to make an impact by tying a ribbon around a tree to show support and unity during the time of social distancing and uncertainty we did a survey and over 90 of the students that responded that said that this would be a great idea we are recommending the following rules for the community project if you don't have a ribbon you can get creative the ribbon should not harm any animals or plants community members are responsible for taking the ribbon down and disposing of it properly the ribbon will be taken down by friday june 12th the last day of school thank you catering our project well thank you all for joining us today and for coming up with such a wonderful idea as you know a little bit later on our agenda we have a we've prepared a resolution under a new business item l1 that i anticipate we will pass when we get to that part of the meeting i'd like to say thank you to all the students that are listening as well as to um deborah ever susan karsch natalie hanlon jeff dagg and kdc all who contacted the city about this idea and um i think it's really wonderful that our students at this time are helping us remember the important things in law and uh anyway i look forward to getting to that approval later on in the agenda thank you for participating tonight thank you again thank you thank you are there other members of the community um that would like to speak this evening on any topic should i unmute everyone sean yeah why don't you justin or or they if they know how to we should probably educate them that they they can raise their hand if they have their participant window open um on the lower right corner of your participant window there's a little raise hand button if you know you want to speak please raise your hand otherwise we can unmute and and take people that aren't um as familiar with zoom i'm not seeing any hands um so i will hit unmute all yeah i've got three hands now justin at the top and we're up here recognized by britney young please hi there everybody can you hear me hi bethany if you could state your address please would appreciate it absolutely my name is bethany young i live here in ann arbor at 201 west williams street apartment 1 ann arbor as they said 48104. thank you uh i guess i'm gonna just to speak and it'll give you an idea of i'm i'm here speaking on behalf of avalon housing for the housing um property that's considered in in dexter so my name is bethany young and i'm a long-term tenant of and now also an employee of avalon housing presently working as a peer support a peer support is someone who has lived experience in substance use and or mental health and i'm a part of avalon housing support services however i'm here tonight as an example of a person who receives supportive housing services through avalon housing i have shared some of my story here in dexter i don't know if anybody's familiar with me but in any case i want to summarize i i came here in to michigan in 2004 and i lived here or there in dexter after i finished substance use treatment i was able to find a rental for myself and to my two sons in dexter excuse me my sons then attended schools here including wiley and mill creek and we loved it there we felt very welcomed and actually we really welcomed the stability and the environment dexter offered for us too it was really helpful for my sons and of course for me unfortunately we were struggling to afford the cost of living i in connection with some other local resource agencies was connected to avalon housing and we were then lucky enough to get a voucher for supportive housing um where i live now here in ann arbor i didn't want to move my sons again at the time but in the end it was the right solution for us then um at that time i went on i was sober um we were doing well in ann arbor i i am a loot i was a new mexican licensed nurse when i arrived here over the next 10 12 years i became a licensed uh registered nurse here in michigan avalon housing helped with with many things that i still had challenges with though and i accepted some like use of the food pantry was one thing that was very helpful um after school children's support programs and summer camp arranging things mostly with my kids but i still had a sense of shame of not being able to do more myself so i didn't avail myself of a lot of the offered support coordination like the social worker or case manager so over time it was harder when i also went on to deal with a series of unforeseen health and financial challenges i ended up i did relapse i i have a alcohol history abuse history and i got a dui so the point is i just want to say i'm not a perfect story but most importantly today today i'm in recovery i finally accepted more of the support services that that can come through avalon that they they helped coordinate and for me my they helped me coordinate my recovery and about two and a half years ago and in sobriety i applied for and started working with avalon housing as i had stated and i really feel good about the work i do so i just want to say i truly wouldn't be here if they hadn't stuck with me um they knew i wanted to live differently and they were willing to go the extra mile and so that's just something i wanted to add um to speak towards the project that they're doing in dexter as a present tenant and employee so thank you for your time thank you for your comments bethany thank you next on the list is sherry montoya hi i'm sherry montoya with faith in action uh we just wanted to thank you for your support i know this um approval of the site plan is on your agenda today um faith in action and avalon have been working together on this project now for uh you know a couple years really and um our work here in chelsea especially during this crisis has shown that you know this is a really important work that we do to provide supportive housing even in the best of times and in this time period that we've all been going through you know it was seamless the families who lived there were able to just you know they knew where to go for support there has not been um any change in anybody's status we've been able to all communicate and work seamlessly and so it really speaks to the the really important work of this project and um you know the the two non-profits together put in thousands and thousands of hours on this project and so we appreciate all the work that you've done you've also put in just countless hours on this we appreciate that and i think in the end you know countless lives will be positively impacted because of this work and so we appreciate all of that and we appreciate every step of the way that this has um you know all the work everybody's done on this project thank you sherry uh the next hand i see is our friend james mccarter our hudson street resident thanks very much sean i'm speaking tonight as a dexter homeowner first off thank you all for uh for doing what you're doing in this very hard time uh can you raise your hand please if you can hear me okay i just want to get a an idea council members in particular got it thank you all good job thanks very much uh good job sean um i'm speaking as a dexter homeowner 26 years my kids went k-12 through dexter schools as many of you know i'm also a veteran dcs teacher i taught second grade and sixth grade i was also a trained district first responder for many years uh on the day of the dexter tornado i was in huron farms and i can tell you that at that time i either had a current student or an alum in about one out of every five houses in that subdivision and that was representative uh as a teacher i want to say something that may be obvious but we don't think about too much and that is homeless children do not come into school wearing sweatshirts proclaiming their homelessness uh their fragile housing or their food history their parents who need support uh but the teachers and the staff knew principles knew and we acted whenever we possibly could out of compassion and love to support these children many times going well beyond going into i know principals who went into their own resources well entire at their own times to support homeless children children who were in fragile situations i became aware of the avalon issue through this flyer that came to me anonymously no names on it back in january and since then i've been reviewing your packets in detail i've been tending as often as possible and for the other citizens on the call and particularly for the students who are on the call i'd like you to know that this person this individual citizen views the actions and the behavior of this council as being extremely responsible throughout my time looking at this and prior as a citizen or a teacher i would have supported you the council and what you have done so far with avalon housing without hesitation and i encourage you to act on it tonight favorably now at the same time what i'd like to do is mention for a minute that i believe when i come on here as a citizen and i move into the public square to speak for myself let alone if i'm advocating for a position before you or anybody else that there there is a citizen's social contract this isn't something that's law this is just a covenant that includes a number of i wills it includes i will be honest i will be caring i will be compassionate i will respect the dignity of every human being i know by the way the strong overlap between what i just said in the letter of support from st james episcopal that is in your packet uh they're just two blocks up from me here now i want to talk briefly about the dexter citizens of a responsible government and i'm going to be blunt dexter citizens for responsible government and if any of you are on here i speak to you directly you have repeatedly demonstrated outright irresponsible choices relative to that social contract that i just mentioned a few minutes ago it starts with the name dexter citizens for responsible government this is absurd no reasonable citizen opposes responsible government what your group name does is it sets up two clear implicit we versus they boundaries one is that the council itself has not held itself to a high standard of responsible government the second one is that anyone who opposes a stance taken by crg supports your irresponsibility and that's absurd when i first learned this i looked at this flyer i tried to find out who was behind it there was no name and i didn't need my u of m masters work in statistics to recognize selective use of figures and outright propaganda to promote an agenda i went to the contact page the website page that was listed there there was for example a letter to the editors page it said letters to the editor you can see it today i checked it still the same 10 letters opposing avalon each one authored by quote a dexter resident now if you do the digging on the quotes in those actual letters eight of those ten were written by either jamie griffith or sue cheryl that's not on there that's not a dexter resident ten different ones it's two people claiming that their letters represent the broader community on their page that is incredibly misleading and incredibly irresponsible their facebook page links to a sometimes news site with another letter also jamie griffin an interview also with jamie griffith neither the facebook page nor the website includes officers named contacts all the contact information is a post office box an anonymous email and the facebook link i had to dig like crazy to figure out even just a couple of names that are really behind a lot of this now i learn about the petition for uh the revision to our council charter so i guess i want to close this out by flipping over to the facebook page for avalon housing if you go to avalon housing you get a picture of a team of people a very large number of people you get pictures and names of nine board members with titles you get links to partner organizations that reads like the vip list of non-profit highly touted organizations in our counter a county not just faith in action but also food gatherers and many others that contrast to me is the contrast between being irresponsible and being responsible i noted in the packet that there's a bunch of information about the pair housing act and i'm glad that that's in there it's a huge reminder to me that when we enact in the context of fear that leads us to prejudice based on groups that are disadvantaged particularly including people who are low income particularly people who need supportive quality services in order to get into the mainstream of being productive citizens in our community we need to support that we need to support it strongly last thing i want to say is it takes more than just a village to raise children i know that book and that phrase is out there but sometimes it takes a county we have a homeless problem homelessness problem that goes well beyond the county excuse me beyond dexter it goes into the county and sometimes it takes a state to raise children and raise families so i appreciate the time i encourage you to support the proposals that are on the agenda for you tonight related to avalon and i will say that at any point even when i was across the street at recess at cornerstone when it first opened when my son first went there i would have supported this project thank you very much thank you for your comments this evening jim i thought there was one other hand but maybe i'm mistaken justin are we are we clear of raised hands at this point um cole had his hand up but i was able to clear his question there we go yeah called oh he was cold does not want to speak thanks thanks for for catching that show and i i just had a question for justin about recording the meeting but we're all set okay very good you're welcome anytime why don't you give us your address just yeah uh so cole miller 76544 street uh uh thanks for doing the meetings thanks for uh keeping this going and uh you know i can only imagine what justin's workload is at this point and and i i would give all the city employees a round of applause uh daily if i could they certainly deserve it well said cole thank you okay um justin i'm not seeing any other raised hands so if you don't see any i'm gonna move on i don't either i did unmute um two people who have called in in case they wanted to speak but other than that i don't see any hands okay so we think we got everybody that's what it looks like yeah okay thank you for your patience everybody else as we went through to make sure um i'll move on to item h there's two communications in the packet uh the upcoming meeting list and the uh letter that mr mccarter mentioned from st james episcopal church um supporting the project um does anybody have any comments on the two communications or questions okay seeing none we'll move to our first report from our treasurer slash assessor slash finance director marie sherry marie how are you i'm good counselor good sean how are you very good thank you good to see everybody sort of in real life and if you if you hear chewing behind you i bribe my dogs with two sticks so they won't bark while i'm talking um you you have my report in front of you um i wanted to just kind of touch base on the covid um pandemic and what's happening out there with possible reimbursements and that sort of thing i looked today to see if there was any updates it's kind of fluid on how all this is going but the latest update i heard is what they're trying to do is they're trying to get congress to take the monies that have already been approved not for communities that are over 500 but the rest of it and make it so that they can backfill lost revenue so that's kind of an angle in my report you know i talked about we're gonna we're gonna see less revenue sharing um so that's kind of something that um is in the works in the various lobbying and legislative areas to try to be able to allow them to backfill uh state revenue um our next state revenue share sharing check will be at the full amount it's the one after that that will start seeing the effect of um people not shopping and people not spending uh money there any questions in that area can we receive those quarterly marie uh every other month every other month okay okay thank you um on the board of review just wanted to touch base briefly on that i do expect probably four may go to tribunal i know for sure one has um and that's one that goes tribunal every year um we may have two residential and another business that will go to tribunal we'll find out you know when those filing deadlines happen um all of the all of those uh petitioners actually got rulings in their favor but i don't know if they necessarily got rulings in their favor enough so just kind of a heads up on that um i don't really have any other updates unless you have any questions for me council do you have questions on marie's uh third quarter report nothing here thanks julie okay looks like you're doing a great job nobody has any questions on money so yay hopefully soon we'll see each other in real life that would be nice yeah yeah i'm not sure you we got you are the the uh the uh gfoa award was mentioned at the last meeting or the previous one and i'm not sure you were on but uh congratulations was issued so thank you in for everything you're doing there to to continue to bring that that home for us thank you and the funny thing is we're already starting to work on spreadsheets got the upcoming one gotcha good deal okay um let's see up next is our public services superintendent dan welcome good evening everybody good morning good evening it was back and i provided a two-week report um i had a couple meetings late last week that i didn't get in my report and i'd like to start with that the first meeting i had was in the industrial park we have a storm ditch that runs from the side of nepco down to our big retention pond um it's been overgrown for a number of years so um we noticed that when we did our saw grant that there was a little bit of water being held up because of the being so overwhelmed so we're looking looking at different options i'm working with ohm um maybe it's nothing we're going to do maybe this year but in the future i'm also talking to courtney about it so that'll be something that will will bring to you at a later date on how we're going to go about removing some of the the trees and doing some of the stuff there and then also i had a meeting with tom and jim from ohm on the central street project um i didn't make it for the whole walk through where i made about half of it but we put a punch list together the contractor is supposed to be back this wednesday to start doing some restoration work um on that project obviously down at fifth and broad they haven't even got top soil or seed in there and also we walked central street and we looked at different areas where i think that they need to add top soil a little more seed to make it look a little bit better they're hoping to be here wednesday for that but looking at the weather um i don't know if that's gonna that's gonna work for them so they're looking for an alternate day it may be friday now i think they said monday in an email you probably haven't seen yet okay the rain day right now is monday okay so um that's that's the meetings i had uh later in the week i couldn't get into my report is there any questions on my report um hey dan i'm gonna ask you to help me here uh maybe it's courtney that can help a little bit but just on the i wanted the council to know and the community to know that on the path project sort of unrelated to the past project there was a a tree that fell in the vicinity of the path and knocked out or not knocked out but knocked down some communication wire that leads to towards the creekside project can you just fill in how we've tried to step up a little bit and help get the branches away and some of the things that we've done um i know we're going to be working through with the schools to try and help them get that repaired but um can you just share what what you've observed and done and i'd like to give a shout out to gino for coming in and helping well we um got the call from the schools that the tree had fallen and the tree was outside the easement area but it had fallen onto a communication pole that was inside the easement area and obviously communication fiber connection is important to the schools right now so we had our arborist arbitrary landscaping come out on an emergency and technically um they weren't working but because this was for a government in a school um he actually just came out himself and cut the most immediate need of which was the tree um the branch that was actually causing the wire to be sort of unstable and he has sent them back twice actually he was out today kind of doing final cleanup of some brush in that area um and then we've been working with the fiber company on figuring out a solution to put up the new pole the replacement pole so the um mill creek park path plan or the mill creek path plan called for putting up another pole um about 20 feet away from the existing one and so now what we're going to do is just put up one as a replacement so that's kind of the difference the plan now so we're looking at you know there was a cost that would have been incurred for that poll falling if it had fallen six months ago and had nothing to do with the path and there's a little bit of an incremental cost because we'd like it to go into a certain location so we're going to work with the schools to figure that cost sharing out thanks courtney appreciate that i see scott bell has his hand up scott do you have a question yeah just a couple of questions for dan on the two westridge items uh that the sinkhole where's that and what's the issue um i was notified by a resident and i cannot remember the name of the road it's a cul-de-sac when you first go in i think it was bridgeway pardon me bridgeway i was notified that there was a sinkhole and uh i went back there with a couple other guys and we looked at it and it looks to me that it's an old sister and there used to be an old home there many many years ago um so when i got i called the realty sign out front and they were gonna get in contact with somebody this was the last week i even followed up on it well they were gonna get in contact with somebody to come fill that in so what we did is we pounded post all the way around it and put our orange fence around it to secure it until they can get a contractor out there to fill that back in gotcha it was approximately six feet wide three feet deep okay so enough to cause harm to a pedestrian but not a fraser sinkhole size no it was no nothing like that and it there's just a lot of kids home right now you know that's what he noticed he noticed there was kids out there and walked out there and that's how we then he gave us a call so i think we've got to secure it as good as it needs to be and then and you had a bullet item uh that referenced a waste management mess what was that well yeah we've had a little bit of uh windy weather and when they're dumping things it's kind of flying all over the place um i know we contacted waste management we're trying to work through that with them trying to figure out what we can do a little different is that resident complaints sometimes the garbage cans are so full too the lids aren't closed down so and part of it too is some like leakage from the truck potentially so we it was a resident complaint you know people are home and they saw that occur and so they did clean it up and then since subsequent to that last week i believe they street soft and western as well so you know hopefully they're not like massive piles but it's enough to be kind of frustrating one of the things that i have noticed is with these cans is it it's definitely cleaner you know there's not as much stuff blown out of the old recycling cans so the process i think is cleaner but we've had some some little things that we've got to work through well i think it's it's part of murphy's law that says the windiest days are going to happen on trash days every week exactly thank you dan thanks courtney dan are you done with your report i am if if nobody has any more questions i'm not seeing any um okay we will move on to our community development manager report good evening michelle how are you i'm fine thank you sean and good evening council how are you sounds good all right i'm glad you're all doing well you have my two-week report in front of you but before i go into updates do you have any questions for me okay so um i provided you with another update from the michigan research and uh in seminar and quantitative economics it it will they're putting them out looks like it's putting they're putting it out monthly and although some of the information may not be the most uplifting uh so to speak it does give us an idea of what's going on and will help us as we go forward working our way navigating our way through this this unprecedented situation um i'm working on a survey to of the businesses to find out um what are the things that they may need um assistance with going forward the dda asked that the survey be created not so much that that the city can fill in for the financial um um the financial needs that they have but the data may the data and the information that we get at may be helpful as we go forward in helping businesses um so that i'm working on i had hoped to get it out i have something grafted by last week but um you know what they say about the best laid plans mice and women so um the two there's three updates for you um grandview commons will be coming in brower will be coming in for an amendment to their final site plan and the reason for that is they contacted me last week about a fourth amendment to their condo docks and what that amendment involved was showing balconies or decks if you will off the backside of the townhouses so um when i went back and looked at the approved final site plan there are no decks or balconies and as such before i could administratively approve this as a minor amendment on the condo tax they have to go through the amendment process for the final site plan and it will fall under a minor amendment provided they can uh demonstrate that it doesn't add more than five percent um to each structure um and they've excuse me they have indicated that they can demonstrate that so i should be getting that on wednesday and i'll keep you up to date on it i reached out to dte last week or the week before regarding the duplicate polls on grand street you know that they cut off some of the existing ones uh put new ones up so that they could get their the improvements that they needed to complete or the in order to deconstruct or decommission the broad street substation but the other communications companies the the fibers the phones they haven't completed their transfer of their lines to the new polls yet that will be happening just as soon as the lockdown is is lifted for them to be able to do it so it is coming and your patiences is requested excuse me i'm so sorry dexter bakery opened up on sunday how many people went hey yeah i hope somebody ate an apple fritter for me um i understand that it was pretty busy i've spoken to the or texted with the business owner today and she said the the amount of people coming through yesterday as well as today has been amazing and she was it just warmed her heart she said to know that business was missed that much and appreciated by the community dairy queen is opening up on friday folks so they will also be working hard to keep social distancing in the outside but they're going to be doing curbside ordering and pickup so you won't be calling ahead to make your order when you get to the parking lot and you park your vehicle they'll make your call then and they will deliver your food to you or your order to you that's what i have so far does anybody have any questions for me if not enjoy your donuts and your ice cream folks michelle approximately how many of the units at 150 are occupied you know um let's see if i had to make a guess i'd say about a half a dozen gotcha i i spotted one of the newest members of the community waving to me from her balcony yes yes julie knight enjoyed a nice morning out there actually it was a brisk morning i almost fell on a piece of a sheet of ice watching her oh glad that transition worked out for you julie thank you thank you it worked out quite well does anybody have questions for michelle not seeing any answer oh jim smith please michelle do you wanna give us any more updates on the encore um other than what's in my report um let's see i don't have anything else i did receive the review letters from the consultants the city attorney and there was no update from the fire department so um those have been provided to the applicant i have not heard anything from them okay okay so we we don't know when they're going back to planning commission then planning commission postponed them to may so as far as us going forward now they're going in front of planning commission next week monday okay all right thank you for clarifying thank you okay i don't see any other questions for michelle if we uh somebody thinks of something we can come back if we have to oh i'm sorry i did forget one thing sean okay go ahead thank you i did receive a call from jim harlis this morning you'll recall he's the environmental consultant for the norfolk team and he was telling me that there may be a a chance it might be a slim one but there may be a way to utilize an existing program through the state to help move um move our project forward and be able to be what's the word he used eligible for those non-environmental costs that are currently the hold up for the project things that like being able to do the underground parking etc so i'm waiting for a call from all people jim tishler so as soon as i hear from him if this really does turn out to be something that um it makes sense for the city i'm certainly going to pass it on to you and and update you accordingly so i've got my fingers crossed right now okay any questions on that okay thank you for keeping us up to date on that uh next up on the agenda is our city manager report miss nichols how are you good thank you how are you good i don't have too many updates some of you may have seen in the last email update that um we had included a link for people that want to be put on the permanent absentee voter list we did get some about 36 replies to that which was good so we're adding people to that and that means that you'll get the application for the election automatically you just have to return it we have gotten a lot of applications back for the mail action which we can actually use for august so that will save us some postage and some time ballots that is our next election is august 4th we anticipate that the vast majority of that will be done by absentee so we'd like people to get their requests in so that we can kind of do a big mass mailing all at one time instead of kind of every day more and more um those ballots won't be available be mailed out mid-june um so hopefully everyone's gotten the message that the polls will be open may in may but you know the signage won't be out it should be pretty obvious and we have included that in various updates um i did put in my report that grant street's now scheduled the grand hudson project is now scheduled to start in mid-may due to the closure of the schools there's no reason to wait for school to get out so the contractor has a pretty aggressive schedule that would have him finishing at the end of july um so that will be good we're following up with the residents on their water service lines because we had sent the letter asking to be let in to inspect them like right when the pandemic hits so clearly people aren't going to be comfortable with that so we have a magnet trick we sent out today in an email to try to decide or try to figure out which service lines aren't copper so we did get our first response today which was police on a photo and the magnet and everything so i'm hoping we get a bunch of responses on that um i've not heard about anything from lj for the path or don't to finish up the restoration from the 4th street sidewalk and the rapid flashing beacons but hopefully we hear something about that this week i wanted to ask about the ballot language for the august election for the fire station right now if you read it it says that the earliest we could collect the millage would be 2020 which doesn't really make sense anymore because it's not going to be collectible in 2020 so i didn't know if council would be willing to change that to 2021 we could have that as an agenda item on the 11th um but it just didn't really make sense to keep it 2020 since we have the time to change it to 2021 and i'd also like to refer to the sheriff's department as the sheriff's office because that is their technical um how they're supposed to be referred to so unless council objects i'd like to ask for a little few changes since we do have time to change the language before the may 12th deadline um so that'll be on the next agenda then is what you've got there right yeah for may yeah because that's the last chance the battle language is due may 12th okay um and then i wanted justin to provide an update he had heard back um from the attorney general for the charter amendment so i just wanted him to provide a quick update on that yeah so we um courtney said we got a email back from the attorney general's office um indicating that both they and the governor's office had received the letters that i sent them about um about the citizen charter amendment um and they requested um copies of the front and back of one of the petition forms um and they're going to be in contact with scott who is assisting us in this um and moving through this process um but the the deadline to certify that language to the county again is may 12th so um they're gonna have to have to move pretty quick here um to review that that language and that's that's all i got for you okay courtney floor is still yours i think the only other thing was just the comment in here about the tedf funding um the original deadline for that was may 1st um they've just extended that today to june 1st um but we would like to submit a project for broad street um this is a funding source we've received before so i don't know what our chances would be but i thought oh i made a good point that in the past a lot of the stimulus money that has come through for infrastructure goes through existing programs i don't think it's a bad idea to kind of have programs in the various uh just in case something bless you comes up thank you so we will plan to submit that for the remainder of broad street and we can discuss that more wednesday at the budget session as well i think it's a good idea that you're you're able to fill that out thanks for the extra effort it takes to do that yeah no problem i see jim smith has his hand up so why don't i call on jim courtney now and we can see where that goes yeah courtney i had a question about on the absentee ballots people who voted in the march primary will they are they automatically on the list so if you absentee ballots yes so if you voted in the march primary and you checked both boxes on that application for march and november then yes you'll be you don't you won't get another application for november you'll be all set so the people on the permanent list um it becomes a little bit more complicated just because we have you know may applications that are good for august and we have march applications that are good for november but we'll but so people that did submit them won't have to resubmit for november okay thank you other questions for courtney looks like paul's got his hand up he's literal i can't see that okay not for courtney but i i do have some comment that went over pretty quickly there from the chamber that i'd like to just let you know about when courtney's done so i'll go back we have to go back to ford just so i give you some updates on some some activities okay absolutely sorry for passing over that quickly no no no problem at all so when courtney's done let me know and i'll jump in okay i don't see any other blue hands or people waving hands um courtney i guess you're got off the hook easy tonight yeah thanks all back to you all right thanks sean uh there was a meeting this morning of the chamber and i would let you know that the decision has has been made to not make a decision to cancel the concert series yet until we hear from the governor on the 18th i mean on the 15th we have another meeting then on the 18th which we will then make a determination as it relates to that okay um that's that's the first thing okay so the concert series first event which was with the uh with the dexter symphony has been cancelled by their request okay so it'd be starting with the second event that those events haven't even been placed on a a flyer or a poster yet because they didn't want to put that expense out without um knowing that there was going to go forward okay uh chris jones and his dexter creamy have been this main sponsor they didn't want to have any extra burden of expenses with them at that point in time uh the second thing that i would like to mention is the ribbons uh this the chamber had a discussion a month before that about ribbons around the trees um and so uh i would like to uh support the concept that the young people have talked about uh there was a question of whether there were going to be white ribbons or blue ribbons but the cut but the chamber would definitely be involved in that process if they would like us to be involved in that um since we are in town we have businesses that are that are related to those types of things so yeah just let us know what we can do as a chamber uh i'm sorry i missed the teacher's name but you can contact me through the city offices there and let me know what we can do or you can talk to the chamber president karen maddox there either one the third thing is that there has not been a decision yet uh on uh dexter days as we know it you know the extra days has not formally uh departed from being a part of the chamber that has not been legally done yet uh they have not applied for as i checked with courtney today they have not applied for a application for dexter days yet either through for the liquor license or through um the insurance or even for street closings so no formal application yet that may happen uh i know that when i've been in a beer can i've never been within six feet of anybody so uh that that that will have to all be worked out sometime if in fact that would even be potentially allowed you should know that chelsea has cancelled their sounds and sites on thursday nights completely and there's none of those activities going along including their big fundraiser that they have which is a large tent behind the uh common grill there in the parking lot there so uh well we're we're still up in the air on a number of those things but we will let you know as quickly as possible on the 18th of the decision that will be made from the chamber i'll try to answer any questions if anybody has any thanks paul appreciate the updates on those you're welcome i assume that if the concert series does go forward they're still gonna have some guidelines in place for some type of separation the sound travels quite far so we might have to have people sitting in places that they're not usually sitting you're right and uh we'll we'll do the appropriate things if necessary sean absolutely gotcha okay appreciate you keeping us informed of that doing my um best anybody have any questions for paul i don't see any blue hands and uh no more for courtney um i'll bounce down to my report um wanted to make you aware that both the dda and dafd held their first virtual zoom meeting these both occurred back on the 16th of april so about 11 days ago the dda board meeting went smoothly was pretty well attended we had people participating via zoom from as far away as florida um so a benefit of these virtual meetings allows people to participate even when they're out of town the dda saw its first draft of a budget for the next fiscal year and um it was well put together by marie and our treasurer mike fitzpatrick we anticipate that we'll be approving that budget at our may meeting in advance of the end of this fiscal year at the dafd meeting we held a little practice meeting similar to what council did first and then we had our actual meeting on the evening of the 16th the meeting was went pretty smoothly we received a very detailed report from our fire chief related to all the activities and the precautions the protocols the concerns the cleaning the safety masks and and many many other topics related to what they're going through or what our first responders are going through in uh dealing with um you know the the the possibility that they're coming they may come in contact with someone with the virus uh you know that's the uncertainty is the hardest part i think um but the chief and this team are well prepared um and we successfully completed our first zoom meeting um i should also point out and i don't know if i mentioned this at the last meeting but we have a new chair of the dafd uh harley um asked not to be chair at the february meeting and in the interim between february and now uh well at the february meeting we appointed jim smith to be our new chair so jim ceta thank you jim ceta to be our new chair and um anyway jim ran the first zoom meeting uh in dafd history this past week so anyway both of those are moving forward i want to remind council that this wednesday we have our first budget review workshop it's another meeting like this on zoom uh staff has worked very hard to put together the first draft of that that's also available online if you need to find it if any of the 48 or so people that are listing here are interested in seeing it online anyway just a reminder that that's on wednesday i did spend a little bit of time after our last meeting talking with chris knight of uis related to the site plan approval topic that we postponed at the last meeting that they requested to be postponed and i'll be happy to elaborate a little bit more on that when it gets to the that item under uh old business but uh just wanted to make make everyone aware that i did spend some time with our attorney as well as uh their attorneys and michelle working through that that issue does anybody have any questions for me on things okay let me just get back to looking at the agenda then uh looks like donna has her hand up oh i see okay donna please i move we approve the four items listed on the consent agenda bill's in payroll in the amount of 370 000 i'm sorry three hundred and seventy thousand two hundred and forty two dollars and forty five cents uh the setting a public hearing for the sale of property between dte avalon and the city uh the third quarter budget amendments and the trouble unlimited planting plan okay motion by ms fisher thank you mr smith you have your hand up yup i'll second okay second by mr smith thank you justin if you could call the role to approve the four items on the consent agenda uh council member cousins yes councilmember fisher yes smith yes belle yes michelle's yes knight yes mercu yes motion carries thank you very much um moving down to item k1 old business this is a recommendation from planning commission to approve the final combined site plan for uis and we're also asking the council consider approving the agreement that was lifted listed as a draft in the packet and the more recent version of which was shared on i believe friday of last week do we need separate motions for those two items yeah i think i think we do scott i think we do i see jim's got his hand up the um sorry do you want him to make his motion first but i think that that's actually a condition of approval that we finalize it so um i think by virtue of adopting the motion you guys are saying you're comfortable entering into it so it would be implicit because it's number 10 on the condition list okay you want to do it at one month okay yeah good enough i read that it gives us the chance to just make the final dot the eyes cross the t's right change that that makes sense okay as always if there was anything of substantive nature in a chain it would come back in front of you okay jim thanks for waiting patiently sure uh i'll make the motion to approve the i'll make the motion that's on page 83 and ends on page 84. i won't read through all the conditions but approve the recommendation of the planning commission and information provided by the applicant staff wartman ohm dafd and reflected in the minutes of this meeting the city council moves to approve the uis combined preliminary and final site plan revision dated march 11 2020 in architecture elevation sheets a 101 a 200 a 201 revision date march 30th 2020 in accordance with the requirements of article 21 of the zoning ordinance subject to the following conditions and there's the ten conditions listed okay thank you jim motion by smith ms fisher you have your hand up yes i'll second the motion second by miss fisher thank you both okay michelle i'll turn it over to you okay so um as as sean indicated at the beginning of this item this was postponed at the request of the applicant and over the course of the last two weeks we have worked with the applicant and his counsel to excuse me to come up with a a road map if you will i.e an agreement for moving forward with this particular project the elimination and or partial releases of the different easements and making sure at the same time the city agrees to assist wherever it can but not be held harmless because there are there are uh things related to this that require a third party decision making or agreement and we can't be held responsible if those at those third parties don't um don't come to the table the way everyone needs them to and to make sure that the city's fees are covered as it pertains to our consultant costs to help help the applicant um the applicant's side was extremely uh helpful i have to give kudos to um to courtney and or justin they were able to find in the dungeon a file that provided me the opportunity to develop a timeline so to speak a history of how everything came to this point and it started way back in 1999 so um um it's not it's not an easy process and it certainly isn't going to take another 10 years to complete um please be assured of that excuse me i have received email uh email confirmation from the various utilities that they are willing to support releases of easements or complete termination of them that information has been provided to the applicant and his council so i really am very comfortable with a motion to approve subject to the conditions that are outlined the applicant is also indicated that they are supportive as well if you've got any questions for me i'm happy to answer them but that's all i have for right now so council i want to just elaborate a little bit um the the element of time is very important to chris knight and uis relative to the project goals and given our knowledge that there's an easement in the way so to speak there's at least either one easement or there's two depending on whether the current consent judgment's valid or not um you know normally we would not grant anybody preliminary zoning compliance to get started knowing that there was a problem and the the need for the agreement is basically to protect the city um we sort of have a a friendly customer service type attitude when it comes to helping our businesses here but you know the risk is all on them should they want to get started while the process of extinguishing the easement is taking place as we look back at that file that michelle mentioned uh the city tried to extinguish this easement and get a re get a revised plat recorded back in 2005 i think it was and after a couple of years worth of trying the state of michigan didn't allow it to happen because at that time dte wouldn't give a partial release of a portion of the easement that was needed to extinguish it so um the discussion that i had with the owner chris knight with the help of michelle and and our attorney steve este and their attorneys was related to since the village was the plaintiff on the last attempt to go through the court and get the easements extinguished we've sort of agreed to partner and help them reopen that case if you will um they're going to do all the work our attorneys will review you know any documents for filing documents that type of thing they're going to cover the cost of our attorneys to help with that we're not really uh we're not taking on any any risk or cost other than the time it might take to administrate making sure the agreement goes forward the way it's intended um michelle has already done a lot by contacting the three primary utilities dte a t and itc i think was the third one you told me michelle yes and anyway though her contacts and efforts already are should help this process go forward um i don't think um anyway i just wanted you to know more about the interaction that i had over the past couple weeks in this and i think we're at a better place because at the end of the day we were we had two businesses 12 years ago or 15 years ago that paid our cost to try and help get that plant re-recorded of that extinguished and it didn't happen so by even though we're offering to help uis go forward in this um you know we still need the cooperation in the formal agreement by the court and thus the agreement protects us in case something unforeseen happens that's the purpose of the agreement as part of the condition and uis is very supportive of it so if anybody has any questions for me on that i'd be happy to try and help i hope i didn't confuse anything and what i said okay is there any discussion then um on the motion and the second i'm not seeing a justin are you seeing any i am not seeing any okay all right then i'm gonna ask you to call the vote to approve the recommendation from planning commission all right councilmember michelle's yes knight yes bell yes fisher yes cousins yes smith yes mayor kyo yes ocean carries thank you all and thank you bell thank you for your good work on that you and staff on finding the history in the background um i'm sure uis will be pleased with that that moves forward and thank you for your help sean i appreciate it you're welcome uh now down to new business item l1 hopefully the students are still with us it looks like several of them still are this is the consideration of the resolution from the students regarding the coronavirus support this is paul i'd like to make that motion okay it looks like donna's got her hand up we approve or we adopt the resolution all right i'm going to take that as a support so boston cousins support fisher i'd like to just that'll do discussion comment if i may sure mr cousins uh first of all i think this is a great idea and as i mentioned the chamber has had talked about this over a month ago particularly as it related to the comment of ex express community spirit we were talking about supporting the many people that live in our community in the surrounding townships that our nurses and doctors and uh and as well as all the other uh ancillary people from the firefighters to the ambulance drivers and everything that so that that would fit in real well and i would be happy to uh tell you that anything that we would like to that you would like us to do as a chamber we were very happy to to do that uh buy ribbon for you or help you out in any way that you feel we can so miss eber if you can um well let us know we'll be happy to to work with your group there but i certainly support this uh one other comment that i'd like to make and this is a bit of history uh so i'll take carol jones's space here for that uh that back in 1970 which we just celebrated the 50th anniversary of earth day last week dexter was involved in that i was involved as a environmental ed teacher in dexter schools at that time and uh there was a lot of planning going on in the uh wausau county particularly in ann arbor schools in the university of michigan eastern michigan at that time about what could be done and we had great speakers coming in uh to talk about and speak about those those activities in there i had seen that all of it was ann arbor centered and so me with my big mouth i raised my hand and asked if there's anything that we could do out county to help support this and during that time they said sure so we put together an activity where we invited about 200 students from chelsea about 200 from pinkney and then our 300 or so 350 or so that we had from the upper classes of dexter met in the gym and they supplied a speaker for us two speakers and and a a folk singer so the folk singer is saying some songs uh the speaker was one of the speakers was marvel who was our uh was a u.s representative from the washington county area at that time and he spoke and then you young people will not remember this name but somebody older would arthur godfrey came and spoke at dexter high school back in the night in april of 1970 for the students there and so we had our own celebration here uh in dexter as well as all the activities that went on at the university of michigan and ann arbor school so a bit of history there that arthur godfrey came and spoke at dexter high school in the 70s thank you paul other council comments carol says she was there too that's right carol researcher thank you carol for remembering looks like zach has his hand up okay zach councilmember michelle uh yeah just some thoughts for those of us who may not have um ribbon around the house mr cousins had mentioned potential for the chamber of donating it um one thing that's been floating in my mind is is if the students would be interested in taking a step further and for those who may not have risen or want to not want to go out and wrap their trees um collecting a donation and going doing it for them and then using that money towards supporting some community group like the the senior center or some other worthy cause with whatever folks would want to donate for that that's it i think we could share that idea when we share that the resolution's been passed i i don't have a problem with anything they want to do above and beyond other council comments on the resolution of support okay justin if you would please call the vote to approve the resolution of support or the resolution to support the showing of unity please council member knight yes fisher yes michelle's yes smith yes belle yes cousins yes america yes thank you everyone motion carries and thank you students and the teachers that helped bring this to us um new business item l2 is our last new business item it's the consideration of the recommendation from planning commission to approve the final pud site plan for hilltop view apartments uh mr smith has his hand up the motion the suggested motions on page 125 make the motion to prove the recommendation of the planning commission and information provided by the applicant staff parallel wartman ohm dafd and reflected in the minutes of this meeting the city council moves to approve the pud fspr hilltop view apartments revised final pud site plan dated march 13 2020 in accordance with the requirements of article 21 of the zoning ordinance subject to the following conditions and there's five of them listed there okay i see miss fisher has her hand up so motion by smith i'll support that second by miss fisher thank you both i'm going to turn it over to michelle to take us through what's here please thanks mayor keough and thank you council so you have in front of you the final site plan for the avalon excuse me hilltop apartment hilltop view apartments that's the 24 residential apartment units the food pantry that's going to be operated by faith in action community center and the ancillary offices that go with it the planning commission as you know did postpone it back in march when it was originally up for final cycling approval or recommendation of approval due to some minor details regarding elevations um elevations and facade details the applicant came back with all of those details um and just knacked it out of the park the planning commission was was very happy with the amount of detail and and effort that the applicant put in to providing that information and so on april 6 they did make a recommendation of approval to you uh subject to to the conditions that are outlined in my letter there are no um anything that's left is is very very minor um the excuse me everything from ohms comments about a minor conflict with the dumpster and some of the utilities they're able to fix that and have agreed to it they will provide a revised site plan should council approve this recommendation as it's been written and the development agreement is also in a form that is that staff and the city attorney are very comfortable with as is the applicant any other changes just like the us uis agreement are very minor if there was anything substantive that were to come about after your after your action tonight staff would definitely bring that in front of you the last thing i will the last thing i will address in before turning it over to scott is the information you've seen it before and that's on fair housing um as as i've discussed with planning commission and city council before from a land youth perspective this is a multi-family development that's what the land use is that's what the zoning ordinance regulates the additional services that are going to be provided or the type of residents that are going to live there the way the avalon is is financing the project those are not eligible for consideration as part of a land use decision and that's why the fair housing act information is provided in your packet tonight as it has been in previous in previous packets if you've got any questions i'm happy to answer them otherwise i'm going to turn it over to the city attorney scott to address the concerns or the the questions regarding a little more in-depth on restricting the uh making any restrictions on the development okay before scott says anything we have a question by ms fisher yes ma'am so i looked at the drawings tonight and i noticed that on i looked at my drawings in my packet and on the front of the building it it indicates the community room and there's also black lettering that indicates the laundry room that looked kind of commercial to me and if you live there i don't know why would you need a directive to get you to the laundry so wondering why that was out there um their um architect is actually participating in the meeting today and i he had talked about that because there was a question raised at planning commission it wasn't exactly of nature that you did but he addressed it and i'm gonna ask him to um to follow up and because he'll do a much better job than i could um david esau are you available sure if i can be unmuted there you go you're all set david okay thank you um the desire was primarily to have a sign telling people who are coming in from out of the site how to get to the um to the food pantry um we did show signage to clarify the community center and the in the laundry areas because there will be people visitors coming in residents new residents getting used to where things are in the site that would help them i don't think we're wedded to anything about those um the community center or laundry signage wendy can certainly weigh in if she would like to they're not lighted signs for the community center or the laundry so we'd certainly i think be open to discussion of reducing the size of those is can wendy be unmuted to address it john yep yeah okay go ahead wendy yeah thank you um and and thanks david yeah i would agree that i think we you know sort of for consistency we're putting sign on the food pantry then also put one on the community center and the laundry but if uh you know council would prefer we not have one on the laundry i don't see any reason why we would need one there michelle if i'm not mistaken um how many of those signs actually face the road i mean this is building c that's way back in the back of the site plan you'd have to be inside this inside the site to see the signage you you won't see it from the road uh correct me if i'm wrong david um except for the food pantry side right food pantry yes the laundry in the community center you won't see that gotcha okay thank you donna you still have your hand up are you do you want to make another comment no now that well yes i do um i understand it's in the back of the building having the community center identifiable i understand that and the food pantry but somehow having that laundry label to me was an invitation oh there's a laundromat here come in and use it and made the rather than residential it seemed like um commercial area but i'm you know it's if that's what everybody majority wants to do but i did want to raise these the laundry is not intended for use by anybody other than 10 right thank you david are there other comments or questions about the motion and the second i think that um the applicant can take ms fisher's comment into consideration as they go forward does that sound right to you michelle yes and i see wendy shaking her head so yeah thank you okay cousins here i don't have any problem where it is since it's not visible from the road okay thank you okay just checking my participant window uh any other council members want to speak on this topic tonight okay um we had a motion and a second we've had discussion i'm going to ask um justin to call the vote please sean did you want to hear from scott manzel oh do we need to yeah do we need to if we need to uh yeah only uh people probably only if people have a question about okay that's in the packet yeah that's fine if not that's fine let's save our money perfect well we're we've done a good job of following the fair housing act so yes i i commend right i commend you all i really okay uh justin wants to call the vote please all right thank you bell yes fisher yes knight yes cousins yes smith yes michelle's yes mayor keough yes motion carries thank you everyone thank you council can you give us that can you give us the account for the vote there please it was 7-0 unanimous thank you thank you you're welcome um that concludes our new business for this evening uh so we'll move on to council comments and i'm going to just go in order on the participant window here that i see i'm going to start with miss knight please i have no comment listen to the council meeting okay good night justin if you could mute um mr enos iphone i think maybe uh welcome uh miss fisher oh no i'm good thank you okay uh mr smith i'm good okay uh mr cousins i guess uh my only comment is about the community garden i guess i will wait to hear what the governor has to say on the 15th to see is that what we're kind of waiting for there courtney and uh with olga on the 15th to decide whether we're going to do that or not because it's getting to a point where people are going to be anxious or not be able to participate you want me to answer that yes please yeah so she sent an email to all the previous participants so um the applications can be filed and we're assuming we're moving forward the only difference is going to be the workday so the dpw will probably do more of the work for the work day than they normally would because i don't know about getting people together for that but other than that we should i just was talking to wendy or going back with wendy today on the kind of temporary agreement with them so that we can keep using it but as far as i and olga are concerned we will open it in may so and do is there a specific date that that's been chosen for that or not no i need to find out if it's been um plowed or turned over but i imagine it yeah it'll still be usually it's around because usually i'm gone so it's usually like the 16th or the 23rd so i would think it would still be in that time frame thank you very much no problem good question paul anything else no i'm all set okay um see i think i'm down to i got to do scott and zach how about scott you next please um yeah i just wanna say it's good to see everybody i'm glad everybody is healthy you all seem to be and i hope to see you in person soon thank you thank you scott likewise and mr michelle's how are you so far so good um i just want to briefly touch on planned unit developments i've seen a lot of people are really confused about them they are a peculiar planning tool but there's nothing nefarious or unusual about them almost every community that has euclidean zoning across the country has some version of it uh locally we have approved 150 jeffords was a planned unit development grand view commons and stopped me if i'm off here a bit uh michelle um millennium place or whatever that's called now was a planned unit development and i suspect huron farms dexter crossing and westridge were all also planned unit developments is that accurate which wasn't a planned unit development um but i had thought the same thing for a number of years there are actually now with avalon if i remember right this should be the 12th qud the city's done they're currently listed on the zoning ordinance zoning map um that's on our website and it will be updated to reflect babylon's hilltop view as soon as the development agreement is signed all right thank you thank you okay did i miss anybody i think i got everyone okay i just wanted to make one quick comment i uh i know the schools are also looking for a way to try and recognize the various students that won't have a graduation um ceremony this this year um one of the school board members had contacted us just informally through email about whether or not they could post or place things on light polls uh like banners or whatever and i know we've suggested the use of our overhead banner so if anything like that comes up between courtney and i will be sure to continue sharing that with you they haven't asked for any formal approval but we've offered our unofficial support if there's a way to recognize the students i do know that they've placed signs in front of every senior's home that acknowledges um the you know a senior from a senior from dexter lives here and uh obviously we're supporting by allowing those temporary signs in place during this special time so i just wanted to publicly acknowledge that that some of that conversation has taken place and anything we can do to recognize those 290 hard-working young men and women i would certainly be in favor of but just wanted to let council know that that has had some informal emails on so more to follow maybe okay i don't think i missed anybody um so we're back around to non-arranged participation justin if um you can help me see if there's anybody that wants to speak by raising their hand or uh if you're you've called in you can hit star 9 to let us know maybe you want to unmute people uh looks like cole miller has his hand up so great cole welcome again hey uh cole miller again i just had a question for courtney um uh following up on uh i was confused it sounded like there's two separate lists for absentee voters one for march november and one for may august was that not right so oh we can go for justin yeah so um as a part of the march election we had sent out absentee ballot applications that included options for both march and november the intent was uh if when we had an august election we would have the same option for uh selecting both august and november but um may is in this weird little little spot where um uh people when we were having a may election we sent out the absentee ballot applications um for may um and since we canceled that election um the may applications are now valid for august um those who uh did not submit an absentee ballot application for uh may but would like one for august and are on the permanent list for august um we're going to do another mailing of absentee ballot applications to those folks okay i'm not uh so if i applied for the march primary and check the box for november then you'll you you will automatically get a ballot for november you will still have to submit an application for august okay all right but if you submitted an application for may then you don't have to resubmit an application for august okay all right uh cool then i know what to do thank you you're welcome you're welcome uh keith smith looks like you have your hand up yeah sean hey i listened to maria earlier and um i heard her mentioned a number of ways to get reimbursed from the government for stuff but i want to make sure you were aware or every particularly marie and dan that the fema public assistance grant has opened up and this was a a really quick grant for municipalities to be able to recoup correct costs and projected costs for the the virus activities so maybe you've heard out of it maybe they have not but if they have questions they can email me tomorrow and i get some information to them but it's going to have a very very short window for turnaround to get that public assistance uh dexter city already has an account with them as does every municipality it's just opening that up and then and then being able to submit for it uh the second thing i appreciate you bringing up the afd and and uh the briefing that was provided there uh i do want to encourage people that that was probably one of the most in-depth briefings i gave on anything and there was a lot of information there and i believe you still have the recording of that so if anybody wants to look at that and get the information and see what's been going on in the emergency services community i'm i'd encourage them to go look at that thank you thanks chief thank you thank you chief i did the best i could to give a summary on it so if i missed something uh feel free to elaborate i presented okay thank you okay i'm not seeing any other hands up um so with that i'll shall i shall i just unmute everyone yeah let's do that just to be sure we got everybody justin that'd be great all right everyone right so we'll get a plane tuesday right is there anyone who would like to speak today all right i think we're gonna see this no okay i'm gonna move to item oh which is uh requesting a motion for adjournment please moved food by smith report all those in favor well all in favor of adjourning signify by saying hi please i i hope everyone has a good night and thank you for attending this evening thank you thanks for a good meeting good night everyone good morning everyone thanks justin and courtney you're welcome all right", "0ovJDklMzYQ": "what's up guys

"Keopeulruk :) I was going to hold yet deulchyeo the bimongsamong the cream donuts as tours go \u314e\u314e (hand sanitizer) - V log of Imna Saturday 6 March 2021 You\nchicken-cheese muffins, bacon and egg muffin Mac, just I ordered Egg Mac Muffin I had to eat breakfast, so I stopped by the McDonald's DT store-I'd like to eat chicken cheese muffins first . I need to put a hash brown in the middle so the taste is completely different when I put it in the middle and when I didn't put it in. The most delicious first mouth :) A heavy and happy morning with McMorning Haha. When asked, McDonald's tastes better than Americano. It tastes a little softer and fresher, so it's easy to drink it all in the early morning.-Even if I open my eyes only at 9:30, I came to eat McDonald's with my sister until 10:20 . You can order it (DT) Because you can come out with a beggar if you bring a car \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b There are times when you just take your eyes off and wear a hat-If you want to drive and go to Yeontral Park, you have to eat hard. Someone thinks you're driving a rickshaw ) For some reason, McMorning also tastes like this when I come to the store and eat it like this (My sister said she wouldn't eat it because she fell asleep..) (I'm not eating it alone..) -Egg McMuffin size is small like full moon bread, and if you eat it for lunch, it's three bite cuts. Inexpensive possible Now, my mouth is less relaxed because it hasn't been long since I opened my eyes haha Imna) Because the protein (the ratio is the biggest) is the egg inside)? If you eat it with milk, the world's healthy diet feels like a real breakfast thanks to the hot eggs (I stole the coffee I bought for my sister to drink.. heh) -It's definitely good to have meat in it for visuals (bacon egg mac muffin) I can't stand the scent of bacon- (Store Inside) Looking at the list, there were some people who came at 7 o'clock. I regret that I was n't a little more shy as a single person who always took a long time for the last order.-I bought a couple look to take a picture with cream and go to the studio.. I really thought about it. jeongjak then go left at home was not trying to take beautiful pictures today disclosed the first sister) somehow today I was lucky the weather'm afraid I'm really geographical Lee - now brightens jigetji - ... I would not \u314e\u314e Why me that a company is like spring weather weekend If it's raining, cold, or dark on the day I write a year or year, I 'd rather be cold, cloudy, or rainy on the day I go to work \u3160\u3160 -I arrived at Krim and Yeontral Park. It was warm until Friday, but it was cold from Saturday at 9:30 am . \u314e\u314e was a huge - here (snacks) bench'm not going to require snacks already was now arrived - falling so good to be together in the morning photo spot itgilrae found saengsyat challenges cream \u2606 sister :)) I'm sorry to say anything of daejanchi to catch the eye model I don't have so much soul in my eyes. Now take a picture\n(I hate stones!) -Cream, who's the one you save when you're so hard? \u2605It's me\u2606 Sweet potatoes bought at a nearby convenience store I'm sad that there are no places to sell baked sweet potatoes as the days get warmer (I'm tracking the traces of sweet potatoes ) Love, passion, and tenacity for sweet potatoes I prepared this blanket because I didn't know it. The garage was very windy, so I used it useful :) By the time I got home, the day was getting loose. - I arrived at Landis Donut. Even though I went to 10:30 with a leisurely pace, there was already a line, and the line was stretched really quickly . Sister) Are you sleepy...? Im Na) Yeah, I think I'm sleepy (a system that the staff puts you when you say the donuts you want) When it comes to my order, it's confusing and time is tight, so decide in advance! Landis donuts/ colorful and pretty colors haha - I'm going to eat them with cool iced americano. Landis donuts and Americano are a must. -It's a glazed donut. Sister) I heard that if you eat this, you can't go back to crispy. You mean that delicious? -Now Choco is here . I go to the same hospital with Choco and Cream, and I often come to play on weekends because I am close to my house haha-Doesn't this seem a bit heavier than Chrispy? If the crispy donut is a type that melts smoothly without a sense of density, Landis is a thicker dough and a more dense style -Texas glazed donuts. More than twice the size of regular donuts Was Texas a good place to live? Im Na) I want to live in Texas Sister) I don't even taste the same as glazed donuts I know , but I was surprised by the overwhelming size and bought both, but you only buy one of them! -Noted is a classic taste -This is a new... It's a new generation taste. It's a really new and not new generation taste. Noted is like a donut, and Landis is a donut! Unni ) If the line isn't so long, it's a place worth going once even if it's far away .. Wow, the line is really too tight. Landis' orange box, which is hotter than the Yeonnam-dong limited Hermes box- I know that there is only Yeonnam-dong in Seoul, so the number of stores is so small. So, my sister, who has no choice but to be crowded ) People asked me as they passed by, Im Na) Why are you standing like this? The store itself is located in a conspicuous place , so I think I'm more curious. I'm a bit embarrassed by the appearance of a buttercream donut called Landis Signature that is different from what I expected ??????????????? -It's completely different from what I thought, I thought that if I bite a bite, there would be a lot of buttercream, but there's no cream at all? It's not that it's not tasteless, but it's a little bit clumsy..? -(Butter) Where is the cream? I went Maple greater ruler inde It 's small, so instead the price is cheaper (2,500 won) compared to other donuts Landis donuts hear talk priced nopdan per-\u314e\u314e But that donut itself is huge tender it, not just chewy sugar powder donuts huge sow taste It was n't very expensive as 3,4 thousand won Im Na) It's the sweetest donut I've ever eaten Sister) I was going to talk about that too haha \u200b\u200bIt's so sweet that my teeth hurt.. The strong sweetness of the maple scent is surprisingly not strong, and the sweetness of the top of the donut and the donut aren't very strong. The texture is unique . Na) Apple fritter sister) I think I saw something similar in Dunkin, visually-I think it tastes completely different from that. The apple scent and cinnamon scent is strong. The bread part is very sweet and very sweet, but the taste of apples. Since this is added, it's the best dessert Sister) These donuts are usually really sweet. Eating just one or two won't give you enough sugar. Sister) You know Gangjeong called'Oranda'? There's a bit of that feeling, and this is better when you eat a spicy main meal and eat it as a dessert rather than eating it as a pre- meal bread or snack like this .. \u314e It seems like it would be perfect to eat kimchi and eat it. Sister) I think there were 10 people in front of us . I didn't even give it to you quickly -Now, recommend (donut restaurant). Anyway, I 'm going to go to Old Perry donuts at once because my sister and cream and'Let's go out' every weekend. I 'm confident to go anywhere in Seoul or suburbs of Seoul. -The mint chocolate donut scent and texture are really right, Mincho sister) Doesn't it feel like a miku? Im Na) It feels like Texas. It pops out naturally as if I've been there. But this taste is like a real Mikuo outside..\u2606-Have I brushed my teeth right now? Sister) Im Na) 1st place among the Minchotems you've eaten So far, it seems to be the 1st place in the future. Minchofa people should try it haha -I'm not a half-minchopa (it's okay) Oh wow, it's refreshing Sister Haha Next is a ganache donut -Chocolate is on top and white chocolate is on the bottom -It looks very sweet, right? It's no sweeter than the apple fritter. Apple fritter magic that makes all donuts light . It's definitely chocolate! It's not sweet! Imna) M. aenem donuts sister) That's so pretty something visual \u314e\u314e like to come to a fairy tale illustrations -\nyou know who is upon unconditional short-range bullseye when really weigh physiological got to meet the one M. aenem donuts put as donuts and chocolate woogeok woogeok chewing feeling sister), so it just seems like a feel from the visual appeal of Landis mikuk gaemseong - but really ought to donuts Korea is so much I do not think I'm only thing not mentioned is the United States several times today .. heh meosseuk to jeungmal ohdeonga once went later \u314e\u314e But everyone, too, are you RGRG? -Wake up at 8 o'clock in the morning on the weekend \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b Have a try \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b Bad story X Honey tip 0 Sister) And it's a little pretty, it's a little pretty Im Na) I think you'll be really grateful, for me, Sister) Standing in line? Blah \u314b\u314b\u314b \u314b\u314b\u314b \u314b\u314b\u314b \u314b\u314b\u314b that's enough paint jjikeoyaji the marriage certificate What sister) (Let's have used the following) grassroots me once, tell Haram two-gongsupyo \u314e\u314e heat if Tofu / Imna) seems to be delicious sister sister), I slightly salty I heard that point (maepjjil the sister today seunaekmyeon) Jujuy gatgido tofu stew with spicy eolkeun just good enough to eat and the taste was expecting something really K- taste shooter - gonna have five \u3151 Tofu is really good sister sister kkeulyeojun bongdang 370ml water 1 degree put tofu if the ratio is 1: 2 and wave, Chengyang peppers, zucchini heat if soup into as opposed to black pepper and eggs Talk is this the end if these days the heat and I'm doing Tofu ridden sister) did was how little longer to put the tofu is singgeowo quality So, the second time I boiled it, I boiled the soft tofu ramen 1:1, but it was not so crispy than I thought and it was delicious! - I think even gigabytes will be blocked for haejang now to kalkal of donuts haejang Do not drink suits you really well in bread haejang \u314e\u314e Imna) (if continued) Sister egg is not easy yireogi) almost poached egg's world waang bite one poached egg Kimchi topped kkosup Note that kimchi jonggajip Kimchi inde whatnot taste also may take turns ordering from well enough to not getting hit yiraseo basic one type rarely salted fish smell pagimchi also the mother dipped jusideon kimchi tastes almost like water kimchi is another brand that kimchi has come Jongga's house haha \u200b\u200bThe feeling is very different from the pre - dinner bread and the dessert that came back to the donuts after the haege. Is the real donut like this? I'm going to take care of the chores when I'm full. It was easier than I thought to assemble the last time I bought the IKEA roscog . It's less bulky than the existing trolley, but it's better stored, and it's much more sturdy, so I'm very satisfied\u2606 I'm going to try Patech once I hit it. It surpassed 7,000 won on a bunch of green onions. I wanted to eat green onions by shaking my hand . Listen \u314e\u314e right sawateoyo from plants at Daiso but the real real real sense, without good sleep once cut and boil ate the smell instead of fun ssolssol severe veranda or balcony countries already seem sister uncomfortable) Whoa sister) to gatgido'll put plug garaetteok in soil Imna) \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b -I picked up a thick one and planted four Imna) It grows here Sister) If I cut it and eat it, it grows again, grows again, is it an infinite refill? After I finished my hobby , I took a two-job break. Heh , I have a two-job break these days , so it's time to take care of it because I've worked hard, so it's time to fill it up. The sound of boiling oil that is the best in the world :) -For midnight snacks and dinner Peacock Pocha Smoked Shrimp / Bibigo Dumplings/ Bibigo Namdo Tteokgalbi/ Hwayo x Tonic Water- I heard a lot of saying that Hwayo is so delicious. It's delicious if you eat it with Hwayo Tonic after burning it in tonic water.

I sold it at 24 E-Mart convenience stores. I stocked up 3 more bottles right away on Sunday hahahahahahahaha-Shall we drink a shot of Tuesday ? I said it as if I didn't want it, but I couldn't help it. I said it with a serious expression, but it didn't work. -It's too good (exclamation) The thrilling endoscopy effect is a bonus \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b It can be an opportunity to determine the location of the organ :) -Bibigo It's a shrimp dumpling, but I've never tried it (I wonder), so I turned it on the stove, so the blood part was a bit tough, but the inside of the dumplings was completely solid and okay.- Should I say that it smells like shrimp? Something spreads softly. As expected, the dumplings are pounding. -You have to finish the day by eating delicious food. ^^ Sister) So, you think you bought it hard? Let's burn the last 10 minutes of the day..\u2606 On the weekend, the real time is too quick. If you do something, you will be less tired after two days, and if you do nothing, your body will be less tired, but when you go to work on Monday, there is something unfair and you cannot escape. \u314e\u314e Tuesday Let tonic to, albeit extended a little Saturday night so dokhaji even if the books fluently example flexible \u314e\u314e required when eaten to focus only on've been drinking pineapple juice x Tuesday combinations downed Lap go with no real end or even a cocktail feel yiraseo only pineapple juice x Tuesday without snacks continue to be able to drink something like heojeon Tate ham and cheese ciabatta summoned as before, but are often eaten these days competition is also one of the funnel is the item in the freezer :) meals, snacks, supper, snacks available to take advantage of all though not often find anxiety film falls I today I think Tate ham and cheese value if no Avatars find soothing give strong complacent turned after delivery applications fairly emptiness \u314e\u314e Fortunately, it found a place in the corner finished eating one nyomnyom \u314e\u314e today finish placing four squid once more flowers it until the temper I can't let it go.. I can't let it go. See you again in the next video :) Thank you For Watching :)", "UNf8Np3cl58": "aloha everyone this is lenora hawaii's pickle lady today i'm going to show you how to make apple crisp and a really easy recipe that even the kids can help you do this because there's a lot of things to do first of all uh the best apples to use are the green apples the granny smith i use like eight apples and this is the way i peel it i take off the top here in the bottom and then i just peel it like this okay now what i do is i cut the apple into quarters okay then i cut them again and then what i do is i take off the inside the core like that maybe with the kids they need some help but you know they could cut some of the apples just gonna do one apple so you can see how i do it and actually you can use any kind of apples but the granny smith people like that because it's tart and it it's good for baking okay so now what i do it's all peeled and no core or seeds i just slice them thinly just keep on going each quarter maybe has about four slices finish cutting it one more piece and then i have a big bowl where the other apples have already been done so here you go now you need the juice of one lemon so it doesn't turn brown so i like this little gadget and it's uh it comes apart like this and it catches the seeds and all you do is you put your lemon in and use some pressure and it squeezes and it separates the rind and the seeds and i have all kinds of juicers but i like this one see there's no mess here so now you can just pour it out see the juice comes out and i can throw this one away and do the other half sometimes i cut them into quarters if the lemon is so big or you can do this with an orange also okay now just pour it in and there you go the juice of one lemon there's a few seeds so i'll just scoop it out so now just pour the juice all over and give it a good mix now when my older daughter was young she was interested in baking so she said she wanted to make this so this was her first recipe that she made and she even wrote it down herself on a card for a later time i don't know maybe about 10 she was yeah okay now i have the pan i don't have to grease it i'll pour all the apples into the pan and just kind of spread it around and the apples are going to shrink so you just kind of get it as evenly as you can in the pan so you can see how all the apples fit into here at first i thought no it wouldn't fit but i try to kind of press it down to get it in all the places so now we're gonna make the topping so all you need is flour and then pour in oatmeal some salt some cinnamon and nutmeg and just mix it up real good now to make it stick together you have to use butter now it's mixed really good so now i'm gonna add butter i've kind of softened it a little bit pouring in the butter that i've cubed up so it's easier to cut into the filling now you're going to cut in the butter so it's easier to use this pie thing so you you just want it crumbly you don't want it like a batter because that is what will make the apple crisp nice sometimes it's hard so what i'm gonna do instead is use two butter knives so i'll scrape all this off so i'm going to use two butter knives because i was kind of having hard time with that pastry cutter so what you do is you just cut it like this it's just kind of like making pie crust or biscuit you also can use your fingers i might do that too as long as your hands are clean i think i will do that so now i'm using my hands so whichever method works for you is fine i i once took it to a potluck and my goodness the thing went out in about five minutes everybody loved it so much so it's very easy to do just a little bit of work in peeling coring and cutting all the apples up it's worth it in the end and you know the kids they would have fun doing this because for the little kids it's like playing in mud and getting it all nice so what you want to do is you kind of want to mix it up get the butter mixed up with the flour and the oatmeal and the brown sugar and then the cinnamon and the nutmeg and a little bit of salt gives it a really good smell and when you are baking this the whole house smells it's kind of like thanksgiving okay i just want to get these butter pieces a little smaller now this is a lot i'm not using the whole thing i'm making this actually for the official taste tester but he doesn't know it yet he'll be so happy when he comes okay i think it's done this is what it looks like kind of crumbly but like i said you don't want it mixed up like a batter for cake or cookie you want it kind of lumpy looking so you have uneven bits okay so now you want to make sure you cover up all the apples just sprinkle it evenly spread the rest of it evenly so it looks uneven the clumps but it's okay it's just the butter that will melt okay i think we got it all covered so i'm gonna put it on a cookie sheet because i'm afraid that this might bubble over because it's full to the top save a lot of cleanup if it does okay now the oven is preheated to 350 and i'm gonna bake it for 40 minutes okay put it on here here it is already done i'm gonna take some out it's still kind of hot gonna scoop some out let's taste it okay apples still have a crunch but it's soft enough that you can eat it nicely and you can taste all the um the cinnamon and the oatmeal and everything it's really good so you can see that it's very easy to make so you got to try it try it with the kids helping you out because there's a lot of parts in here that they can help out peeling and cutting and whatnot and this is perfect with milk but i like hot tea so whatever you want or coffee good for breakfast for lunch it's wonderful if you take it to a potluck to a picnic it holds up there so remember if you like this video don't forget to smash that like button comment and subscribe and don't forget to click that notification bell so that you can be notified whenever we make great videos like this one this is really good now i gotta make some hot tea to go with it so here we have again the official taste tester he's finally arrived and i fixed him a plate of apple crisp a la mode so try it apple crisp mo mo that's what you call it when you have ice cream oh okay paella mode cake aloe and are these nuts on fried on top no that's oatmeal butter brown sugar cinnamon nutmeg tastes really good yeah the apples are just really good they're like yes they're really good i think it's very sweet and it's just right good how long does it take to make one what are the steps well the hardest part is getting all the apples so i had eight large granny smith apples which are the green apples i had to peel them all i had to cut them and i had to cut out the core and then after that i sliced it and then just put it in the pans sprinkle some lemon juice over it so it won't get brown and then i made the topping separate just crumbled it all up and then just scatter it all over and bake it for about 40 minutes or more 45 minutes to an hour depending how soft you want the apples if you want the apples like kind of like applesauce like this it's about an hour if you want the apples crispy then you make it 40 minutes oh okay it looks really good and the presentation is kind of nice too yeah good and this was i think the first recipe that my one of my daughters made and she even wrote it down and i think till today she still makes it so your family will eat this yes yeah sort of like an apple pie but it's different hints of different flavors so a lot of times when i'm lazy to make apple pie i'd rather do this because the apple pie you have to make the crust and all so this one you just throw everything together it's good for a party too", "vwZEWXpa8ag": "what's
