{"2SdBEMvqovs": "so am i DIY pedicure video you guys gave a strong message that you definitely wanted a DIY sugar video so today I'm gonna show you how I make my paste at home of course the first thing that you need is sugar I'm using 1/2 a cup and then I'm using roughly 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and two tablespoons of water which is going to give us a quarter cup of liquid you can also double this recipe if you want to make a larger batch but I just prefer to keep it small because it's more manageable for the next step some recipes that you may have come across will include things like salt and vinegar I'll tell you right now that is completely unnecessary so throw all of that into a pot and combine it and then we're going to take this to the stove and now is where we get to the really important part so pay attention rule number one although you want high heat you don't want to put your burner on the highest setting so make sure that you turn it down to medium high because you do not want this paste to burn so after a few seconds you're gonna notice that your syrup is starting to bubble I use a whisk but feel free to use a spoon as well doesn't matter just keep your mixture moving because as long as it's moving it's not burning and you'll notice that my serum goes from a really light yellow color to a slightly darker color and the minute it starts to golden take it off the stove don't cut the heat off physically remove it from the range because it will turn on you in a second and as you can see there is a lot of foaming so if you're not quite sure what's going on underneath feel free to turn your heat down it does not have to stay on high so immediately off the stove you'll see that you have a true simple syrup so the mixture is quite thin and still runny however you are going to let this rest and also feel free to continue to stir it because they're going to cool it off and as it cools off you'll see that it starts to thicken basically what I'm looking for is a consistency that when I start to spoon it it'll hold its shape a little bit before it starts to melt back into itself that's when I know that it's ready to need so if you've ever attempted this recipe before but you couldn't use it because your wax would always get really hard you'll want to try this method and knead it before you store it so you'll notice that I am throwing the ball back and forth between my hands the reason I'm doing that is because it is really hot it is very easy to burn yourself at the stage so keep the mixture moving because again if it doesn't sit on your fingers and long enough to you know generate a lot of heat it won't burn you and also I forgot to mention the water I'm periodically dipping my hands into it just to coat my fingers a little bit to keep the sugar from sticking to my skin so whenever your sugar starts getting too clingy just use a very little bit of water on your hands and you'll know that you are done kneading the sugar once the color starts to go opaque so it's gone from a very translucent amber to a much more solid color and so I just rolled it into a ball and I set it aside until I'm ready to store it and I'm gonna show you guys how I do that but it's a good idea to clean up now so just dump some water into your pot and that will keep it from hardening but even if it does harden don't worry you can always pour water into it at any point so for storage I'm actually taking an old container from lush and put just a single drop of oil in it doesn't matter what kind of oil you just want to grease it to make sure that your sugar does not stick this just ensures that I can use literally every last drop of the sugar I'd never have any left over because it comes away from the jar so easily when I do this just the small amount is gonna be enough to do my entire arm which has quite fine hair naturally but the hair is even finer because I sugar regularly so I'm putting some mascara so hopefully you guys can see I do actually have hair on my arm so as you saw in my pedicure video you do want to start off by powdering the skin just gonna use actually arrowroot powder which I just grabbed out of my kitchen which is going to ensure that your skin is dry and free from sweat so make sure that you keep it nearby because you might need it later this is another very important step we are going to now mold the pace into the hair for me my hair grows on a diagonal so when applying the sugar you want to go in the opposite direction of your hair growth so I am gonna mold twice and then when I'm ready to pull then I'm going to flick because you're going in the opposite direction when you're applying the sugar when you go to pull the sugar off you're taking the hair out in the direction of your hair growth therefore when the hair starts to grow back in because it wasn't pulled out at a weird angle it's growing in the with naturally therefore lessening the probability that you get an ingrown hair and if you noticed that when you go to mold this happens that means that there's moisture on your skin so make sure that you reap out her so you're going to continue this motion throughout whatever body part that you're working on and at some point you're gonna notice that your sugar is starting to turn colors as you can see mines are starting to go like white or a light yellow color that is because it is also exfoliating your skin so it's picking up dead skin cells along with the hair which is why sugaring makes your skin so ridiculously soft and at some point you'll also notice that your mixture is getting really gooey and a little bit sticky this is because either the room that you're working in or your body heat is warming up the pace even further and so it's getting really melty at this point it may be hard to remove it as well so if you ever get stuck just spread it as thin as I can with my finger or you can also use a spatula take a wax strip this one is a cloth one so it's reusable and I'm showing you the strip because now hopefully you guys can see that there is actually hair in the wax if you don't actually have wax strips then don't worry you can just use cotton this is some muslin that I have on hand it's actually the fabric that I used in the DIY drawstring bag video reusable strips are perfect because all you have to do is set them into warm water and the sugar will just dissolve this is what happens after your cloth has been soaking as you can see this is all of the dead skin that I was talking about including the hair once you're done waxing your body all you have to do for cleanup is just wipe down with some water and for aftercare I like to use fresh aloe so I'll just cut off a piece remove the thorn and peel it open and then I just massage the gel into the area that I just treated and then I will also put on an oil and I actually want to give you guys a few more tips so that you know what to do if you run into any of these scenarios so this is actually the wax that I used in the DIY pedicure video but it's very firm which means I can't remove it by hand so what I'm gonna do is just microwave it for 10 seconds so obviously it's a lot runny Urso in that I'm using it as a piece I'm gonna take it onto a popsicle stick and you can just spread it on like you would a regular wax however it's obviously not as thin but now you can just flick it off instead of relying on your fingers and you can continue to wax your body with the stick or you can take it off and use it like a regular paste or after microwaving it you can just let it cool slightly scoop it out and then use it at a slightly warmer temperature than I did the first time so here you can see that I can mold it a little bit faster and a little bit easier because the sugar is hotter however do keep in mind that you can feel the temperature on your skin a little bit and just in case if you guys are curious lately I've been using this a cure oil of dry wax because as you can see it's called seriously soothing because it has blue tanzy oil in it and my arms do get pretty red because I'm not able to hold the skin top so my last and final tip and it's also a really important one is when you are doing any type of hair removal especially sugaring you do want to make sure that you're exfoliating the skin regularly so I give myself a couple of days and then I start dry brushing you can also just use a sugar scrub or salt scrub just make sure that you are treating the area because as your hair grows out make sure that it doesn't get trapped under a layer of dead skin and eventually develop into an ingrown hair hope I covered everything but if you do have any questions feel free to leave them in the comments I also wanted to let you guys know that I do have a DIY channel so if you like this video then you might want to go subscribe over there because I'm going to be migrating mine on there are related videos to my DIY channel so I

literally feels solar to be shown on camera yes yes oh look at the difference hey guys what's up what I do welcome back to my channel or welcome if you're new my name is Casey and if you are new take a second go down below hit that subscribe button and click that little build button so you don't miss when I post a new video so honestly this is a very impromptu video because I okay let me tell y'all the whole story if you follow me on instagram then you already know I was trying to create my own sugar wax at home to do myself because I'm just getting a little bit furry and I'm getting tired of it don't look like my wax place is gonna be opening anytime soon so I took the initiative I watched some tutorials on YouTube tried to make it myself I'm and input some footage here so you guys can see how badly I failed so I had pretty much followed the tutorial to a tee like I use the right amount of sugar I used the right amount of lemon juice and water I put it in the pot I mix it up I place it on the stove the whole thing and I literally burnt it like I burnt it so bad so what I ended up doing was redoing the entire thing in a different pot and it actually came out pretty okay the second time but the consistency was still off temperature was so off I didn't have a thermometer at the time to like track the temperature to make sure it was the right temperature I was just kind of going by the consistency and the color but it was just off and I even needed it the way that she recommended to in the video and I literally couldn't get it to stick to my skin I have no idea why but it wasn't sticking to me and at this time I didn't have powder yet which I really should have had in order to do this the right way but I didn't have baby powder so I was just doing it directly onto my skin I was kind of sweating I was getting high I was getting nervous it was just a mess and so since it wasn't sticking to me I had saw another tutorial that you could add more water to pass to get it to stick but I added too much water as you can see and it was just a gooey mess so it was like literally hurting to get off so I just rinsed it off and I gave up I didn't have the patience to try again and so I contacted my sugar waxer and she pretty much just said that the ones that they saw on Amazon are good options but she doesn't recommend them just because even though they say they're all-natural sometimes they do have other preservatives in them but she recommended this one to me this is the sugaring kit by sugaring NYC sugaring NYC is a very very popular sugaring place in New York they actually had a location here in Miami but I don't know what happened I think they got it shut down or something but what did this kit from Amazon literally like two days ago and Amazon you know how it gives you like the estimated day that it's gonna ship instead of wasn't gonna get to me into like May 20th so I didn't think that I was gonna have this video ready anytime soon but it popped up at my door so I'm gonna try it today I'm super pumped so this is what's inside the kit it's actually really cute so this is the jar of sugar it says that you actually don't have to heat this paste up but if you plan on doing it on more course areas like your underarms or your legs or your bikini area they suggest warming it up for just 15 seconds in the microwave which is way easier than the oven or the stovetop so I'm gonna go ahead and warm this up for about 15 seconds and I'll come back okay so it's definitely warmed up now I don't want meet up too much so it's still kind of run temperature which is good you don't want it to be too hot inside the kit it also has two applicator thingies these I'm actually really glad that this came with because when I was trying to do the sugaring on my own with my hand it just wasn't working so these should be very handy and then it also comes with some gloves comes with two pairs of these cute little pink gloves so the instructions states to follow the instructions that are on their YouTube page so that's what I'm gonna be following let me tell y'all if this works I don't think I'm gonna pay so I have myself wax well okay I'm lying I think what I'm gonna do is do the easy parts myself and then just pay for like my bikini or like my Brazilian cuz that I'm never gonna do on my own it's just never gonna happen okay so I'll watch the tutorial there's a few things that she didn't do that I'm gonna do just for safety percussions so my sugar waxer always takes a little bit of alcohol or she takes like a toner or something and just wipes the area so that the area becomes clean and it's not wet I have this mirror here by the way just so I can make sure I can properly see myself so I'm just gonna take a little bit of this alcohol I'm gonna put it on this little cotton swab you want to put too much do you want to dry your skin out okay I'm just gonna clean it I do have deodorant on so definitely want to get that off my hair is actually pretty thin which is why I enjoy sugaring on a regular because my hair goes back so thin this is literally two and a half months of growth you know how thick my underarms air my underarms airs my underarm hairs would be if I wasn't sugaring at this point so next this is also optional but my sugar wax are also always powders the area that she's gonna be doing also to make sure that it's not wet because if you try to wax or sugar an area that's what it's gonna like tug on the hair and it hurts so just to get rid of any wetness I'm gonna use this powder it's just a regular baby powder I'm literally gonna put some on my little glove and I'm gonna pet it we're gonna do one arm at a time I put so much why do I put so much all right I'm gonna scoop a really decent amount on here not too much so like this much can you see that and it's so sticky so I'm just gonna Oh so you might have to press it oh wow I feel like I want it up a little too much cuz it's a little too gooey so just yeah I can see I got like some of the hair off a little too gooey like I can't get it to come off I'm gonna take a little bit more of the sugar it says if you have trouble you can just take more of the sugar I'm gonna try to go a little bit deeper so it's in the area where the sugars are not is warmed and hopefully that will help me get it off I don't really know how clear that says for you guys but you just have to snatch it really hard my arm hurt so I just went ahead and rinse my arm cuz I couldn't get it off and like I have patches but most of the hair came off the good thing about sugaring is that it doesn't really irritate your skin by the amount of times that you put it on whereas regular waxing it can irritate the skin if you do it too often even with me rubbing alcohol on it after just waxing it it doesn't hurt I actually wouldn't recommend that but taking my powder not as much this time okay so I'm gonna try one more time on this arm and we're gonna go to the other arm I'm actually also going to try to do a smaller section this time because I try to do my whole arm at the same time and that's just not smart I'm gonna start at the top aha I got it this time yo yo I got it I got it oh the LCL is coming off this time it came off completely this time I got it this time y'all it came off try and make sure all the hair oh I did it yes yes yes yes okay I'm gonna go a little bit higher so that's the key you got to do smaller sections I'm sorry y'all can't see this I'm trying to focus yes yo I'm so happy okay so I just rinsed off the excess and look guys it literally came out so good my Shiva waxer usually always puts aloe vera gel on me but I don't have any so I'm just gonna use this after Sun body jelly by Shea Moisture it's pretty much made for when you're in the Sun and your skin gets dry or it's irritated so this is also really good for this as well it's just gonna help smooth my skin call feels so good it's so cooling oh it feels really good it feels like I have like a cooling sensation oh my god I'm so happy excuse this cut I got this cut when I was moving like last year I had a box-like swipe me and the mark has been there ever since people keep asking me if it's a birth control and I'm like no ha oh my gosh but yeah I'm super satisfied I'm gonna get ready to do the other arm okay y'all I'm frickin tired oh and all I can definitely say this sugar piece is very easy to use you just have to come and get the hang of it I'm probably going to continue doing my own underarms because it's a very easy part of my body to do but like my Brazilian and my bikini i'ma leave that for my sugar waxer I also might try to be my stomach but yeah it can be used without being heated up so you'll have to worry about trying to burn yourself I actually found it better when it cooled down versus when I put it in the microwave right away it was too gooey the texture that it is is room temperature is fine it definitely does like I said take a little while to get the hang of the technique but it's once you get it you get it it comes off the hair comes off and your Gucci your Gucci look at this I'm obsessed and sugaring definitely has helped my hair to grow in thinner so it made it hurt not as bad now if you're shivering on hair that has never been waxed or hair that it's not thin oh no and I feel a little Borden if a little bit more difficult though overall like it worked so well for me my frickin applicators are stuck to this towel right now but I would definitely say that applicators also help it's a lot easier to do than using your hand which is like the traditional sugaring technique but like if you're not professional or you know if you just want to make it a little easier on yourself definitely recommend these and also I recommend having some wax strips readily available because if the sugar starts to get stuck you might be able to just take a wax strip and put it on top and rip it instead of constantly trying to use the applicator I feel like if I had some wax strips it wouldn't make the process a little bit easier but yeah I will make sure that my Amazon store is linked down below I will make um a section on my Amazon store called sugar wax you cannot so you guys can find all the products that I use for this video don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and hopefully I'll see you guys all in the next one [Music]", "BsIiz6OBecw": "hi everyone I'm Andrea I'm here to answer your most frequently asked questions about how to use our sugar paste at home the fastest and most efficient way to warm up the sugar paste is in a microwave but if one isn't available to you you could always use a wax warmer another method would be to get a bowl of warm water noting boiling but definitely warm you submerge the jar to about here you do not want to get water inside the jar but let it sit for about 5 to 6 minutes test the sugar if it's ready to go you're good to go if not you want to drain some water out and put new hot water in until it gets the consistency that you need if you selected our hard sugar pace then you're going to be doing the traditional flick method for this method we recommend 90 to 100 seconds in the microwave which is a minute 30 to a minute 40 seconds but remember when there's less sugar in the jar you're going to be using less time when the sugar is ready you want to always make sure to grab the jar to hold to test to see how hot it is you never want to burn yourself keep in mind when using the hard paste it doesn't warm up evenly so you can actually feel when you take it out of the microwave that it is warmer on the bottom so when you take it out you want to take your hand very slowly and push it into the sugar and mix it around reaching down towards the middle to get the warmer sugar to mix into the top layer then you're going to take the sugar you're going to push down on the skin you want to hold it down for about 2 to 3 seconds to make sure that it connects to the skin then drag up again for about a count of 2 or 3 1 2 3 flick and you can continue doing this until all the hair is gone remember when you flick always flick parallel to the skin and never up because that would cause breakage again pushing down on the skin 1 2 3 flick now as you get more proficient you can do longer drags but in the beginning please stick to about 2 to 3 seconds maybe this much space like that so that would be the finger method for larger areas you'd want to use about four fingers connect it to your skin for about three to four seconds to make sure that it catches on then you're going to move it up for about the count of three and then flick off like this one two three again you're going to be taking the sugar connecting it to the skin for about three to four seconds then you're going to move up to the count of three and flick forward one two three flick if you find for some reason that it's not connecting or that it's not getting the hair then maybe you need to warm it up for a few more seconds because with the hard if it's not warm enough it will not connect very well when sugaring at home and you're a beginner there are usually two common problems one is the sugar is too gooey and you're having trouble picking it up and the second problem is the sugar does not stick to the skin and no hair is coming up to address the first problem you probably warm the sugar up too much you want to set it aside and let it cool down to the consistency it was before you warmed it up the next time you go to warm it up use less time in whichever method that you used to get it to the right consistency the other issue might be you might be grabbing too much sugar or making your strip too long so please use less sugar and make sure that your strips are smaller also to make sure you don't get stuck you always want to make sure that you're flicking the sugar parallel to the skin and not up this will help ensure success the second issue to address is that the sugar paste is not sticking to your skin and it's not getting the hair up this means you did not warm your sugar up enough so what you want to do is put it back in the microwave or whatever method you use for a few more seconds and this way you can get to the consistency that's right when you apply it to the skin you want to hold it down so that it connects to your skin for about two to three seconds then when you go to do your small strip and flick off you should see the hair come up and it will guarantees yes thank you so much for choosing sugaring NYC if you have any other problems or any other issues that you need to address you can always reach us on Instagram or Facebook leave us

"now i don't know about you guys but i'm almost two months in quarantine cancelled two trips and wondering what life is going to be like when all this is over but suddenly i looked at my legs and was like damn girl get it together so that resonates with you grab your natural ingredients and let's get started [Music] hey guys and welcome back to my channel welcome back to another video my name is alia if you're new here in today's video we're doing a diy wax so first we're going to start off with two cups of white sugar and then we're going to get into this little tick tock hack guys i just learned that if you poke a hole in the heart of the lemon it's actually easier for you to squeeze out the lemon juice how easy this is um besides that honestly you guys can just buy yourselves a lemon juice as well as one quarter of water now you're going to want to mix this all the way through so thoroughly making sure that it doesn't burn but you want to make sure that it's also on medium heat when you start mixing it just sort of looks something like this again making sure that it's on medium heat and you're not skipping a step now what you're actually adding is really important you don't want to add too much sugar you want to make sure that all your measurements are correct or you're going to have to do this again now as you start mixing you're going to realize that it's going to start to bubble up and froth continue to mix as well as check the color now in order for you to do that you might need to actually lift the pot up off of the stove check the color see if it's the color that you want and then put it back if it's not most of the times this is a step that's really important and a lot of times people see the color and think it's time to take it off but then they end up actually under doing the mixture and the wax becomes too liquidy so this is the consistency in the color that you want it to look like this should honestly take maybe about like eight minutes it really really depends on your stove now as you guys can see i decided to take it off the stove and this is pretty much what it's looking like so i'm going to begin to let this cool and the cooling period should take about 20 minutes as you guys can see in this next clip um this is sort of how i want it to be sort of runny but as well as being able to hold itself now you're probably wondering what are you doing with this water yes i am kneading but i decide to do a different technique when i'm kneading i think this is easier for me as well as it prevents me from burning my skin so i start off with a little tester and i put a little bit of the wax into this water to cool it down so now that i know that it's pretty much exactly what i want it to be like i then begin to to put the wax into the bowl now of course i know that i should have gone a different bowl a bigger bowl specifically um but this way i'm able to actually cool down the wax and i'm able to firm it into a ball and not burn myself this technique works for me it might work for you i just find that the wax sometimes is a little bit too hot for me so try this out and let me know down in the comments if this was easier for you [Music] that i firmed it into a ball i pretty much wanted to show you guys what it should look like it should have this golden rich shiny color and from here i'm going to get my baby powder which i got from the dollar store and i'm going to apply it onto my legs because like i said this is what i need to wax so i want to show you guys pretty much how i wax my legs there's nothing fancy to it honestly this is the fourth time that i made this and i'm not a pro but you're gonna actually tend to see that it becomes a little bit sticky on your skin and it might even change in color that is because it it's picking up all the dead skin cells as well as the baby powder so this is probably when you might want to just put it aside and just get yourself a fresh new wax and continue waxing now i also wanted to demonstrate on my arm using a popsicle stick this method is actually easier for some people um it's easier because you don't have to get so messy you don't have to get anything on your hands but i also want to show you guys pretty much how i wax my arm now when it comes to storage i normally make enough for one-time use but if i do have some left over i normally would put it into a jar like this and if i want to use it i would warm it up and pretty much it becomes that same consistency that you guys seen earlier where again so if you have any questions make sure to comment down below and thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys in the next video [Music] you", "V6JagJvAiZA": "[Music] hey guys what's up welcome back to a channel or welcome to my channel if you guys are brand new here hi my name is crystal is very nice to meet you and if you are a returning subscriber thank you so much for coming back I love you so very much let's go and get right into this video so today's video I am going to be sugar waxing I have never wax at all cuz we like never waxed I've only ever shaved and even when I shave the next day hair starts going back so I was like okay I'm gonna try doing this myself look up some videos and I found a sugar kick that looks like it works I also wanted to try a less painful route though I heard mixed reviews I was so convinced for the longest time that this was like shameless but some people say that this hurts more than waxing my underarm areas have always been a big insecurity of mine so I trust you guys enough to show you guys of my underarm area yeah I'm so freakin nervous my heart is beating like a million miles per hour at night so first of all this is the sugar kick that I am going to be using it is by sugaring NYC which actually in the video that I watched I will link the video that I watched down below where I found out about this and I guess this is an actual sugary company so that's why she trusted it and that's why I'm just eating is so nervous the ingredients that this consist of is water and sugar and lemon and you can actually make your own sugar wax at home there are plenty of videos that will show you how to do that but I didn't want to do that because I know a lot of the people that were doing it we're having some troubles where it was like dry really bad like I've never done it before so I don't know for the first time I just wanted to get something that was already made so that's why I picked this up it comes with to those that are nervous I'm moving really like shaky comes with two little spatulas which I will use to leg rip the lats off four pairs of gloves the actual sugar backs right here so it's a hundred percent natural sugar paste is water-soluble for easy cleanup leads to finer and less frequent hair growth which if that happens I will do this more often hurts less than waxing which means less irritation and redness no heating no strips so you don't really have to heat this up immediately and it really has no instructions so the one time I actually want instructions it doesn't have any so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna clean off my armpit this this is so weird to me but okay this is my creme fit I'm just going to clean it up got it never thought I was gonna do news but whatever you know what we're all human it's all look different so I'm just removing any different that I may have from today so I believe this is like a week or two of hair growth we can have me so that's what it looks like I also have darker armpits so that's why it kind of looks a little dark is not that mature but I guess I look at clothes just really want to see also that's stretch marks they have lost weight so that's totally normal but that is what my armpit area looks like I'll show you what it looks like before in here this is 50% rubbing alcohol so she just takes some of this and then she rubs it on the area just to dry out and also clean the area this is what her sugar waxing lady does so so she has a sugar whack Somebody I've never had a sugar weapon lady so I'm just going to follow what he says so next I'm going to be taking some powder this is just the gold bond body powder with aloe and chamomile so she said her sugar and lady takes some powder to dry that smells really good to dry off the powder we know I'm sorry to try out the armpit area yes if it is moist sugar won't attach itself to this okay so I'm putting on my very yoga loves by the way totally stand the fact that these are pink make civil situation so much better like I love this this is a look okay let's get into okay so she scoops it up so I'm just gonna go in and it's actually very hard wise okay I may need to warm this up I will be right back so warm this up in 15 seconds but it literally feels I'm gonna do much I'm just gonna take a blob of it I really don't know am I gonna make it such a mess again I don't know how much I'm supposed to take so I'm just gonna take this munch this is so messy oh no no no no no no there's gonna go straight for it oh god this is a mess oh my god are you though so it says you have to go against the hair growth I don't know I can't see my fat Devils I don't know why my dear group but I think she god I should have wants us with you better give me a second okay so times go ten go dude so she goes straight down oh my god there's number one back there's no more going back there's no more my back oh my god it already aired it already aired okay she just pulls if she just pulls it the way that didn't hear that oh holy I don't know what's happening this is so messy oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god that hurts did I get any hair I got a couple cop oh that is so messy Oh God oh Wow that's not doing anything oh that's not doing anything why did that not work you I mean they got a couple of hairs I hope you guys see that that's it oh ah okay that got more hair oh my god actually there it doesn't hurt that bad like it's very minimal oh it's not grabbing all of my hair though I may have warmed up too much yes so I'm gonna do what she did and grab some from the inside okay this is very messy so be forewarned I look at that angularly like stringing sugar wax everywhere okay god oh god oh god okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay it kind of hurts when you like put it on okay we just got to do it ah I don't know why you'd jump up every time is that blood isn't a blood please tell me that's not blood I walk right that is blood oh I don't know why I feel like I have to go up oh you can see me here you do a lot yeah okay oh okay there's a lot more hair coming up I don't know if you guys could see that if it focuses or not there's also some redhead on there I don't know if that's blood heads blood this is this is very dangerous is it normal to bleed so it did get rid of hair that's for sure but it's not getting rid of all of my hair this actually doesn't hurt anymore whoo I still made such a mess by the way this actually doesn't hurt at all anymore but it is really hot in here so I'm starting to sweat my armpits actually look very nice okay I'm actually kind of a fan of this I'm a fan actually what this actually does not hurt at all anymore it's actually locate a little satisfying not but I'm a fan of waxing you know oh not a fan of the sugar that fell on the floor though okay so there's some small pieces in here that aren't coming out let me get close-up did I see that like most of my hair is gone my armpits the little red this is gross we're so close we're like besties at this point goes if you haven't subscribed already subscribe like we're pretty damn close don't leave me hanging so we're going to do this sighs now again I'm just taking the ball I feel like a professional now so I can go around I'm like let's go baby let's go watch me cry oh I think the initial part of it hurts okay okay I don't think I'm a professional anymore right that hurts so bad oh my god I think that's the problem is when it's like too gooey it hurt [Music] okay this is GUI GUI like I don't uh ha ha Oh Frank why is it so good we it's like a screen to my hair and it's not only the hair out that's why yeah it's like it's not doing anything I think it's too hot in here so we're gonna go ahead and open this door real quick then that we are messing everything up so that some get some airflow in here but look at that it's pretty clean moon ok so at this point we're just very messy I put water on my shirt so I could get rid of the stickiness water dissolves this thing like right away and now we are going to be moving on to my legs so this is what my leg here looks like the hair isn't like super course a baby powder soon enough it's true all-night leg here I do not like how messy this is it kind of stresses me out people said that the leg area hurts more but does not okay so I was about to give up because my hair did not come out so as you can see right here it didn't hurt or anything but it just got a little red but my hair did not completely come off and honestly that's for several reasons one I just I think I don't have this thing down so I want to try again one more time I've learned that if you just scoop it and you just keep going like this so that the sugar wraps around itself just gonna go for it it doesn't feel hot or anything so I think I'm very messy I'm going to go and hop in the shower the sugar wax well it does work it's so like time consuming and a repetitive motion there isn't technique to this so I would leave this to the professionals for like the leg area the armpit area I feel like is very beginner home friendly it did get rid of most of my hair like I said there's just the little tiny hairs that did not want to come off it was a little stressful it didn't hurt pain level on a scale of one to ten I would say pain level is a board like you literally like it's not painful to the point where you can't handle it the pain is just temporary it's not permanent you know like it's just like when you rip off a band-aid and it hurts like right in that second and then it just goes away at least now I know what sugar waxing this like and maybe I would sugar wax again I honestly honestly honestly I would sugar wax again but I would go see a professional just because it's too messy for me I don't want to deal with this I don't like to clean up part of it but it's pretty much it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it even though it was kind of a fail but also not really much of a fail but kind of a fail it was still fun so give this video a big ol like don't forget to go down and subscribe and turn on those post notifications so that you will get notified whenever I post a new video but with that being said guys I will see you all later face [Music] [Music]", "dyzdRln46dI": "moon is a sugar based hair removal the main group a lemon and Kenema and tea tree so the wax actually comes in a glass jar there are two ways to warm it up you can either put it in the microwave oven for about 10 seconds or you can just put it on the stove with cold water and just gently warm up the water and you have your 100% cotton cloth very easy to wash just under warm water and it just knocks away because it is only sugar and I last for years many many years if you do have fun any creams or oils on the skin just rinse off and make sure you just don't get any residue off the skin what you do is just pop the spatula into the pot just white one side of it so you've only got the wax on one side and then you can just pop onto the skin and just do a fine layer then I've got my cotton cloth onto the skin and you just press wick the hair growth not too many times because there is a sugar you don't want it to seep through the cotton cloth you hold the skin down and you pull it away from the head like that just put a bit of pressure on the spatula so that you get a thin application you can use the same cloth and it's just so easy just to do it at home you know in your own comfort knowing that it's all chemical free it's a great way to start if you're starting to do a hair removal and you know you want to go along the lines of being a hundred percent natural you", "Ydd0QH1BIl8": "hi everyone I'm Andrea I'm here to answer your most frequently asked questions about how to use our sugar paste at home the fastest and most efficient way to warm up the sugar paste is in a microwave but if one isn't available to you you could always use a wax warmer another method would be to get a bowl of warm water nothing boiling but definitely warm you submerge the jar to about here you do not want to get water inside the jar but let it sit for about 5 to 6 minutes test the sugar if it's ready to go you're good to go if not you want to drain some water out and put new hot water in until it gets the consistency that you need today we're going to be using the sugaring NYC sugar paste kit let's unbox and see what's inside inside you will find four gloves two applicator cards and a jar of the sugary NYC medium hard mix which is universal for all hair types and body parts for the sugar paste kit we recommend warming up in a microwave about 10 to 15 seconds now remember as you use the jar and you have less and less sugar in it you are going to be using less and less time you don't want it to be so hot that you burn yourself and if you use the same time as the full jar when it's half or less it's going to get way too hot so you're going to put it in the microwave now that it's ready we're going to test the job and make sure it's not too hot and then there you go this sugar is ready to go to use our sugar paste kit you're going to use one of two methods you're either going to use a glove using two or four fingers depending on how big the area is or you're going to be using one of the applicator cards so for the glove method we're going to be taking our glove you're going to put two fingers in grab up the sugar wrap it around your fingers then you're going to take the sugar you're going to push down on the skin you want to hold it down for about two to three seconds to make sure that it connects to the skin then drag up again for about a count of two or three one two three flick and you can continue doing this until all the hair is gone remember when you flick always flick parallel to the skin and never up because that would cause breakage again pushing down on the skin one two three flick now as you get more proficient you can do longer drags but in the beginning please stick to about two to three seconds maybe this much space like that so that would be the finger method for larger areas you'd want to use about four fingers connect it to your skin for about three to four seconds to make sure that it catches on then you're going to move it up for about the count of three and then flick off like this one two three again you're going to be taking the sugar connecting it to the skin for about three to four seconds then you're going to move up to the count of three and flick forward one two three flick the other method is the applicator method for this you're going to be taking the applicator card putting the sugar on it once the sugar is on the applicator card you're going to go to the skin and uphold down for about two to three seconds remember you're always going against the growth of skin of hair hold it down move at one to two seconds and then flick off again you're going to make sure that you put the sugar down hold it for two to three seconds then slide up one two and flick off remember when flicking always go parallel to the skin and never up because that would cause breakage hold down smooth and flick hold down smooth and flick it's that easy and you can use this everywhere on the body when using this method one thing you want to be sure of is you don't want to make your strip way too long it's easier to use little shorter strips but hold down make sure that you're connecting it to the skin if you see the hair isn't coming up hold it down a little bit longer pushing into the skin to make sure it's really connecting once you feel more proficient and you're not getting stuck you can then graduate to doing longer strips but in the beginning please keep it to short strips because this is the way that you'll ensure better success the great thing about our sugar is it's water-soluble so these cards are completely reusable when you're ready to go get a new thing of sugar because it gets too runny or too hard because you've been using it so much all you have to do is go to the sink wash it off and the card is completely clean and ready to go back into your jar to grab your new piece when sugaring at home and you're a beginner there are usually two common problems one is the sugar is too gooey and you're having trouble picking it up and the second problem is the sugar does not stick to the skin and no hair is coming up to address the first problem you probably warmed the sugar up too much you want to set it aside and let it cool down to the consistency it was before you warmed it up the next time you go to warm it up use less time in whichever method that you used to get it to the right consistency the other issue might be you might be grabbing too much sugar or making your strip too long so please use less sugar and make sure that your strips are smaller also to make sure you don't get stuck you always want to make sure that you're flicking the sugar parallel to the skin and not up this will help ensure success the second issue to address is that the sugar paste is not sticking to your skin and it's not getting the hair up this means you did not warm your sugar up enough so what you want to do is put it back in the microwave or whatever method you use for a few more seconds and this way you can get to the consistency that's right when you apply it to the skin you want to hold it down so that it connects to your skin for about two to three seconds then when you go to do your small strip and flick off you should see the hair come up and it will guarantee success thank you so much for choosing sugaring NYC if you have any other problems or any other issues that you need to address you can always reach us on Instagram or Facebook leave us a message and we'll be more than happy to answer and help you out we're here to help you and make sure that you guarantee success with our sugar paste kits and welcome to the family", "yjTF_4J-6QA": "[Music] what is going on YouTube

waxing are who because man hey guys my name is angeline and welcome to my channel so today i'm going to be doing some sugar waxing at home by myself so we're going to see how this goes because i've never done this before i wanted to do diy sugar waxing but that was a fail that was a fail so i had to get my own pre-made thing this is by near snare sugar spa and the story of how i came upon this product is really funny first of all i was scrolling at instagram and i saw an ad for this and first of all if you know me i i hate instagram ads like they torment me they tour meant me because every single thing you type in one word into the google search bar you see 10 instagram ads on it but i digress anyways i saw this and i was like wait like i use nail like their hair removal cream so i was like okay this is going to be great and they have a wax i'm like i trust the company and so like the sugar wax should be good too right so i ordered it and then like six days past and i didn't get like a your shipping label is here type of thing or your tracking number is here i was like excuse me like what's going on so then like six seven days later the same instagram ad pops up on my screen like why can you leave me alone i already purchased it like that's what you wanted you took my money then i see comments and the girl said it's been three months i haven't received mine i said oh what like i know these people didn't scam me and it was like 13 14 for this including like tax and stuff and i think shipping was free then i went to the comments and said and reply to the girl like dang it's been six days i haven't received a thing like i hope these people aren't scamming me then like a couple hours later i guess whoever runs the account said i'll call this number between nine and five and see like what's going on and call them the guy was really nice he was like oh so i think because of corona there's like been some issues with them maybe i'm just giving them benefit of the doubts because i eventually got it like when i called him like the next day he got my tracking number and then i got this within a couple days i was like oh okay maybe it was just something weird because i really i really thought i was about to be scammed because those instagrams as they be scamming people anyways back to the main point so yeah i got this it's the sugar spot and it says 100 naturally derived ingredients and it has only five ingredients and water so and also has no dyes perfumes and parabens and the ingredients are glucose glycerin sucrose citric acid water and rose demacina flower extract so yeah uh that's technically fragrance but like i know my skin is okay when it comes to rose because i use like rose water on my face let's open it i haven't opened it yet actually okay so it comes with a sugar wax it comes with this wooden stick comes with instructions and then it comes with the wax strips let's look at the instructions because i don't know how to use this okay yeah i'm taking you on a journey with me because i have no clue what i'm doing this is really like a beginner like if you're a beginner and i can do it that means you can do it all right so it has different instructions for different parts of the body so like i'm gonna do my armpits and bikini line so it's just for underarms like you can see here it's been a while since i shaved but you know whatever so it says apply in the same like upwards towards the elbow and then rip down and then for bikini line it says go downwards like this motion and then rip upwards here you'll go like that it doesn't say you can wax your face with this but i might try it later okay let me go warm this up okay i only warmed up for 40 seconds like it said it and it looks like it's doing good this is how it looks it said it should be in the consistency of honey and i don't want to spill this you know so this is how it's looking anyways i'm going to start with my armpits and see how that goes this is a wax dress it's kind of large i can divide this into two let me cut it i told myself i was going to repaint my nails before filming this video but i didn't do it so next video i'll have nice nails i promise y'all oh my gosh look this is how it's looking said should be like honey and i think this looks like honey yeah this is a honeybee falling so let me do this on my arm and see how that goes first before i just burn my armpit like can you imagine just a burnt armpit because you feel that waxy okay so like this it'll be like oh this is smooth you'll see that let's move okay so then i'll take this strip then stamp it i don't really have hairy arms though so like i'm doing this for for no reason okay one two okay um it removed some hairs from my arms but this test was really to see if it was like too hot or something it was fine okay this video is going to be all over the place i apologize in advance all right so i did that okay and i put this on and i pulled downwards okay oh oh my god oh and i can't go back now so bro i why did i do this i'm so scared ah i'm so scared rip just rip it fast just rip it fast okay i think they did too big of a section like it should have been a short like this but i do like this whole thing let's just go ow ow okay so i got some but i don't know maybe i waited too long okay so there's still some on there so i'm gonna reapply i'm gonna reply a little bit and then just do the small section like the instructions told me to do like i'm gonna use this like this let's see how that goes okay ouch ow this hurts i don't like that but i think i'm using too much wax i'm going to use this residue like this leftover wax and see what happens ouch i want to see if these are washable like if these are like reusable like if i wash it right now okay so it did wash out so it just needs to dry like so i can use it next time so like that's good we love being environmentally friendly okay so it's much better when you do a smaller like smoother amount of wax and then pull it really fast and also shorter strips i mean to finish this bottom oh my god this is looking good wait this is a good job look i know my armpits are dark so it might not look like it did a good no even my dark armpits look good still okay all right so this is a before and after comparison so this is like nothing done nothing done and this is what oh my goodness what all right let's do armpit too because i'm gonna start with this lower part all right oh god i don't want to do this again i can't what this didn't do anything ouch oh this is really freaking hurting me this is hurting me i sound like a baby but this is hurting me okay i'm gonna use longer strips and see if that helps now i have all these all these strips with like my hair on them all over the place this is the wax strip i hope this is if this is gross to you sorry click out but this is the human body so this is me with my hairy wax strips all right let me do this with a longer shrimp because i was cutting them into thirds for a second all right you got this got it this whole thing is so funny to me because i'm just literally in my apartment by myself just out here waxing my armpits saying out every time i pull a strip like oh my gosh like of course ow what all right let's go okay that was the one that that was the one i like this better than regular wax because like if you have residue like you really have to be peeling it away but this one just wipe it away because it's like sugar it's water soluble so so overall like my impressions of this wax i like it it just my armpits feel sticky i think i need to use like for real water like do this before you shower instead of after like i did because like my armpits are sticky all right so i'm gonna do my bikini line and y'all can watch my reaction i'm not showing you all my bikini line what the heck okay for the bikini line it says apply in the direction of the hair so like if this was your thigh here this is your thigh you wax down and then pull up but it's in the direction of your hair growth so if your hair grows like upwards for some reason then it'd be the opposite way so all right now i'm going to take my strip pray for me guys oh this one was not as bad as the armpit and this one was a better like cleaner job than the armpit actually maybe because it's like a smoother surface because like the armpits like very like bumpy oh if that's the case okay like from doing the bikini line it's actually easier than doing the armpits because like one i think it's easier to pull up from your leg than like pulling like up like from your arm and stuff like the pain was about the same if anything the pain was less for the bikini line balloon i guess i should talk about my overall experience now so one i definitely like this like i'm very glad i purchased this because i will be using it again it's way better than nair because like it's like from the roots like wax so it should last longer because there is pretty much shaving with cream that is pretty smooth but it does leave like a sticky feeling so you're definitely gonna have to like like wash with soap and water after doing this and it is beginner friendly it's like way beginner friendly because like if you mess up you really don't want to go through with it you can put water on your like armpit like when it comes to real wax when you put it on if you make like a mistake it's over for you like there's no way but like let's say i was waxing my eyebrows and i made a mistake and i put too much here like that's it like sorry that eyebrow is gone but if i'm using sugar wax and i really messed up i could use water to dissolve it and like not go through with the wax so yeah overall just to keep it short and sweet i like this a lot i think it's a good product and plus if you're like sensitive because like me i'm sensitive around like my armpits and my bikini line i get ingrown hairs a lot i think this is going to be very worth it because it has just five ingredients it's not like you're putting chemicals there which like i'm very like particular about i don't like putting chemicals here and there and like yeah no so i think it's good for that it does a good job of course it's not like i'm still a beginner so there's still some stray hairs around but it was really good so that's all i really want to say like i'm so excited this is my new wax thing i'm so excited wow okay that's all i have to say i hope this video was helpful if you have any questions for me as always just leave them in the comments because i'd be down there i answered pretty quickly i think so yeah just let me know how you guys like it if you try it or anything or if you did your own diy one from like home and how that went because i tried

also all the information for these products along with measurements of anything mixed will be left down below hey guys so let's go ahead and start with the best vajacial at home ever I'm gonna go in with my dr. Bronner's tea tree soap this is the eighteen and one castile soap and I have been loving these soaps lately I have everybody on them at the moment my parents my friends everybody is loving them so I love this soap it has such a good like slip but it lathers up so nicely without being like super super bubbly and also if you guys don't know tea tree is gonna help you fight bacteria that is a secret that I have to keeping my bikini area clean as well as my face I use this on my face my body I use this this is the only soap that I use I don't use the I don't use anything else I use this I don't mind smelling like tea tree because it keeps me tea tree clean so the next thing we're gonna go in is with the memk2 time soap is like a cleanser it's a cream cleanser and I got this in my Amber Rose box a couple months back and I've been liking this cleanser because it's creamy and I feel like since I do double cleanse I like to use a more abrasive cleanser in the beginning and then I like to come back with a cream cleanser because it's more gentle and it adds moisture back to the skin [Music] so the next thing we're gonna do is whack the area that we are treating so I would highly recommend that you remove your hair whatever method that you use I would recommend that you do that before you start the facial but since I was doing it on my arm and I had hair on my arm I said I'm just gonna go ahead and show them how I do this now i do get professionally waxed but sometimes i will touch up you know in between waxes with my sugar recipe it's so easy like this is literally what I do to my vagina and it takes the hairs off just like the people at the wax place but I'm not that good with it yet so you know it takes me a little while to like get the hair off but for in-between it works perfectly so if you guys don't want to spend the coins at the wax Center you know wherever wax places you guys have in your tone I would definitely do this but I'm gonna tell you right now keep the razor's away like please stop like just do yourself a favor so if you guys have been watching me for a while you'll know that the skin on my body is super EXTREME and it turns red with even like a slight little thump so don't mind that but just go ahead and wipe down the area to remove any of the sugar that was left behind and you're gonna have a nice clean smooth finish look so balm if you guys want me to do an in-depth video on how I touch-up on the wax is definitely that in the comment section down below but for now we're gonna go ahead and move on to the scrub so since this is all natural you guys know that I made this girl because I'm like allergic to everything so I'll be trying not to do the most when it comes to using products on my body I try to keep it natural so this is literally just cane sugar lemon juice and essential oils that I have inside of this jar I keep this in my shower and I use this only I use it on my face my body everywhere so what you're gonna do I'm actually giving you guys a terrible demonstration here because on your vagina you're actually going to only want to go in up and down motions so that it promotes like a good pattern for your hair to go once the hair starts going all wild that's how you get ingrown hair so you want to avoid what I'm doing going in circles but you want to go up and down only or in the direction that your hair grows don't go like all over the place so after you get that nice and exfoliated you're going to go ahead and wipe off or rinse it off of here in the shower I definitely recommend you doing this in the shower so here the next step is steam I like to steam because it opens up the pores and this is the time that I like to take to kind of cater to my ingrown hairs because I do get ingrown hair it's pretty often they're not really bad but I do get them and I like to take them out myself because it's easier for me to do it because whenever somebody else does it it hurts so I like to use two kinds of tweezers for my ingrown hairs I like to use this pointing pair because it's gonna reduce the amount of damage that you'll do to your skin if you're using a clunky pair of tweezers because you will literally only be targeting the one hair the one area where you're working or so you poke the tweezer down in there and you lift the hair out and then you take your other tweezers and you pull it out of the follicle product right here is a secret that they are keeping from y'all this is called skin tight and when I tell y'all it will erase any pimple that you have blemish dark spots anything anywhere this right here is a game changer and it prevents prevents prevents and treats ingrown hair so please if you don't pick up anything get this on to my favorite part the mask so sometimes I like to use the Indian healing clay mask or I like to go in with a message I made y'all know me always making something it is natural it only has lemon juice baking soda turmeric powder and water and this is gonna act as a lightening agent so I like to use this at least once a week because it's gonna help you keep a nice even color around your bikini line it's not it's gonna take away any darkness that you have and it's gonna have you looking like that picture on the thumbnail cyst but just make sure that you make your mask a nice consistency that it's not gonna crack and fall off but you don't want it so watery to where it won't even stay on your arm and you're gonna let that dry I like to let mine sit on for about 15 minutes and mind you guys I do this on the days I'm taking a bath so that it's easy I can sit down I can let it dry and move on to the next step so our last and final step is going to be to moisturize and this is my favorite steps I'm just using my 100% natural shea butter now this shea butter comes straight from West Africa it comes on a huge block my parents buy it from a man named Barack and he has a shop in Oak Cliff Dallas it's inside of the big tea bazaar so if you guys ever in there you can purchase any of his products and I tell you guys they are the bomb.com tell him to indy sent you because i'm his fave like anyways i'm gonna link it down below for you guys in case you want to try it out so if you guys are this far in the video I'm pretty sure that y'all are loving me right now because I just gave you a video that you didn't even know you needed until today so if you guys try this out definitely let me know how it comes out video was helpful for you please give me a thumbs up it helps me out so much don't forget to check out all the products linked down below and I'll see you on the next one bye Oh smooth skin smooth skin [Music] you", "M14twzkv4rk": "[Music] so these are the supplies that you're going to be needing for your DIY wax and you can use any kind of sugar that you'd like I personally like to use white sugar so it's going to be one cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of water as well as a 1/4 cup of lemon and you can use the lemon that already comes squeezed in a bottle you don't have to use fresh lemon by the way make sure you like this video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe so then you're gonna mix all of your ingredients together make sure that everything's kind of combined and we're going to use a medium heat so after you pour it into a medium sized saucepan you want to mix it make sure you mix everything well together this part is really important and it is extremely tedious so you want to check it every I'd say honestly about 45 seconds you don't want your fire to be in too high and you kind of just gonna keep going back and forth checking the consistency and it actually tastes really good at this point if you can find this at Walmart or your local store you will have hit gold if not don't worry there's another way to be able to tell if your wax is ready so now it's getting more into detail talking about the different stages of cooking candy so we got thread stage soft ball firm ball hard ball and um thermometer actually has the little increments of the stages as well and for us right now we're cooking a soft wax so we're gonna go with firm all stage two soft ball stage so if you don't have one of these thermometers or you can find one at the store don't worry if I take a bowl of super cold water about a spoonful of wax and you gonna pour it in there if your wax is able to form a ball once you pick it up then you know your wax is ready so you're gonna want to be able to form a ball and then squish it with your fingers and then be able to form that ball again and then squish it again if your wax just dissolves in the water then it is not ready and you might have to do that test about three more times until it is ready the most important thing is you do not want to let you wax / and your wax should be kind of a honey consistency and a honey color and at this point - the wax is edible and it does taste really good since it's just lemon and sugar so while your wax is kind of cooling you can start forming your strips so you could take any t-shirt cut it up to whatever size chips you want it to be I just like regular cotton t-shirt throw it up over there and the great thing about using the strips is that it is reusable I personally like to use these cloth strips as opposed to just ripping the wax straight off of my skin because I'm I'm a baby and just using the cloth helps me brace myself more it just helps me brace myself more and prepare for the pain even though this is painless so then the next step you're gonna want to do is cleanse the area in which you are waxing you kinda want to remove all the dirt the sweat makeup whatever you got on your skin something that's really important when waxing is using baby powder or this Gold Bond powder this gold bomb powder has like a minty smell to it I kind of like it so you'd need so you absolutely need to put powder on the area you're waxing okay because you need to dry it and make sure it absorbs all of the oils from your skin it's just gonna help the wax to stick on your skin if your wax is folding up and it's not sticking to the skin then that means the area so it's boys shirt and you need to apply more powder so one of the keys to axing is which direction you apply the wax you want it apply the wax against the hair growth so if your hair grows down you want to apply the wax up it's just gonna help the wax get a better grip of the hair and when you rip it off you're gonna rip it downward so this is actually the secret to painless waxing is to pull the strip the way the hair grows [Music] so this is my first time ever sugar waxing and I had attempted to do it last week it was a complete fail so I hope this video helps you enjoy back thing I was so shocked that it was completely painless my knees in my arm yeah I was waiting for it to hurt but it did not so I thought we'd take it to the next level and we do something a little bit more challenging I do want to make sure that your wax stays pretty melty like honey it is okay to put it in the microwave for like ten second increments and you might take it out and mix it again you don't want to let it get too hot in there lose their home and I keep mixing it so the purpose of this video I let my legs grow pretty long okay I didn't shave for good two weeks maybe three [Music] all right so we got a lot here though and I'm really surprised that it did not hurt at all it did not hurt one bit so I'm gonna do a little bit more of my leg and then show you guys I can't get a little messy for sure but that's obviously one hundred percent expected honestly the worst part of waxing is the sound it makes it just like oh alright whatever just a little bit but because that you've got a lot more years out [Music] after you used up a lot of your space from your strips you can just put them in some hot water and wash them and reuse them that is the end of today's video I hope you enjoyed it and found a lot of these tips helpful when I first started waxing sugar waxing I used honey I made a lot a lot of mistakes and I kind of gave up on it because I'm like okay this is just the DIY favor but I tried it again and I would never pay $55 for Brazilian wax again I'll just get a mirror and do it myself it wasn't 100% painful I mean I mean that under visit there's a little bit of pain but nothing compared to when I went and got my wax on professionally so yes make sure you liked this video and I will see you in the next you", "cp0lWnmQZ2c": "[Music] beautiful ten bucks let's do you got abs bro yeah see SPAC eight pack look at the difference this is what we started with and this is all the hair and the dead skin cells being picked up [Music]", "sSHHdV-FTQI": "okay it is on now like there is no going back i'm gonna have to rip this thing off i wonder if you can actually like eat it it's like so it literally tastes like golden syrup oh i don't want to pull it again it's actually really hard hey everyone and welcome back to my channel welcome back to another video as you can see by the title i am gonna be waxing my legs for the very first time so i'm a little bit scared for this video i don't really know how it's gonna go i'm guessing it can go one or two ways who knows we will find out i've never been to a salon and been waxed before i have never tried waxing myself at home so this is literally my very first attempt and you guys are gonna get to see that so make sure you stick around to see that i have been very kindly sense this waxing kit so this is the sugar coated hair removal kit now i am aware that it does say bikini hair removal kit however you can use this on any part of your body whether that be your legs your face your arms your underarms so yeah even though it says bikini um wax kit you can still use this on your legs so if you didn't know sugar coated are an online brand that basically sells vegan sugar wax kits which look like this i will just show you so this is a little box so sugar coated is available to purchase on phil unique which you've obviously all heard of but they do also have their own website um which is www.sugarcoatedhairremoval.com so it's actually on the back of there so i would definitely recommend going onto their website and just checking out all the different wax kits that they sell on there because there are so many to choose from you've got like full body hair removal kits underarm hair removal kits bikini hair removal kits facial hair removal kits leg hair removal kits arm hair removal kits kits i can't even say it now but you name it they have it all so yes go and check their website out so sugar coated is actually 100 natural it's vegan and it's also cruelty free and as far as i know it's actually the only brand or the only waxing brand that is actually cruelty free and vegan so that's amazing all of their things that they are i don't know what you call it i know there's a name for it but all of the little stickers and stuff are all along the side so this brand is so many things it's not just vegan and cruelty free but there are so many things about this brand that are really great for the environment so purchasing this product would really help the environment and the bees so i'll get onto that in a minute so this brand is made in the uk it's made in their own factory in i think it's northamptonshire all of the packaging is recyclable to make it as environmentally friendly as possible and then the wax strips that actually come inside the box are washable and also reusable so that also helps the environment as well on here it does say supporting the bees the bee population is slowly declining due to sort of winter and spring temperatures so the way that sugar-coated support the bees is that they donate all of their excess sugar syrup to beekeepers so when it is too cold outside for the bees to find nectar which produces the honey this sugar wax makes for a great substitute for the nectar which enables them to obviously produce the honey so it is really good that sugar do actually donate whatever is left over to the beekeepers because obviously where would we be without the bees so yeah i just think that is great and even more of a reason to love this brand so i am so excited to try this out and also very nervous because like i said i've never waxed my legs before so i don't know how this is going to go sugar coated is made from pure sugar syrup and water and it doesn't contain any sort of citric acids resin or additives meaning that their formula gives a smooth application and gentle results so as i've said this is the bikini hair removal kit which you can also use on your legs or anywhere else on your body it hasn't just got to be in the bikini area but the only difference with this one is that it has calendula essential oils in it which i think is an essential oil which actually helps to soothe and calm your skin which is probably much needed if you are going to be using this to wax your bikini area anyway i'm just going to get into opening this box now in here you get this little bit of well it's like a little bit of a leaflet i'm guessing this is the instructions which yes it is so you've got little images there which is really helpful if you're anything like me i find looking at pictures a little bit more helpful sometimes than reading a load of instructions it makes it a little bit more easier to understand and then you also get the actual wax strips but you get 15 wax strips and like i've said they are washable and reusable and then you get some little wooden sticks almost like little lollipop sticks and they're just what you would use to apply the wax onto the area that you're going to be waxing and then you also get the wax itself so it comes in a nice little tub like this this looks like it's gonna be very sticky so when you open it up it is like that oh my god is it okay that's definitely smells like something you could eat that smells like some sort of dish like sticky toffee pudding or something like that it just smells so sweet i wonder if you can actually like eat it like can you eat it it's so sticky i don't know whether you can eat this or not would you try oh my god it literally tastes like golden syrup i'm gonna sit here now and i'm gonna just go through the instructions read what i need to do read how i warm this up etc and then i will come back and i will wax my legs because there's no point in me reading out all the instructions to you guys because i don't want to bore you to death with reading out how you use it and stuff like that so yeah i'm gonna go off camera i'm gonna read what i need to do and then i will be back okay so as you can see i am back i have just warmed it up and it's a very nice sort of runny oh god runny consistency i do not want to spill this on me because it's probably going to be very hot right now so i'm just going to ramble on a little bit and wait for it to cool down so anyway right my legs so i've been growing my leg hair for about a week now i probably should have left it to grow a bit longer than a week but i really cannot deal with having like a hairy legs i know for some people it's fine but for me i just i don't know i just don't like the feel of it that is all it is i just don't like the feel of it there is nothing wrong at all with hairy legs if that is what you want then there's nothing wrong with that but anyway i just don't like it on me i don't need to justify that anyway because it's for some people it isn't for some people that is just the way the world works so yeah like i said i've been growing it for about a week um it's not really that long but yeah it's obviously gonna be very hard for me to show you on camera so i will insert pictures of what my legs look like right now so you will just have to excuse what they look like because they are a little bit prickly if you can leave your leg hair to grow for as long as possible and try and get them to a really good length then that is going to be more beneficial in terms of it getting rid of all the hair because it's got more to grip onto i will see how i get on anyway i mean for me there is something for it to grip onto so there is definitely hair there for it to get rid of enough of me rambling that should be cooled down where is the where actually is there so obviously to know what you are doing you will just need to read the instructions but if you're used to waxing then you will know how to do it actually says do a patch test i'm not gonna do a patch test i'm just gonna risk it and hopefully i will be fine in terms of application you apply the wax in the direction of your hair growth so i will be applying it downwards and then when you put this strip on you put it on like that and then you pull it upwards so against the hair growth that is what the instructions say so that is what i'm gonna do so this is what it looks like let's just get a wax strip ready i don't really know how much you're supposed to apply i haven't actually read that properly on the thing uh a thin layer in the direction of the hair growth with a scraping action so applying it downwards so [Music] a thin layer oh god oh my god it feels nice and warm it's so nice [Music] can you see that [Music] rub it like so okay it is on now like there is no going back i'm gonna have to rip this thing off okay oh you can just do that why is it not working what's going on maybe i warmed up too much i'm not really sure why that didn't work i'm just gonna leave that to set because when i just tried pulling it then like it it wasn't getting stuck like i feel like that's not gonna do anything so we will just wait for a few moments a few moments later i don't know what's wrong with it but i've been waiting here for ages i can just pull it off like that so i don't know what i've done wrong you don't know i'm just gonna leave that one on that leg and i'm just i'm gonna move on to this leg so if i spin round this side and do this part and just see if that works so i'll get my wax strip maybe i need to wait for it to be a little less runny or maybe i need to apply less apply downwards and we apply the white strip [Music] i'm hoping that it's just the case of me applying a little bit too much on that leg that's the same i don't know what's happened why is it doing that maybe if i just pull it let's just try and pull it rather than trying to peel it off and see if it will work okay that hurt but it didn't remove anything i don't get it what am i doing wrong why is it not working i thought this was a great idea [Music] okay i'm not even gonna count because it just makes it ten times worse i can't do it [Music] you shouldn't go over the same area either but it genuinely didn't pick up any hair maybe i just haven't grew my leg hair enough okay stop being a baby oh my god i would love to receive my reaction because that really hurt i've still got hair on me but i also have hair on here so it kind of is working but it kind of isn't i don't know if it's just my technique or not but can you see i don't know if it's gonna focus oh my god why will it not focus there can you see all of my hair on there so it has kind of worked that looks funny [Music] god anyway saw but why we still got loads of hair there i've still got this one to pull off now and this was a lot of works [Music] oops oh i don't even know anymore i don't know what i'm doing wrong this is just such a fail of a video now okay i'm gonna try again on this part and we'll just see how i get on so apply downwards [Music] like so so hard to do it and show you guys as well [Music] there oops and then apply wax strips like so i don't want to pull it again it actually really hurts my battery's about to die i'm just going to pull it three two [Music] one [Music] like there's hair on there but there's still hair on my legs unless it's just growing back as soon as i pull it off right i've just done one off camera when i changed my battery over because my battery literally just died and i think i've got the knack of it now my leg started to go really red from where i've done it now like it's really sore and irritated so yeah maybe waxing just isn't good for me maybe i should just stick to shaving but we will see how i get on so i'm applying it downwards just a really thin layer and this stuff is still so warm so obviously it takes a while to cool down but like because this is so sticky as well it really sort of clings to the hairs to sort of pull them out so now i have mustard the technique i think let it work this is probably going to be the last one that i do on camera because it's going to be a long long video if i just record myself doing my entire leg oh my god i really don't want to do it i really don't like this okay so that's all on and then i can't do it [Music] i just need someone to do it for me but you need to remember to leave a little bit there as well to pull you've got something to hold on to just do it just do it just do it oh my god why am i acting like it's just like the worst thing in the world really not okay oh my god okay my face must look so funny okay that is nice and smooth that feels so much better okay so can you even see [Music] it's really not focusing but it there is hair on there i promise look there it is it's all on there so yeah it's working okay for you that is nice and some move but my legs have started to go a little bit red and dotty i don't know if that the camera is picking it up but yeah it's going red and dotty i don't know whether it's the way that i'm doing it whether i'm not doing it properly or not but it has removed the hair and it does feel really nice and smooth on that area there so there's no point in me carrying on and doing the whole thing on camera because that would just be a really long video i've done sort of a majority of this leg i've done all of this area and then i've got all of this leg to do yeah i will carry on off camera and then i will come back and i will show you guys the results okay so i am back my legs are currently burning a little bit um because i had to go over the same area more than once they feel so smooth right now like they are so soft like don't get me wrong there are some areas where there is still a little bit of hair just one where it hasn't picked it up but i can just quickly go over that in the shower later on with a razor but it has got rid of a majority of the hair that was on my legs and you will see that in the before and after picture the only thing is is that my i don't know if it's gonna maybe i need to come a little bit closer you must be able to see that i don't know but my leg has started to go really red and you know like spotty you know when you get like a shaving rash and it the area goes a little bit spotty it's gone a little bit like that i just think my skin is very irritated from the waxing my legs aren't used to being waxed at all because i've never ever waxed them so my legs right now probably thinking sophie what on earth have you done to me but yeah i mean in terms of waxing anyway obviously waxing lasts a lot longer than it does when you shave your legs i'm not quite sure how long waxing lasts for but i think it's a few weeks whereas when you shave your legs they're usually starting to grow back the next day so at least with waxing you haven't got that problem the feel of them right now like they are so smooth and sometimes you can't ever get that smooth feeling with shaving i know it took me a while to try and get the technique to work obviously you see in the first time i applied it and i could just sort of peel it straight off and i just think it needed to cool down a little bit and i think the first time i put a little bit too much on once i got the hang of it it was fine and although it was quite painful when you as soon as you pull it off afterwards it's not so bad they're only burning now because one of the areas i had to go over more than once and i know that when you wax in you should try and avoid going over the same area sort of multiple times but sometimes i suppose you just can't help it if it hasn't picked up enough hair then you need to go over it again so yes but yeah that is it i can now say that i've tried waxing and would i continue waxing i don't know i mean for that little bit of pain i suppose it's worth it because then you haven't got to shave continuously all the time at least you can wait you know a week or so before you have to sort of do it again i mean like i said waxing lasts for a few weeks obviously depending on how quick your hair grows um if it's anything like mine mine grows quite quick but yeah i really enjoyed using this and i would definitely recommend giving this a go if waxing is something that you are into it's just nice quick and easy and obviously lasts for a while as well i didn't actually mention the price of this kit um i know on their website at the moment it is actually on offer so it's normally 11.99 it is now reduced to 9.99 so i don't know how long the offer is on for so there's your chance to pick it up for 10 pounds if you are interested so i will leave their website linked in the description bar down below so you can go and check out this product and all their other products on their website so that is all from me i hope that you enjoyed this video and if you are new here and you've somehow found me through searching for whatever you search for and my videos come

"that thing fine as hell because oh my gosh that's my baby camera line you divine mighty fine wow that was so powerful academy award [Music] hey hello hi so today we are here back and better than ever with a waxing video i obviously am not pro so like is every single hair gone maybe not but you know what we're bare enough okay i can raise my arms and not feel ashamed i feel like a woman my armpits already waxed i'm going to be demonstrating to you guys how i wax them in this video so if that's something you're interested in seeing then like stay tuned bro but if you guys could like comment and subscribe that would be much appreciated just like this video comment down below any questions concerns or anything and then you know hit that bell notification so you get notified every time i upload and also my socials will be linked down below my instagram and my main instagram so without further ado let's get right into this video for anyone who may not know the difference between a sugar wax and a regular wax pretty much a sugar wax is made of all natural ingredients usually so that's why it's better for sensitive skin it's water soluble so it's easier to clean up afterwards it doesn't adhere to life skin cells so it's less painful and honestly it's just my preferred method of waxing whereas regular waxes they contain chemicals it's difficult to clean up afterwards and it's way more painful but it is a much more faster and effective way of removing all of your body hair at the end of the day it really just depends on your own personal preference when it comes to which wax to use in this video i'm going to be using the nair hair removal sugar wax i don't really like this wax because it's really difficult to use and it kind of stains my hands and it's just a mess but i already bought it and it does get the job done for me so i'm just going to use it but i for sure wouldn't recommend this i would honestly try making your own sugar wax at home there are a bunch of recipes online for how to make sugar waxes yourself so i'm going to start by heating up the wax i have an 1100 watt mac microwave microwave if you guys were wondering this is what the wax looks like it comes in this jar with a little stick to stir it and as you can see it's really solid right now because it's not heated up yet so we're going to open up my microwave and plop her in there and heat her up for about 30 seconds that's what i usually heat mine up for and i've noticed 30 seconds was good enough but if i noticed that it's still a bit thick after the 30 seconds then i'll pop her in for like 10 more maybe 15 more seconds you don't want to overheat it though or else it will just be too hot for you to use and you'll know if it's overheated when you see a bunch of bubbles in it so if you do end up accidentally overheating it then just let her sit and cool down for a bit but this is how it looks when i am done heating it up as you can see it's runny but not too runny when i'm waxing i just laid down an amazon box on the floor because let me tell you this thing is red and it will stain if you get it on anything so these are my supplies i have the wax with the little stick some pairs of scissors to cut the wax strips that comes with comes with 15 super long strips which is it's just obnoxiously long so i just take some scissors and i just cut them to a good size especially since when i wax i do it in small sections not just one big section so this is how my armpits are looking they're very hairy this is like a couple weeks pretty much a month of not doing anything to my armpits so i'm going to take some of the wax and do a little test on my arm to make sure that it's not too hot and when you're applying the wax make sure you get a good amount so that you can evenly coat the hairs and when you're applying sugar wax you apply it going against the hair direction so this is where it's kind of different than a regular wax because regular waxes you go in the direction of hair growth so usually you would go downwards but with sugar waxes you go against the hair growth so i'm just coating the wax upwards and then when i get my cloth i'm going to press it into the wax to make sure that it's really gripped into there and the wax is really secured to the wax strip and then when you're ripping it off you go in the direction of hair growth so you'd rip downwards and usually with regular waxes you'd rip upwards and this is how the sheet strip looks i'm going to continue doing this all over my armpit going in small sections smoothing the wax upwards applying the strip and then ripping it off downwards and with this one i applied too much so i had to use an old t-shirt to kind of soak up the excess wax so really be careful with the amount of wax you apply as you can see look that thing is stained and i just use another wax strip to clean up the excess wax that is left on my armpit and then when i'm done waxing this is how it looks as you can see there's still a few strands of hair left however a majority of the hair is gone so compared to how it looked before this is a huge improvement the wax strips are reusable and washable so when i'm done waxing i just wash them off in a sink and as you can see the wax just easily comes off with just water to remove the extra hairs that were left on my armpits i'm going to go in with jamaican black castor oil and a precision eyebrow razor it says eyebrow but you can use it pretty much like anywhere on your body it's just like a regular razor so i'm going to smear the black castor oil all over my pit make sure you put a lot so you can see what you're doing and then i'm going to take the razor and kind of just shave my armpits i'm not a pro at this so i'm most likely doing this wrong and it's kind of hard because you can't really see what you're doing that well and you're trying to pull the skin taut so you don't end up cutting yourself but this is the hairs that are coming off when i'm satisfied with how my armpits look i'm gonna take a wet wipe and just wipe the extra oil off of my pits and this is how it looks compared to the not done side to the wax side as you can see it's a huge difference after i'm done wax my armpits i like to treat it to some tlc so this is the mio clay away body cleanser this is a two in one mask plus cleanser for your body that works to offer a deep purifying experience without leaving your skin feeling stripped of its natural essential oils i like to just plop on my armpits just to help remove all the toxins from the sugar wax we just used because even though sugar waxes are supposed to be natural i'm obviously using a nair candy apple sugar wax so it's not 100 natural so i just want to detox all of the yucky gunk out of my armpits and i just like to leave it on for a little bit and then rinse it away with some water after i'm done rinsing away the clay cleanser i like to go in with the vitamin c clay mask on my armpits just to help brighten them up a bit you know because armpits tend to get a bit dark down there and vitamin c is known to help brighten your skin so i just like to take this clay and use the brush that comes with to smooth it all over my pits after i rinse off the vitamin c mask i like to go in with the mio heavenly body purifying scrub this is a luxurious vegan formula that features exfoliating salt crystals to buff away dead skin cells helping to tackle roughness and dullness and i like to use a scrub on my armpits or whenever i'm waxing like on whatever part of my body because when you use a scrub it really helps to prevent ingrown hairs and i apply it in a downwards motion so that the hairs that grow back in grow in that direction then for the last step i go in with the meal future proof body butter this is a deeply hydrating body butter that helps to banish dryness leaving behind supple conditioned skin this is made with fig extract and monks pepper berry so if you're looking for mega hydration this body butter is super good and i just like to take a little bit on my hands and just massage it into my skin and this is how my armpits look after waxing and caring for them i use this waxing method not just on my armpits but also all over my body and you can use this method with any sugar wax homemade or store-bought so i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please once

next video bye guys you", "zB9hF5SWLIU": "[Music] hey y'all is she kurosaki welcome back to my channel in today's video I'll be showing you how to make DIY sugar wax with three common household ingredients up for this wax you'll need sugar lemon juice and water to get started I placed a medium-sized pan over medium heat I didn't want to make too much wax so I added 1/2 cup of white granulated sugar then I added 1/16 cup of lemon juice and I did realize that the pan was a little bit too hot so I did turn that down I'm just a little bit I then stirred in the lemon juice into the sugar then I proceeded to add one sixteenth cup of water if you'd like to make more wax you can double or triple the ingredients and you will still get the same results once you've added all three ingredients you will turn the burner on medium high heat stir frequently and make sure that you don't burn the mixture if you burn your mixture it will completely solidify once it cools down [Music] [Music] it took about eight minutes for the mixture to become a nice golden-brown color the consistency should remind you of hot maple syrup remove the mixture from the heat and continue to stir for about one minute until it is no longer bubbling [Music] transfer the mixture into a bowl or jar and let it cool for 30 minutes if it's still too hot after 30 minutes let it cool down some more after 30 minutes my wax was absolutely perfect I used a popsicle stick to apply the wax because I'm not too fond of anything sticking on my fingers the best way to wax is to apply a little bit of baby powder to the area that she'll be waxing if you have oily skin the wax will adhere to your hair better once you add the powder [Music] apply the wax in the opposite direction of your hair growth and pull the wax off in the direction that your hair grows [Music] [Music] I'm wiping your skin with a wet paper towel so that you guys can see how nice and smooth her skin is after the wax I thought this video would be helpful to everyone out there who is missing their bi-weekly or monthly waxes most people have these three ingredients at home so you don't have to leave your home to get nice and snatched I hope you guys enjoyed this video please don't forget to Like comment share and subscribe I'll see you in the next video bye", "Ma66mOcaopE": "[Music] so yo what up everyone thank you for stopping by to the thc spot where we review uh thc products today we're bringing you something a little different i've been reviewing concentrates lately but um i wanted to bring something out exclusive today we got the 710 labs flower yeah it comes in this dope ass container look at that blue universe number six that's a blue magoo with miss universe so we're definitely in for a treat comes in this dope dope pack look at that comes with a little note in there as you guys seen the shots and the video the flower looks freaking amazing definitely some of the uh some of the best flower i've seen now there's this thing going on where uh people are wondering why it's testing so low it's testing that 15 total 18. you know what like at the end of the day it doesn't really make a difference this thing looks super exotic and i've heard it still gets you just this medicated you know so living soil flower that's the new stuff well i don't know new stuff for me because i've never tried that so it's a little bit more expensive that's 65 and 8th but i heard it's completely worth it so we're going to go ahead and try it out ourselves smoke a few bows and i'm doing a review in the cart today a little different just so we can enjoy the outdoors get out the house for a little bit that's pretty dope a little thing that came in there a little message that they that they uh provide there i believe it's like a mission statement probably 710 labs always does good so just by the look of it it looks amazing for sure trichomes everywhere the smell is there smells definitely good has the like blackberry kush kind of kind of smell smells good you know nothing exotic about the smell but it smells good i'm not talking down on it the looks definitely look super crazy i hope it smokes just as good as it looks but um yeah i just hope i just hope it's good y'all because 65 and eighth is pretty harsh you know you end up paying like 70 for this but it looks amazing though it definitely looks amazing you got your little cap on there you put the second cap and uh just so you know i do have a fresh pipe so we can get the full flavor and experience and it's been a minute since i since i uh did a flower review so it's a little different sometimes you guys switch it up you know i enjoy the flowers concentrates my thing you know but could never forget about the marijuana plant so yeah got this bowl loaded up hope everybody's having a good day thank you for subscribing if you have not subscribed please hook your boy up do me a favor and just hit that little sub or hit a like

me go ahead and give it another quick rip good inhale tasty exhale um it's pretty good pretty good for some reason it still reminds me that black black blackberry og kind of blackberry og kush flavor along with some like i don't really get an og flavor in there but i definitely get that blackberry for some reason see i don't know what what that blue magoo is you know or miss universe definitely strains i've never heard of to be honest with you but the high is a little different i need i need to see what that living soil is all about trying to see what the difference is it's definitely sticky i'm breaking some up right now and it's definitely on a sticky level a lot of trichomes the high is different though it's definitely a little stronger it has that couch lock effect and now it's just the bow i mean i'm not saying i have the highest tolerance but this is pretty strong for that quick bowl try another little one this stuff is heavy i'm not going to lie it feels like a 30 thc flower like and it's 15 that's to tell you that the percentage doesn't really matter at the end of the day i know you can't see it tripping but yeah total percentage thc 18 and i'm freaking stone with just those two little bows yeah tasty tasty terpene profile is good on the palette very tasty i'm definitely happy with this purchase it has met my expectations on the flower yes i know the percentage is low but this thing is bomb strong straight mental um this is good i like that stuff that goes straight to the brain and you feel like a little meanie hurricane in there of thoughts yeah i recommend you guys try it out now i really really want to try out other strains so what this was a longer video than usual on super stoned i went over the time i'm supposed to record but that's a good sign you see i only smoked a couple of bows it wasn't my first high of the day but um i'm very happy good job 710 labs that blooniverse number four go get yourself some 7-10 labs don't sleep you get what you pay for quality over quantity all right thank you guys for watching and thank you for your support peace", "3htTQSwx84Y": "when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates [Music] today i'm dabbing on one of my personal favorite consistencies this is called sugar starting to sesh off with this live sugar from grassroots oh god that looks beautiful that sugar is such a pretty bright yellow color all right i'm just gonna dunk it right in there oh ah delicious man holy crap [ __ ] yeah that treyo g is a really dank earthy flavor that's [ __ ] fire got a little bit of sweetness on the back end too it's pretty nice there's a lot of different words that people use to describe cannabis concentrates some of the most popular are ones like shatter sugar butter wax sauce diamonds the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of a concentrate not the actual quality so one isn't necessarily better than the other just based off of its consistency but today we're going to take a deeper look into sugar wax it's a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a dispensary before you've probably seen it on the shelf at least it's created through a solvent extraction process just like shatter or wax but it's not necessarily better or worse than any other consistency it's just different everyone has their preference but personally i think this is one of the better consistencies all around i just think it usually has a nice terpene profile and it's easy to work on a dabber but i don't want to put too much emphasis on the importance of a consistency honestly i've had consistencies change on me before i finish smoking the concentrate honestly if you leave shatter sitting out in the open on a warm day it's not too rare to see it sugar up there's actually a lot of science that's involved when it comes to making concentrates it's a little overwhelming when you just look at it but sugar is really just a term used to describe any sort of cannabis consistency that kind of resembles like a wet sugar there's not just one way to get to the finish line here but no matter how you make it sugar typically has great effects a great smell and a great flavor but it's very sticky and crumbly i don't recommend using your hands on this concentrate i recommend getting a dab tool and scooping it up the stickiness really helps to stick to the tool usually let's just get a nice little chunk on here and get a little bit more than that oh yeah now we're talking i really like this little scooper dabbers i feel like you can get a decent amount of concentrate on them when i'm dabbing on a cloud banger with a turf pearl in it i usually wait about 90 95 seconds before i take my dab we're at 90 seconds right now so let's go for it oh yeah it's gonna be a good tent oh yeah it's perfect god damn i just love weed man it's the best i'm assuming that's something we can all agree on here dude just smoking and dabbing it's just incredible but anyway sugar wax is often found as either a cured or a live resin and the only real difference between live resin and cured resin sugar is that live resin sugar was made with fresh frozen material while cured sugar was made with fully cured cannabis but the main difference between the two is typically with live resin you're going to have a more noticeable terpene profile but it's usually around the same thc sugars usually tend to be around 70 to 90 percent thc sometimes with live resin sugars companies will just get little thc diamonds and sprinkle live resin terpenes on top of that until it's like a little sugary consistency and then they call that sugar there will be a saucy coating over the diamonds it'll look just like sauce just a little more dry it's called sugar as well but it's really not the same thing as sugar wax but sometimes these concentrate consistency names just cover up a couple different consistencies under one name i actually have two perfect examples here as you can see both of these are called live sugar you can see live sugar right there and live sugar right there however this is what was inside of each container as you can see this one on the left is what i was talking about where there's little thc diamonds just coated in a live resin sauce where this one over here is actually more of a waxy consistency but it still is a sugar when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates they're not even the same color the saucy consistency is much more of an amber color while this sugar is much more of a yellow color some might even consider this more of a sauce consistency but to me that's sugar you can leave it on one side for a little bit without any of the stuff pouring out of there and live resin sugar and live resin sauce often look very similar to each other the main difference between the two is the thc percentage and the terpene percentage sauce typically has a lower thc percentage and a higher terpene percentage than sugar while sugar typically has the higher thc percentage and the lower terpene percentage but still has a great flavor so that's why i typically like to go with sugar so i feel like you get that nice thc punch while still getting a nice flavor and like a delicious overall experience when it comes to the smell and the flavor but i'm about to take a dab of this saucy sugar now and see which one i like more this drain portlandia is absolutely fire it was actually recommended to me by one of you guys it has a super high mercy level this one it's actually only testing at 2.8 which is still pretty high but i've seen it testing it upwards of seven here's the stats for the portlandia sauce for anyone that wants to see it pretty high amount thc and thca while still having a great terpene profile and i'm actually impressed that the sugar wax had good flavor now that i'm looking at the stats it's over 90 thca but it's still a great terpene profile let me know in the comments whether you guys prefer when it's more of a sugar wax consistency or went into the little thc diamonds with the live resin sauce on top i don't really mind either way i like it both ways again it's hard for me to pick a consistency because really i don't look at the consistency i'm looking at the strain and the thc and the terpene percentages when i'm buying weed and the consistency of sugar is just not uniform in nature it even ranges from like a light yellow to a ambery color like this let's scoop out our dab i think it's almost time to dab too god [ __ ] not dabbing all that i'll drop that though all right wish me luck on this one [Music] huh oh my god [Music] oh yeah killed it oh my god that was a good hit oh my god holy [ __ ] that portlandia is [ __ ] amazing i'm not kidding i'm really glad that whoever recommended that recommended it shout out to you but honestly i just love sugar because of how easy it is to get on a dab tool and honestly i think that it has the dopest melt shots when i'm filming my snapchats however i do feel like it is much harder to do than other concentrates sometimes i think i'm just taking a normal sized dab and then once you drop it in there it just turns into this giant puddle and you're like holy [ __ ] i was not intending all this i feel like when i'm dabbing butter or shatter it's so much easier for me to have an idea for how much i'm taking but when it's those little diamonds and all of a sudden there's just a giant thca rock in there you don't really know how much that weighs and you're like all right well let's find out how high i'm gonna get but i still think that sugar has a pretty nice well-rounded high and flavor no matter what form you have it in and i love flavorful concentrates and sugar is not the terpest there is but i still think that it has a great flavor profile and i think the butter and sauce are probably the most terpy for those who are wondering and if you're new to dabbing do not get overwhelmed if you see all these different consistencies at the dispensary and don't know which one to pick honestly don't even look at the consistency if you ask me just look at the strain and like the thc and the terpenes whatever you're looking for if you're a thc shopper look for the thing that's the highest thc if you like a certain terpene look for the terpenes like when i'm looking for a concentrate i'm looking at the terpene percentages i want something that has a really nice terpene profile most of the time concentrate consistencies are all basically the same thing they're all just different concentrated forms of cannabis it's really the cannabis you want to focus on and depending on the concentrate sometimes it'll change consistencies by the time the company packages it up and it actually gets to you bho does not have the longest shelf life and especially if you're talking about something like shatter or butter they can change consistencies pretty quick so honestly i wouldn't even say that labeling at the dispensary is 100 accurate you really don't know until you see it but that's the video you guys let me know what consistency of concentrates you want me to do next i did this before on sauce and you guys seem to really like it so i'm gonna make it a series so let me know what consistency you want me to do next i can do shatter butter wax diamonds let me know make sure you click that like button and subscribe for more videos i got a bunch more on the way and don't forget leave a comment let me know

[Music] you know what I think pineapple Express is actually really good yeah it's definitely one of those like you once you hit it you feel medicated but doesn't go past that for me at least in my testing at least for right now maybe this gram will do it since my body has gotten used to it finally um definitely I'm Murphy hmm and piney with a hint of citrus on the middle beginning end on like I said in my review on Instagram definitely one for like after work pains um you get home you want to relax or just waking up it can be is throughout the whole day it's a nice hybrid but it's on the more like where I like it to be like oh I feel medicated you know chill still can focus though and do stuff which is nice I like those kind of strains it's just some days I look for a really potent stuff you know I'm not gonna lie though oh the on this gap tool is actually branded on it is the it is the is company or whatever who's they make a lot of different products on they're really good brand supposedly but yeah did not know it was branded I totally forgot about that and for five bucks that's pretty nice I like it huh you know what guys and listen yeah let's just do one more mark one word see I'm already high let's scoop the rest of this off the tool and cuz I am medicated and I think I got the gist of what I'm trying to say hopefully you understand what I'm saying I'm a crazy person let's take some reclaim that I collected and put on here why not why am I using you I got a new tool excuse it at least it's not really regretting using this site now actually note to self

that end sucks the way it does but we got her dab dude and like I said this is like whatever this scoop up was of the you know what let's screw this item we're just gonna like dab this traditionally at this point because this is getting ridiculous with how stupid I am but you see how well this is working I really haven't done anything all day not even worth my time for that just like this as you

checking out this blue Magoo by Altis extracts not concentrates and with that with top right into the numbers so THC comes in at thca is seventy seven point four one total THC comes in at seventy one point oh and the terpenes are five point zero nine alright so let's hop right into it [Applause] so looks really good in the package and as you guys can tell here let me zoom in real quick as you can tell it's got nice it's like a sugar you know it's got nice granules well pronounced let me see what it smells like so as far as smells concerned it's a little bit more earthy earthy with a little bit of like menthol it almost has like I'm not a medicine type you know it's like a really lavenderish almost lavender there we go it almost smells like yeah an earthy lavender and with that I'm really excited to go try it and I'll be back with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this went [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] guys what's up so I went ahead and tried that blue Magoo and as far as the flavors concerned there wasn't anything too distinctive but it just had a light clean floral like concentrate taste and then as far as the high this is why we went and bought a gram literally before we were even out of the first one and it's because it gives you a nice stone enos around the eyes it's a really good relaxing like concentrate but it also provides this weird like uplifting euphoric kind of effect to it that really makes you so I was having a horrible day I'm talking like so a lot of you guys might may or may not know I have anxiety and so when you have anxiety sometimes you have your bad days and you have your good days well I was on like a three-day like bad day binge and the second I dabbed is I kid you not it completely changed my mood I was able to like clear think clearly and just like it helped me get back to myself so I don't usually talk about medical but when I feel something along those lines I really like to mention it and this like I said we went and bought a second ground before the first one was even out so good job two Altis for putting this out this was a great product we really loved it with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "Nts9hwd43zo": "yo what's good youtube it's cosmos and today i'm coming at you guys with another terp review we've got some altered alchemy live resins right here that i just picked up for saturday got five g's five different flavors these are new ones by altered each of them um cost me 17 a g normally 15 a g on saturday sale so i'm gonna go ahead and show you guys these and then we're gonna try them out um one by one and i'll tell you guys how they each are and how they rank and whatnot which ones are worth it or not so uh let's start it off with this blueberry cheesecake we got total cannabinoids at 70 if you guys don't know um altered alchemy altered alchemy is a brand of budget line in oregon there's some crc product which is color remediation it's not like the best product in the world but honestly a good crc for right around 15 a gram is a great deal in my mind and i'll dab these all day so yeah we got some raspberry shortcake here so we got the blueberry cheesecake and this raspberry shortcake now let me give you guys a smell of them too so normally i like to mix them around before i get a good good smell but i'll just do um a smell before mixing them around just to tell you guys how they smell yeah i'm not gonna lie um this uh this raspberry shortcake it just smells like crc you know just that bland crc smell that kind of it kind of has like slightly like lemon cleaner smell to it but it really is just kind of a little bit a little bit bland i think would be the best way to explain it this blueberry cheesecake has a little bit different consistency than the rest of them it's a little bit more battery almost and the smell um it has like an interesting smell kind of like a i want to say stale but it's not like as much crc smell as that raspberry shortcake but it still has just kind of like a almost like an older smell not like in a really bad way but not in a great way either we're gonna move on to this blue magoo right here the ground that i wanted yeah zena really wanted this blue magoo which i've had blue magoon before that was awesome so it doesn't really want to focus but here we go okay let me smell this yeah this one just smells just straight like crc man just give that a whiff doesn't smell bad to me though it's not it's not a terrible smell but it is quite uh just straight crc it doesn't have doesn't have much of like an authentic terpene smell behind it now we're moving on to this lemon cush right here my shorts are running short so they're not very yeah so this one even though it does have like a main general smell of crc it has really nice undertones that are citrusy that are beyond the crc um just beyond the general crc it just has a lemon a lemon smell that bites your nose that's not that crc lemon smell yep and last but not least the trunk funk which uh the homie at the dyspo said that this one was their best seller so far when i smelled it the first time i instantly knew why if this one just has the most authentic terpene smell from all of them you can tell that the terps are intact from the original plant here at least some of them it's too bad it's not a little easier to smell things because if you would have been able to smell things a little better um you would have done that yeah i keep my mask on at the dispose so i don't smell anything i just look at them um so i don't know it's cool though it's five different strains it'll be it'll be cool to get five different uh five different little flavor tests so let's start it off with a dab here of i'll just do them in order we'll start with the blueberry cheesecake and uh in the water oh in the order that i showed them oh okay gotcha so yeah gonna heat it up then we'll come at you with the dab so about to go in on this blueberry cheesecake and i wanted to mix it around shit's crazy actually smells like blueberries now so maybe it was just because i didn't mix it before smells pretty good it should be a good time excuse everyone okay my throat ready for this dab the the pre dab cough you know if you cough before you take a dab then you'll be less likely to take a cough after you take the dab that's not true it's not super harsh no i just accidentally cut my tongue on my retainer oh ow okay so yeah i like the flavor on that one was pretty good it was maybe definitely better than it smelled yeah better than it smelled at first um the flavor once you mixed it it definitely had more of a flavor than it's not like blueberries i thought it smelled good yeah yeah yeah definitely satisfied with that for 15 g for 15 a g it's a good deal um i'm curious to see if these other ones are going to be smoother than that one because that one was it's a little harsh yeah i was gonna say it wasn't like crazy harsh but um it wasn't these are less harsh than like the mango grasses though than the other ones okay so zenith when she says mango grass or whatever seriously referring to these emeralds here we recently scooped up some sour tangy and some mango grass for 13. um for 13 injury which is a great deal they're not crc they're non-crc and for the deal they're a great deal they are they're honestly not that bad for what they are for what they are they're really good i feel like foreign yeah and these ones definitely i'd say a little bit smoother for sure i think a little bit tastier too to be honest with you maybe yeah yeah that the um i feel like the sour tangy that we had out last night that we took a couple of dabs of was really flavorful i like the sour tangy a little better than mango i thought at first but i'm not exactly i'm not 100 sure yeah i'm with you i am with you babe so you ready for another dab i'm gonna try out this uh strawberry shortcake oh [ __ ] we're gonna take this down right now yeah why not right okay let's do it i gotta drink some water give me yeah yeah you're good you're good i gotta i gotta heat it up anywho and i'm just finishing keep dipping you're good you're good now this one the raspberry uh shortcake right here oh hello there we go it's quite bunched up let's give it a let's break it up and see if we can get a better smell out of this i don't know it doesn't seem like there's like tertina there's not really like terps hidden in this one it's just kind of bricked up here it's going to slush out but let's see we'll give it a mix-a-roundy see if we get more terps out of this it's very um it's kind of like a wet sugar just a lightly wet sugar interesting interesting it definitely smells differently still smells like crc um yeah okay nice okay i do i think i like that a little bit better so we're gonna heat this up now um then we're gonna come back once we're heated up take this of uh strawberry shortcake yeah see you in a sec all right so we gave it the mix around i already smelted it does that smell it okay which one is this one uh the strawberry shortcake oh i think it smells better i'd say it smells slightly better but it still smells like seriously but we'll see how it tastes it's it's still the overwhelmingly crc smell for me yeah like yeah i understand like it doesn't have its own distinct smell compared to just crc and like being like dabs um but yeah okay yeah it has a little bit more of a flavor than it does a smell that one's smooth smooth like it's like almost creamy do you know what i'm saying like it like coats your throat almost like not really but it does like it's creamy almost interesting like yeah i'm not sure if creamy's the way yo zen and i just took a dab and my phone storage was full so none of it just got recorded i thought it was really good like i felt like it was a really good critique too it was a really good uh we gave good feedback lots of amazing jokes i feel like my face was way too close to the camera so that was the blueberry uh shortcake and because of this um now snuggles i think that i'll have to heat up another dab right now we're gonna space out this review space we're gonna space out this review um throughout the day for dabs we're just gonna take two right now but i guess i'm gonna take a third dab because i didn't get the review on the second one so i'm gonna heat it up and then we'll go in or maybe just me all right so i gave this strawberry shortcake a little mix-a-roni here and it actually has a little bit more of a smell but it's not really distinctive from the crc smell so i'd say overall it has that crc smell to it for sure but it smells a little bit better than it did before i mixed it up so yeah send it on this damn cheers so yeah i'm gonna have to uphold my uh my review from the first app that i took of this one the number one thing that i would say if i had to just say one word that came to my mind from this one smooth is incredibly smooth smooth on the palate pretty damn smooth on the throat it tastes nice very very very mellow mellow flavor zena said it was almost creamy to her it's a light fruity flavor maybe strawberry 100 sure you really don't get too much of the fruity terps but it's just so so light you really just get mostly just smoothness with just a tiny hint of some fruit flavor overall for 15 a g would buy it again probably would buy a gram or two more um i wouldn't dab it like every day all day because it's really not it's not crazy crazy flavorful or anything but um it's smooth it's smooth as [ __ ] that's uh that was a nice dab [ __ ] it we'll catch you guys on the next step yo what's good it's sunday morning now and uh we're gonna finish this turkey view with the last three strains i was gonna record it throughout the day but we're streaming on twitch and it just that it didn't feel like the right time yeah we were i was gonna bring it up but we were chilling yeah we were chilling it worked out going down for the first one did we already heat it up no we didn't eat it yeah okay i'm about to heat it up just want to show the show straight and get a little smell it has like a a slight undertone of some uh of someone how do you say authentic terps and then it just smells mostly a seriously so we'll see how it tastes i'm gonna heat it up catch you in a sec all right so i mixed the bloom with goo around and you get the slight the slight smell of the blue magoo underneath the crc but it doesn't look like seriously cheers everyone it's definitely not bad though we just spent like all last week smoking 13 edgy non-crc stuff and i think i prefer this that blue magoo is nice um it's nothing to write home about it does taste mostly like crc there's that tiny undertone of the blue magoo taste that you get for 15 a g it's not a bad deal but um i wouldn't recommend it out of these five grams i wouldn't recommend this one necessarily or that that blueberry um cheesecake i think was the other one uh those two so far not as much not as much let's try these last two here we got trunk funk and lemon kush coming up um let's see we'll go with the lemon kush for this next one which definitely has a little bit more of a smell especially than the last couple that we've tried distinctive from the crc smell that is i'm gonna q-tip it and heat it up and we'll catch you guys on the next step we got some lemon kush right here going down for this one cheers everyone should we go on the temp oh [ __ ] we are definitely good on the top i just went and uh checked on our cats so we uh both ran on back for this dab yeah that lemon has a way better flavor has a distinct sweet lemon terp that's different from the crc turkey that tastes like lemon i was gonna say the same thing that tastes a little bit more like lemon to me it's a little harsher though i feel like the blooming was a little smoother interesting okay the blue magoo was pretty damn smooth i think the two that we tried yesterday might have been even smoother than the blue magoo i agree that's why they're called cheesecakes yeah yeah yeah but the maybe not the blueberry cheesecake the blue or cheesecake i remember being pretty raw yeah you're right compared to the raspberry the raspberry was way better the raspberry shortcake yeah yeah take a second off anyways all right y'all so my uh phone ran out of storage again i need to just clear out my whole phones in here we got the trunk funk going down i'm saying this one has a really nice smell definitely like nicely funky um as you'd expect from trunk funk cheers sorry i kind of stole the phone light to take silly cuz i was like oh that's not that bad right now [Music] yeah i don't think i plan on taking part of the third bath well you did really completely spaced so trunk funk i would say um out of all of them that was kind of a smaller dab so there wasn't like a crazy amount of flavor but i think that that one in the lemon kush had the two most distinctive non-crc flavors out of the batch that being said the lemon kush might have been a tiny bit harsher i think the trunk funk is great smooth the blue magoo's pretty smooth tastes pretty much like crc the blueberry cheesecake is solid um but not not amazing so i'd say pass on the blueberry cheesecake pass on the blue magoo i'm really sorry cheesecake yep scoop yourself up some raspberry cheesecake some lemon kush and some trunk funk and just double down on those three and you'll be happy you'll be super happy overall though at 15 and g bro like all of these are very fine for 15 and g altered stays slaying it and uh these are awesome honestly these are great so yeah yeah 15 a g not a bad deal yeah i'd say i'm happy with all of them overall you know it's cool to have some different strains but now we know uh the three that are our favorite just wanted to relay that on to all of you guys just in case you're looking to go outside yeah you're curious and it's hard to smell through your mask so yeah not that you shouldn't wear a mask for your mask um but it's hard to smell so we couldn't really tell exactly what was really good until you tasted it and brought it home right so yeah it's good to make reviews like these so appreciate all the love everyone yeah let's see it's like 1 30 right now i'm gonna be live over on my twitch today at uh i don't know if you need to say that on your youtube video do you

for a nice session", "57SSWEedSFQ": "what's up guys it's your girl cassia AKA sweet serenity and i am back with another video if you are new to my channel welcome i'm just gonna give you a quick overview of what my channel is about my channel mostly consists of pre-nursing student tips and advice I am also a healthcare worker so I talk a little bit about my job as a patient care tech in the hospital and if you don't know what that is then click the link below also I've been trying my best to include some lifestyle videos for all of my non-nursing viewers out there so now that I give you a quick overview don't forget to hit that subscribe button for me go ahead and click it right now thanks ok so today's video I will be showing you guys how to create your own sugar wax so sugar waxing is an all-natural thing like literally or Naturals so I'm gonna show you how to create the sugar wax and I'm gonna give you some tips on how to apply the wax and yes I mean wax like underarm waxing brazilian waxing leg hair waxing that kind of way and it's all natural no chemicals like so natural that you can eat it I mean don't eat your wax but you can eat it also the wax is an all-natural hard wax so it's not a soft wax you don't really need like the paper strips or anything to rip it off no it's just a hard wax you just apply the wax and then take it off this video was inspired by a between E I'm I hope I'm saying that right but I'm gonna put her name there she is a youtuber who shows you all of the life hacks okay all of the DIYs it's on her channel also I would like to tell you guys that I am NOT a licensed wax waxing aesthetician or whatever it's called I'm not a professional I'm not I literally just looked at a YouTube video instead hey I want to try and it worked wonders so I'm not giving you any professional advice or anything like that I'm just giving you showing you how you can do this yourself at home if you're not comfortable doing it do not do it so I literally did this one time and that was yesterday and like I was so excited like yes I just did my own wags like what I gotta go to a waxer for like I can do it myself and I love the little of sugar waxing already okay I go to European Wax Center to get wax oh I've already been getting waxes so I don't know if that makes a difference but this is not hurt to me like and also I have a high pain tolerance as well but this did not hurt my underarms anyway okay enough blabbing here we go okay so we have sugar here lemon juice and water we also have a bowl to put our wax into when it's cooling off and some measuring cups you're gonna need one cup and then 1/4 cup and also a spatula just to mix it up with first we're gonna put our sugar into our bowls or one cup of sugar and then I had to change views because it's hard for me to record and try to put the ingredients in so we put the sugar in already and then we're just gonna go ahead and add our lemon juice which is 1/4 cup of lemon juice I'm gonna do about 1/4 is fine you don't have to you know be exact then we're gonna add in 1/4 cup of water about 1/4 is fine - I started to make a mess here it's just water though obviously I can't pour man we're just gonna mix it up because you want the sugar to dissolve a little bit before you put it into the pot so just kind of mix it up a little now you're gonna need a medium-sized saucepan you don't want a very small size because then it boils and it might boil you over so like a medium sized turn your heat to medium and just continue to mix it this is very important because you don't want it to burn so here you can see it boiling a little bit getting started so just keep on stirring it keep an eye on it you don't have to consistently stir it like the whole entire time but just keep an eye on it because you don't want it to burn or anything I was not joking guys when I said this is all natural that is literally the only thing you need water sugar and some lemon juice and you can literally use any sugar you can use brown sugar or you can use white sugar I use white sugar in this you see that it's boiling a little bit more now and my heat is still on medium it stays on medium the entire time now this is the trickiest part for me because you really just wanted to get to boiling and you don't want to leave it on for too long so I would say like about 10 minutes maybe not even if it just starts to boil and you feel like it's a good boil then just turn it off because if you leave it on for too long then it'll burn or if you leave it on for too long it'll get very very hard if that's not what you want you don't want it to be super hard even though it's a hard wax you don't want to be super hard so this water is just used to test out the wax to see if it's done it's just a little cup of cold water and you just pour like a drop into the water and if it gets very solid then it then you know it's done because the girl in the video I watched she had a thermometer and I don't have at the monitor so if you have a thermometer then when the heat gets to 250 then it's done but I didn't have one so this was a cool trick that I used so as you can see it's starting to turn a little brownish but it's not dark enough yet so I'm just showing you guys like the inconsistency and unfortunately I did not record or forgot the push to record button to show you guys how to check to see if it's done but do you see how dark it is now it'll turn like that dark when it's in the pot and it will boil like a lot more than what I showed but I did not record it because I don't know what's wrong with me but this is you see it's like already getting a little hard and I poured it into the plastic bowl you guys can use a glass bowl if you want but just make sure you heat the glass bowl up before you put the hot wax on it because it will shatter like put it in hot water put the bowl in hot water or something I just use a plastic bowl so I'm just showing you guys the consistency it's a little bit thicker all the water's out of it now and as the more it cools the thicker it will get so like I said you don't want it too hard but you want it good enough to like manipulate be able to like squish it and like form it into a ball that's what you want [Music] so now I have my powder this is what I'm going to use it's cornstarch and I'm just gonna put it into this bowl here so of course you don't like the dip and dab into your cornstarch just pour like a little bit enough to cover the area that you're going to be waxing you can use any powder baby powder flour cornstarch anything to absorb the moisture this is what the powder is gonna be for it to absorb any excess moisture you have on your body because then the wax will not stick it'll just slide right off here I'm just showing you guys exactly how it should look you should be able to roll it into a ball and then just like squish it with your fingers and then be able to roll it back into a ball so you see how like it's it's still soft but it's not liquidy soft it's still like firm and hard so here is the wax cooled off a little bit but as you can see it's still very liquidy and that's not what you want what you want is what I just showed you guys for it to be like more firm and if you put this on your skin it'll be just very sticky and just messy which I made that mistake before so don't do that here I'm just showing you guys i waxed a little bit of my arm like I'm just showing you guys a difference obviously my hip my arms are very very hairy so I'm just cleaning the area right now making sure it's very clean you don't want any bacteria getting into your pores after you X because when you X its exfoliating your skin and it's like having an open wound or a cut so here's the wax now it's definitely thicker as you can see it's not so sticky I put a little bit of powder on my hands because it can get very very messy so I don't want it to stick all over my hands so here I'm just putting the powder to the area that I'm gonna wax this all can get so messy guys my hands get very very moist so if you have it in your hands for too long it will ruin the wax it'll just make it very sticky and stick everywhere so you see it's a hard guys but it's not like super hard it still look how stretchy it is I can still just like pull it out it's it's so messy guys it really is this is one thing I don't like about the sugar wax it's very messy if you play with it too much in your hand it'll get your hands are like will get moist and it get sticky but as you can see I'm trying to figure out which way my hair goes so if my hair goes up I'm gonna put the wax the opposite way so my hair grows downward so I'm gonna put the wax upward so you see I'm just really trying to mold it in there so it can grasp onto the hair I do this about two or three times it's good and pull and you see guys I pulled the opposite way that I applied the wax so I pull it downward because my hair grows downwards so it just makes it easier for the hair to come out of the come out of your skin if you're just pulling the way that your hair grows and it makes it less painful - there we go and guys this is not hurt like I never waxed my arm before but it doesn't hurt you see I'm just you doing this method to take off any extra sticky pieces that were left on my arm but yeah it does not hurt guys like it it's like a little shock and then it's like okay that you know that wasn't bad as you can see the more I have the wax in my hand it's like getting stickier and stickier so you'll see like now it's getting harder to apply so try not to like hold the wax in your hand like I said I'm learning along with you guys as I go only did this one time I don't know if you guys can see the difference but I'm trying my best to show you guys like the difference between look how sticky is getting it's so messy but I'm just trying to show you guys like the difference so the part of my hair that I did white first is the part that I did wax like it really does work the only thing I don't like about it is like I said it can get very messy and also it's just it takes a couple of times like you have to keep going over it for you to get like basically clean wax and also if you've never waxed an area before like if this is your first time your hair is more stubborn anyway so it won't like come out clean you'll still have little pieces of hair like hanging around but yeah even when I did like my underarms it I had to go over it a few times that you can see guys it really does work it doesn't hurt at all try my best to show you guys how like how it takes it off so sorry if you guys couldn't really see like the difference between the way the part that our wax to the part that wasn't length but I tried my best to show you my camera I'm using my cell phone to do this so my camera quality isn't the best but now I'm going to tell you guys how to fix your wigs if your wife does not come out right so there was a lot of behind the scenes okay to my waxing because I had to literally wait forever for it to cool off and then I tried using it before it was all the way cooled off and like it was just a mess like it was sticky in a mess so that's one thing you don't want you don't want your wax to be sticky I showed you guys in the video how to like how you really want it like the consistency you want almost like you can manipulate it like you can pull it you can stretch it you can roll it up you can flatten it but it doesn't stick to you if that makes sense so one way to fix it if your waist is too sticky just let it cool off so the bowl that your wax is in just sit it in another bowl so it can just cool off quicker your wax comes out too hard what you can do is kind of heat it up again so either heat it up in the microwave not for too long because you don't want to cook it you just want to warm it up or the same way to cool the wax off with cold water use warm water instead to make the wax softer so just sit your bowl in some hot like and I mean hot like boiling water just to warm it up a bit but not so much that when you apply it it'll burn you so it'll just make it a little bit softer one thing you should never do is add water into your wax that you've already cooked you already put into your separate bowl never add water because what that will do would just make it it was just making a mess like it would defeat the whole purpose of cooking it so when you're boiling the wax you're literally trying to get the water to evaporate out of it so that way it can be a little more firmer if you add water into it it's just gonna make it melt away so now tips about actually doing the waxing before you get started with the waxing you want to make sure you cleanse the area which I showed you guys in the video you want to make sure you wipe down the area because you are waxing you're exfoliating your skin so it's basically an open wound if that makes sense so your pores are open everything's open so you don't want any bacteria that's it's on top of your skin to get down into your pores or down into that wound so you want to cleanse the area very well once you cleanse the area make sure it's completely dry and then add your powder whatever powder that is and your powder onto the area that you're going to be writing now what the powder does is it helps absorb that moisture so you have to make sure you add the powder and like I said whatever powder that is that you use then use it because I use cornstarch because that's the only powder I had you can use cornstarch you can use baby powder you can use flour and you can even use setting powder that you use for like makeup your foundation and everything so you can even use that whatever powder you have use it so like I said this video is not perfect because I only did this one time so I'm learning with you guys really so just like don't judge me I have a lot of bloopers like I said when I first the first time I did in my wax was super hard and then I had to fix it like I did my underarms actually and then I had to fix it like I told you guys to put it in like warm water and then then it came out perfectly fine actually it way super smooth and then I'm gonna show you guys what my underarms look like as well okay so this is what my arms are really dark which I have to work on that but this is what it looks like and again like I have little spots but that's because I haven't gotten a wax in a long time because my wax place is closed due to quarantine so but this is what my arms look like another thing that I wanted to tell you guys to is that like my arm hair you might not see like you might see I don't know you guys can see but like you might still see some hairs like they're like if this is your first time waxing you're not gonna get all of the hair out so even if you go to like European wax Center or like any wax or they'll tell you your first time waxing you're not gonna have like a clean no hair there my first time going to eggs there was still like little stubs of hair there so that's why I never wax my arm before but you see like now it's all patchy so I probably gotta finish that but I never wax my arm before but light is so smooth guys like like I said you still see some hair because I never wax before and that means my hair is super stubborn but like for my underarms I pretty much got most of it because I got my underarms right before so it was pretty easy guys that is it that is all - sugar wax me I know this video is not perfect but it's my first time doing it it well my second time doing it and I'll get better over time so as you guys can see it's very simple to do the toughest part for me is honestly knowing when to turn the burner off like that's the trickiest part because you can either overcook it or like undercook it so just check out that the color of it and when it starts to smell you can smell like it smells like caramel then just turn it off thank you guys so much for watching and don't forget to Like comment share and subscribe this video and also guys follow me on Instagram and tell me how it turns out when you guys make your way because I really want to see like I said I am NOT a professional we did this together okay we were in this together so I want to see how you guys turned out hopefully it turns out very well hopefully you don't go through as many mistakes as I did hopefully my instructions were very simple if not I'm sorry we'll get better over time also guys I forgot to put in there that this is what I use after I was done my waxing I got this from the European wax Center but if you don't have this then you guys can just use like witch hazel or like aloe vera gel or anything that's like soothing and also cleanses because you don't want to put anything that's gonna have like that'll cause like any burning or bacteria or anything like lotion things like that and you don't want to put deodorant on if you're putting is wax your underarms because that has chemicals in it which will probably burn your underarms there's people who have literally said that it didn't burn that they're unarmed so I just wanted to really add that in there because it is important and sorry I forgot to add that in the video earlier but this is really good like this is so good you can probably order online but also you can just simply use witch hazel that's probably like the best thing to go to or Oliver Joe thanks again for watching [Music]", "iUdkKoMpT60": "[Music] [Music] Camden um what's going on you guys I came across a new strain today my brother actually has it I came across a new strain of marijuana today and it's called soul shine Aloha it's very very very brand new um it's a very new genetic strain

to really get political at all oh I don't know if you guys were okay I don't know if you guys remember me talk getting all political about a week ago and I don't know if you guys remember telling you me telling you that there are bills that were proposed to Trump okay there were bills that were proposed to Trump that didn't hit didn't hit the media that you literally had to look up on the internet to know what they were and a lot of you did not believe me you thought I was making it up you thought I was just saying [ __ ] because I'm a pot-smoking liberal let me tell you something right now three of the bills that I told you about a week ago just got signed and it was on the news yesterday and I was right on all of it all of it you want to know the bills that got signed the environmental the Environmental Protection Agency for Alaska and now other places where you can hunt like Montana North Dakota South Dakota Canada a lot Canada I mean really like oh pretty much just Alaska North Dakota at all the places in the states the environmental protection got lifted on those hunting rights now you can hunt whenever the [ __ ] you want you can kill whatever animal you want doesn't matter if it's an endangered anymore Trump just signed an executive order to lift that why why why what what purpose what good is that going to bring the people sit like seriously what why did you get rid of something that we've been in head initiated in America for it tens of heat ten tens of years and he just got rid of it something else he just got rid of he literally signed a bill that um is trying to get rid of all now all the gay rights that we just signed off in all 50 states he just passed one in Tennessee and now he's working on the one in Florida and now the states are growing he's literally reversing all of the laws that took Americans years and years and years to establish and he's reversing them within just days in weeks and no one's no one's really saying anything and if no one's really doing anything and it's like all the Trump supporters that were so for Trump all the people that were like you're from oh [ __ ] what people all no no I'm so for Trump where are they now they ain't saying anything anymore they're not talking [ __ ] anymore they're literally just sitting back and going oh my god what do we what have we done that's what they're doing now like it oh and the third thing I forgot to tell you guys the third thing yeah you can now hunt hibernating bears now like in the third thing he now signed an executive bill this was I saw this this is this is [ __ ] can't believe it was actually signed um you he now fully signed this is now 100% indigo it's 100% the works now then Mexico is not paying for the wall we are we are not Mexico we are in what was Trump's whole campaign about who is his entire campaign about before he was even elected we're gonna build that wall and I'm gonna make them pay for it I'm gonna make have to go pay for I don't know how we're gonna make them pay for it we're gonna make them pay for we're gonna build wall we're gonna build that wall because you know why we need a wall apparently you want to who's paying for it and the get-go in the long run and you me you everyone else and you know what the really stupid sad thing is to all the stupid Trump supporters that are on board with the wall they're like oh you know I guess that's okay I don't mind paying for the wall Augustus was gonna happen anyways that's not how you should react that is not how you should react to that half a visit campaign was literally about something that you were so on board for that you completely voted for him because of that sole reason and now the moment he's president he signed an executive order making you guys pay for the wall and now all the sudden half the Trump supporters an entire America are okay with that why it's like we're okay with going back on what we voted for it's like no I never believed for a second that Mexico was gonna pay for the wall there is even so many interviews in videos that came out of Mexico from the President of Mexico himself saying I am not paying for that good wall that's literally what the President of Mexico even said he's like I'm not paying for that in wall like I just thought I'm gonna this is the last time talking about Trump and it's the last thing I'm gonna say if you guys still have faith or any any shred of faith in that man don't just don't he just just don't stop having faith in that goddamn human being because he's wasting Americans money he's wasting our time and he's destroying a foundation of what everything we thought it was going to be so like this man has signed more executive orders in his entire presidency already in two months than any other president has in their entire four term year presidency but does anyone that I hope that really bothers people like he signed more executive orders in his two-month time period than any other president has in their four-year time period he's literally the puppet for the rich people because all he cares about is money for him stuff Nats II don't wanna say I'm on say he's a businessman and that's all he'll ever view the people as is just a business and not a society it's just there's just plain [ __ ] wrong wait what do you mean Aldi I didn't vote at all and the people are like why did you vote you should have vote your vote would have mattered no it wouldn't my vote would have mattered I don't want to it's like choosing between the two evils you're telling to tell me that it I could have should have voted for Hillary no I ain't gonna vote for someone that lies has ten thousands of emails and there's a war criminal in his literally for war and then we have an idiot that has no political experience that literally views the people in society in the complete United States is a business in machs it women like hmm which evil do I want them I hope either one of them but America chose each other the idiot America chose the [ __ ] idiot and now we have to deal with it we have to deal with the fact that we chose an idiot to run the country it sucks Laurie whoops I'm doing a bomber she's a [ __ ] come on melt now there we go i melted the wax into the bud I didn't grow based up on I didn't one over hurry or Trump to be president welcome both Y ak-47 cut 2020 huh

I don't really can I mean it is fast food but like we have too many things to be considered fast food like we have so much goddamn food like on the menu that it's not even funny we have shakes slushes ice cream slashes we have tea lemonade natural lemonade we have cranberry juice on [ __ ] tap like um we have a shitload of fried food hamburgers chicken sandwiches there's so much [ __ ] food like it's not even helmut breakfast is all day like we have happy hour to - for every day unless it's happy hour all day for some rare occasions no secret ingredient well there's no real a secret

the menu here dude because I shall french toast all the time in the mornings when I do when I do morning shifts over orange juice and french toast man or sausage egg and cheese burrito hmm don't [ __ ] get my english is bad course we are from Russia and we missed any it I've even heard English is one of the hardest languages to learn besides Mandarin Chinese and Japanese in Korean I heard English is like number two or number three in the entire world opens like MoMA Hardison in like languages to learn because we actually have more more things to remember eyes like like certain nouns punctuation x' certain way like you can't say Morris you can't sit you have to say there's more of that like or you can't say this is the most bestest you have to say that's the best it like there's no bestest this is just the best like you have to know like they shouldn't words I don't know you gotta know you English yeah man bastards in Pennsylvania dude hmm um hmm what's something that's on the menu though what's something that's really good to get on the menu oh you guys like going to Sonic Green if you guys even know what Sonic is highly recommend getting something called pancake on a stick it'll change its it'll change your way of thinking how in fast food I [ __ ] love that thing it's 2 bucks and it's so [ __ ] good it's try to study Russian oh dude I've heard Russian people talk Russian it sounds extremely hard too but dude Russian dude up some Russian female accents are [ __ ] dropped it mmm drop dead hot I wish that's why I want to study Russian sometime so I can understand what the hell the same but also um for all you guys watching I wanted to make this smoke stream really quick because I was doing a strain review on this strain called soul shine Aloha and it's a very very exquisite exotic um rare strain and it just got put on leaf Lee has no reviews at all um the genetics of this strain is ice princess which is white widow and Cinderella 99 and they took ice princess and cross it over with something called Hawaiian big bud and they came up with the name soul shine Aloha and this is an extremely connoisseur weed if it's grown in Hawaii um I can't believe my brother got his hands on this weed he doesn't even know what the hell this is until I told him um it's extremely frosty but it's Airy we just like a sativa should be but it's very frosty for us for a sativa I don't know if you can see that like this frost in the nice orange hair so that's a good that's a great angle while very frosty weed how much did it cost um he got announced for 235 but it he said he goes through this guy that um takes the time to go to California to get all his weed and he comes back to Arizona to sell it um and this stuff was the 235 an ounce stuff he had 200 announced stuff he had 220 on stuff and he said this stuff was the bunker stuff from Cali and it was 235 an ounce but my brother sold me Tennant gram on it so I don't mind I got to 420 I think that's pretty good it's not that bad but like for connoisseur we'd tenant for tenant Graham like I'll pay that like I'll definitely pay that I wasn't going to go through a dispensary bet I didn't want to wait now and a half because I didn't realize he had wheat like this like I don't here's we that has Popol on it I want to see if you guys can see it I know there was a stem on it there's a stem going through it but there's purple there's like deep hues of purple in this weed hold on there we go on Wow see how you know you can really see the purple because for instance this one see it oh now you can really see it this one is green on this side and then this one on the left is purple this one on the this ones this is just what a good weed oh you know how my brother comes across scalloped the California dealers like this always sunshine on the west man White Widow is the [ __ ] man here I'm actually gonna I'm gonna put the actual genetics of what the strain is in the in the message below okay hey when I got this I'm just trying to make it organized so you guys can understand what the hell it is all right that's that's the strain I have at the very complex genetic strain is marijuana yes marijuana is legal in Arizona but I have to have a medical card in order to get my Maya medical marijuana um it's not recreational yet I am over the age of 21 so I am comfortably waiting for it to go recreational in the moment it does go recreational guys you're gonna see me I'm gonna start growing I'm gonna start doing grow streams I'm gonna start showing off my weed a lot more um because then when it goes recreational then it really won't matter it really really won't matter if I don't think it matters now guys it's never going to matter when it goes recreational because then I can really simmer start smoking occasionally wait hold on we'll see the comments how long does a gram last me of weed I can go through a grandma weed really quick is that the purple comes from the plant getting cold when budding I thought that's what I thought too you have death wish coffee as your phantom is that desk which coffee any good damn that's so low in THC what the heck that's not even that's not even good weed what the point - it's good dude I've always wanted to try some off Amazon but I know my it would probably kill me haha it probably would strip show you know some strains are just purple hold on really quick smidge there that's way easier to read new when it gets when it goes recreational are you worried about the quality no I'm not worried about the quality when it goes recreational at all no mass production um that's why I'm probably gonna stick to certain dispensaries that I trust for quality Mehta Hays do I've actually heard of the bud called meta haze I know exactly what that stuff is you can get it from black rifle Coffee co2 and that company is all military vets and gets money goes to them oh that's awesome then phantom um but hey did you also see that other Death Wish coffee phantom it's like um Viking inspired or something it's like um I forgot what it's called a Valhalla coffee or something have you tried that yet apparently it's like a different kind of flavor or different kind of roast or something different kind of strength I love wheat - James hold on or something just something just sitting here like hold on [Music] I think it's funny that when my cat freaks out and tries looking at what's outside like my door she'll just keep looking at it while getting freaked out at the same time it's like cat what are you doing why are you trying to freak yourself out like like she'll go towards the noise she's getting freaked out at and she's getting more freaked out as she's getting closer to the noise in my I'm just like staring at my cat going what what are you doing like are you trying to get yourself a heart attack like yep no did not see no you didn't see that yeah I saw it on Amazon phantom apparently it's like one of their collector limited-edition coffees oh and something else I forgot to tell you phantom if you're a huge fan of The Death Wish they have limited edition um you know the game for honor they have limited edition for honor coffee bags they have the samurai one the Viking one and then the knight one and it's like yellow blue and red coffee bags from The Death Wish Company and apparently they're I think they're all the same flavor I'm not entirely sure or they could be all different ones but um they last time I looked it was like a month and a half ago and they're all like limited edition like Death Wish coffee flavors I don't I think that something that would interest you a Ponty or super Silver Haze dude I've had super Silver Haze before I haven't actually had that strain in months in the UK they come down hard on drugs very strict damn I'm so sorry to hear that like especially well especially sense of what happened now in the UK that terrorist attack that happened in the UK um that definitely scared of shitload of people kupo it's a false-flag mate one but huh come dog drill head Kim Jeong drill that's it let's go what's going on ever heard of Blackwater og yes I have that stuff is dinky dinky dink

three-lane game it's a MOBA you have three lanes you have your minions you have your tower you have your inhibitor in the back and then you have your core okay imagine League of Legends but instead of looking at it like you're looking at it from a screen and you look at it 2d and everything you know imagine being up close in you're actually from a 3d person point of view like you're literally like three feet behind your character and you're not just looking at it from like an aerial view you're literally like right behind your person and you get to control that up close and it's amazing and just to put the icing on the cake Paragon is still in beta mode so I think it's still free to download um and on top of it it's a cross um it's a cross system game which means um I it's a PC and ps4

Monday product review so check it out for today's video I'm going to be dabbing and trying some of this Narnia by echo man this is something I've been waiting to try and they they used to at the dispensary where I'm at I know it's different everywhere else but at the dispensary I'm at they used to sell these grams for like 60 70 80 dollars a pop so I kind of waited for them to drop I got this one from recreational ghosts $36 gram for this then I purchased it medically at about 30 about 30 flat so not bad okay this is the narnia this is a sugar wax this is by echo and this is 8.5% terpenes

just terpenes that's not THC or CBD right there here's our product now what is this 77 percent THC with no CBD so that's what it says here at the bottom 77 percent it also says three to the B three percent three to the B shares the love between humans cannabis and bees three percent of our proceeds are donated to honeybee health a native bee home okay so they're helping the bees 30 percent of their proceeds go to helping bees bee habitat stuff like that that is amazing and that itself to me is just fantastic okay any company that's trying to help the environment any company that's just

welcome to Pacific Northwest cannabis my name is Zach couldn't do a little wake and bake this morning it's kind of a quick little check-in it's been a while since I said hang oh so good so I picked this fleek leaf up last night I got the 14 gram otherwise known as a half ounce really really good you guys I wish my lighting and there's a little bit better I'll be working on that at the new spot but hello you guys forbidden punch skunk haze Northern Lights that Northern Lights really really dark flavor smells really good everything super crusty all the nuts super nice and dense so we're gonna load that up this morning we're gonna take a couple of puffs I do a couple of breathing exercises get ready for work we got work at the dispensary today nirvana East Washington fear in the area swing by see your boy bison fleek you will not be disappointed um let's see what also going on well I did a phone interview yesterday we were pretty well company held high 509 cannabis they are out of four for tchard Washington which is great cuz that's kind of where I want to move to so wish me luck on that I thought I did well on the interview I'm a really good dispensary employee because I believe in keeping track of inventory and keeping stuff clean and customer service I hope it works out the people i zoom we did a little zoom conference meeting with they seemed really cool asked some really great questions so I really hope that goes well it's the weekend so I'm not really expecting to hear back from them until on Monday Tuesday of next week maybe not really worried about anything I know ever worry about background checks or calling my ex employees or anybody or max employers I never walk out anywhere in a huff never like trash cans on fire and [ __ ] like that just send off some positive vibes give your voice and loves into the universe and I'll pick that up I asked the universe to put me where it wants me I've been feeling a drawback to the portal turn area from years now the whole time I was in Las Vegas I talked about moving back up here when I finally moved up here instead of porta workers I thought I had a job I just need to be in Port Orchard so that's where you want me universe put me there um we're gonna take this quick dab get our endocannabinoids systems jump-started and add some flour add those additional photo cannabinoids really make sure that I would get a nice entourage effect so this is going to be the last of my strawberry banana slab mechanics another really really great product you guys for in the Pacific northwestern in Washington State check them out super good on the cost I think was like 20 bucks for the g4 I'm sorry $20 for the gram it was nice down super nice good feel quick quick quick body fill for me not a doctor I'll cure the diagnosis or giving me medical advice but for me the body filled with this was really fast so the spread loves close to human thought oh-oh-oh mechanics is definitely do it right I'm not gonna just forbidden puncture the grinder you guys finger grind it top of my bowl always get me out give me a second to recover let that a kick in ask you what that does to you lando cab annoyed system and then uh if we need to Oh cake some flour kind of balance it out I got plenty of time before work this is a sativa smoke money last night with my roommate when I came home and both of us got really high neither one of us really got like dopey you're sleepy or silly or anything so I think I'll be fine for work gonna let this dab kick in that feels better right some oxygen some cannabinoids start to get that nice wash body fill till the kanab when I start to kicking in start to get the body filler that dab I don't really do concentrates too much you guys they're super hard on my lungs I've been smoking for almost 30 years now too stupid to quit so my lungs are trash I loved abs the idea of being able to take a small amount very concentrated cannabinoids all in one shot jumpstart everything I love the idea what you need to know about concentrates versus flour it's very simple there are more individual cannabinoids and flour up and down both sides of the spectrum CBD and THC then there are in concentrate so I want you trying to concentrate that has the concentrated cannabinoids that really affect you try to stick with it I know it's super hard because I've been at the dispensary going on a couple weeks now and I see that our inventory it's not where it needs to be like it's not like Target it's not like Safeway it's not like 7-eleven it's not like we get deliveries every day and we once we get a product and we'll always keep it stocked like that's not that's not how the cannabis industry works the farm grows something they only get a certain yield of something and then they send it to the processors they only give a certain yield then they send it to us they may not have the same yield on that same strain on their next grow if it's less we may not get it because the producers may have to use all of that product into a flower bag versus into a concentrate so we may have entire harvests where they don't process any of those concentrates for the market and that's really hard flour is a little more consistent because if you find people who were grown on the actual strains that they're saying they are you can find some consistency and that can get the same strain every single time smoked your flour you know you're getting the cannabinoids really affect you physically we all react differently that's why different people smoke different strains and have a different effect I find strains and work growth what really well for me a couple years ago I found this lemon see OTO and it's just bombs exactly what I need the cannabinoids that were left over in the lemon OG are exactly the ones that get my pain centers takes away all my back pain takes away all my shoulder pain just lets me live my life like I'm not a [ __ ] and I can actually do stuff so I found it I loved it from when I'm out of it I'm gonna find some more of it but really find something that really hits you I really like this lab mechanics the consistencies been really nice the flavors been really nice and it gives me a nice body wash so I literally feel like a cloud come over me and I can feel the cannabinoids starting to connect and kind of give me some relief it's not the hi-- indica pain relief and it's definitely not an opioid pain relief so if you're looking for that you don't want to do as a kiva this is more of a body feel more of a body relaxing but it's definitely kicked in smoke that about five minutes ago so got about a five-minute for me and my body type about a five-minute head feel so I don't think I'm gonna introduce me more cannabinoids we're just gonna take a sip relax I've got work today it's the weekend a lot of people working on the weekend now they're starting to open things back up like we're trying to get back to normal I'm not saying a new normal I'm not wearing a mask I'm not a doctor not here to give you any medical advice but I just went back to normal and we'll just figure it out from there so I'm just gonna kind of think about my day from any negative thoughts that I have leftover from yesterday I wasn't able to process I'm gonna breathe in positive energy you're gonna let that positive energy take ahold of that thought and then I'm gonna exhale I'm gonna let that thought out with that energy now I'm gonna breathe in and I'm gonna fill the void so the important part is this is for me this is the important part I'm gonna fill the void left by that negative spot with the next positive breath that I bring in because if I leave that void empty another thought will pop in and that next thought may not be positive and then I got to start the process over bring that one out to breathe out breathe in whatever's going on think about it out of your control just let it go should be a little spot where it was a little bit positive interview the universe is going to bring to us the energy that we put out into the universe so get rid of these negative thoughts from your thought cycle just putting positivity if you're already thinking positive thoughts if things are going your way if you're building a business for starting a family you're building a house anything that's going positive for you just concentrate on that you don't have to breathe that out just breathe the power into that box I'm thinking about this job in Port Orchard right now I don't have any negativity going on I'm just saying this is where you want me put me here breathe some energy into it this is where I can make the difference that you want me to make in people's lives put me in Port Orchard breathe some energy into it I've got some new people in my life if they're supposed to be there to help me on this journey let them be there breathe into it okay I have conversations with people in my head all the time all day long that are never gonna happens every single every single thing that you can say I've thought that you've said and I thought an answer for and it's maddening I learned this technique as a way to shut those conversations down so I can clear my energy in my process up to push myself forward as long as we're dwelling on this negativity we're not moving forward so we're gonna take a couple more minutes I'm gonna reintroduce some cannabinoids total full plant photo cannabinoids so we get a nice full spread should mellow out this head fill that I got from that dab and you should add to the body fill that I picked up from it it's a really good combination I'm really happy that I picked up the forbidden punch if you guys are in the Pacific Northwest definitely check out fleek leaf I've tried a lot of their products really good flavor there's somebody over there that is making sure that these buds are cured properly not tried not processed cured proper if you know you don't if you don't know figure it out because that's the difference between quality bud and harshly curing and drying this is being cure you can tell you know you know definitely check them out get some

not good for people like me got some ongoing medical issues or mental issues I deal with cannabis and meditation and yoga so for me it's no big deal like as much as I love interacting with people I don't like being out in public so for me in locked at the house no problem but it causes a social anxiety and a social stress that I think a lot of us are really starting to feel so let's just be

clouds and I'll catch you next time", "g8dBnYoMphw": "ah i did that too slow shh [Music] on youtube [Music] hello and thank you for clicking on this video this video is a little bit of a different one a strange one i might regret one but we're gonna do it i'm going to be trying out at home for the first time ever and not only at home i have never ever tried waxing so i have no idea whatsoever what the pain is like what it feels like literally nothing i've been sent some wax from sugar coated and this is their vegan sugar wax is registered as vegan water-soluble 100 natural eco-friendly and leaping bunny certified which obviously everything in there is like first of all if you're going to get a wax kit then you want it to be all those things and the next thing is so this is by sugar coated the smell the smell of this product honestly it literally smells like sticky toffee pudding honestly when i first smelt it let me get it open oh my god honestly i feel like i could eat it you probably could even eat it because it's that natural i'm not gonna i'm not going to eat it but i'm just saying you might be able to um so i really love the packaging first of all of this brand and so everything it's got like a really cool design of like some bikini stuff wax and stuff like that so it does say bikini hair removal kit but it isn't just for your bikini line you can use it on your legs on your underarm obviously also your bikini line so i'm just going to open up the little instruction pamphlet here i literally haven't tried this yet this is the first time i'm trying it so it's very new to me and i don't really know what i'm doing so getting started heating our vegan sugar wax we have to eat it up so in the microwave you remove the lid from the jar place the jar on a plate place it in the microwave for 40 seconds please be careful when taking out the jar at the microwave please hold the plate instead of the jar stir thoroughly and you get these little sticks stir foil the consistency should be that of ronny honey please note the temperature should be warm and not hot if not warm enough heat and 10 second intervals so that is what we're gonna do do a patch test oh i'm gonna have to do a patch test first and wait a couple of hours so i'm gonna go and heat that up i'll do a little patch test and we will see how we get on just a little pre-warning i have been growing my leg hair for this for at least two weeks maybe even more and they are long the hairs are long they are a little bit crazy right now but i did all for the video oh my god it's so hairy that might be the hairiest my legs have ever been that i've left them too let's go and heat this bad boy up so i'm back and i've heated the wax up so i'm just going to show you the consistency that it is so i think this is the consistency supposed to be supposed to be running like honey the sound quality isn't as good as before it's because i've had to unplug my mic and the mic that i use is attached to the camera and i think to do this i'm not going to be close enough to be able to use that so i do apologize if the sound isn't as great as before and i'm going to pop this down and put a towel down just because when i was walking upstairs i had visions that i was just going to fall with this and basically just go flat on my face and wax would go all upstairs and i don't want any wax to get anywhere so i'm just going to pop a towel down and then we're going to carry on so i don't know whether from the angle that you're at and the lighting whether you'll be able to see how hairy my legs are so i'm going to take a picture of the before and then we're going to do an after picture so we've got legs this is the correct sitting position for sugaring legs so i've got to get my leg sort of as high up like that as i can um apply wax thinly in the direction of the hair growth which is downwards so we're going to apply it down apply firm pressure to the spatula to achieve a thin film of wax the maximum area you can apply at one time is the same as the strip apply the strip and quickly and firmly flick back against the direction of the hair growth so we're doing it upwards like that and we're going to apply so we need to get the strips out i don't know if this is going to be enough strips for my legs no it should be so you can't do it any thicker than the strip so we're going to start off about there so you can see what i'm doing i was going to zoom in and show you like a zoomed in thing but then i was thinking you're probably not going to be able to see my reaction and that is going to be part of this video oh did it say in the direction oh no down like that i think i don't know if you can see that i'm a better moving my leg back there we go so apply down oh my god i'm so scared now ah what am i doing what am i doing so just going to dip into a little bit more wax i'm really really hoping that you can hear me because i never use this camera without the microphone so i hope that it's not too bad i will put too much on there maybe a little bit wider i don't want to do it i don't want to do it now no i do it's fine it's going to be fine people get waxes all the time i'm gonna pop the strip on i don't think i can do this you could i'm gonna have to now the wax is on press it down firmly onto the skin i can i'm so nervous oh my goodness what am i doing i don't want to take it off now i'm just going to keep pressing it for a little bit longer so that i can prepare myself for what's about to come can i do this i can but you've got to do it in one end yeah if i do a bit and then stop i'm gonna it's gonna be worse isn't it i can't okay i'm gonna cut myself down we're gonna pull in three two one i knew we weren't gonna do that okay we're gonna try again we're gonna pull in three two one i can't do it someone else is gonna have to come and do this for me three two one oh oh did it hurt it hurt a bit i don't know whether that hurt me on no i don't think it did ah oh my god it's so smooth oh god look at all the hairs uh oh my goodness so i'm gonna take a photo of where i'm up to so i can pop it on the screen because i really don't think you'll be able to see from where you are i'm pretty impressed with that actually so don't need to fold that up so a thin layer do you know what i do have my eyebrows waxed but there's something a bit different one about doing it yourself to doing it at home by yourself and obviously also you're not a trained professional but i feel like i've done a pretty good job with that first bit i'm super super impressed with this actually i really would recommend doing this and i know i've only done one strip so i might change my mind but at this moment in time how smooth that leg is i have never seen it that smooth from shaving wax strip number two so i'm just gonna press that down my goodness i'm so i'm still nervous it didn't hurt last time but you know when it's just like i don't know are we ready why am i doing this okay okay we're gonna do this in three two one go ah i did that too slow oh that one hurt more than the other one ah i did that way too slow i could tell ah oh you know i'd swear on youtube oh my god that yeah that one hurt i'm gonna do some more around the sides for that once the strips on there's no going back because the only way to get that strip off is to rip it off that's on there just going to grab it from the bottom nervous again we're going to pull in three two one ah did it slow again it really isn't an unbearable pain it just stings it's just like getting your eyebrows done like most people have had some form of waxing at some point in fact i'm gonna do round this area now so i had to leave this on for a bit longer because i needed to change the battery pack in my light so i'm hoping that this doesn't affect how much it hurts because i've had it on for quite a while now so we're going to get it off and we're going to pull three two one oh god okay come on demi we've still got another leg to go here i'm gonna pull it off in three two one ah okay that didn't hurt as much it hurts it literally does hurt for like a second but it's not like a pain that's unbearable because i wouldn't carry on if it was so i've probably got one strip there one strip there maybe this bit here to go so i'm gonna do that and then i'm gonna come back and show you the results i'm not gonna do both legs obviously on camera because we're gonna be sat here all night watching me count to three and then not actually pull it but i'm gonna show you the finished results so i will be back shortly i'm back i've finished my legs and i need to say a couple of things when i was still downstairs heating the pot up i thought wow what if this hurts this actually might hurt and don't get me wrong the first couple did hurt but when i say her i mean like it didn't hurt as in like it was painful it more was like if you've had your eyebrows waxed then you'll know when that strip's pulled off it's just a tiny little and then that's the only bit of if that's the only bit of pain it's the same with this but actually probably hurts less than eyebrows just because this bit of your face is actually really sensitive and the skin is a lot thinner around your eyes and obviously on your legs it's a lot thicker i'm actually really impressed with this my leg feels so so smooth so i finished everything off i've took a little after picture so i guess i could put like the before and after side by side here and show you exactly what it looks like before and after and i hope it will come through on pictures and on the screen properly but hopefully it should um in terms of the product itself i definitely would recommend this it smells really really good and the only thing i would say what i should have done what i probably didn't do is the wax starts to cool down a little bit obviously you're melting it in the microwave and it's not in an actual wax heater and so if you can see now it started to go a little bit thicker again whereas when i took it out of the microwave it was really really run air showed you how it looked the consistency then and so i would say bang it back in the microwave for 10 seconds before you go over to say your second leg and just because you want to keep that wax warm i noticed that it was a bit more difficult to put on as well as get off when it started to cool down so that is a top tip that i would recommend so i'm gonna pop their website and their socials down below you can purchase these at sugarcoatedhairremoval.com um and also take a look at their instagram this is not sponsored i was gifted this product to review however i am not required to one provide a review or to provide a positive review this what i've shown you is literally me just like trying something out and being honest i think i'm gonna get in the bath now and just really make sure that i've got everything off and then get out and put some really nice moisturizer on like imagine how good my legs are gonna feel when i get in bed tonight i'm so so excited you might be thinking i can shave my legs in the bath of the shower and it doesn't cause me any pain whatsoever and but waxing can last three to six weeks which obviously is a very long time for me my underarms i shave them pretty much every time i have a shower maybe like every other day turns in my legs they definitely need doing twice a week to be kept really clean and so it is definitely a way of making sure that it's a lot lower maintenance you obviously saw how long it took me to do that like it really doesn't take that long and it doesn't take as long if you are not sat there going three two one go and then not actually doing those wax strips thank you very much for watching this video i hope that you enjoyed it and i hope to see you here again very very soon thank [Music] [Applause] round in you screaming out your name", "nLZUcF3Nggc": "with us transitioning into spring and we are going to be bearing more skin I wanted to share with you guys one of my favorite methods of removing unwanted hair have you ever heard of sugaring sugaring is an alternative method to waxing the reason why I prefer sugaring over waxing is number one it's easier to do by yourself not to mention is more gentle on the skin and it's so much less hassle so much less work with waxing it seems kind of like a big ordeal because you have to heat up the wax you have to have the strip's you have to have to stick to you have to have all this stuff I get it I know people ask me all the time what are the best ways to remove hair they ask me because a certain method hasn't worked out whether it's shaving because they are irritated and red and bumpy and raschi or waxing and it's the same result at that point you're like I don't know what's worse the itchy rashy redness or the hair the reason my trucker may smooth is my very favorite it's all natural hello all of that it's also so good for your skin and they break it down so it's easy there's face wax and then there's body wax and it comes with applicators they're just like little plastic credit cards that's about the size and the fill of them and that is what you use to apply the sugar so let me show you how you use it because it's just this really easy kind of flicking technique you take the sugar which by the way it smells so good I'm like can you frost cookies with it - after you get done cutting your arms by the way I feel like this would be a really funny and fun date night experiment you could um you know like watch your boyfriend's back or chest or abs just see how tough ii really is or your husband oh no i'm simply showing you how to do this for the technique of how you apply it and remove it but i will put a link to the video that they have where you can actually see how great of a job it does in removing their first step is make sure your skin is clean and dry then you put the sugar on the applicator and what you want to do is wipe over your skin three times because that's what's heating it up and with this the more you use it the easier it is Flik once again you take the sugar and swipe it three times just to warm it up and then do the flicking motion isn't this so amazing okay I'm gonna do it on the upper part of my arm to show you guys as well one two three and flip and then you can just keep going you get into this motion in this rhythm and I usually do a lot more but because I'm filming and trying to show you guys anyway they do have other products and you can go to their website I'll put the link below pre and post eggs and they also have these sugar scrubs which are amazing and the lemon one is my favorite so here's two sugaring and bearing it all", "HiMWdJTrcIg": "hello

bit of sugar helps the medicine go down now what about today's lesson i'm going to talk about a man by the name of a.w tozer you ever heard of him here's his book it's entitled the knowledge of the holy and it's the attributes of god i'm going to use this as my stepping stone for our class today you ever heard of tozer today i'm going to tell you who he was and i'm going to tell you what he did and finally i'm going to give you one of the greatest theology books i think that's ever been written okay a.w tozer who was he his name is aiden wilson tozer that's his aw he was born april 21st 19 or 1897 in newberry pennsylvania he never went to high school he never then went to university he quit school at the end of elementary school when he was 14 years old but when his life was over he had earned two honorary doctors degrees phd's from two of the elite universities in the christian circle one was wheaton college and the other was houghton university tozer grew up in a little tiny farm over there in the community of west pennsylvania parents were very poor they had a tiny farm and they suffered all kinds of hardships when he was converted to christianity as a teenager he was working in a tire factory in akron ohio it was just over the border in the next state on his way home from the tire factory one night after he'd finished his day's work he stopped to hear a street preacher who was waxing elegant on the corner and he overheard these words if you don't know how to be a christian just call on god and say the following lord please be merciful to me a sinner when tozer got home he went up to the attic on his dad's farm in the house and the rest is history he got out his bible and he began to read his bible he was just saturated with what he read old testament new testament and in that reading god found a moses an old-fashioned moses because that's what was going to happen in the life of a.w tozer at that moment tozer felt the call to become a preacher he stayed at the tire factory for the next five years but every night he couldn't wait to get home to open his bible and study and he did and he memorized old testament and new testament and he was self-taught self-educated amazing man and then after five years working at the tire factory over in akron he thought i'm going to see if i can get a job preaching well he noticed in the paper there was an ad requesting a preacher to apply in a little town called nutterfolk west virginia never heard of it he went over and he applied and he went to the pulpit committee and they asked him what training do you have mr tozer he said god taught me huh did you go to seminary no well how do you know you're the man that god's called for us he said let me preach so they did he went down one sunday he got to the pulpit and he preached that began 44 years of public ministry that church was in the christian missionary alliance group and having preached there that young preacher was so gifted that his personality began to spread and so did his reputation and from there he went to the southside alliance church in chicago and he pastored that church for 30 years the final leg of his life was where i met him i shook his hand i knew this man only once i was a student at seminary in 1959 and his church avenue road alliance church was just three blocks around the corner from where our dormitory was and one sunday i went to hear him now remember this man was born in poverty he was self-educated he had no high school he had no university training and he actually suddenly became in his ministry the written voice of the modern church he published 40 books his most famous publish was this one here the knowledge of the holy as a matter of fact of the 50 best books ever written in the united states by an author that one is included i had another one in my library it's called the divine conquest that is also an aw tozer it's not as good as that one but it's a lovely book in 1948 he published the book knowledge of the holy i'm going to tell you the highlights of that book from my class today before i do let me tell you the sunday that i went to his church and i met and shook hands with a.w tozer i was a student at the seminary and when i went over the place was full his auditorium sat over 2500 they had a circular balcony around the whole church and as many sat up there sat down below i sat in the very back of that balcony and it was time to preach upstood this short little man he only came up to hear on me he looked like mr magu and here was this massive pulpit at abner road church oak and when he got up to preach he had to stand on an orange crate and when he preached a wonderful sense of humor lovely delivery and you'd have thought he was a trumpet well anyway people would laugh they took notes everybody carried a bible they couldn't write fast enough when he was speaking over in the corner of that large balcony i remember i'm sitting at the back and i could see it is a whole host of students do you know where they were from osgoode hall well osgood hall is the canadian law school in toronto down on queen street and the professors used to send their students up to avenue road church to hear him preach and you know why they sent him because one day you students you're going to have a client and you're going to have to stand in front of the judge and you're going to have to represent that client well and here's how well you're going to represent him you're going to say to the judge the clarity that you learned from listening to tozer preach i want you to follow his logic i want you to follow his outline i want you to hear his conclusion and when you're done that judge he should be able to understand what you're saying about that client so here they were they're all there they're taking notes and they weren't christians and i don't even know if their professor was but they wanted to see excellence in delivery excellence in speech and excellence in understanding and knowledge anyway that's what they did and that's what i saw on the way out he stood at the door and i shook his hand and here was this little magoo and i said thank you so much sir this has been my crowning moment and that's all i remembered him well tozer had a wife and they had seven children six boys and one girl but you know what tozer did now remember living in north america can you imagine this he never had a driver's license i can't imagine living in this country without a driver's license when i had my three kids growing up they all had summer jobs and when i'd come to work i'd drop them all off all at different stores one went into the canadian tire the other i dropped off over its safeway and the other went down to polo ralph lauren now when they were getting older and heading off to university we got another car and the kids always named my cars the best car we had was our family sedan and it was 15 years old they call it florence well we had another car when the kids were learning to drive and it leaked oil they called it fluid and i was so ashamed because i said listen don't you dare take that car to any of our friends in the church because they said i'll never come back because it leaks well then the last thing i had a pickup truck and the pickup truck was wonderful it was all rust it was terrible as a matter of fact it's almost like that uh ad that you see for the cough medicine buckley's it tastes terrible but it works well we call him floyd floyd looked terrible but he worked now if i had three cars and that was the life as my kids were growing up and tozer had seven kids and he didn't drive do you know what he used to do when he'd call his deacons they would join the church to become part of this board so that he could use them as his transportation to go and visit his parishioners isn't that cute in other words he used public transportation or he used the deacons in the church after becoming a well-known author tozer signed away all his royalties he never kept any of the royalties of the books he wrote for himself all the royalties went to people and those in need that's amazing man all right having said that and that's his introduction i'm going to give you three attributes he's got a whole two of them but i'm only going to give you three today in our class and i'll illustrate each one of them now the three attributes that i'm going to talk about is the love of god the mercy of god and the goodness of god now what brings tozer to my mind for this lesson in the knowledge of the holy it's a book about god's attributes meaning our christian life how do we walk how do i behave how do i look as a christian to the world i can hear you saying well run what is an attribute well tozer devotes a whole chapter to each attribute in his book and he's talking about the wisdom of god the faithfulness of god the goodness of god the justice of god the mercy of god the grace of god the love of god the holiness of god the sovereignty of god on and on he goes i'm only going to talk about three the love of god the mercy of god and the goodness of god and i'm going to try and illustrate it for you tozer's opening theme to his book he finds a way back in the book of proverbs chapter 9 verse 10. here's where he got his name for his book the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding he devotes an entire book talking about how we're going to understand who god is and there's no better book written i don't think that gives us a sense of the fear of the lord than this book and in the list of the 50 most important books ever written as i said in the united states that's one of them it's a book on systematic theology it's clear it's simple it's very articulate and what tozer says how you cherish your thoughts about who god is will will determine how you live your life that's really the theme of the book and i find the book it's sound it's wholesome it's inspiring it's a treaty of what the bible is really talking about you know where i buy a lot of my books i go to the thrift store and the reason i go there is because in most thrift stores they have a large large section of books that people just give away and many of the books are religious books and they're wonderful books as a matter of fact i picked up this book knowledge of the holy and it cost me 50 cents when i go into a bookstore and it's a thrift shop i pretend it's my cigarette money now i don't smoke but i pretend if i were smoking you'd probably spend me 10 bucks that day for my cigarettes so i go out with 10 worth of books and i almost have a hernia because when i carry it to my book i've got two bags full and it didn't cost me 10 bucks anyway that's just a little hint on how you're going to go and get the book now you can get it on amazon and you can download it but go to the thrift shop there'll be one there that book has been printed in millions of copies so there'll be one there for you why am i telling you this in our story about the love of god the mercy of god and the goodness of god i'm going to give you his attributes and how he unfolded them but then i'm going to illustrate it from my life he says that god has declared us an unchanging love in jesus christ when you find it it'll cast out fear your troubled heart will be at peace and then john wrote god is love have you ever seen the love of god up close we'll use that as our first attribute do you remember the words of martin luther the body they may kill god's truth abide us still but his kingdom is forever brentfew baptist this week had a funeral it was on friday i was there we laid to rest one of our church's greatest daughters her name was gloria nemes she died just short of her 70th birthday she's the wife of the husband dan they have two grown daughters larissa and crystal they have six grandchildren for years and years all gloria did at brentford church was share the love of god her dining room table every sunday became a guest host for strangers that came to our church they would invite them home they'd feed them that was gloria that was the love of god scores and newcomers became members of the church because of her inviting them in gloria was one of our lead teachers in our sunday school and she was also one of our lead instructors and our pioneer girls when mustard seed downtown was just starting up and they were feeding hundreds of homeless street people people would volunteer to go down and take the whole night and bring the dinner and feed a hundred of these people that came off the street gloria and dan did it with her two daughters and gloria would take these huge vats and make homemade chili two of them and then she would make two big hampers of homemade buns and down they would go and the girls would say to mom and dad what are we gonna say when we serve these i don't know how to talk to old people or people are off the street gloria said don't worry about it you just go and put that into their bowl and hand them that with the buns and you just watch what they say to you gloria did this twice a month year in and year out talk about the love of god talk about the church and overalls that was it she was there feeding them well i think when i look at gloria and i saw her life that beautiful soprano voice singing right behind my ear every sunday morning in our chancel choir she was the cook in the summer time up at camp caroline she just spared her time she was a cook in our kitchen as well i saw the attribute of god's love flowing right through that whole nemes family but ten years ago gloria came down with an illness and that changed her and it changed dan and it changed the two daughters i watched it happen the illness was called progressive supranuclear palsy or what's that it's kind of a muscular dystrophy coupled with lou gehrig's disease it was a funny name but it had a horrible horrible side effect it affected her brain and i watched that beautiful girl who practiced the love of god deteriorate she couldn't feed herself anymore she couldn't talk she couldn't get into bed for 10 years dan became her florence nightingale and you know as i watched this all this flooded through my mind as i was at the funeral where she passed away on set on friday and i don't think there's been any church that's seen a glorious glorious lady celebrated like ours and you know that wretched illness that took her voice she couldn't sing anymore it crept into her muscles she couldn't lift her hands she couldn't feed herself it took her speech she couldn't walk that love of god that gloria displayed so unwaveringly disappeared but you know what picked it up dan did she faded but dan didn't fade and you know we saw the love of god carry right on through through that husband and gloria you had a real prince of a man and dan i can just tell you that he showed brentview church what the nema's name was all about dan would come home from work and he'd bring his panel truck during the day they had home care come in and then dan would come home and what he would do he would puree the dinner and he would feed gloria for an hour and a half every night he never turned the television on because he didn't want to have any interruptions and there are the two of them he would feed her and she could only look at him and they did that for all those years i didn't have to read my bible to find out where the love of god was i saw it in gloria first and then i saw it in dan dan could probably identify with that beautiful hymn martin luther's the body they may kill god's truth abide us still his kingdom is forever and you know what i saw in gloria and what i saw in dan is now living out in the two daughters and the grandchildren you know those grandchildren sat through an hour and a half service and they never made a peep beautiful little things gloria would have been so proud to see your family carrying on what she had already shown us the love of god all right i've got a second attribute it's called the mercy of god tozer mentions this lord how shall we thank thee thy mercy which comes down to the lowest part of our need to give us beauty for ashes oil for the joy of mourning and for the spirit of heaviness a garment of praise mercy is an attribute tozer tells us of god it dispenses compassion and both the old and the new testament proclaim that mercy i like the words of that old hymn you and i saw it when all thy mercies oh my god my rising soul surveys transported with the view i'm lost in wonder love and praise louis armstrong do you remember him his full name was louis daniel armstrong born august the 4th 1901 he died july the 6th 1971 his next his nickname was sachimol he was an american trumpeter you remember him as having that gravelly voice when he would talk but you know what he did jazz music became his mouthpiece and he was to jazz music to what beethoven and mozart was the classical music as a matter of fact he was also a wonderful actor he got involved in hollywood and he starred alongside bing crosby grace kelly frank sinatra and barbra streisand do you remember that song that he used to sing hello dolly with that gravelly voice i can tell you his background and how he started and why he became famous now you talk about the mercy of god listen to this louis armstrong was the grandson of slaves he was born to the poorest neighborhood in new orleans louisiana his father abandoned the family when he was just an infant his mother became a prostitute when he was just a child he was turned over to his grandmother along with his sister to grow up there they lived in the poorest conditions louis had a gift for music at the age of seven he'd go down to the bourbon street and sing and he put his little hat on the sidewalk at his feet and he became a little singing beggar a jewish family immigrated from russia and they settled in new orleans and one night when they were downtown walking the streets they came across this cute little colored boy who was singing in front of his hat there on the sidewalk the couple listened that enjoyed his singing and they were quite taken by this little boy what's your name louie louie what it's louis armstrong sir the couple said to him we could use a little boy at our house as a helper around can you cut the grass yep can you do dishes yup can you sweep yeah can you wash some windows yep they went to the grandmother and they said to grandma grandma this little boy that you're raising could we have him come and help us at our house we will pay him and we'll pray it pay him handsomely and we'll watch over him if you let him go grandma said sure if he wants to he's a good little worker he'd help you do that that night on the streets of new orleans a little boy his life was about to change his grandma met the russian couple and the russian couple also met his little sister and louis he would go home on the weekends and he would work for this couple and when they would work they would pay him their name last name was carnosky they came from lithuania over in russia louis armstrong and his little sister had never been treated by such kindness and tenderness because louis brought his sister along to help him out some of the times when he was there one day mrs karnovsky the jewish couple with the husband came to grandma and they made an astounding request they asked louie's grandma if they could adopt louie and his little sister their request was granted louie and his sister were filled out the papers and it became legal and louis and his little sister became the children of the kanatskis there in their home well they had the children finally they'd never had before the ones they had wanted here they were a brother and a sister each night the new mother she would sing to them russian lullabies their new parents taught them the russian language louis and his sister were fluent in russia it gets better they took them to the synagogue louis learned to speak yiddish and his yiddish language was pure hebrew and often when the cantor was playing guess who played with him he sang and louis played the trumpet because his father had said to him louis you're going to have to play an instrument what would you like to play he said i want to play a trumpet that'll be fine we'll go get you a lesson they got the best trumpet teacher in all of louisiana to come and teach and the rest was history louis often would go back to the synagogue and teach he actually became very popular among their conventions and conferences as their guest speaker he would speak and then he would play his trumpet on his lapel he wore the star of david all his life one day when he was later into his teens his mum and dad took him back to lithuania to meet their former family and they introduced him this is our son louie this is his sister well louie became very famous he was the one that composed that song go down david or rather go down moses often in his older years armstrong became so well known they called him satchmo do you know where the term sachimo comes from it's a yiddish word did you know that and it means puff cheeks anytime you saw louis armstrong play his trumpet his cheeks would puff out and that's why they called him sachimo that's what his dad called him louis armstrong the little black boy with no future no education he became a student and he became a granny women winning musician and most of all he said i learned that there was a god and that god showed me mercy and i learned what real life was like and my new dad and my new mom taught me determination i never knew that word but now i have it and it's become me all because he found mercy one day when he was playing or singing on the streets of new orleans talk about the mercy of god that's an attribute can you remember who touched your life who came into your life maybe they're not your adopted parents but who came in and gave you that hope i think there's hope there if we can only we've got something to give i want you to start sharing it would you well finally let me give you one more attribute it's called the goodness of god what it means god's goodness is that which he disposes on man and when he's kind cordial benevolent and full of good will you suddenly become tender hearted and when god bestows you that tender hardness you become that when he bestows blessedness you become a blessing to others and he takes that pleasured plate happiness will be his people that show goodness of god when i was in grade four i had a school teacher and she showed me goodness that changed my life nobody knows this story i think it's the first time i ever told it you'll re you won't remember this but years ago back in ontario in the public school system there were inspectors that were hired and they would drop into a classroom and examine the work of a school teacher and they would come in unannounced completely out of the blue they'd sit at the back of the class take notes they'd criticize the the teacher and then after the class is over tell them what they did i can't imagine teachers enjoying that i bet they hated that well one day i saw it all happen right in front of the class after lunch our teacher would read us a story as a class and i love that because the stories were exciting and she was a great reader and i just got caught right on i just couldn't wait for her to tell the story every day after lunch well she was about to start reading the story and guess what happened in came the inspector unannounced well i watched this teacher spot him seeing and he went and sat in the corner and i watched her whole complexion changed her face blushed she turned red and we students didn't know what was going on but she did something completely out of the ordinary at that moment she decided she wasn't going to read well what'd she do she looked at her class and she said class i'm going to have one of you come up and read the story for us today then she said i wonder ronnie kernahan if you'd come up and take my book and would you read the story to the class i almost froze i obeyed i left my desk i went up she handed me the book and i opened the book and then i said to her what's the story about she said it's about a little boy that lost his door right so i turned around i looked at the audience of my friends and i read the story once upon a time there's a little boy named billy he had a dog called lightning and i read on and on the little dog got lost and they couldn't find him they looked everywhere finally late in the afternoon they found they heard a whipper and he was down along the creek and he got his foot caught in a muskrat trap and it broke his leg and he couldn't get out and their little billy found him and he went down and he did the best he could to take that trap apart so the dog could lift his leg up and he couldn't walk and he took the dog and he brought it down his arm and he took it back to his mom and there in the farmhouse they wrapped up the little leg and the dog was found and they lived happily ever after well i handed the book back to the teacher and in the corner sat this inspector and guess what he did that was great well she went over she met him they gave us some school work to do at our desk the afternoon went by finally he left and the bell rang and we left but on the way out the teacher said to me uh ronnie before you go just i want to talk to you a minute well everybody left and i went to the desk and she took her book and she opened it to the story and she handed it to me and she says no would you read this for me and i looked at her and i said i can't read. well i knew i was going to get the strap but you know what she did instead of chastising me and putting me down and punishing me she came around behind the desk and came over and she gave me a hug and she said to me i'm going to teach you how to read every night when the school is out you're going to stay 15 minutes and i'm going to show you how you are going to learn to read that whole year she did faithfully every night when everybody was gone nobody knew about it i just waited and suddenly they were gone and i went to her desk and she taught me the rudiments of how to be a reader she taught me phonics how to pronounce she taught me how to pause she taught me how to reflect everything that was her and you know what that had to be the goodness of god i would have never even been reading today if it wasn't for her but she saw a little boy something that had a spark and if i could just take that spark and maybe just fan it a bit it may burn into a little wood well that's what she did well this is the story i've given you today about this thing called a.w tozer and you know i like that because tozer i found to be a wonderful friend that book i've used a long time and out of his goodness i talked about the love of god the mercy of god and the goodness of god i can see the time is up i want you if you can get a hold of the book and if you can run over to the store thrift store and you can shell out 50 cents i'm sure you won't pay any more than that use it because you know what if you have this and you also have it coupled with your bible your pure gold you're going to get a systematic theology story that you have never found you'd go to seminary it wouldn't be as good as that okay with class over let me end with a little note from the sunny side of the street i like to do that with my class put a smile on your face before i go you know since we've all been locked up sometimes we eat too much we don't exercise enough i have a little jingle that i want you to learn hi diddle diddle my fats in the middle and i'm hoping to whittle it soon i won't get much done because i'm having such fun till my fork runs away with my spoon this week i got a call from a lady and the lady i didn't know well i did a little bit i buried her husband a year ago and she didn't go to our church but she called me and she said you know ron i don't have any grandchildren i wish i did but over time i have saved all kinds of teddy bears hoping one day we would have a grandchild well we don't and now time has gone by and i'm moving on could you come to my door keyless lives over here she has her own house would you come to my door i have two bags of teddy bears for you i said sure i'll come so i went to the door this week and she gave me

I decided to go ahead and start him a minute early so this is a another video in the event on a girl love it I mean a pardon me this is a YouTube live video on cancer and fasting this is a one week long event on proline why am i doing that well here's the thing I'm a full doc who's basically at this point I retired but I'm still seeing patients I retired so I could see patients and do some of this education regarding heart attack and stroke prevention I've got had a couple hundred patients over the past year or two many dozens of them losing 30 pounds or more and there's a pattern on how they do that the pattern tends to be this you you start on low carb and then you narrow the window that that you're eating I've got again like I said I may be over 30 patients that have lost 30 pounds or more and most of them are doing just that I cannot get patients to take me up on the suggestion to do fasting so I wonder why and here's why it's because it's hard pardon me I'm having a little bit of a struggle here trying to see the chats that anyway so I'm gonna go ahead and go I can't see whether it looks like we've got 12 people on but I can't see the the comments so again a lot of patients have lost tons of weight they do it very simply you go and look Harb and then stopping or closing that window then they go in - they just stay there they stabilize on it and they lose a lot of weight what people don't understand is that there are significant benefits associated with fasting beyond what people are calling intermittent fasting so for example closing that window from 12:00 to 6:00 during each day that you eat most people call that intermittent fasting I would just call call that time restricted eating that is helpful but prolonged fasting has special impact and we'll talk about one of those later tonight in terms of cancer now so I'm doing this event with proline now the folks that I've got maybe half a dozen folks that have done prolonged water fasting like I said why are they why so few because it's hard I've had a few dozen folks do intermittent fasting and here's why it's a great easy way to go into more prolonged type effects fasting there's a lot of good research on it I've tried I did what half a dozen times during my first year about three years ago and then I'm just been doing water fasting mostly since then so I have been low carb over the past 4 to 6 well and low carb of about four years over the past four to six months I have also been doing a two-day water fast what was interesting to me was yesterday I showed that I had a spike up to about 200 that was at the lunch and there's really not that much that that I ate except a mushroom soup as you see I didn't get that much of a spike during dinner so there was a lot of discussion about that last night and one person made a suggestion one viewer suggested you know what don't do that time restricted eating so what I did was I didn't do any of the proline meal for breakfast I just saved it until noon and got that kind of spike so mm-hmm I don't know what what you will see though is I went ahead had breakfast the only spike I got was up to about 90 lunch spike about just over 150 and a dinner spike about 120 130 now here's what's interesting day 1 of proline spiked to about 150 and about 130 so look at this the day before when I was on my low-carb diet eating a lot more calories no no spike no significant spike I did have a couple of spikes that day that was Sunday and that's because I knew I was gonna be doing proline all week today before no spike and again overall averaging or below 100 the day before averaging even less never even got up to a hundred except maybe that one spike same thing so again you see a pattern when I am on my low-carb diet I am not getting up I'm barely getting over a hundred yet I'm eating a lot more calories on the proline diet I am getting spikes routinely when I eat now it's some if you're over there saying well duh the proline pet the proline diet is not low-carb it's not it's a diet that actually is low fat and low protein as well and why is that well the fats and especially the proteins have been found in research to to increase the metabolic markers associated with growth and inflammation so this is a diet that's very much focused on the science and as a part of it it does include a lot of carbs now they're not high glycemic carbs again that mushroom soup and all these soups basically focus on and the whole diet focuses on complex carbs but again as you can see I'm 62 years old I'm not heavy I don't have a huge amount of fat mass to to continue to work with in terms of decreasing my fat mass I'm 510 weigh a hundred and fifty three now and I still have significant challenges even when I just eat kind of complex carbs like that like a proline diet now am I worried about those kind of spikes you know if it had stayed up around 180 to 200 for many hours yeah I'd have been worried about that but again I'm just happy that I'm I know what's going on I know that the vast majority of folks in this country that what 80 million American adults that have insulin resistance nine out of ten of those don't even know they have insulin resistance so I'm I'm fortunate enough to be to be aware of this and to be able to be focusing on it now if you're looking at those patterns and saying we'll wait a minute how do we know that's a glue that's continuous blue comma tree and again we had a question about that last night it's called freestyle Libre you get one of these little dots this patch it costs between 40 and 70 bucks you put it in your arm very simple it doesn't hurt as much as a finger stick and it gives you its an eight-hour loop at least every eight hours you need to download the app as I have here on your iPhone click on the app and go to home and hit check glucose and it will read it I'm at 85 right now so but that's not as accurate as finger six so you may be asking well are you actually checking it and yes I did check it with finger sticks a couple times today and it was actually amazingly on target or at least these two with each other and then some of you may be asking is a keto yet then I can tell you with spikes like that I am I'd be surprised that I'm keto but here's the mystery and it gets back to some of the conversation that we've been having tonight by the way I'm not keto how can you decrease your calories to 600 a day on a prolonged basis and not get Quito you're gonna get Quito you're going to start forming key toes but ketones because you're burning fat so it'll be interesting to see what happens day four and five and so that's what our report now I'm getting comments here let me just let me just run through the comments a real quick continuous zci guanaco continuous glucose meter yep that's the that's this one positive dentist's hello hello to you and Loretta Dillingham perhaps we're listening instead of commenting I hope you weren't listening too well because I started off really badly tonight a whole bunch of stuttering you could say well maybe he's hypoglycemic from this diet we know it's at 85 I just was struggling a little bit to to get up and rolling someone baibek gangaiah and someone said physiologic insulin resistance your body preserving what little glucose is getting can you comment on that someone's yeah I saw that comment on the last one and I'm still struggling a little bit with that comment I'm still trying to figure out where he got that I'd love to see some science on that love to get a little bit more in touch with that concept David Jones I wonder what ketones just before eating the carbs yeah I do too I wonder if well routinely as you may have seen noticed on there I get hypoglycemic especially between midnight and 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning when I wake up that's not unusual for people and that's one of the patterns that you began to see if you get your own freestyle Libre and start watching your patterns that's a normal physiologic pattern to have lower glucose levels now back when I was not managing my insulin resistance as tightly lower was in the 70s and 80s between midnight and 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning now lower is in the 50s your body does harden to lower levels of blood sugar in fact people that are type 1 diabetic or brittle what we called a lot of people call brittle diabetics people that are on insulin have to be have to watch themselves because their body develops resistance to hypoglycemic attacks John beaters maybe since your regular low-carb 40 to 60 grams the proline is just too hot carb and therefore the spike is not really a problem actually John I think that's a great great point and that's what I think's going on this diet has been researched actually we're going to go over a few a few points about this diet specifically in cancer and overall fasting and cancer in a few minutes dr. brewer what is your Lucien dr. brewer what is your opinion on the triglyceride HDL ratio for risk detection I use it all the time I've got several videos on the triglyceride / HDL ratio in fact when I look at and somebody's cholesterol value the first thing I look at has nothing to do with their cholesterol it's got everything to do is their triglycerides / HDL ratio and why because that tells me most of the time if they are insulin resistant and insulin resistance causes plak plak causes cardiovascular inflammation cardiovascular inflammation causes heart attack now we get starting to get a whole lot of comments Taylor why hi y'all hello Taylor I'm gonna go into some content that I wanted to cover quickly tonight I did a video on this and it'll it'll release in a in a week or two but part of the point behind this is again there's there's some focus on routine fasting mimicking not fasting omitting routine intermittent fasting in cancer but not a whole lot there are tons and tons of research on cancer and a couple of other dietary things though couple of other types of diet one is low carb and one is fasting and another is inter fasting mimicking so somebody asked last night have I heard of keto diet for cancer and the answer is yes I have we mentioned the thing called the Warburg effect at that point I didn't remember who I didn't know who developed who Warburg was or Warburg was a Otto Warburg 1920s biochemist in Germany he noticed that cancer cells were stuck in overactive growth mode and activity well and that's basically if you think about it that's what cancer is it's human it's tissue cells that won't stop growing that's why they form a tumor he also noticed that these cancer cells were focused and tended to use glucose that couldn't use much else very well and what organisms do we know that are like that yeast so the cancer cell has a metabolism that's similar from an energy perspective to yeast it focuses on glucose it can't burn fats very well so Warburg removed their fuel he took the glucose out of the out of the equation for cancer cells and that led to the use of the keto diet for cancer guess what there's a whole lot of information around fasting and we're going to cover that in just a minute but this is from US News and World Report confessing improved chemotherapies effects and the answer is yes there's no question about it now how does it do that fasting in cancer fasting lowers levels of growth factor in lowers levels of glucose it increases ketones from fat breakdown and it it increases growth factor inhibitor fasting mimicking diet has also been studied for this it lowers proteins it uses lower proteins lower sugars it's rich and healthier fats and it's the precursor for today's proline that again was researched with cancer now proof if you read the book longevity diet bio Valter Longo he gives a really good example of this whole concept of fasting and cancer he talks about the French Napoleon at Waterloo his point was this the the French actually attacked the Russians in summer of 1812 the Russians couldn't take them on at that point they did a tactical retreat they burned their villages as they retreated so the the French had to trudge through this tactical retreat and finally engaged with the Russians in the dead of winter the Russians then had a tired French group that had not been home they were in the cold and they lost and that was how the French and Napoleon met his Waterloo that kind of technic technical retreat is actually well known in military history the rum and the Carthaginian Carthaginians did that but here's an example in terms of real life you're saying you know this is not what we're talking about this is something kind of off topic actually it's the same thing so if you take these are two types of lung cancer ad no cancer and mesothelioma this is normal diet this is chemotherapy that's fasting and that is fasting and chemotherapy so look chemotherapy alone not much of an impact but fasting and chemotherapy huge impact so again why because the the cancer cells just don't have a lot of just like the French didn't have a whole lot to work with by the time they hit winter of 1812 the cancer cells don't have a lot of work a lot to work with either because they've been starved of glucose they've done clinical trials on the fasting mimicking diet they've done clinical trials looking at fasting here's what they found people that this was a trial that had to do with a female cancer that carried women through a couple of different components if they made it to 72 hours of water fasting their impact with that cancer and with chemotherapy was much much better they had better impact on the cancer and far fewer side effects fasting mimicking diet itself has has gone under trials with lab animals and I showed this in a video that we did the other day these round dots are real a Bratz that were a normal diet these round square dots or lab rats that had a fasting mimicking diet now how would you do that again you do the rat equivalent of us of that here's what happened at month 20 the the control rats started getting cancers and they started getting more of them it was month 24 before the regular lab rats started getting answers so and they had less of them so again you got a lot of evidence here that fasting is very helpful and again fasting mimicking diet there's nothing even the inventor of this fasting mimicking Valter Longo would say there's no significant advantage biologically of fasting mimicking diet over water fast prolonged water fasts here's the advantage it's easier it's not as painful it's not as difficult a couple of other quick points about cancer and fasting and this one was specifically with FM D there's a type of chemo called doxorubicin you get toxicity with it you need to give it with dexamethasone it has a significant increase on the impact but it also has significant increase in problems with side effects so the recommendation is not to use the doxorubicin without or the doxorubicin with the steroid unless you use fasting mimicking diet so again significant research about these topics and something to consider if you haven't started doing fasting yet I'll just cover this last point and then we'll go do some more comments this is this is one of the articles about decreased side effects for women with cancer cancer treatment associated with with fasting and what did what did they see with those women they also looked at the the biomarkers decreased insulin decrease glucose increased ketones and increased decreased insulin like growth factor that's no surprise that's what you see every time you put mammal type organisms a fasting state so let's go back and look at some some comments with the muscle loss be too high in this diet now muscle loss actually lean muscle loss doesn't appear to happen with with either fasting mimicking or with water fasts so that was Rajiv aide vide taylor white i believe he looks as if he has a sign of glucose issues i'm just maybe I am maybe I'm just tired I haven't felt tired tonight I have struggled a little bit in terms of trying to get the the content together Steve sepal hi doc since there has to be a certain level of glucose in the system at all times what elevated level will cause insulin resistance over a period of time and will it be different for different people I don't think we know that very well yet what we do know though is that will typically see people that have insulin levels of 2050 you know very high basal insulin rates you want your basal insulin rate to be less than 10 what sort of glucose levels do you have to have to get it there it varies with people and here's the other thing this these gadgets these gizmos this continuous glucose monitoring it just has not been around you've had continuous glucose monitoring with other competitors Dexcom 5 is the most common competitor that it's eight to twelve hundred bucks so since this came out the freestyle libre there's a huge amount of information that's starting to become available in this specific area I expect we'll get a lot better focus on this over the next couple of years okay David Jones I like how your spikes recover without undershoots mine always undershoot I work on my hie high-intensity interval routine to slowly reduce effort to not trigger insulin reaction and hypo symptoms blood glucose falling edge rate taylor white i'd like to do some fasting but i'm not sure that i should be in my 18 to 18 point 5 well actually that's one of the recommendations that the proline group and Longo and several others say of they they say once you get down to a BMI of eighteen eighteen five or less that you should be careful doing their their diet now they are extremely cautious i know a lot of i've know and love a lot and have seen a lot of people who've who fasted in that space i agree with you though there's you just don't have a lot of fat to work with ramsey raise i'm doing 16 eight fasting doc it works for me it works for a lot of folks you probably join a little bit like ramsey and i'm may be glad that you did I started off poorly tonight people are losing tons of weight with different types of intermittent fasting whether it's 5 - I did a video on that with the Jimmy not with Jimmy Kimmel it's Jimmy Kimmel lost like 2530 pounds just going down to about 600 calories per day for two days a week and then eating normally for the other 5 tons of people are doing what they more of a daily type pattern which is what you're doing Ramsey 16 and 8 doing well with it especially combining that with low carbs and of the patients that I've had that have lost 30 to 50 pounds most of them are using that exact pattern decreasing that window of eating down to 6 to 8 hours and then an adding low-carb to it Taylor white some would call that time restricted eating exactly that's what I call it rather than fasting exactly that's what I would call it that I'm restricted eating window kind of nitpicky but some like to separate them because they have different well see that's the thing you don't have that level of research yet regarding all of the things we talked about with insulin-like growth factor insulin some of the other things and things like time restricted eating you do have some research coming out and I've got actually i I've done a couple of videos on time restricted eating and guess who's who's done a lot of that research Valter Longo the same guy that developed the fasting mimicking diet okay Catherine peach I'm trying to do the 69 fasting to really week this morning not sure why yeah especially when you first start any of these dietary restrictions you your body's not used to it and you can get hungry usually you just be patient wait through it 20 minutes half an hour and you're not hungry or weak but it takes willpower to make it through that 20 minutes or half an hour that's the thing that tends to keep people from that's the thing that's hard for people to to get over the the boundary the challenge in terms of starting fasting getting over those hunger periods and especially if you're eating carbs your blood sugar is doing what we showed it's doing this all day get on a low-carb diet it makes it a lot easier to do different types of fasting so you begin to understand that you begin to understand why it's such a popular and effective way to go low carb first get your blood sugar down and stable and then go to that time restricted eating window Lucianne so keeping insulin levels down over time is good for health Lucian is a great point thank you for bringing it up absolutely it's still not completely clear how much Wester inflammation is caused by insulin and how much is caused by elevated glucose they are so lockstep so hand-in-hand it's it takes a lot of a lot of sophisticated study design to be able to tease those two out and the vast majority of studies just don't have that level of sophistication so we know that when people have chronically high blood sugar chronically high insulin rates they have a lot of plaque and cardiovascular inflammation and heart attack and stroke and kidney disease and blindness and the things that go with it so yes insulin you want to get your insulin rates down basal insulin lu-chen lost it okay Donald farmer any information about nicotinamide mononucleotide or nicotinamide rai beside and its effects that are similar in fasting actually I I have put a ton of people on a recommended regular niacin or in derson which is a wax matrix extended-release in derson now why am i bringing that up I decided to call the the company I wanted to see if we could develop a system where we could give that out I'm a lot more samples out for patients we've had that sample system in the in the past but now that we're doing were more remote care we don't have quite as much access so I called the company and here's what they said they are making nicotinamide amount of nucleotide and nicotinamide rai beside and they are very interested in offering samples they gave me a few I'm taking them right now as soon as I get beyond some of the time challenges that I've got right now like trying to improve people's focus on fasting then I'm gonna go back and start setting up more of that kind of activity but to your specific question and its effects similar to fasting I'm not sure specifically what you're talking about but I will tell you the reason that people focus on niacin is that it is the one drug or supplement that increases HDL decreases LDL now it has at least temporarily some negative impact on blood sugar it will increase blood sugar Oh Loretta dillahunt Dillingham dr. brewer yes on the topic of us women what can you help us learn about ourselves and mental health hormones perimenopause through through menopause would you be okay to look into info on this well Loretta Dillingham I appreciate you asking and here's the thing there is no question that hormones both male and female have a lot to do with aging they have a lot to do with mental health they are areas that are exploding in terms of interests but I have such a wide area of remote care I do telemedicine for gosh almost 40 of the 50 states I I don't if I were to get way deep into endocrine care into hormone care I think that would create risk for my patients and myself so I focus on non hormonal areas in terms of heart attack and stroke prevention I'm insulin itself is a hormone and I'd spend most of my time dealing with with insulin thanks again for your question oops meant to qualify on the topic of being low carb high fiber ketogenic and using intermittent fasting big deals yes there's some some information and evidence about mental health with fasting as well David Jones I skipped my niacin when fasting the flush nearly catches my clothes on fire seems like the flush is 10 times yeah it does and I don't really I haven't researched too much into that phenomenon but I know what you're talking about Lu Chen P metformin for example results in muscle loss from what I read Lu Chen I would love to see and wear see where you got that I have not seen that also said I saw a study which said exercise and lifestyle is better than metformin no question about that actually I've got a video on it it was I think a New England Journal article 15 years ago they did very specific very light lifestyle changes for people with insulin resistance they also in the study group did metformin only and then they had a control group which they did nothing the lifestyle group it was again very light it was like maybe an hour to not even two hours per week it was less than two hours for sure it wasn't hard high-intensity interval training which has been found to be better than other types of training it was just like walking jogging things like that very little in resistance training what was the impact even that very liked lifestyle work was three times more effective than metformin and metformin alone was more effective than doing nothing so here's the thing that's what this issues about and that's what my legacy focus is I'm working more than full time right now on this issue as we get older we get insulin resistant we get heavier and usually we're getting heavier because we're insulin resistant not so much that we're getting incident resistance because we're heavier you have both going on 90% of us don't know that we have it as I said earlier in the video I'm fortunate I work in this space and I and I know it so that's why I'm able to focus on some of the things I'm focusing on why is it so important for people to be aware of insulin resistance because that causes plaque and cardiovascular inflammation and what's the number one cause of death heart attack what's the number one cause of disability stroke what's rapidly growing in competition with for number one cause of disability dementia what's the number one cause of blindness this same process type 2 diabetes so again in the insulin resistance phase or the pre-diabetes phase 90% of us don't even know that we have this problem and we're not looking if you if your doctor by the way says oh you may have a little bit of you may have a touch of sugar but don't worry about it worry about it have fear be very afraid and start getting some work done because more people are dying from the insulin resistance or pre-diabetes phase then actually die from the diabetes phase because they don't know that it's going on and it meanwhile it's burning their arteries okay Loretta Dillon ham exercise helps to lower blood glucose exactly right exercise actually even is almost like taking insulin both short-acting and long-acting one of the things you'll find in patients find is they start using continuous glucose monitoring is that yeah I can eat a few carbs take a break from my low carb diet and instead of having a peak if I go out just taking a leisurely walk after that carb vacation I can take the top right off of that peak that's one of the most important things that you learn from watching these patterns of continuous glucose monitoring Taylor white I fasted maybe 14 hours from our most recent lab tests a UA found trace of ketones does that suggest I'm switching to ketones lowering insulin glucose that quickly I thought it took base that's a real good question the standard thing that you'll hear if you if you bump around on the internet from people that are excited about doing getting quito from dieting and fasting they'll all say most of them say well it takes at least two days there's a lot of truth to that that one and a half to three day window is usually the typical time period but it depends very much on what you're doing so for example if you're low carb and low calorie before you go into a fast you're gonna get keep ketotic a lot quicker if you aren't already ketotic here's the very simple thing that most people don't recognize about ketosis or ketones ketones are made by burning fat so anytime you are burning fat you are you are generating ketones ravi vitae our vide hey doc I'd like to know your take on testosterone replacement therapy improving insulin sensitivity actually it's the same answer that I had for female hormones I do not do work in intestine replacement here's what I can tell you though there was not a lot known about it up until just a few years ago and they then they were able to do a series of very good clinical trials with testosterone what I'm going to say a lot of people are going to hate on bit that's the majority of what came out of these clinical trials the testosterone therapy worked for one thing it worked for improving sleep now it didn't appear to work for performance all the other things that it's given for but when you think about it what are there very few things that are as important for says sleep for insulin resistance and all of the health things that we're talking about so the the message is still a little bit fuzzy in terms of testosterone replacement and impact on insulin resistance okay steve s'appelle perhaps we should revert back to the hunter-gatherer eating habit as they had to wait long periods between meals it's only recently that humans have enough food to eat on a continuous basis that's a really good point Steve I appreciate you bringing it up if any of you have read Jason fung's any of his books most of them start out with with this very same discussion and it's a good point have you watched what the next generation the the kids today are doing for an eating pattern it's get up have breakfast take a snack to school eat a mid-morning snack then eat lunch an afternoon snack dinner and a snack before bed that's like eight nine times you're stimulating this entire insulin system bad news we should not be doing that we should one of the things to focus on is decreasing that window of the day that you eat and therefore increasing the window of the days that you're not eating Shane Kramer hello Shane hello dr. brewer couldn't agree more about insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease after getting a CT angiography despite a seat IMT score of less than 50 I had a 50% led blockage how do two having an eye are insulin resistance of 180 with meals I think what you're meaning is you were getting spikes of 180 with meals and yeah that's what's causing plaque and again it's a silent epidemic and it's killing more of us than anything else it's disabling more of us than anything else Taylor white metformin is prescription only drug yeah you know actually I personally question that I think if if the FDA we're looking at things all over again they should keep some things like maybe aspirin more of a prescription and maybe metformin more of a supplement because they used to think so metformin was more dangerous than they actually understand at this point long story but I'll just take a quick cut at it there is a very common reaction with metformin it's gas you get gas in or even diarrhea up to 20% of people have that after they take take the metformin for a few weeks that slows down and becomes negligible some people have that permanently and can't take metformin but here's the big issue with metformin they used to think that it caused a thing called lactic acidosis and if you go I think it's the Mayo website it will still warn you of lactic acidosis with metformin despite the fact that there have been two not one but two complete Cochrane surveys Cochrane literature surveys where they the scientists the volunteer scientists throughout the world look at this one topic look at all the research that's been developed in that topic and they found metformin doesn't cause lactic acidosis so metformin is not not the Bugaboo that many people think it is Shane Kramer I am now I are normal and have an IR of 110 to 130 with meals the one hour mark again that's probably a glucose level of 110 to 130 that's pretty good you can stay very healthy with that get a glucose meter and know your levels I agree malucia and P metformin muscle loss metformin to augment strength training effective response in seniors the Masters trial if you don't mind putting that on the comments I would love to take a look at that Lin Chen also Barbarina is very similar to metformin yes I've got a couple of videos on barbering berberine I'm sorry berberine and comparing it to metformin DEXA showed this is Lu Chen again I think about the same study the dexif showed that lean mass increase overall p-value is less than one in 10,000 I think Lu Chen you might be saying that metformin increased muscle mass because again if you go into the bodybuilder community and you discuss metformin a lot of them have tried it metformin gaining significantly less lean muscle mass than the placebo group I don't know I you and I we need to look that out Taylor why I'm just starting to learn the risk of many common OTC drugs aspirin NSAIDs non-steroidal anti-inflammatories proton pump inhibitors acetaminophen some can be pretty nasty yes that's true worries me when someone pops three extra strength tylenol yeah it does me too doc I don't know if the study is published here's the protocol that message is held for review its NIH PubMed David Jones I found that what metformin gets in the way of HIIT it does stretch out the time between HIIT days as the glycogen doesn't recover as fast in a keto world David that's interesting I've actually found the opposite at least going into a low carb environment that I recover much quicker after my HIIT sessions and I do two per week and pretty aggressive ones Ravi veed hey doc and bodybuilding metformin is is tried to stop blood glucose issues caused by oh by HDH juice not from muscle building Thank You Ravi I appreciate that I need to go look that up I tell you what tonight though we covered a few things we focus a little bit on um on fasting and cancer I appreciate your interest we've had a lot of participation and I've had a couple of accusations that hey maybe Brewers hypoglycemic again I'm 85 or I was we took it a few minutes ago we can take it again and we'll see how I do tomorrow night I'll continue to share with you my experiences on the fasting mimicking diet this is day three so two days ago I had 1,100 calories yesterday I had six to 800 calories today I had six to 800 calories and for the next two days I will have 6 to 800 calories David Jones great job I enjoyed the talk taylor white i think that was my postdoc that's not what I meant to say well it's okay dear a couple of other questions Babbitt Gunn Jovian I hope I pronounced that right by back do you recommend metformin for longevity I do how can we get it and if our primary refuses to prescribe it oh gosh that's a great comment I'm glad I I'm glad you put that in there I've got several videos on a thing called the taem study taem stands for targeting aging with metformin the principal investigator is a fellow named NIR Barzilai NIR ba r zi la I that he didn't design the study alone here's how that study was designed well before I tell you how was designed let me tell you what the study it's basically putting metformin in the water on a practical basis what they're doing is they're saying once anybody turns 65 they'd like to try putting them on metformin what is the reason again it's what we've been talking about tonight insulin resistance is a key in fact the key for aging it causes plaque and then plaque causes all of those age-related disease such as heart attack stroke dementia kidney disease blindness etc so what they're saying is look half or more of people develop insulin resistance from aging we don't understand exactly why but it happens by age 60 90 percent of those people don't know it until they've already spent decades in insulin resistance burning up their arteries so one way to deal with that is just give everybody metformin once they hit age 65 that study did not get funded for years and it just got funded recently over the past year and here's why I didn't gets get funded for so long what were they treating aging and the the government's never been able to to get around to developing funding its funding is for for medical research is for diseases it's not for aging they had to reclass of they had to go through this argument and debate of reclassifying aging as a disease as they debated funding the tames study so yes i do recommend it you ask the next question what do you do if your if your primary doesn't want to do that I've got a lot of patients that came to me I have a service where I do that Terri Wyatt hi dr. brewer excellent info thanks Ravi V thanks ducks you're a wealth of knowledge I appreciate these comments Steve s'appelle now I'm gonna have to ask my card cardiologist to put me on metformin I know I'm causing a lot of Doc's trouble at Isaiah as I discuss these items but you know what change doesn't come without trouble and you tell me if heart attacks strokes dementia if the vast majority of these are preventable don't we need change even a group as conservative as the CDC has said 80% of strokes are preventable we're not doing what we should be doing we need change and in order to get the change we're going to have to go through some pain Terry White Wyatt it's a good question how does someone get a free style Libre without a prescription you can it's still a it's still a prescription armen prescription taylor white answered that for me they're their prescription only in the US Frank Mancuso looking tremor and slimmer tip-top Magoo I've thanks about the tremor and slimmer I did about six months well four or five months ago I was up over 160 and I started getting into more problems with my insulin resistance I don't feel as good and my atrial fib episodes started increasing as soon as I get back under 160 most of that stuff goes away and I'm back down to 153 again my family doctor Frank Mancuso my family doctor won't give me metformin I'm not diabetic I explained to him but it won't budge Lu Chen P pre-diabetic that's a really good question and let me just share with you I've shared multiple times Jon Lorsch Eider who shared it several times on videos he created for us when he was out of retirement and working with us he came to see me and we the first day we started talking I started going there in terms of are we sure that you don't have national resistance he said doc I know you focused on that a lot I know that space very well my doc checks me every year and I check up on him and I don't have a sugar problem John as he shared in his videos humored me I wanted to go ahead and get an OG titi or glucose tolerance test we got that and it was it was equivocal it clearly showed that he had some instant resistance not not much but we did a what's called a a craft insulin survey it's a 4-hour test instead of two they use a hundred grams of glucose instead of 75 and sure enough at our three long after the og titi would have stopped John's numbers went up I think he said to almost 300 his recycled him when that happened and said are you okay and he said actually this guy may sound kind of weird but I'm glad glad to at least I'm glad to know it because I've had stuff going on and we didn't know it and we thought I had no blood sugar problems that is a great example because John's already shared that multiple times on the videos I cannot tell you the the majority of my patients way over half come in to me and have insulin resistance that has not been recognized you remember old Alabama gardener did a series of videos with us and he had the same issue had not one but two or three docs that were watching him and he said and not only did they not know he had insulin resistance he had full-blown diabetes by a couple of definitions so again there's a huge epidemic out there and the CDC's numbers on saying 90% of it is unrecognized that's really an under-recognized number but that's a low number I think it's more than 90% of its unrecognized and here's why the CDC says that based on the criteria of a fasting blood glucose over a hundred or a hemoglobin a1c of five point six or five point eight or higher I have plenty of people that come in they have an insta have a a hemoglobin a1c of five point four and fasting glucose of ninety seven you do a no GTT or especially an insulin survey and you find out their way insulin resistant just like what happened with John that is not uncommon so again it's a significant insulin resistance like I said epidemic out there that's when your arteries are getting burned up because you have it for years decades and you don't know it and you continue to drink drink beer and eat pizza on a regular basis it's okay to do that every now and then even if you have an internal resistance but you know again it's you go back to the numbers that I've showed you tonight even with just some of the mild carbs in a prolonged fasting mimicking diet I'm getting spikes think about that and then when I went low-carb I'm keeping it below a hundred very very different if you start consult applying the two or three days I showed you of these spikes that I get with mild complex carbs with the days where I'm low carb so basically what you've got is people that are out there right now who are spending day after day multiple hours in the day with blood sugar levels of 140 hundred and eighty two hundred or more and they don't know it so no wonder heart attacks the number one cause of death okay here we're continuing to get more activity I'll respond to that before we before we leave now finds us so so any explanation on why statins reduced cardiac mortality of excess cholesterol is not the culprit I will not say that excess cholesterol has no impact but I find so it's a great question did you know that half the people that have heart attacks have a normal cholesterol cholesterol is important the major reason why we always focused on cholesterol in the past and still somewhat is that plaque is almost a hundred percent LDL or bad cholesterol so having an increased level of cholesterol in your blood is a risk factor but it's not nearly as big a risk factor as we have always thought when you look at the content of the plaque and here's what the issue is when in the thie liam is damaged LDL passes through those endothelial cells the endothelium is the lining of the of the artery if that endothelium is healthy LDL doesn't pass through no matter what level you have I have plenty of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia these are bad cholesterol numbers in the three to three four hundred levels very high and they do fine usually unless they start getting damage to their endothelium through smoking being 50 to 70 pounds overweight or aging and insulin resistance so that I hope that answers your question why statins where it is Oh actually there's another point about statins and reducing cardiac mortality stends have two impacts on people and again look it up I've got several videos on it they decrease inflammation in the arterial space as well as decreasing LDL statins are not all created equal some of them decrease inflammation better than others one of the worst in terms of decreasing inflammation is the most common and most popular statin lipitor lipitor doesn't have as much of an impact on inflammation especially if you're diabetic or pre-diabetic or if you're female so automatically that's the majority of the population unfortunately most folks are on on lipitor so you've got some challenges there if I were on I don't prescribe lipitor i prescribed for the most part low dose receive a set and five milligrams per day or less usually less and llevarlo is starting our bottom statin is starting to get to where it's affordable lavalla or pet have a statin has the advantage of not increasing not only not increasing insulin resistance like the other statins do it actually improves insulin resistance so if you can afford it I would certainly recommend consider it Taylor right I believe various blood lipples lipids do play an important role some statins reduced cardiovascular inflammation Thank You Taylor but I don't think that's the only way they reduce risk I would agree if there is an LDL impact you can see that when you look at some of the drug studies out there when you're taking LDL from 150 down to much lower levels you do have an impact lu-chen P but I did find that statins can cause insulin resistance so there's a risk with sentence - yes there is and as I would say be careful which statin you're put on all statins are not created equal Frank Markku so I'm not pre-diabetic I'm glad to hear that from Frank Mancuso have you had a no GTT have you had a craft insulin survey what's your triglyceride over HDL ratio Lou TN p LP little a is scary because if it's high you can't do anything it's too easily to lower I've got a ton of LP little high patients there chin there's actually a a gene pool of French Canadians which have very high LP a little-a levels 400 levels and even more I tend to find with them the same things that I find with FH patients familial hypercholesterolemia patients that for the most part the body tends to manage the LP little a pretty well you don't have a lot of healthy little egg patients dying in their 30s 20s things like that they start to get into problems when they add smoking to it or when they start hitting their 40s and 50s and again get insulin resistance now these these people with LP little a in the 400s 500s are again not very common and again not somebody that they're not dying in their 20s just so you'll know I have one patient who has a LP little-a of 450 he had he told me when we first started working together he said you know what that's down it used to be much higher and I said what was it he said 1,100 his name I'll go ahead and give you his name because he's got a video coming out his name is Joe Riley his videos coming out next week and he's been very R to tell his story the other thing to know about these folks that have these high levels of LP little-a up in the 400 500 range they tend to have calcification of the aortic valve and again Joe's gone down that path too he'll tell you a lot of that story next week if you tune in to see his video ok what natural things could a person try and reducing inflammation getting that BMI down into the low 20s and 25 for some people's okay as you can tell for me I'm my BMI is around 21 22 and if I start eating a lot of carbs you see where I go in terms of exercise we used to think long slow distance was the big thing not so much I mean it helps but marathon runners have heart attacks and plaque and all the time when what the research has come out especially over the past five to ten years that there are two other types of physical training that are far better for improving inflammation and insulin resistance one of them is has already been mentioned high intensity interval training the other one is resistance training so you really do the those of you who are out basically doing walking for your exercise you do need to figure out way to start adding intensity interval training you don't have to be doing six-minute mile type intervals if you're somebody who's just doing walks start looking at doing walks uphill start doing looking at doing stair claps find a place that has stairs and if you if you live in the flatlands and you can't get it outside a almost all treadmills have a way to do incline that once you start going up a hill you have significant improvement in your resistance and high intensity training now there was a study at was at Mayo I think it was Mayo is that in Rochester anyway it was on high intensity intervals and elderly and mitochondria they actually took three groups of people thirty-year about twenty to thirty year olds fifty year olds and 80 year olds and they had him do 3 different types of exercise one was long slow distance like you know walking kind of stuff one was resistance training and one was high intensity intervals then they actually did muscle biopsies the 80 year olds who were up to that point untrained had the biggest impact on their mitochondria many of them doubled the mitochondria in their muscles that was the 80 year olds so again don't tell me I'm too old to to start doing any kind of high-intensity interval training yes you do need to focus on getting more of that intensity interval and it's the old folks that have much more opportunity for improvement so we are getting a little bit long in the tooth again had a lot of good questions again I started out a little bit slow a little bit confused but I think we got there as we got geared up and heat it up quincy st amazing work you're doing dr. brewer thank you very much and I will say thank you guys thank

missed you so much I hope you've been staying healthy and safe and that you've been keeping busy and having fun maybe reading some books playing games making art or singing whatever it is that you like to do you've been able to keep busy during this time it's been a few days since I last made a video and I'm going to do my best to make sure I can get these out more regularly to you and again any time you'd like to talk to me let your drunks know and we can try to maybe arrange or find a time that we can do a video chat or a phone call or something I'd love to do from any analogy in the meantime though I thought we could do some stuff on our calendar put together our calendar check the weather I have a few books I made I thought we might read a book today and I was also thinking that well it's been a long time since we've been able to bake together and I was thinking of some recipes that might be fun that might be something that simple that you could do at home with your crops so we'll talk about that a little later but before we do anything else let's do some counting on our calendar and I think we should be able to figure out what our April pattern is so let's do some counting and if you remember we're in the month of April and we start with the number 1 here so we'll count all the way down to figure out what number needs to go there ready you can't count with me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 we need number 14 down here we'll fix that number eight there and let's look at our pattern to see if we can figure out what picture is going to be on number 14 so we'll start with number 1 and we've got just a little bit of glare but you can see that that's a B so gotta be a flower flower a monkey a be a flower a flower a monkey a be a flower a flower a monkey a bee need to figure out what comes next but did you hear a pattern there do hear something that sounded like it was going hit you were hearing it over and over and over again sometimes remember we make little rhythms or songs let's see if we can do something with this will do very B flower flower monkey B flower flower monkey B flower flower monkey B flower flower monkey B flower flower monkey so if we just keep saying that over and over again we'll just keep going through our pattern and we can figure it out so we'll do one more time going down to here doing that little rhythm B flower flower monkey B flower flower monkey B flower flower monkey B flower flower seems like it would come next to or at least to me so you can also figure this out if we look at any of the other bees here we have a B here and right next to it is a flower with a bee with a flower right next to it of B with a flower right next to it so all of the other bees that we see have a flower right on the next side so if we look over here I think it's going to be a flower I don't know what you think but we will figure that out but number 14 down right yeah all right every now and again I'll get this myself too I think it's about time for us to check on the weather as well look at that we've got our weather chart let's take a look outside and see what this guy's show us all right so I'm seeing some gray gray skies but I'm not sure if you can see here I am also saying some snowflakes falling just strange weather for April can you see those hmm so snow in April let's that's fun now I've only got the one hero here and I think because this is so unusual not so unusual but not super standard since we haven't seen snow for a while I'm going to leave that arrow on snowy for today I wanted to show my friends how wonderfully their sprouts are coming along and their herbs and we'll take a little look at everyone's here quick let's see this first spot over there was Emmet so these are Emmett's sprouts and then we have Oh Lana under Emmet there's autos these ones over here looking pretty healthy underneath Lana we have Priscilla's priscila your basil looks happy underneath Priscilla is my oh my let's take a look at your basil ooh what is that everyone so far has got something fen it's underneath my oh so what look at fence basil yeah just two little leaves so far but they'll keep growing alright and then we move up to the next one up here which is ADA and ADA also has basil so these are ADA's sprouts and they're looking pretty happy and coming along well just like we want them to be and ADA I think is the last of our friends growing basil after that we've got Sebastian and he's growing time so Sebastian start right here let's see if we gonna had a lot of sprouts on that one and these are looking pretty good look nothing came up over here but that's okay that's why we planted extra ones so that you would have more to grow us after Sebastian we had up Lucas Lucas these three are yours and a lot growing in there these ones and they're different sizes but the basil and the time they kind of look the same don't they just little sticks with two leaves you'll notice even though wait to talk about that well go forth and forward and say oh here's Brooks let's go down hmm these are some tall ones Brooke and there's two tiny tiny ones this one kind of bigger one and then we've got these over there I'm pretty healthy okay after Brooke Oh jack so Jack these are yours you've got these tall ones here and these are right here and those over there so what could be healthy that I can't hear out of there after jack we move up to the top here for a breeze so Aubrey you have got opera's ears are really really tiny here's one for you and these two but they are coming along and they are growing and they will get bigger and healthier you've got some underneath Aubrey's plants we have Malcolm and Malcolm planted some oregano so Malcolm let's see yours are starting here I think yep so these ones are growing very nicely but you'll notice that these also look kind of like the basil and thyme sprouts they're just a little little sprout coming up with two leaves on the top and you'll find that a lot of plants look kind of like that when they start but as they grow and they get more leaves you'll see that they look all these plants like a little herb it's three different plants the basil the oregano and the time will all look just a little bit different I'm moving on underneath Malcolm we have des so let's look at there's plants there we go there here's your oregano yeah there and there we go so those are all looking pretty happy also there I think would we finally can get together we will have plenty for our pizzas Vivian is next let's take a look at Vivian's oregano Vivian's start over here a lot bundled up there you might have to move some of those how do I manage that hmm here we go viv can you see those and nothing over in that one but we've got these waiting for you all right Jim Ian it's a success underneath Vivian we have Johnny's oregano Johnny's got these three looking pretty good to see if we can get a clear view on these there we go that's some good-looking oregano sprouts and we'll go up to the top of this one for Ellis Ellis let's take a look at yours oh I knew we get some eventually here we go you've got some oregano also growing little ones and then there's this really tiny one right there so everyone's got something growing and if you remember I just noticed this we planted one pepper seed and one apple seed also our pepper seed does not look like I've ever sprouted but we do have a little bit of an apple tree coming up there nope it's not trapped under see I bent around there in a way that makes me nervous but we'll keep an eye on it maybe it'll prop up and so I'm going to keep your plants in here for just a little bit longer and then once they are a little bit bigger I'll put them in pots for everyone those will be what you get to take home when the time is right before we move on to anything else thought it might be fun for us to read a book and I picked up I managed to go to this got to go to the school a little while ago and I found a book we read one more book about plants I think this is one that we read a long long time ago I don't know if everyone remembers but I I remember that a lot of friends really liked this book and you kept asking if I could read this again so we have muncha muncha muncha the author is Candace Fleming and the illustrator is G Brian Connors if you remember that authors the person who makes and writes all the words and the illustrator is the person who makes all of the pictures so muncha muncha muncha muncha muncha muncha for years mr. McCree lee dreamed of planting a garden he dreamed of getting his hands dirty of growing yummy vegetables and of gobbling them up who's gonna Greeley thinking about planting a garden but he never once tried it until this spring said mr wegg really this spring by golly I'm going to plant a garden looks like he's at the garden store so he hoed and he sowed and he washed his garden grow it looks like he's not the only one watching lettuce carrots peas tomatoes yum yum yummy said mr. Magee Lee I'll soon fill my tummy with crisp fresh veggies [Applause] but one night when the Sun went down and the moon came up three hungry bunnies appeared to be tippy tippy pat muncha muncha muncha like mr. McCree was gonna like that the next morning when mr. Magoo really saw hits his nod sprouts he was angry hmm so people the small wire fence all around his vegetable garden there he declared no bunny can get into my garden now and the Sun went down and the moon came up and tippy tippy tippy pet spring hurtle - - - OH muncha muncha muncha the next morning when mr. Magoo really saw his nibbled leaves and an odd sprouts he was really angry so he built a tall wooden wall behind the small wire fence all around his vegetable garden hmm he huffed those floppy errs can never get it will never get over it no bunny can get into my garden now he's dreaming of his vegetables and the Sun went down and the moon came up and tippy tippy tippy Pet dig Scrabble scratch scratch scratch spring hurdle - - - muncha muncha muncha so they dug under the tall wood wall and then they jumped over the small wire fence now they're munching on those veggies again the next morning when mr. Magoo really saw his chewed stems his nibbled leaves and his nog sprouts he was really really angry so he made a deep wet trench outside the tall wooden wall all around the small wire behind the small wire fence all around his vegetable garden ha he snorted those puffs tails can't get under it they can't get over it and nobody can get into my garden now and the Sun went down and the moon came up and tippy tippy tippy Pet die paddle splash splash splash dig Scrabble scratch scratch scratch spring her dash dash dash muncha muncha muncha so that didn't work too well either did it hmm the next morning when mr. berg really saw his chomp blossoms his chewed stems his nibbled leaves and his gnawed sprouts he was furious never that means super super mad so he hammered and blocked and drip sawed and stalked and drilled and filled and trapped and locked and he built a huge enormous thing before the deep wet trench outside of the tall wooden wall behind the small wire fence all around his vegetable gardens eye out smarted those twitch whiskers for sure he exclaimed they can't get through it they can't get under it and they can't get over it no bunny no way how can get into my garden now and the Sun went down and the moon came up and tippy tippy tippy stop hmm the three bunnies looked and smelled and touched the huge enormous thing before them and tippy tippy tippy pat the bunnies hopped away the next morning when mr. egg really saw his untouched vegetables he was happy I beat the bunnies he whipped and he did a jiggly-wiggly victory dance then he climbed over jumped across squeezed between and crawled under until at last he reached his vegetable garden said mr. Greeley at last smacking his lips he picked them he picked and pulled up lettuce carrots peas tomatoes and with his basket overflowing he reached inside for something yummy muncha muncha muncha [Applause] looks like miss Marie really gave up can't beat those bunnies that was a fun book friend I'm glad you read that one again moving on though it's been a long time since we have baked anything and I thought that maybe we could do something like that again um gonna be a little different because we're doing it through a video but I think this is a this is something that you could probably do at home and you'd probably have enough things in your house already that you could do this or maybe next time when if your drums has to go to the grocery store you order some food or maybe you can figure some other way to make this but I know that everybody really seems to like chocolate and I have a recipe for a chocolate cookie but it's one giant chocolate chip cookie and I think if you'd like to you might be able to do this at home but you do have to use the stove and a few other things so if you do make sure that you ask your grown-ups for help and make sure that they know what they're doing um and we'll walk through it together but if anyone decides to do this at home and would like the recipe let me know I will happily email it to you or maybe I'll just post it in the description I'll figure out how all this works alright let's head to the kitchen I guess so for our recipe our giant cookie we'll need one stick of butter an egg um remember this is this is brown sugar sweet like sugar and you can tell it's brown sugar because it's brown so butter egg sugar oh our flour we need baking soda not baking powder baking soda and some vanilla vanilla extract oh and of course chocolate chips or chunks it's a different shape but it's still the same sort of thing then we'll also need our measuring cups and spoons we'll need I think we'll be needing a whisk a little saucepan and a pie plate now remember we need to use the oven and the stove for this recipe so make sure that if you would like to make this that your grown-up is there to help you to begin we need to make sure that we set our oven preheat our oven so it gets nice and hot for us to 375 degrees and that will get nice and hot for us and then we need to get our saucepan and we need to hope that's the wrong burner like that which is one of the reasons why you definitely need to grown up because that is super super hot and it's very easy to burn yourself we're gonna take our pot and we are going to put our stick of butter in there also make sure that when you throw your butter in there you keep that bit of wax paper out the one that the butter is wrapped in you'll need that we're gonna turn this heat down a little bit and we are going to just let our butter melt most of the way not all the way you want a low heat because you don't want your butter to burn or boil see how it's you got that liquid in the bottom that's the butter slowly slowly melting and we want to get our butter mostly melted but not completely melted keep an eye on that and then once that's done we'll move it off of our stove and you need to put it somewhere that you can or somewhere that you can place super super hot things because this pot will be super hot so I have an oven mitt then I'm gonna put this down on so make sure you've got something let's see keeping an eye on it and you've got something on the stove you never want to go too far away because well it's not safe you never know if things could burn or it something could get knocked over so it's always important that when you're using a stove that you stay close to it so you can keep an eye on it and make sure everything goes all right also a little side tip keep the handle over the stove and that over the ground that way if you walk in front of it you don't hit that handle little safety tips we learned so much so that looks like it's about isn't melted as I'm gonna want that for our cookie so we will turn off the heat and we'll move our butter over to our hot bed we took the pot off the burner off the fire there and we let it sit for a while and it was still pretty hot so that melted the rest of the butter but it didn't burn anything and next to the pot we need to add 3/4 of a cup so that's almost a full one of these brown sugar to our pot here so I have 1/2 cup I'm gonna dump it in there very carefully because I don't want that splash and then I can't find my quarter cup I want that I think during our move and so I'm just going to fill this one up by half wait the brown sugar to add that I'll put in just a little bit more and keeping my friends that I was telling you that this the ingredients that we needed but if you were your grown-ups think of something else that might be good in here you can add that into if you want to throw in some cinnamon maybe or some fruit or something you could do that too right now though if you wanted I should have you get the brown sugar in and our egg and our vanilla I'm gonna need to move this camera for a second and we're back so I poured 1/2 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon right there of our vanilla extract and I'm just going to put that into the pot too and then I'm gonna stir that all up together whisk it in and you might also remember we've tasted some of this stuff before we tasted butter before and we've tasted brown sugar but the a we said you cannot taste we can't taste anything that has raw egg in an egg that hasn't been cooked because it's not safe for you so this won't be safe to taste anymore until it is out of the oven and we also can't taste our vanilla extract as much as it is the wonderful oh that smells we don't want to taste that because it actually tastes pretty bad and it's not good for you until you've cooked it or baked it applies alright friends we've got 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and the baking sort of kind of clumps when we put it in here so we want to add instead of just dumping the whole spoon just shake a little bit on there and then stir it in hmm and we'll shake a little bit more and [Music] stir it in I turned off the camera in the middle of passing from hand to hand so I'll try not to do that again but I was shaking some more let's give it a stir do your best not to spill any on the counter like I'm doing I'll just put them rest of that in and stir it around now if you did want to add cinnamon or nutmeg or any other spices this would be a good time to do that if you're not going to add in any of that then I would say you can move on to your flour our recipe is calling for one cup that's a one cup size measure we need one cup of just regular flour so I'm gonna do my best wedding that is if you remember you want this nice and the level there want it to be pretty even across and we will dump that in there into our pot and mix that in really well see how it's you can still see where all the flour is but now you've seen a little bit more than your butter brown sugar and egg mix on the bottom all right this is smelling pretty tasty so we've got almost everything except for the most important ingredient when you're making a chocolate chip cookie your chocolate I have a few left over from another bag [Applause] [Applause] so I think that's probably enough so this would be a good time if you wanted to add in any raisins or oatmeal or some other kind of candy M&Ms or something this would be a good time to do that and mix that around and then you might remember that I asked you if you had if you could to save the butter wrapper I'll say there's a little bit of butter left down there and we do that because we can rub that on to our pie plate or container that will put the cookie in and match it make it - it doesn't quite not quite as sticky sometimes when you bake things they will stick inside the pan and break apart when you try to take them out closer how can that happen [Music] hopefully that's enough you can always add some more butter or even a little bit of oil if you need to okay and now we need to pour this into here and I'm gonna do that without the camera because I don't foresee doing that with one hand being a success so our cookie batter is in the pie plate less than I remember the Bing I'm sure it'll be fine and we have our oven set to 375 degrees which is too hot for you and it's too hot for me but it's just right for a giant chocolate chip cookie so we are very carefully going to be here open the oven up [Music] we're cookie inside and close it and we will set a timer for between 20 and 25 minutes so we will do 23 and I am realizing now that this would have been a good time to read the story maybe if we do something like this in the future that's when I'll do that in the meantime though we will let this bake I won't make you sit through that and we will return when this is all ready to come out of the oven oh yeah and one other thing this time while your cookie is is baking this would be a great time to do some cleaning up so if you and your drums are making this together now would be a good time to help them clean up the mess so that you're all done and you can relax when your cookie is done we are down to the last few seconds of our timer there we go and we will check um turn it off I'm going to put on an oven mitt so that I can touch my hot pan inside the oven let's check smells really good be very careful here yum looks pretty tasty so I will turn off the oven and give that a few minutes to rest you don't want to eat this right away because it's going to come out of the oven super super hot and super super gooey so we want to give it maybe about 10 to 20 minutes or a little longer until it's cooled down a little bit and it's okay to eat thanks so much for watching friends and if you do any baking at home or any more art please let me know I'd love to see some of what you've done I also want to mention a few things but I tell Brooke that I was really I really liked your flower garden looks like those are coming along really nice and hope they stay they keep growing and they bloom and I also wanted to wish you a happy birthday on seho the rest of your birthday parade went really well and you got to see lots of friends and family Malcolm I saw your wax resist painting and I really liked your cactus Micah this was green and I really liked how you kind of you thought a little differently and you did something very creative and you made blue cactus a blue cactus or with a three blue cactus and then you painted your sky in red and I thought that was kind of neat you switched some colors that maybe other people wouldn't have thought to use and I thought that was very creative and it's very imaginative Jack you're the seeds that you're growing at home I'm really happy to see that you're doing some plant stuff too and I'm really interested to know how those keep coming along and also your beans your bean sprouts those are really interesting they look like they were growing well too so please keep me informed as to how those are going and I also want to say I just got a message from Lana and I'm really impressed with how well you're doing with writing your letters and I'm glad to see that you're all still learning and a lot I'm glad to see that you're getting plenty of practice with writing and drawing and those are some excellent letters my letters aren't that great and so I'm very impressed with yours because those are probably better than any letters I can make I think that's about everything so thanks so much if again if anyone does want the top I'm usually around or I could make some time and we'll find it time to talk stay healthy stay happy stay busy keep learning keep making art and maybe do some baking some singing since we're wrapping up though we will end like we like to end things and sing we had lots of fun to day so let's all say hooray we'll see you all

we'll do some will do more evening swalls this is just trial and error right you got to do things got try different things and see what's up Oliver what's up Mike's Tuttle got the swollen Armas X fam going drop in some dropping some Knology I float some biceps float some biceps and we'll get going so to get it started who here who here put in the comments right now who here has done an elimination diet let's start there who here has done an elimination diet today we're talking about grains we're talking about bread so who here has done an elimination diet and who here has seen benefits from getting rid of bread or grains so let's do that let's start there so now I'll get some questions we got some questions going but I want you to all start dropping in the comments have you seen progress and improvements and benefits from cutting bread out of your and what have you noticed what have you noticed what have you noticed eliminating that that's probably even just equally just as important what have you noticed from eliminating because you do not need bread or grains you don't need them you don't need them first serve with us to survive you don't need them for health and this is mixed with science and opinion and experience you don't need that human beings were fine we're fine we evolved and we just started consuming these things because when you think about what grains and what these food sources were beneficial for it was beneficial for those winter months where you can dry the wheat and you can store them in the winter when food wasn't readily available and then it just be kind of came pervasive especially now obviously as supermarkets and she'll like that they're everywhere a Mexican eliminating greens is a mission why is it a mission you stop  eating it it's not just because you're Mexican was I have to do with eliminating grains well like what does that have to do with anything right whether you're Mexican or whether you're Jewish or whether you're smart or whether you're stupid well if you're stupid as maybe you had you'd have a problem doing things not calling you stupid but it doesn't matter what your nationality is you're Mexican grains or grains okay I thought that was funny tortillas tortillas tortillas eat your rice if you want to some people have problems with rice we're not talking about rice we're talking about grains today Brad Robins an eating feels like fuel not weight not fulfilling eating feels like fuel not weight mmm I don't understand that that does make sense I think that's a typo sometimes I know and by the way sometimes I know spell correct gets in the way and doesn't uh doesn't allow for what you mean to say hit Send and you're like god dammit iPhone Elena Blankenship I don't eat bread I am high fat low carb and I find I'm not bloated and swollen anymore I just feel so much better without it word stopped eating parenthesis almost everything ah so Geoffrey V val is starving himself on Instagram now dropped 35 pounds in three months kept muscle tanked my hormones though gained it all back hard and fast I don't know what I don't know what you were eating you said stopped eating almost every thing sounds like you did a starvation diet which makes sense that you gained it all back so maybe you want to drop a little more comment there you know what happened or what you what was your situation from that let's say Brian on Facebook first few days I feel Low Energy then I feel much healthier and usually lose weight remember if you do any kind of elimination diet you do any kind of cutting something out your body is gonna go through some kind of withdrawal you're not used to eliminating bread you're not used to the cravings you are kind of repurposing your body is going through a seismic shift when you cut stuff out and that's why you might feel a little sluggish but then when you clear that out and your body isn't craving that anymore you're not fueling that bacteria in your gut you'll feel often better maybe I'm in the wrong group know women I did cut out dairy maybe you're in the wrong group no women what does that mean misty Wilson wrong group no women everyone's welcome here on the gained train everyone's welcome here this is for women this is for men this for everything Oliver I can really tell how food affects my body now if you do the elimination diet you'll notice this okay so let's get into what we're talking about today with grains let's talk about gluten but not specifically gluten not specifically gluten gluten has been the I guess the poster child for lectin proteins it's been the poster child for what you want to get rid of and where the food companies have gone with gluten-free this gluten-free that gluten-free this gluten-free that you'll find a lot of gluten-free out there now when you're buying a product that is gluten free a lot of times it is full with sugar as other sorts of sweeteners like gluten-free bread it's just air or made from rice which people have issues too as well and there's other types of ingredients that could also be detrimental the thing is that gluten be so popular and when I say popular being so popular to get rid of so gluten has the spotlight I think we can agree right float some biceps if you agree that gluten has huh the spotlight some people get rid of gluten and still have issues I'm also curious for that has anyone have any of you done some kind of gluten-free or gluten removal and still had issues or it didn't solve the problem because gluten and eating gluten free foods doesn't mean you're getting rid of everything that could be detrimental gluten is just one glutens just one it doesn't mean it's everything and I want to talk about another one called it's abbreviated WGA it's called wheat germ agglutinin and you can do your google searches on this and i'm gonna reference a couple studies that have been done over the past few decades i'm not gonna name the studies but bring up some topic and some talking points for reasons why even if you went gluten-free you might still be having issues I want to talk a little bit more about what lectins are and the reasoning why they cause damage in the body and another thing to make clear before we begin this is don't assume that all the studies and everything that we need to know about gluten and about grains and how they affect the body has been researched and has been studied we yes we think because we have iPhones because we have Technology because we have electric cars and all these things that there's all this science and research done on wheat and grains we know all those details like oh that's just we know these things that's not true that's not true and I've said it time and time again on the daily swole that these studies take tons of money they take a lot of high-level science large sample populations and a lot of these studies are done on animals and animals are not necessarily humans right human human beings are animals but not all animals or humans so you've heard that phrase before all fish live in the sea but not everything that lives in the sea are fish so you can't just say oh well it did this in a rat this is what's gonna happen in a human not the case we don't test everything on humans because of moral issues and bla bla bla bla bla bla I'm starting to think that it's a lot more than just moral issues it's because people with the power and the control don't want these studies to be done so they play the card of it's not moral to test on human beings they just don't want to really find out what the problem is so they don't lose boatloads of money it all comes down to money power and control and keeping everyone in the dark so that's another little I don't think it's really a conspiracy theory I think it just kind of makes sense but a lot of these studies haven't been done because the big companies that have tons and tons and tons of money don't want to put these studies into play because they are gonna expose some of these truths and they have to be done over and over again and remember one study the truth does not prove you have to really coat over this in two different populations and large or longitudinal studies and okay that might happen in the short term but what are the damages long term well the other what are the other factors in this person's life that could be causing cancer or issues right if you're having let's say oh this person has this person eats gluten and they have cancer well maybe you find out also this person doesn't exercise and they smoke like a chimney so which what's really the problem is that the gluten in this person that they were consuming their whole life or is it the smoking and the lack of exercise so there are you know there there's a lot of it's hot that's why it's hard to do these studies so I just want to preface that for those who that might not have caught the other episodes and that's why I'm recommending that you go and you check out especially the last several weeks these episodes have been a lot you get a lot of foundation so if you go back and watch and listen to the prior episodes you'll have a huge base of understanding from where we're coming from and why sometimes I'm talking about these you might not understand some of these subjects that I'm going into or why I'm saying the things I'm that I am but if you go back into some of the older episodes you'll get that context so that's why the podcasts are great to catch up on when you're busy so most of these studies were done on animals and wheat germ agglutinin oh I'm just gonna say WGA is a protective lectin protein that's found in seeds right and this is to keep away pests and vader's animals seeds are pretty much the babies of plants and in order to protect in order for a plant to survive in a plan to evolve in a plan to still be here today as it was 10 million years ago is to protect its babies so just like you have a child you'll protect it from wolves or from other people trying to eat your baby a plant has specific proteins such as this lectins that will prevent other animals creatures insects pests from consuming that because it will damage and it will cause indigestion and issues in those creatures so then they don't touch the seed the seed gets to drop or it germinates or it becomes ripe in the fruit or whatever it is and then it lands on the ground it grows in the pant the plant perpetuates itself so plants and animals we all it's all survival it's all survival mechanisms and to preface a little bit more why it is a good idea to eliminate lectins and to go this direction especially when you're trying to figure out why you're not losing weight or why you're doing kill Erick restriction right you're counting your macros and you're doing caloric restriction but you don't seem to be losing weight you don't seem to blah blah blah well maybe it's because your body is fighting these issues and you have anti you have inflammatory reactions and you're having autoimmune responses to it and I've mentioned that several times I don't think it's just a matter of okay I'm eating less calories I'm consuming I'm gonna lose weight that has a part to do with it or you're eating extra calories are gonna gain weight that has a part to do with it by the same time if you have an autoimmune reaction and you have a hormone imbalance as a result and you're storing more body fat and your body is shuttling more glucose into the liver and into the fat cells and your body is storing more energy you know the decrease in calories might still be affecting you negatively because it's throwing off your hormone balance it's causing a different response in your system so even though you're cutting down on the total calories you're still up your body you're still up that balance so some of these concepts let's get into a couple of them and a lot of members here that you saw in the comments if you didn't scroll down or scroll back up the they found a lot of great results from cutting out wheat from cutting out lectins and that's just ok trial and error trial and error right so the lectin protein protects the wheat from the invaders from the past from the animals and what these lectins do and what we German glutenin does is it increases intestinal permeability and that is another fancy term for leaky gut and float some biceps and some hearts share say what up Papas wooly or whatever you want to say just float somebody sets at least if you've heard of leaky gut that's becoming a little bit more of a common term unfortunately leaky guts becoming a little bit more of a common term to hear about and leaky gut literally means that your gut your intestines are leaking leaking intestinal permeability you have these lectins that are affecting the binding sites on the intestinal membrane and they're causing swelling in the cells and gaps literal gaps in the intestines and then shits going through shits going through your intestines and when particles that are too large or that shouldn't be found in your bloodstream or getting through the intestinal walls then you have an inflammatory reaction your body says invaders let's go to war and when you have a war in your body it stores fat you retain water all those things that you don't want so when you have trouble with these love handles and fat around your stomach and your waist and how do I get this back fat how I get rid of fat on your arm how you get your fat off your chest when cortisol levels are high you tend to store fat in those areas you don't like around your hips and your stomach and your arms and your chest you know estrogen levels go up and all these you know inflammatory reactions in people and a lot of times that's because of this leaky gut system or syndrome we can call it as a result of the inflammation from the foods that you're eating that should not be consumed so the leaky gut autoimmune issues go up and this can be attributed to a lot of different things from joint pain to sleeplessness to headaches chronic migraines so if you have and if you have any chronic issues comment below right now do you have joint pain chronically do you get chronic migraines what do you have as a result of your struggle with nutrition maybe you're just thinking about it now think about it you get chronic migraines do you get migraines a couple times a week or a few times a month you know that's not normal it's not normal to get migraines that frequently that's related like nutrition and if you have migraines chronically you need to take these words very seriously because it could be so simple as cutting out lectin based foods like legumes and like grains and it could literally just disappear I'm not guaranteeing that chronic joint pain these are all related think about why you might have chronic joint pain I'm gonna get to this stuff when we talk about glucosamine and like that why those supplements and I'm always harping on the supplement industry not that I think supplements are the devil but I just think it's so Wild West and everyone thinks it's so cut and dry like a supplement is good just cuz on a shelf doesn't mean it's good it's really wide open it's not really tested and you're being pushed a lot of garbage so you're getting pushed a lot of these anti-inflammatory drugs so we're gonna talk about that in a second so there was one study and I'm poking around the interwebs a study done in the 70s that showed glucose or how the we term agglutinin mimics insulin very well in terms of binding sites that can help shuttle sugar and glucose into the into the fat cells and into the liver thus spurning more body body fat and water retention and so forth and as a result of that triglycerides and blood triglycerides can be elevated which is more of a determinant for heart disease than high cholesterol high triglycerides is a big is a big one because you could have high high higher cholesterol but have a very high HDL cholesterol and you might be low risk of heart disease because you have a high HDL but triglycerides are very closely linked to heart disease so this can be also a factor that can lead to that now there's not a ton of wheat germ agglutinin in foods but think about how much wheat you're consuming breads okay I mean you have tortillas you have all these different wheat products and you can look at the back you'll see a lot of grains and a lot of grain products and grain sources in a lot of the foods that you're consuming a lot of wheat sources pastas and and all sorts of things like that that can lead to these conditions so the volume that you consuming and if you want to know a little bit more about lectins and why they could be so poisonous I mean float some more biceps if you've heard of the poison we'll call it a poison ricin ricin is a lectin ricin is a lectin that is let me scroll I don't wanna get this wrong ricin is found today Joe where is it where where did I where did I find was it from like the it's from a bean I just want to make sure I get this get this correct castor bean right so it selecting from a castor bean casing that's right so the castor bean and you can extract rice and so rice and I think it's like a very very small amount one let's see five hundred micrograms can kill a human being and that's a lectin now that doesn't mean that if you're eating elect ins obviously you're going to die because you're not going to die from having a loaf of bread but just to put it into comparison that that type of lectin from the castor bean can kill a human when it's concentrated when it's you know very small amounts can kill someone it's a poison and it's very hard to trace because it's you know it's you know unless you're looking for it so that's a that's just another form I don't know how many of you might have been familiar with ricin and that it is actually a lectin so this is like the same type of family right it's found in a castor bean a bean is a legume and that's why peanut butter can be an issue for most people that's why any kind of beans and grains and seeds are oftentimes problems that's why tomatoes seeds or cucumbers the seeds the peppers red peppers those can all be issues for people you don't have to mention nightshades and all those things so the bottom line is if you don't know if you don't have any experience with this and you'll know how you react it's very simple it's very simple you cut out grains and legumes for you know six to eight weeks some people say 30 days you really want to do it for four to six weeks minimum and then find out see how your migraines feel see how that has adapted you can do a full-blown elimination die you can really go down to the bare bones and get rid of everything from caffeine alcohol dairy you know that's the best way to do it and I've been posting on Instagram I'm posting on Facebook that if you really don't want to go through an entire elimination diet then you're not really going to get all the information if you eliminate one thing you might not see any difference from your migraines you might not notice that they've decreased in frequency so maybe it's dairy and the grains that are causing you problems so if you're really if you really want to find out what's going on with you you have to do the work you have to put in the legwork and figure this out also what I want to talk about I want to build upon an episode that we did a few weeks ago about ibuprofen about NSAIDs and the issues with wheat germ agglutinin with these inflammatory foods in combination with those over-the-counter painkillers and anti-inflammatories and we'll talk about glucosamine in just a second when it comes to ibuprofen an episode I did a couple weeks ago showed as a newer study that taking ibuprofen regularly can reduce free testosterone in men and it's known that ibuprofen causes leaky gut and it damages the intestine so like if your tape you take ibuprofen even just like one time it can really up your your gut biome and your everything that's going on in your in your system so it's really bad it's really bad we have a lot of people in the military that are saying yeah they just hand them out like tic tacs ibuprofen motrin those things are extremely bad for you they're anti-inflammatory but why are you having inflammatories why are you needing to consume anti-inflammatories so if you have joint pain what do you do you take motrin you take ibuprofen you have a headache you have a migraine you take ibuprofen you have you know any kind of backache or this you take ibuprofen but what if it's coming from the food you're eating a food that's causing an autoimmune issue you're having inflammation and then you're taking a pill to get rid of that inflammation now one of the big ones that you're all familiar with most likely is glucosamine so I don't know if any of you do any of you now you can comment below do any of you now take glucosamine glucosamine is one of those oh I'd reduce inflammation it's good for the joints blah blah blah so everyone's taking and that's a massive billion billion dollar industry just that product alone and right here about glucosamine just a little bit about wheat germ agglutinin what glucosamine does is that instead of the wheat germ agglutinin binding to the tissues in our body it binds to the chitin in the glucosamine so it's actually like the pulverized part of the glucosamine it actually binds to the glucosamine instead which reduces the impact of wheat germ agglutinin so the WGA instead of actually binding to let's say insulin receptor sites or these types of places it will be interrupted by the glucosamine so then oh no more inflammation I feel so much better let me keep on eating bread but I'm eating my glucosamine so if you think about really what you're doing you're putting band-aids on top of band-aids on top of gauze on top of band-aids you're really just putting layers and layers of different you're causing issue then you're doing this and you're causing other issue you're doing this you're stacking things up or it could just be so easy as just changing what you're eating and then BOOM and then you don't have to take all those things all the time so right here a little tidbit many millions and this quote many many millions of Americans who have greatly reduced their pain and suffering by ingesting glucosamine and NSAIDs like motrin may be better served by removing wheat the underlying cause from their diets so we knew we kind of know this if you're causing problems let's fix the source and more often than not the source comes from the food it doesn't come from stress at work you might be stressed out at work because you're tense from eating poor foods you're not sleeping well all these different things that come from food or eating bad or having issues you can have joint pain and then what's gonna happen or migraines so how are you sleeping well how are you sleeping at night if you have chronic migraines you're not sleeping well so then you're not recovering well and then cortisol levels are elevated so and then it has the cycles and you're not sleeping well then you're exhausted so then stress levels are higher and then you're storing more fat because cortisol tends to cause bloating and store extra body fat and then you're on this calorically restricted diet eating all this garbage food and you're wondering why you're not losing weight or you lost weight but you're really losing muscle and you still feel saggy you're still storing fat on your midsection you lost weight but you don't look good right you kind of lost bad weight and pisses me off it really really really pisses me off when you get these so-called fitness experts that really push the macro and those eat less calories and enjoy your life that's any other there are so many people that do caloric restriction that still have body fat that don't lose you're causing inflammation you're changing the composition and how your body works and you're affecting how you lose weight Tibor never thought about eliminating glucosamine great to know you have to go back and watch that part again I didn't say eliminate glucosamine I said that glucosamine helps block WGA from affecting the body to an extent that's why the glucosamine industry has been blowing up and that's why glucosamine is heralded for reducing joint pain and issues and inflammation because it's blocking the foods that you're eating essentially that are causing inflammation in part so what's more important to eat the bread and have inflammation and take glucosamine try to combat it or stop eating grains and lectins and then not have to worry about having anti-inflammatory pills and medications because you're not causing the problem to begin with so can we just eat vegetables become vegan ah you can enjoy that misery you can there's no there's really no conclusive conclusive work that shows that being a vegan will be even better because vegan is very high in legume consumption vegans really rely a lot on grain so that doesn't necessarily people that do restricted vegan diets raw vegan this and they have issues and they don't lose weight or they're miserable or their hair starts falling out you can't get all your nutrients it's um it's challenging so there is individuality and everyone's different and everyone's gonna react to things differently but it doesn't mean you can't be a vegan doesn't mean you can't be healthy and be a vegan you know we're still figuring all this stuff out and it's funny because I'll get people messaging me what about this bodybuilder he's a vegan and I look I said yeah he's a vegan he's also taking a ton of  steroids so don't forget that you'll see some of these fitness you know muscular guys and you're huge and they're vegan and I've been vegan for all these years yeah well you're still  juicing you're still taking steroids what do you think what do you think really really really you know it's like stop bullshitting everyone sweet potatoes by the pound for life cheap it's and sweet potatoes are really good for you so that is one of the issues is taking these anti-inflammatories like motrin advil the ibuprofen the NSAIDs and also consuming these inflammatory foods so when you're consuming let's say ibuprofen you're causing leaky gut you're causing inflammation in the gut you're having issues you're causing this damage in the intestinal lining right in the mucosal layer and it's not as much in the stomach as I'll make you think oh you're gonna get ulcers from having too much higher proof in it's really in your small intestine and if you're causing this rift in your small intestine and you're consuming all these lectins and these elements that are going to be inflaming the cells more and breaking through and causing inflammatory reactions you're just compounding it and you see why right you see why it's an issue that's why it can get really spiralling out of control because you're causing the problem you're taking pills to fix the problem but you're causing the problem again you're not getting to the source so that's what this episode is all about and I hope you learn something and I hope it opened up your eyes to start eliminating some of this to see if it's affecting you let's take some questions the only thing I take is protein and BCAAs BCAAs are you don't really need them just eat food protein powders can be inflammatory they can be dairy based you don't need that I don't take any protein powders whatsoever I eat food BCAAs it's not gonna hurt you necessarily but there could be an insulin response from BCAAs all the artificial fillers can cause you problems aspartame and all these sucralose and issues that are in these supplements misty Wilson can't wait till healthy food is a little cheaper we just had an episode on this healthy food is cheap healthy food is cheap it's cheap healthy food is cheaper I mean I've been cheap it's not it's not that expensive it's not that much more expensive really really if you buy in bulk and you buy the right things and you're eliminating a lot of other foods and you're not spending money on that you really don't need in life it's not that it's not really that much more expensive if at all because you're getting more nutrients getting more nutrients or affecting your body unless you're not buying let's say all these anti-inflammatories you're not taking all these medications because of the damage you're doing you're not getting sick as often so you need to buy these  night quills and all this crap because your immune system stronger you know it pays off in the long run and the short term I mean how many of you are saving money how many of you are saving money or how many of you are really going out of pocket and get going broke because your quote eating healthy food sweet potatoes what 90 cents a pound 60 cents a pound sometimes I go to the store they're 49 cents a pound 49 cents one of the best carbs when the best resistance starches you can consume yuca super cheap kale it's cheap but you're getting a ton of nutrients good I don't have to buy the 50 before work right you don't though right you're not spending on we're on protein shakes and all these things what's your favorite carbs for good mental health mental health no I just had sweet potatoes mental health is I mean that's relative I've been enjoying life eating  for 31 years time to enjoy life a little less and lose some weight enjoy life a little less that's subjective I think almost a borderline ignorant comment you've been in quote enjoying nah I'm just busting your ass you put I see quotes enjoying life nah that's cool you're back in the clear now just just think just think about it not Geoffrey I think you'll I think you'll like it a lot I think you'll feel you're going to feel better one of the big things one of the big things that you'll notice once you start changing your consumption and you actually feel better it's not so much oh I have a six pack now I'm huge I have big muscles or I have a long luscious beard you just get rid of your pain and everything changes how many of you have gotten rid of pain and chronic inflammation issues or migraines from changing your nutrition and how has that changed your life you get rid of pain you are going to feel so much different so much better it's so freeing it's so freeing to get rid of pain you know I deal with that all the time all the time veggies are expensive here in Alaska but you can't put a price on health yeah because you got shipped those things like 10,000 miles you also don't have to live in Alaska either so that's a personal choice so when someone when you when you get people are like I live in Alaska you can't complain you could always move there's a lot of United States to choose from you don't have to live in Alaska and you like to rock climb there's plenty of rock climbing just move to Colorado you can smoke weed too so all the benefits plenty of mountains and they really love they're organic and they're healthy in Colorado that's for sure you use a plastic bag and you get dirty looks especially like in Boulder in those places super hipster a bag of beans is $1.00 lasts more than a week yeah but it's also probably causing you why you think beans cause gas why you think a lot of beans cause inflammation issues and aren't digested well baguette beans cost a dollar but if it's not helping you what I don't give a like who gives a  how cheap food is you know a lot of stuff is a dollar candy is a dollar who gives a if it lasts more than a week what it fills you up it fills up your stomach why do you think these foods got popular why I think beings what you think beans got popular why why you think beans got popular why I think rice got popular why you think grains got popular because you can store it you can store through the winter you can have to depend on hunting elk or hunting Buffalo you can put it in a granary and save it beings are also rock hard like rocks you have to boil them for an hour to eat them and they still taste like tastes like don't tell me beans are delicious beans tastes like  it tastes like unless you put a ton of stuff on them and don't give me like oh when you make them like this in a taco yeah well you're putting tons of salt and seasoning and  on them beans plain tastes like absolute for a reason they taste like because they don't they don't interact with our palate well human beings don't crave beans we don't  crave beans we don't crave grains like in itself it's just bland it's bland well I think a lot of bread is like honey wheat because I have to sweeten it up cuz it tastes like chalky why do you have to put mayonnaise on it because you have to try to put some kind of fat on it to make it taste decent tastes like lalla and that's a lot of opinion too but I really do think it's a lot of people's opinion tastes like  why you think you have to put so much mustard and mayo on sandwiches cuz bread is dry and it tastes like  I'm down 15 pounds chronic migraines and lower back pain through weight training great fantastic back pain is gone joints are pain free it's amazing it's amazing share with us what you ate today please I had some grass-fed beef I had some yuca and I had some bone broth I had a couple clementines and I worked out I had some bacon that's what I ate I'm no mystery but you have to do an elimination diet me telling you what I eat is nothing to do with you that's why I really don't like well this is what I'm eating today it gives people the wrong idea that oh let me eat that now you gotta you gotta  go through the process you got to do your homework Tibor great insight rolling the elimination and still taking glucosamine sounds like I need to stop the glucosamine so I get a true litmus test on how my body reacts that makes that make sense taking painkillers and taking anti-inflammatories doesn't let you for example no you know from scratch but okay yeah stuck in this body for life nutrition is an investment that gives immediate returns absolutely immediate and long-term that's what a lot of people forget is that you only have one body you know one of my viral videos the truth hurts right what I'm saying why don't you treat your body like your car everyone's out there you know waxing their car buffing and yo polishing the chrome but then you eat McDonald's like your body is so much more important your car you don't need your car you know you got legs alright you can walk you can walk you don't need a car a car just makes you get somewhere quicker but your body is equipped to do everything by itself you don't need a bicycle you need a car this is gonna take you longer to get somewhere so you have everything you need you just need to make sure you're treating it the right way awesome information thanks Kim let's get some more comments on Facebook before we bounce Joseph thanks man knowledge is the power here I got to get to work on my history essay so yeah you're welcome bro and this is not I'm not saying this is gospel this is the truth nothing else matters this is just a lot of stuff that's really coming to light remember there's not a ton of research this is still in its infancy in terms of nutrition a lot of people are just starting to see you know starting to break through a lot of this stuff is breaking through the noise of the government of the USDA food guidelines the food pyramid I think most of us that have a head in our shoulders we understand that's a scam and that's but it's a big machine and propaganda is a propaganda think about world war ii think about any kind of war major now with social media and the internet information gets around it's much harder to have the same level of propaganda you have a lot more voices talking you don't have let's say a couple news agencies giving you all the information you don't have them saying well this is bad this is evil and then you say okay that's evil yeah so we're trying to move this entire massive lurking organism which is the government in which is all these policies where all the food companies the medical companies the entire insurance you know everything from the government all the way down to the schools everything doctors mess and everything is just completely glued together with this huge huge huge massive loaf low-fat carbs grains all the right for just decades it's gonna take so long to undo that but you can do it starting today tomorrow like you don't have to wait for the recommendations to come down from the American Heart Association that those old white people slow making decisions we're trying to put money in their own pocket  all of them that I'm not completely anti-government but damn like they have way too much control and they spread all way too much and this has literally poisoned at least the American people but a lot of people are in the world have been suffering but other countries are much more progressive they make a lot more sweeping change with GMOs and with issues than the United States United States or just it's just the companies are too much in power the people really have to ants up to you right if you stop buying the they'll stop selling it like if you don't buy foods that have let's say everyone stops buying wheat everyone let's say everyone all of a sudden one day no one buys wheat anymore bread prices are gonna plummet and those companies are gonna start either removing everything or though they'll figure it out real quick all right they'll figure it out super  quick if no one goes to fast-food restaurants anymore and says you know what I don't want all this soy  you bring back real food they will change in a heartbeat they will pull a  u-turn like a car chase they will drift and fur they will completely 180 but no one's gonna do that you're not gonna have that sweeping everyone synchronized but you as an individual you can make those choices you have choices you can make every day so if you want to ignore and be like no enjoy you only live once Yolo then fine you only live once and you're only gonna live once with diabetes and in a wheelchair with joint pain so if that's how you want to live that's fine I'm just spreading what I'm aware of and I don't choose to live that way I'm gonna try to minimize that so if you want to use your one life to be sick and in a  wheelchair because you want to have your fast food you won't have your cake and you want to have all this garbage they'd do that every day if you want as your life I'm just trying to maybe give you a little insight so you can live a little bit more flourish a little more of a flourished life Elena I have eliminated wheat and grains but next I am going to be eliminating dairy my goal is to drop body fat percentage to enlist in the army sweet Colorado you ain't lyin validus many of my overweight chums criticized my diet and said they want to live a little I'd rather feel good 22 hours a day then eat a crap diet but enjoy junk food a few times a day but not like how I feel and look the rest of the day I hear you man you know a lot of you will get this crazy bloating when you go through an elimination diet and you really cut this  out for six weeks and then you have one of these foods and it blows you up and you're on the toilet you have stomach cramps and you feel like you have migraines all day you realize what that food is doing you don't even crave it anymore you realize oh my God if I have bread I am going to be jacked up you also realize why your body will store that much fat your entire life because if you have that violent of a reaction because you probably have bread since you're a baby you have cereal you start eating grains in cereal where you're three four years old so your body builds up these defense mechanism is still causing inflammation but your body is essentially fighting these foods your entire life so you don't notice how severe it is until you cut it out after three or four weeks your body absorbs those defense mechanisms and then your body is kind of neutralized you re sensitized to these foods because your body gets rid of your by doesn't need a standing army against grains if you're not eating grains right so if you don't use it you lose it grains are not present your body says but we don't need these cells we all need these warriors anymore so they get rid of them your body goes on its way and all of a sudden one day you test you're like let me after six weeks let me try some bread you have bread for this you have a tortilla for dinner and then next two days you were just like oh my god I feel like bloated you don't sleep well you're sweating and you realize oh my god this was me up severely my entire life I've been eating it almost every day so maybe that's why I have fat around my chest maybe that's why I can't get rid of the fat around my stomach maybe that's why my knees always hurt maybe that's why I get chronic migraines three times a week ah not to mention you're making it exacerbating it by taking ibuprofen and motrin and Tylenol and all this every time you have a headache because of what we just talked about that cycle right you're eating the food causing inflammation taking a pill to cover it up all you gotta do is start start the source start out what you're putting in your facehole alright eliminating inflammatory foods got a lot of questions a lot of stuff cool so anyone that's watching now make sure you scroll through the comments I highly recommend if you're watching on Instagram live to pop over after we after we leave here right now and check out Facebook because Facebook is really blowing up with some awesome interaction awesome comments and you know this is something that you can see that everyone has every everyone has their own story I'm gonna read this one because this is actually really powerful Aimee Vanover on Facebook I go to an integrative medicine doctor and she has helped me change my life through her knowledge information and blood work she was able to help me improve my overall health it was truly life-changing the things I am hearing you say tonight is basically everything I have done I totally relate and believe many of the things you are saying great great and what's even more amazing is each of you are watching me on some kind of cell phone or computer so you have access to all this information just start googling take  ten minutes when you're in the bathroom you're taking a and Google WGA Google wheat germ agglutinin check out lectins and just look this up there's a lot of stuff on it and it makes a lot of sense it makes a lot of sense and one of the things you have to be aware of as when you look at something from an educated perspective is that there isn't always a cutting my answer there isn't always a study that relates directly to that but you have to also use common sense common sense is powerful what's your instinct tell you what really makes sense about evolution about how human bodies work what really makes sense as to the patterns of our quality of life and our health in our society how about oats oats are the oats are the same which are the same oats barley all those things and when if you're consuming a lot of them if you have issues look any one if you have issues and you're trying to lose weight and you're struggling and you're doing all the macros or whatever you're doing and you're trying to narrow down what the issue is cut it out stop eating oats for six weeks stop eating bread for six weeks just stop eating it thoughts on quinoa same concept same concept anything you got to cook for like three hours to eat that's a grain I mean think about that I mean sweet potatoes yuca I mean some things need to be absorbed but with lectins you know there are certain things you can do that have been explained that you can reduce the impact of them let's say pressure cooking can destroy the electon proteins and break them down so if you must have beans you can use a pressure cooker so that will maybe impact them less but I would highly recommend doing elimination and then testing that let's say beans and seeing how you react and if it you up maybe you can go back to your lumination died off in a couple days and try them in a pressure cooker and see how you react if it's better then maybe that's a good way to prepare them if you absolutely love beans and you must have them but it's the process of you putting in the work I don't have all the answers I have a lot of these insights and things for you to try but as an individual you have to be willing to do that because everyone's gonna have a different permeability an issue with their intestines some of you are taking  ibuprofen every day some of you have never done that some of you are vegan some of you are I don't know some of you are older some of you are menopausal and some of you I mean everyone's got their own situation so you don't really know until you try some of these things but you have the ability to look into this stuff and to cross check I'm not saying listen to what I say and then go blindly do but what I'm tell you to do is nothing dangerous I'm not saying tons of meat or only eat corn I'm not telling you anything like that the fact the matter is if you cut out oats for six weeks you'll be fine it's not dangerous it's completely fine cut it out and then see for yourself you know bread cut it out and then see for yourself it's very simple what about this what about this I would say no I don't eat those things but cut out try it yourself don't take my word for it do it oh but I'm really addicted but what am I gonna eat what am I going to hold my food between if I don't eat bread I'll you and then go on with your life and why are you watching this you don't really want to learn you don't really want to know because you're not gonna do it straight to know and not to do is not to know it's just okay so it's only good advice if you take it so if you really want and that comes down to I think I did a post today I forget which post it was but it comes down to if you want it bad enough you'll do it if you're struggling right if you're doing everything and you really want to lean out you really want to lose this man you're building muscle you really want to take yourself to the next level then take it to the next level right put your effort where your mouth is don't just talk about it or if you don't want to do it then admit to yourself and it's not that important to me then it and keep doing it as long as you're happy but don't say you want to make all this change and then not put the work in to do it practice it practice it practice it these podcasts are a lot better than the first couple ones right the audio is better just the setup everything you know all my stuff that I'm doing is better two years ago because I practiced I practice video editing I practice doing the audio I know half the stuff I knew about audio synchronization editing and sound editing and all this  stuff practice practice I did and if I didn't know something if I don't I still do it all the time all the time oh well I don't know that so I go on Google or our YouTube it and I look it up and I find the answer well how do you do this or how do I do this kind of edit on my video I look it up and then oh cool and I do that and I know it and I've learned it by doing it so you have to do it so thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoy this episode I think it's a great a great great

stories unfolded quilt exhibit is upstairs this is our last quote it's a Mississippi map quilt wall hanging made in 1902 by Sally Lumley Miller of Yazoo County and it was donated by the Lea Edmond Miller family in 1902 Mississippi had 75 counties and Sally Miller pieced all of those counties except for one out of weighted silks weighted silks popular late 19th early 20th century were weighted with metallic salts to make them shinier and more lustrous the problem was that over time the metallic salts called caused the silk to deteriorate and eventually shatter and that is why the Mississippi Matco is exhibited flat in an enclosed case the one county that Sally Miller did not make from a weighted silk was her home county of Yazoo there it is she made it out of sturdy maroon velvet and it is still going strong I would like close with this collage of Mississippi quilters with the Mississippi map quo it symbolizes the rich and diverse heritage of Mississippi history and Mississippi culture that's represented in quilts and their makers and it is a rich and diverse heritage to understand to appreciate to learn from and to be inspired by thank you [Applause] the colors there's no bleeding of the colors and red tends to bleed so much could you comment on the material prep before the quilters began first of all I think I saw kte tree in the audience she is the mdh museum conservator so she actually arranged for conservation to be done on almost all of these quilts or so okay and some of that some of them I mean they've been collected in the 70s or 80s and so they'd had conservation before in terms of in particular red eye we could get off on a long tangent on red dye but um a colorfast red dye one was called Turkey red and it did not fade it might actually cause the fabric itself to deter ate but instead of fading or bleeding it stayed bright red other fabrics did not fit faded so fabrics that bleed all you quilters know you always wash your fabric before you use it did people always do that no that cut out chintz quilt that I showed you at the beginning with the nine rosette rosettes Lucy hatch whitfill made by enslaved women it still has when we go upstairs to see it you can still see some of the glazing on it so it was never washed so just fabrics will bleed yes wither I'm sorry oh yes yes the right and the even though was conserved you can still see that the slave chain quote made by FIBA Johnson in the 1930 some of the fabrics she used did bleed look look for some pink streaking on it thank you other questions there do you want to talk a little bit about the gallery tour that you're going to do oh sure so for those of you that um have time and stamina to stay with me there is some seating upstairs for the 40 quotes is it's the first exhibit in the Murli and Medgar Evers and FedEx exhibition galleries we're gonna go upstairs and I actually I'm pardon me I read from my script because my husband knows I mean I could talk to you a long time about these quotes right ville okay so but you didn't have all day and I needed to end at 1:00 so there's there's actually some more we could say about the quilts and then to be able to see them in person rather just on the slide so I'll be glad to to take all who want to go upstairs and and go through and have a tour of that well that's great I think that's the time that we have the books the catalogs are for sale next door stay here for a few minutes and we will be glad to sign those and meet upstairs at what time do you want to start oh um well let's see I mean people may need to have a rest break so-called rest break or whatever so should we start like in 15 minutes like a 1:15 so the elevators are outside these doors here across the way you can go straight up or there's a staircase over there we'll meet upstairs at 1:15 and Mary will lead us on a gallery tour of stories unfolded thank you all for coming today help me thank Mary Lorenz and I

for lunch and they were like talking to me about cooking and it was very sweet like she she has no idea I'm making this there she was talk we were talking about cooking and he was telling me his mom is not a very good cook and you know she said you know I didn't she didn't really take an interest in cooking until she's like finding it that you know when she goes out to eat that the food's not as good as what she has at home so it was very sweet so I'm gonna start I think I was originally gonna handwrite the recipes which I might still my handwriting is not the best but it's okay you know hi

to the auction well I missed the auction and so you're teaching two weeks of the summer and if summer school Kate Wow hi Kathy anyway so I missed Kerr's auction I yesterday just got away from me yesterday it was like a day where I'd usually get up early with him and you know what I didn't you guys he gets home really late from work and then I usually get up with him early make him some food and I don't have to but if I don't he really doesn't eat not because he can't make it himself it's just he gets home so late the time he gets up in the morning hey he's Magoo he's gonna go look this also has a magazine transfer I don't know how I you can see it the lips or a magazine transfer so anyway back thick so I missed Kara's auction so I went back to sleep so instead of me getting up I didn't get up until like I don't know 11 which for me is like really late I mean really you know sleeping really late and I all the stuff I needed to get done you're trying to pay off your Maui vacation I totally get it all right Vicky what are we supposed to call you cuz it's not Vicki sparkles anymore hi bunny love you bunny we're supposed to call you Jodi right right Vicky Jodi I have my electrolyte drink cause I have to tell you I'm in love what they think though I think it's called ultimate electric electrolytes so good so I got up so late I think it to do anything and then the next thing you know my daughter texted me she goes aren't you picking us up from the airport I'm like oh my god cuz I told them I said please message me when you are leaving Oh wahoo they were on a Wahoo sugar test there so I'm gonna jelly print a little on some to start some faces of my painting papers and then I'll stamp and stuff over them guys I got this big huge jelly plate my hottie bought it for me I haven't used it yet and when I was cleaning you know I told you guys I have half my stuff my supplies in my bedroom and half of them out here in my little space hi Nancy no Vicki's okay you don't want us to call you Jody you missed Kara's auction because you had to take an ant nap well I didn't get to do anything then I watched a little of the replay and um so if she has I'm just letting you know what I did there was a couple things in Austin I didn't sell that I thought wow I might like that so I messaged her on Facebook so you go everyw all the proceeds of any of her sales go to the basically the postage of the disabled artist foundation or Sumner or sometimes she buys jelly plates or whatever for the for the members for the people that are in that and her group and it's a completely confidential group so if you know of an artist that you know maybe he just just doesn't have the finances to really support an art you know artists therapy and I enjoy it a lot oh my gosh you guys I'm so excited about this jelly play I can't tell you so you know if you feel like it go over and watch her auction weird message from Facebook and say hey you know I didn't get to buy anything what's left occasionally she makes multiple kits of things so there are leftovers and I don't know when she's doing it next month I don't have the whole for one one so hi Lynne this is my okay so I realized you guys for those over knew I just just got here I got a job and I realized like this morning I was like putting together all my stuff that I need to sometimes up at 5:00 I was putting together all my stuff that I need to do for my like stuff that I won't I won't be able to get to unless I make a priority of it so I put all that together and I think I might be a little live stream next Friday but I'm not a 100% sure but I definitely won't be on Tuesday so if I don't get a chance to make a video since this is my first week at work um please be patient with me I will eventually eventually getting my groove what job are you ready hi Cheryl I am curating and rebranding a store so I'm working for this big company and they have I think I don't know if they have more than a dozen stores I don't know if it's like 18 stores honestly I don't know you guys they told me but um I my head didn't room didn't retain it so I'm rebranding them they have sort of high-end Hawaiian Living stores meaning like they really do support a large amount of craftsmen here in the Islands and they do manufacture their own stuff they manufacture koa wood furniture which co-op koa is a Hawaiian hardwood and I know my brayer sturdy but it still works and eventually I will soak it and eventually I will soak it and Murphy's Oil Soap and it'll all work out so I'm gonna rebrand their store and make it like a luxury gallery like I'm gonna what's exciting for me the creative part is I get to go around and I get to curate and find artists that I really like your work and because my taste is probably a little bit more eclectic than say like the average person's taste you know I'm looking at it as like a real opportunity to showcase some artists that might not get that opportunity because you know sometimes when you're arts a little bit more out there say then everyone else is people like you're not always the one people go to does that make sense gosh you guys this is the biggest jelly plate I think I've ever know it's the biggest one I've ever have it is like a big it's a big jelly plate anyway so where's my jelly plate tools this is my favorite Gelli plate tool if you guys ever find one it's a Tupperware pot scraper don't look at it has dot it has a comb it has this I like it I don't know where I got it I miss it got it had a um a yard sale or honestly I don't know maybe I got it at a thrift store maybe somebody sent it to me and happy it's terrible so I'm super excited about that part the part that's a little daunting for me is is the it's finding a staff because you guys half the battle for me as far as a as far as up working working gallery or successful gallery and I'm gonna print on this um Restoration Hardware catalogue I don't know why I like them I do it's ridiculous but I do in their free Sophie anybody everybody was asked me but I'm just telling it so I'm printing on today so I'm a little nervous about the staffing thing because the staff you know your staff is everything so I'm like a little a little nervous to see what whom I can find and and I don't want to just take anybody because this sort of branded store or this is the flagship store they're gonna do four more after this and asked me if I would do the other four and three more and I said can we just get through the first one you know because they don't always manifest the same way as they do on the mainland you know like what an idea is here may not translate well I'm super excited do you know much I love our big hugs Kate because I'm happy to see you hi Irene greetings to you from the Netherlands okay let's see how this came out because most of these are gonna generally be cut up into used use as collage bases or pieces or bits or pieces but I really like this one but it needs to dry um I don't know we'll see how things go I mean I'm excited but I'm also I'm not gonna lie I'm a little nervous fun fact people who wear light blue and bright yellow clothing are perceived as more friend anything that there's not wearing this colors hey I didn't know that's awesome it is a perfect job for me Kathy I hope it's successful I mean it is a perfect job for me it is an absolutely perfect job for me I agree well what's kind of even nicer is it wasn't really looking for a job so this friend of mine called me and told me this gallery in our town and it's sort of a big deal gallery it's gonna was looking for consultants and you know he's like please apply please apply so I'll tell you how I came about so for like the 15 seconds I was on indeed when you're applying for a job on indeed I guess I didn't know this but you can make your your resume public or private you guys I never apply on indeed I never apply for anything like that you know so for the 15 seconds that my that my resume was public this lady from human resources for this company found me and she was like you know she was really um she was really aggressive and I you know I appreciate that in people she was like you're perfect for this job of of about and can we have a phone interview I mean she was urgent about it where I find we find when you live in the here that there's not a lot of urgency I'm gonna love this I'm gonna do more layers oh this is just a drugstore bag how many of you guys have to stuff in your stash it's like ridiculous right but I gotta use it or lose it so that's my goals to use it so anyway she hurt I appreciated her she was very urgent in her in her conversation with me she was very urgent and her like there was a sense of urgency and she was just like please don't let this pass by you know she was just like you know she was selling me but she was also saying look you know I can see from your resume that she taking a hiatus and that's understandable because you guys the art business is really stressful I'm really gonna love this when it dries I made you another layer on top of it but it's a little wax my green paint it was like almost out so I wanted to use it so it's a little watery so you know I appreciated her urgency I also appreciated the fact that she was that she was really honest with me she was like no it's not for everyone but you have many CVS bags whoo I would be like jelly printing away so [Music] how are you miss Cheryl you like the yellow and blue um so she was honest with me you know and I appreciated that her the candor of her conversation and that she was like you know just saying like she was saying things to me that you know I would say to somebody that was applying for a job or you know that I'd really want to work with but the staff thing is a little bit stressing me out so anyway she found me in that five minutes that I was live correspond with me I had a phone interview it happened to be in a Wahoo visiting my sister who was visiting her daughter because her daughter goes to college there and my sister was like it's better that you come here because remember I told you guys I was supposed to go see her and the Carolinas where she lives and she was like it's better that you couldn't see me here because and you don't have to fly the 13 hours because it is a long flight so I managed to turn my schedule and I go see room when I was on Oahu the lady called me for a phone interview and she says oh man I have the CEO of our company call you and I sit with my sister and you know the last job the last company job that I had I worked for I work for a company and the guy was a crook so that's kind of why I stopped cuz I was just like I was burned out you know so the guy was a crook and I have to see people face to face in the last job that I took you guys like this I was no I didn't interview face to face so I didn't see the guy's face Charlie stop guys I had to the Charlie's dog bed like right next to me because otherwise she'll try to crawl on my lap the whole time I'm sitting here and it's ridiculous so [Music] and I'm only gonna do one side because it's usually glued on the other I'll leave you to turn one you're doing jelly fits and you're doing it stop yourself right now stop and they'll let me turn when Ashley swore oh that's awesome would you please stop charlie you guys she's missing everyone she doesn't understand that there's like no think every little noise she hear she thinks somebody's coming home and it's not so anyway I'm excited about the job but I also don't have it usually I have a fool of applicants that I've saved up from all that I don't anymore oh I'm loving this one do you guys like this one hi Angela Angela how did your shower go Angela did a book shower a baby was at a baby book shower or children's book shower how did it go anyway so she you know I'm starting and I'm trying to get myself excited about it like

than little one you guys and I never really talked about it but she had been diagnosed with scoliosis kind of severe scoliosis and the diagnosis was kind of late because she didn't have any outward signs but when you did an x-ray she had pretty severe scoliosis I was like 40 degree turn 40 degree s-curve and you know we went to Shriners that's where they send you here Shriners Children's Hospital we were going like weekly and she was braced and then they were just like you know because evidently they think that once you started your menses yeah you have about two years from that time until your final growth but you know it you guys I don't know I don't totally agree with because I remember like I got mine really young but I remember like growing a couple more inches in high school you know like about anyway whatever so they basically told us that that she that she was gonna Chi would just need surgery and so they were just opting for surgery guys and every single time we go they it was you know it's pretty frightening when you when you think about you know having a metal rod in your back your whole life well in the interim I have a really dear friend that is an amazing she's amazing healer herself but she's a massage therapist and she was like there's this guy that lives on the island and she told me his name she says really difficult to get into she said um if you can get a an appointment with him it'll be life-changing and honest like okay so I just kept calling him until he finally took his in he's retired and so she's going like twice a month you guys he studied with Ida roll for you guys do you guys know anything about Ida Roth and roll thing anyway she was this person that really believed that you could really manipulate your body and change anything and she would take people that couldn't even stand up and manipulate them so wait and you know they were hunched over manipulate them in a way that they became you know that they could stand and mocking every you know do that anyway so he studied with her and he's quite old you know so I was like I don't know if this is gonna even help or whatever anyway we've started going twice a week and can I tell you her curve or twice a month her curve went from this forty degree because once your curves over like thirty five I think they they so you need surgery and the thing is a brace doesn't stop the curve it just supposedly holds it in place like so once she was already a forty she would always be a forty she would never get less you guys she's under twenty now her curve is under twenty so she's not eligible for surgery anymore that I have to tell you the doctors at Shriners Hospital are like one of them what the heck we did and I told them we go to this guy strengthener stomach and so it's awesome we're happy you remembered them checking your spine and the fitness of crap that exact reason yeah but you know what she she got her period really early she got her period which is like ten she'll be 13 so you know I think maybe some of us we have to check even earlier I know right it was a miracle you guys I cried I mean I know people have miracles happen all the time but I was just like that is a mess as a rock enough that was like rock and mass crying you know just grateful just super grateful that my friend you know it's kind of weird is it you know I told you guys that we moved off the island for just a little bit I had a different job or my job here took me there and we moved off the island for a minute and and my family wasn't happy they were not happy so that's how we really came back you really came back and they took a different job and and do you guys realize that had I not taken that different job that ended up being a nightmare job might I add ended up being I told you guys the guy was embezzling it was just horrible it was like experience anyway if we hadn't taken that job we would not have ever come back here and never been able to meet this doctor that he was a medical doctor in New Zealand he's lived in Hawaii for about 30 years did you know it doesn't translate your medical degrees don't translate to here so um we would have never gone to him and if we'd never gone to him she would probably have a metal rod in her back so just when I they that you know I'm gonna think that that job was horrible because it was not gonna lie that job was really bad now working with people they're not to have no integrity in a business it's already sort of sketchy ridiculous so we would have never met that doctor you guys he's amazing I would recommend him to anybody you know he says the problem is it takes time you know for it to work so let's say he's been going since August of last year I mean you know August of yeah last year so she's thinking with this September October there August of this year I guess she's been going for about a year so she's probably had yeah August says she'll be a year so she's probably had and he went away for a while so say she's had 20 treatments I don't think she's had that many but in 20 treatments to take somebody that was in a state of where they were gonna put a metal rod in their back to not being eligible for surgery anymore is miraculous in my book that's so sweet hey Laura law says it I brought great karma to so many people in a small portion I'm your temple da that's a sweet guys I felt blessed I really feel blessed I feel blessed that I feel blessed I just feel blessed you know he says people come to him he tries to only work on he works on anyone I think that come that you know he feels guided to guys he's like it he reminds me of like a not that I've met too many Indian Saints but he's not in the invite but like if you've ever gone to the Himalayas and/or gone to anywhere where people like sit like a Tibetan monastery where people sit in meditation he reminds me of that kind of a person now mind you he has kids and a beautiful wife and his kids are grown they you know he's like a normal person but I'm just saying he's got that energy that sort of like I don't know Royals feeling of energy or something I don't know anyway he's just he was he's miraculous but he nobody told me I said to myself why don't you teach other people he goes I've tried he goes what he goes I've had students I've had apprentices he goes it definitely CIPA to know not everybody's at the same level of understanding and wanst it and wants to really listen to their body and listen to sometimes when I do these magazines these newspaper things I fall in love with them do you guys do that is it just me and my weirdness is that I'm like oh I love that just the center part anyway I don't know I hope somebody carries on what he's done cuz you know that's why I don't believe that everything there's only one way for anything you know I think you have to figure out what works for you you know like after really seriously like look inside yourself and find what works for you you have a few papers you left like eight sometimes I'm like the ones that I really love I don't even do anything with I just like to look at them it's so stupid I know that still and they're usually painted on like newspaper or magazine pages or recycling of some of some sort or something you know they're not painted on I'm not painting on art paper you love recycle art supplies need to I have like a like a thing for them I don't know why it's not that I don't like really nice art supplies I do but I just love recycled stuff like I'm gonna love this like I already started to love it can you see I call the different layers and I don't know it's just me and my weirdness is right I like it all um so that's what's kind of going on in my world I mean I you know I shouldn't say that I'm not excited for this job I am I'm just a little nervous because of the you guys right now we're going through we nobody really wants to talk about it or take it seriously here but it's true we're going through a hiring crisis here because there are no very few affordable places to live people are moving off in droves and what what's not understandable so we get like 2.4 million visitors a year to our tiny island and we only have a hundred and seventy-five thousand full-time residents so at some point somebody's gonna have to stop air B and being all the affordable housing and you know what they call a median price housing here you guys are you ready for this so they build these new subdivisions and they tout that it's affordable on all this seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars you and they're not luxury homes okay let's get something super clear they're not luxury homes they're not like that's not like with a pool or anything so it's just I don't know think something's gotta give here and something's gotta give what are you gonna do you have a collection of your favorite you're gonna bind them in a book oh that's good when I start my new job in Monday I'm not right who can afford that you guys have no idea no right so start at Monday but when I'm doing on Monday is I'm going into a different store than my store and learning the point-of-sale systems and all their computer stuff logging in so they can figure out how to do payroll so I can figure out how to do all that sort of stuff and I'm training in a different store than the store that I'm gonna be managing which I actually appreciate you guys sometimes I think it's hard for people that have a sponge maybe it'll work so sometimes I think it's hard for people like if if you have to Train somebody that's your boss you know what I mean it's gets resentful so I appreciate the fact they're letting me do all my my training at a different store and I thought I had an assistant store manager I was super excited about it cuz I really like her I don't know her so well but I mean I've worked I've been exposed to her and worked around her over the years and I was super excited and I guess she went to give notice at her current job you know to say that she was gonna and they offered her like double her salary that's how much of a of a hiring crisis were in right now I just put some water down to see if I could get some of the paint that's dry up I may not be able to but we'll see it's kind of hot here today so it gets my paints dry and faster than it normally would eventually it makes some pool layer somewhere even if it's not my and you guys I have many more colors in this this is just all I have close to me must've been working on something in that color family yeah that's been working on something in this color family and that's what I have right here I hope I'm in a rock Laura the one thing I did do is I found some clothes to wear to work gambits I don't know next week I'll definitely built I think I'll be able to stream on Friday because I think they've given me Friday off but I won't be able to stream on Tuesday so I don't know until look until I'm in charge of my own schedule right now I'm just training so until I'm in charge of my own schedule I won't know and my Heidi and I are also trying to work out the fact that our little one is um me right now she's at her grandma's or whatever on the mainland but we're trying to work out like the logistics of our little one because our little one will um you know one of us will need to take her and pick her from school so we're trying to like he's trying to take like Mondays and Tuesdays off and I'm gonna take Wednesdays and Thursdays off or something like that you get the you get the drift so that one of us can so there's always somebody to take her and pick her up from school and I'll have to just deal with whatever the one day like the one day that neither one of us are are able to we'll have to like one of us will have to do the morning and one of us will have to do the evening afternoon I'm looking at two guys like that like I'm a ton two and because I have so many more tools than one amazing but I don't know like this so I don't know I'm excited I found something to wear which is like a plus for me cuz I told you guys i throw my work clothes away your mic in this page too sometimes when I make these sometimes when I'm making them I imagine you guys feel the same way like you're making them you're really into it really enjoy in it and then you're just like oh my gosh I just love these

bought it for me okay so he tried to buy it for me at some point I told you guys we only have one little craft store here it's a Ben Franklin and most of it is cake decorating and floral arranging you know so like party stuff like nappy like you know wedding things right so one time every few months they have a 40% off coupon okay think of a 42% coupon off of one regularly priced item okay this is the catch ready for the catch the catch is that it can't be it can't be a Ben Franklin just can't be a Ben Franklin thing it's kind of whole thing so so you can go there but you may not like say you find something and it's not it's Ben Franklin that puts their things two ways one way is where it has like um if it ends in the number 88 you can't get the discount on it and if 99 he can so he went there and because you guys here everything is like it's ridiculously priced so he went there and tried to get it accepted do not buy it unless it's on sale and yes it was expensive I want to say it was like Oh $60 or something I would never have one like in that I would never bought it for $60 you know that's just it but with the 40% coupon so he went one time and the lady wouldn't sell it to him and then it came back around I guess this coupon came back around or he was aware of it I forgot all about it and he went back and he demanded that they he demanded demanded they honor the coupon cuz he found out what the what the deal was he demanded if they arm of the coupon so he surprised me so he bought it 40% off otherwise I'm sorry guys I wouldn't have done it I'm liking this painting paper I'm really liking this one there wasn't one to it cuz it's just like I don't need another craft supply and I certainly have tiny painting I certainly have small um jelly plates so you know I don't necessarily need another one but it was very thoughtful he was being thoughtful soft he's always thoughtful you guys I'm very lucky it's very thoughtful and he's an artist himself so he's like he gets it like he never like says a word to me about my art mess ever he never says word one that's how lucky am i that he never says a thing about my art mess cuz you know what I got an art much going on I do not gonna lie and I saved the most random ridiculous stuff you bought one that fits a four size paper ooh good gotta love a man who can make a coupon for God supplies work oh my god no it was the principle you know it's the principle you guys when you live here and everything is so expensive you sort of like I don't know you sort of like you don't give in to win it it's not working for you you're like oh no they have to make it work if you want my business it's stupid I know but anyway and for those of you that were asking the other day about our lovely Tracy from its Nana's place I chatted with her briefly yesterday she is doing great she's gonna be back on YouTube before you know it she just is working a lot and you know like any new venture when you have a new new job or anything you know what it's like you guys you just got to make that your priority so she's working a lot and I think she said she'll be back really soon love a mess guys I'm really into it I think she'll be back really soon and then she'll be you know back to making her her messes and being creative and I mean I'm sure what she's doing now she's creative but you know what I mean it's like those things are you're like okay okay I'm liking that let me so I can find but you know what saying that no matter how big my space is like it always ends up being I always end up working in this small space did any of you guys have that we're like no matter how big your space is you always end up working on a small space all right let me see I'm gonna do this on this cheap I'll show you the front of it cuz I know somebody's gonna ask me it's this it's cheap it's like drawing paper and it was probably like $5 a pad or something what what did it oh my god crazies is they're giving out free pimp trees at Walmart today oh my daughter brought home ones and mom I think it is it ease it into but what is a pimp tree I don't even know Christine says oh I guess Laura's like what it's a bit of what the heck is a pimp tree and that name I'm dying right and Chrissy says oh my god Laura it's a one of those treat for air fresheners for a car for a car rear view mirror that smells it smells like a headache haha he calls him pimp trees oh my god I never heard it either Laura you and I are in the same boat okay I don't know what it was either I didn't know what a pimp tree was how many of you guys know what a pen tree was anyway I'm just like guys so people here speak in like there's a Hawaiian dialect okay they caught kitchen like pidgin English and it came about has like kind of a really cool history I mean it came about because you know a lot of the people that came here came here until you know from all over the mostly from Asian countries but a lot like then also Portugal - so like Hawaii has a melting pot of Japanese Chinese Korean Portuguese you know and they all would work with each other in whatever capacity and because they didn't share a common language they kind of created their own and it came out of like all these difference got a very interesting um history Hawaii anyway so it's and then you know obviously the Hawaiians that came from Polynesia right so oh my gosh I'm loving this piece okay this is funny I think this is my favorite piece so far so look Laura and Laura she charges extra for gank gangster ephemera okay my god so they still speak in pidgin here I mean not everybody but you know and you got a mix of people and you just gotta go with it you just can't even like you got to be available I'm just go this where you live right so Mike hottie you guys you guys saw a picture of him Hey he's like very he's very well educated he's very well-spoken he's like he's just he's a sweet man anyway he's he's what he's at work and he works at a restaurant gangster ephemera it's perfect it's perfect so he works a restaurant and it's a really nice restaurant on my dad and one of the girls it's at the host and she's a local girl right and so she's telling him and they comes out in the Hawaiian language every every vowel has every you two sound at every vowel like you know and so anyway they they make his name something really funny which is not his name but they sound that every every word so I'd be like if your name was if your name is Kate they would call you caught a okay so they they call him this name it's not the same but anyway if it's sounding on all the letters of the name and one of the girls sit says to him something he's like okay what's going on because you know he was a ask her he they ask him something and he works

it's multicultural as you can get as like New York City I mean the difference is in New York City you know you have the history of lots of different cultures coming together right but here here this these are these people have actually melded together into into a community that is beautiful it's just so in its in its not only is it beautiful but it's also like you just see like this melding of tradition and community is it's beautiful here you know I haven't sprayed alcohol inks on mine APG saying you can but um but it will it will stain it is that what you said APG it will stain your jelly plate I haven't tried it you guys have like my jello just a lot and I don't I don't want to sitting on this like this big wicker basket underneath my table hopefully in one of these pools I'm gonna get like a real I'm hoping in one of these pools I'm gonna get a real um like a whole pool I may have to do it with packing tape though you know the whole pool where you can reach underneath and get all the layers sometimes it has to be on the on a on a thicker paper I have tried pasta pans I haven't tried them on my jelly plate have a PG might have have you a PG if you choose saying alcohol inks will stain so you're talking about just regular rubbing alcohol oh that might yes I don't have any over here with me yeah it'll definitely make like some cool patterns in it that's for sure I have I have not tried pasta pins on a jolly plate I have Tasca pins and I have used them many times but I've never tried a lot of jelly plate how many of you guys have tried them on a jelly plate if any of you guys read Koska pins on a jelly plate find a place to put this orange down before I move it this is the problem I like to move all my stuff and then I have a space and then ridiculous you got alcohol inks for birthday president month ago um you guys I think I don't I've used my alcohol and used to use them all the time okay I will say right now I haven't used him in quite a while you know I just haven't used him in front of while so I can't actually so if you do you think she wipes hers down with a baby white before she puts her jelly plate up um I sometimes do that sometimes don't I mean this one's a new one so maybe I will but sometimes what I do is I let it get all like this oh whatever it is and then when I go to then I take it to the sink with some I take it to the sink with some Murphy's Oil Soap and I soak it same with my stencils because I'm not a neat crafter I share Deline I'm not a neat crafter how many of you guys are neat crafters who Oh how many of you guys watch barb Owen and Diane Faygo I loved them and watch them and Diane was talking about how she pins other people's messy studios which I love and she but she has to work in a very clean and orderly sort area and I appreciate that that's just not me I appreciate it how many of you guys are like that where you have to like work in a in a really clean studio environment I can start out that way but it never ends up that way I have a collection of stuff everywhere you're a neat crafter Diana so she's a really neat Raptor and Jersey says she's really not a neat crafter yeah a regular business sized envelope Angela that's all a regular business sizing Andalus not a you know just one stamp 13 ounce one stamp and I think it's less you send it overseas but I don't know you're one that me you guys there weren't that many that signed up from only hey be Jesus she does have to do the dishes before she cooks your tables a nightmare Malia - to your dinner table hates you you're messy here you know what you know I admire people that are really neat where did you say milli I missed it Lucy and Malia says our tables a nightmare my tables a nightmare to you guys I do because I cook all day long it's around this silly keto diet it's not a silly diet it's actually working for me I've lost like 30 pounds another 30 to go I think I'll be like happy but i am i have to i I must wash it and I'm a dishwasher but I have to want I wash dishes that's the one thing I do at least and no matter who cooks in my house I will definitely do the dish clean the dishes or whatever all the time I mess load my dishwasher and unload it two or three times a day but I always have this big pot to dump it in there I'm always scrubbing pot haha I love you Laura Laura says I admire neat people but stop trying to be like them and accept myself for what I am girl you and I are the same boat I'm gonna really like the full lungs bag I mean that little CVS or nose Longs Drugs okay this one I think is gonna be a good poll because it's gonna give me a lot of some of the layers from underneath [Music] Milius is for hahahaha Diane says she and CH a messy craft room er table Melia says her mom is a real neat freak and honestly you have stressful as a kid you've been gone for two weeks and your desk is piled up from stuff your sister found for you Cassandra it's that a good thing or a bad thing okay I'm liking that like Laurie says she was a neat freak two million now our oldest now it's your oldest job you're happy happy you're happy thingy um there are certain things I meet with like you know like all my work clothes are all neat I have I have to have my towels folded so that I can fit them all in the cabinet so I kind of like stress that sort of neatness everything else you know what I used to be it used to be like incredibly but I would I would stress myself out okay I would stress myself out how many of you guys do that you stress yourself out like I would never let anybody just randomly walk into my house right now guys I've been purging but I've also been like my honey and I were trying to define what we should keep him what we should let go of as far as like um as far as like just stuff like he's got he's got papers and just all kinds of stuff that is like business papers and stuff like that so he's been going through him so we have piles of that and my kids decided they we're all going through their stuff so I have the eggs and bag take the thrift store a thrift store and they weren't open so it's like you know my little one grows so fast it used to have a friend we would give all her clothes to but then they don't live on the side of the island anymore so unless I make a point to find where they are I'm just gonna take them to the thrift store I used to do that how many of you guys used to do that like you hold on to stuff thinking I'm gonna give this to so-and-so and then it just never manifested because whatever so my house right now I want my name it aunt you hold on to more things Allah it's weird how people change these to stress you out about neatness so much hatred no I used to never let anybody in my house less my house is impeccable and now I don't care I mean you know I mean my name is three walked into her messy craft room and said what the heck happened in here [Laughter] you have too many bags for donation mister oh I do too we don't have donation bins here but we do have like you know thrift stores and I don't know sometimes they turn you away sometimes are like oh no we can't you know and so she was great now my older children okay you guys ready my older children they are they are neat freaks okay my oldest daughter is a minimalist she she doesn't keep anything she travels you know I told you Sheena has been travel all over and they've been living in China for a couple years they lived in Japan for a while I think they're going back to China much to my chagrin they were headed there and then they've been having some visa issues this work visa because of all the stuff that's going on here but kind of hoping that they don't but whatever there is an Francisco right now they only whatever they can fit in my suitcase and they don't get attached to anything you had a flood in the closet and in a closet ceiling and you had to pack a toss a ton yeah I hear you I have to have my house folder so they don't all fall off the shelves and I that's only really the one thing that I held onto in my obsessive compulsive now my sister on the other hand she is a neat freak like nothing you have ever seen okay she she's a neat freak and she she's beyond beyond neat freak and she can't handle any mess and she came out stand like my crafting thing she doesn't do any she had this home-improvement so it's her creative outlet she can't like when she came to my house she freaked out because I had so much crafting stuff oh there's a place called a crib the Cancer Center in Miami and they take a lot of stuff that helps you purge that's good Laura says she's actually minimalist she owns about a suitcase worth of personal items and now thanks T to me thanks to you people I've acquired a room full of Greg things apply in a year's time well good thank you Laura we're happy to help you with that we're happy to help you you're trying your best downsize Mary Lou there's gonna be some good bits in this especially if I cut them up they're gonna be like some of them are gonna be I'm gonna like them yeah this one's gonna this one is like aha all right look at this one I don't know if you can tell from there but the texture of it and oh can you guys really see it when I think of downsizing I run right out and buy something like fast y'all so you know since I've been doing this keto diet I mean I haven't always cooked I'm always you know let's face it you make pizzas since we're not eating pizza anymore and I love him I don't want him to feel bad about his not being able to cook right so so he bought me a I must have said it in passing like it must have been like ahh cuz you guys I've given away because we've moved so much I've given away like everything everything like I just give it away I know it'll come back to me somehow I think it's a perfect background to Linda I'm loving that I'm like it's my favorite I think love it really love it anyway so he bought me I must have said something oh because for a while there and I still make it I make this really spicy asian-inspired coleslaw it has like sesame oil and like tamari or coconut aminos or soy sauce if you eat soy sauce and it has it has like all those types of things in it right and but I like my I was grading it on a grater how many of you guys make your coleslaw on a grater like you grate it with like a cheese like a cheese grater you know and I like it like that but I was grading my finger one day and I said I really wished I hadn't given away my food processor not that I used it so much and in my head you guys I'm thinking like a $20 food processor you know like a Hamilton Beach $20 food processor from Walmart I'm not thinking like the $500 food processor processor from wherever right so the next thing I know he kind of come home and he goes happy birthday and I said whose birthday and he says oh it's for you and he had bought me this expensive food processor - I'm not like a $20.00 Hamilton Beach food processor I didn't mean like a get on it but yeah I don't want to I can pull that so it's like well I love that I love it so I don't have room for all this stuff you guys and so I meant so I have to be really careful for what I say so now you know it's like now I'm I just don't say I don't say anything because I don't want anything else I don't say like oh I wish I don't think he died me oh we bought me a thing to seal your food you know the one of those things because I was complaining that I can't say much as complaining that our freezer I would put whatever in there and it would get freezer burn and I was kind of complaining about it I said you know and I meant like one of those sealing things have you seen them they're like 20 bucks and you can use them with regular baggies and they suck all the air out of it guys always get big everything you're absolutely right you're absolutely right they always do get big everything so I was like you bought me one of these like food silly things which I've used eight guys because we buy things in bulk at Costco and it definitely I told you we have banana trees and stuff growing on our yard even though we're not eating them our little one does so I freeze them for her because she loves to make smoothies whatever so I mean I'm trying to be like more but because I really I need to downsize in a way that works for me but since since this whole keto thing he's been like I guess because now he's all into counting the macros and you guys he's like into it when he might eat with than I am I guess I should be grateful writing macros and whatever anyway it's like do you want this do you want a stick blender I'm like I don't need another thing I don't have a room I don't have room for it we checking about your ninja you're afraid of it yeah it's a food saver that's exactly what it is you guys that's what he bought me it's a nice thing you guys but I don't have room for anything I told my supplies so I'm liking this one I wish I had all my colors over here I don't I don't know where you guys have to go on search for my it's probably I remember putting it in one big container at one point I remember like putting it in not all of it I kept solving and these little tiny plastic those little shoebox ones you know I'm that little clear shoebox containers I remember putting I think some of it and had those really gigantic containers and I put some of it in that I have a feeling he just didn't even look inside of it and took it I think it's with my stencils you guys my stencils are in a book I made a book for my stencils I can't find it I think you put it up I think it's all on that and that tub of those big tubs that you can't see through I am gonna do a purge I am gonna do I'm really gonna do a purge I am definitely gonna do a purge I'm gonna go through all the stuff that I don't use I haven't used in a while and let go of it you might have to get my ninja out cuz there's a cauliflower fried rice you wanna make you know I haven't even tried cauliflower rice yet I mean I haven't tried it APD says she has her stencils on a garment right clothes rack and you love them that way but you have a huge studio space I've seen you he is studio space it's awesome I want the recipe for the cauliflower rice I haven't made it um I have some of my things in a shoe rack like that you're talking about a Fuji but most of my stuff okay it was really I finally got my I was getting ready to film like uh this is my studio and I'm loving it my little dining alcove space and then my daughter's husband in the back here and my other daughter was living at home at the same time and then like our house is only three bedrooms so I made the the dining alcove their bedrooms in it out so now and after that it's just sort of gone to hell in a handbag really seriously it's been like one of those things where it's been one of those things where it's just like no matter what I do I just can't I need to purge because I think I can really did a bunch of stuff in the time that my kids are here because I told you have friends she's bringing out what brings me on her recycling things and you guys I definitely my book addict I am I can't get away from it I try I try I try I try I don't know what it is but I'm a high paper I'm putting it on a jelly plate a mono printing plate so I don't know you guys I'm like definitely have some

says in Marilyn they have a Michaels Alejandra Bobby so I love the fact I love this this YouTube community for a lot of different reasons but one of the reasons I really love it is like we all watch each other and you know feel really familiar with each other and feel excited to see each other to artwork and all that but I think what's even more exciting is that when you see like you and Diane get together and you really see the real people behind it all cuz I mean videos you can you can do some kind of great things with videos and not really ever have like a not really ever have like a clear idea of who someone is right but then you see videos and you feel like wow they feel like or when you guys getting together and sharing it was it was just lovely and I love this community of YouTube and I'm grateful but it's in my life I mean you know I'm super grateful that it's in my life so it was so cool to see them together I agreed Lauren I think it was really cool barb it was awesome that you guys like got together feels like you're sitting down with an old friend isn't it because you feel like you've known them or you got to know them for however long you like watch their

Friday so if I have off on Friday I will be back on Friday it will not stream on Tuesday because I'm working and you guys because of the time difference so I usually strain at three o'clock my time when you guys are in the summer and in the winter I stream have two o'clock my time right because it makes it the same kind time 9:00 p.m. Eastern but because my job is not close to my house and I have to work I mean a gallery doesn't just the galleries on a nine-to-five job so the only way I can see that I have able to stream is if I get up super early and OH Amir so sweet I hope I rock it out I really do Emma says hello to IU Watchers outside the box all you lurkers so this is kind of like just in case I don't get stream for a while this is my just in case I don't get to stream for a while

how many of you right here right now or like a morning person I don't know what you're talking about I'm a morning person guys I'm not a morning person they've not a morning person I'm talking about being away miss Mary love you guys good partner it's so funny he was like well you're the one that said that you needed a job I said I didn't think I needed his job you guys okay the forward one is I like my own autonomy I like my own autonomy so I was faced with either doing something like starting a business again I didn't know if I could do with it with a small child you know like or and then this job came along like I did it wasn't like actively looking for a lake it wasn't actively good okay I'm gonna go find a job I was actively saying to myself okay what what might I like to do what would be fun if I could do it what does it look like if I could do it um does that make sense so doesn't like isn't like okay the time is actively looking for a job I would have had one long before now and then this job came up and it was sort of like a little bit too perfect for me meaning like it it suited what I like and in the things I enjoy doing I don't know if he's happy that I have a job he didn't say he wasn't but he was like you gotta said to me this morning kind of funny it goes thank you for cooking for me and the name is hey I don't know what he was thinking I'm not gonna cook any mom and I have to eat but he's like thanks for cooking for me and thanks for whatever you know and I don't know you guys I can't figure things out sometimes how many of you like have that experience where you're like you doing what makes you happy and it may be it doesn't make everybody else happy in your life but you're doing what makes you happy me I'm like my table is getting smaller and smaller time you used to be a morning person hi Margy morning Margie says morning happens too early in the day never a few hours later I could be a morning person Margie you and I are in same boat hey PG says she used to be a morning person but lately I'm kind of lazy in the a.m. I'm not a morning person so 5:00 a.m. for me is like I don't know it's actually like a little bit like hell he does want me to be happy and he does want me to know that he lives in it okay he loves me and appreciates me I know he does kidding he tells me all the time but it was it was sort of funny this morning because I think you yesterday I didn't get up with him he cries I did not I I'm not a morning person and I've been getting up at 5:00 a.m. and I don't sleep a lot how many of you guys don't or not how many of you guys are not like heavy-duty sleepers I'm not a heavy do to sleep brief guys I'm not you know I never have my sister makes fun of me she's two-faced she says I just take cat naps okay and so you know I think that you know yesterday I didn't get up with him and he did not make him you guys we have leftovers in the fridge he didn't even take himself leftovers okay I don't know what he just couldn't wrap his head around that there were leftovers or I don't know there was leftovers in the fridge okay so I told him he was like if you make up if you make a menu is funny look if you make a menu I'll make sure that I do my part meaning I could buy make a menu cuz I usually just cook on the spur of the moment I'm like oh we have this and this will make that you know I don't make a plan so here's funny whole damn else I like not getting a job isn't like I'm gonna stop living my life you don't sleep well you sleep two to three hours a night you're not a good sleeper either out I'm not a good sleeper I'm not and so you know like then you guys he's so slow in the morning it takes them forever to do anything that kind of I don't say it irritates me but it really does it irritates me okay it completely irritates me camille tortilla package so I thought - would go ahead and jelly play it on it you slip too much as a child you don't sleep well either he might be missing me already your eyes he's so rarely home you know I told him he needs to get a hobby I told him that he should told me needs to get a hobby think he used to play tennis all the time cuz I hate playing tennis he loves it Carmen says she sleeps two to three hours every night for the past 10 years when I quit graveyard shifts at a nursing home girl I'm telling you it's like I don't sleep I want to sleep it's not like and I'm tired but I lay down and if something wakes me up then that's done you know what I mean it's like okay then I'm awake isn't that ridiculous but that's just how I roll I don't know what it is and that's just how it works for me hi you gonna go take a nap tipsy good for you it is hard so like I don't know I guess if you've always been a sleeper like my sister has to sleep like nine hours a day always has maybe even more she goes to bed super early she goes to bed like at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock I'm an idol can I go to bed early you know and if I do go to bed that really this is the problem so if I go to bed at like say I'm really tired and I go to bed at eight or nine depends I'm up at two and that's it have a good nap we want you to have a good nap gypsy well says she didn't waste a sunrise I do sometimes but I'm not you guys anyway so I'm not all like there are some people though in the morning or like so amazing right they just get there like efficient and they're awake and make it says she's watching in bed she's hoping to nap herself Nikki we hope you get a nap hope that works for you I I can't I can occasionally nap during the day but in all honesty it just throws my whole schedule off it just throws me off so I just don't do it do not do it I just don't know how many of you guys a nap how many of you are Nappers nothing wrong with napping napping yeah napping can be an amazing thing and no there's no judgment here in the napping area you can take whatever you get these days l I hear you you know what when my daughter's home I can nap schedule what's that when my daughter's home I can nap but you're a Napper I would love to be an F er um well I can lay down if she's home but if she's not here I don't know I don't

better so I'm stressed about the little just finding the right person I'm sure she'll come along but at this point that's just what's on my plate it's been through your whole life you're a vampire or in you're a vampire when you're so funny I don't know I think that we all I don't know I just I've never been a sleeper never never never never ever my sister Charlie stop there's nobody here you're gonna take a nap right now but you came on oh no you're gonna take a nap and I disturb your nap I'm sorry oh I can't I don't know I admire people you know what my dad was this kind of Napper dude you guys ever have people in your life like this my dad was a kind of Napper like he could sleep anywhere my hotties like that he can sleep anywhere for like 10 minutes and feel refreshed I'm like that doesn't happen to me I'm like that's not real I'm why how does that work with him you guys I don't know how it works but he just does he can sleep like anywhere he can sleep anywhere he catches a catnap like so he works at a restaurant so Brooks at a restaurant a really nice restaurant most evenings not every evening but a lot of evenings and he works at like a breakfast place in the morning he decided in anyway he decided that I told you guys I've been trying to lay dry house well he decided that he wanted to get an extra job hi Linda how are you he decided he wanted to get an extra job so he got this job at like it's a it's a great place it's like a breakfast place here and you know anyway it's not near our house and he has to be at work at 7:00 and he finishes at one right so he doesn't start it so he tries to get all this work just because none of it is on our side of the island so he tries to get all of his work shifts on on the same on the same day yeah like so he'll work a double shift like for work a morning shift in might shift then his other job doesn't start until 4:00 so he this is what he tells me does I mean I don't know I don't not there but he gets off work around 1:30 and then he goes and swims you know swims in the ocean snorkels or whatever and then he eats whatever I've made it for lunch or he gets himself something to eat and then he takes a catnap and you guys he freaking take a cat nap in the car cuz I proximal on the shade and they just take a cat nap part of me is a little jealous part of me is like seriously seriously you're taking a cat nap nah I can't take it to get your nine-year-old wants to learn has a nap like it's dad I can't nap like that how many of you can take cat naps I find sometimes I'm more tired after that do you guys

stream when you want to stream so who are you who are your go-to youtube channels oh wow this one this magazine this Restoration Hardware look I don't know if I can pick it up and manage to fit another darker color but like look it's on the jelly plate the image of the flowers I wasn't trying to do that do that but this is such a big jelly plate you can't really see it I guess I don't know you're still here you're seeing [Music] you're having oxtail I like oxtail soup you're feeling better oh we love you Lizzie you totally love you I'm glad you're feeling better let me see if I can get this to come off on another piece of paper but I need a darker color so let me figure out I don't have anything except brown I'm black I guess I could do it black let me try it with glue um I have to decide what I'm gonna make I guess I should make stuff that I'm in it can have tomorrow but I do have to do which I had you guys how many of you shop at Costco I mean I shop at Costco all the time because not that I love Costco so much I don't like the lights in Costco and I don't like the busyness of Costco when I shop in Costco because quite frankly sometimes it's the freshest and you know and I buy other things like I don't know I have a list of stuff that I have to buy right I have to buy hot sauce and I have to buy eggs and you can buy like five dozen eggs there and I have to buy whole list ridiculous list somewhere around here of all things I hate going I hate going how many of you are like that you've got an all-day well you don't have an all-day we have the whole paycheck and we have Safeway and we have we don't have any store like an all-day I wish we would get a Trader Joe's that's what I would do to get to I don't know if I would get you got a target though target came in definitely made the prices of our groceries go down we're just great you hate shopping for anything I just don't know I have to go you know it's like usually I make my ha to go cuz if he goes then if he goes then I know he's only gonna get what's on the list whereas I go whereas if I go what happens I find other stuff your honey that's to shop and cook well mine he doesn't love it but he'll do it but he's not gonna be home - and we need it whole paycheck right it's so expensive it's earth very good good a PG says she goes to Walmart for diabetic stuff and dog food well I have to get bunny food we need bunny food food was like my hotties number one he was like L says her big handsome does all the shopping and cooking around here mine was a shopping he cannot do the cooking guys he it's just I love him I can't cook well you can kind of see it but not really I don't know I guess I'll have dark enough paint you used to have all you have as a Kroger in a Walmart in public we have a we don't have a Publix but we have Safeway food land and gonna sack and save that's not particularly a good one we have um what else do we have Costco Walmart Target but depending upon what side of the island you're on so if you're in the central you have it all but if you're on the west side for my new job is all you have a Safeway and food land we also have a times market and then if you are on the other side of the island they don't have they only have I think they only have a Safeway and at times market so the best place to come the central part of the island to do the shoppings because it's less expensive here there is a huge price difference for our stores there are it's ridiculous public seems nice I've been to it but Jeff does Chiapas you have to really track the expiration date I don't know I just try not to you guys if I can if I can get out of going to the grocery store oh my god I'd do it every time you guys it's like people are on vacation here right they come but they come with the energy wherever they'll it came from my life bump into their like aggressive to bump into you the carts and you're just like wow I'm not a grocery shopper you know that's my house good at taking things back take it back he has no qualms about it he will take it back I don't know what I hate he'd bought me and I was like I don't like this thing cuz that's okay I'll just take it right back yeah what could I say faster so funny he's faster he's faster at shopping faster wanting to go shopping oh he's totally a taker Becker okay I'm not I'm like that whatever he's like oh no so that my pet peeve is is we buy bagels for our little one she loves bagels and so you buy them at Costco you have to get in - no no it's - sleeves of six bagels each right I like six seven bucks right but you have to get to three by one it's still the same price now my pet peeve is that suddenly you'll have them for like two days they won't even you will just got home from Costco and maybe you'll have one and then the next day you look up and it'll be molded and and it just makes me mad you know and so you know I try to when we get home get a palm slice and that and try to get them slice them up and then slice it up and put them in the freezer but sometimes like you know it's like you think you would have a day you know but sometimes you don't okay so it just makes me mad you know it's just like the whole principle of everything it just kind of makes me mad and yeah I'm expressing that to him I'm like no this is ripoff or whatever so when we used to live on the other side of the island was just like 45 minutes from where we live now he would it's the humidity he committee actually trunk free so how I do freeze him but you would think that you would get home you'd have him for a whole day right before you had a freezer so he doesn't think anything of it he'll just take him right back he'll just go back and take him back he does not have one issue about it and his takes him back and they give him all this money back and sometimes when we used to live on the other side the island we weren't driving over here he'd let him sit there for a week and then he just take him back because we weren't gonna drive over here for six bucks he'd just take him back and he would you know get his money back he doesn't for everything that I like say I don't like he's like well if you don't like it he goes they have a return policy because I'll take it back so I'm like okay you know so I let him so what did he buy me and I didn't like it oh the other day he bought bacon we bought bacon right and then they sell it in four and packs of four like at Costco and it comes like sealed like they're individually four packages sealed but then they seal it wrap it in some other plastic as well well I usually take it all apart and put half in the freezer but I didn't you guys I didn't put it anywhere I just like left it I was gonna deal with it and I opened one package and cooked it and it was still wrapped in that other you know the other three packages were still wrapped and in the plastic you know a wrapped individually and then wrapped around and that however they seal it so that you buy four at a time well the first pack was just fine the second pair could just find the third package no we're talking a matter of days weeks like took me and probably two or three days later I took everything out and redid the fridge and I was gonna put two packages in the freezer well one of the packages was black like rotted and it pissed me off so bad because it was hiding behind all the other ones and I was like seriously that's it oh whatever and I'm left in the fridge and the next day or two days later he went they took it back well the lady wanted to give him a hard time and he said look he said you can see we were just here he goes you can see because they can tell by like where you are what you bought right he said you're the one that Packard did or who however and it was hidden in the back it was hidden like in the third packages of four packages a bacon and the lady was pissed off because she had to give him the his whole money back for everything so on but it's bacon fifteen dollars or something I don't know so she had to give him all the money back and she was mad and I said why was she mad it's not her store it's not her personal store like we didn't go home and in two days make a make a sealed package of bacon term black know I was just like but it just like he was he was irritated he was like you know she goes she gave she didn't wanna give me the money back so he said I just stood there and he said please call the manager and then she quits arguing with him and she says please call the manager and he says and what is your name he's like Shelly I know how these things work he's like it's not up to her to decide whether we get our money back it's a store policy she's just a worker at the store and he said and honestly he said to her would you feed this to your family would you rock this back and yeah she was not my student anyway he was like I mean that happens all the time here and it you're probably right it is a heat and humidity good he's good about taking stuff back whereas I'm just kind of like yeah whatever you know it's not that I I'm just like laying out whether it's worth my time to go down there and argue with them I think he had to talk to the manager and I think he complained about her too he said you know I've been a cop's cross-code customer for a long time he goes he goes look on the screen you can see my wife by I actually bliss illinit shop at that time he goes my wife bought this like two days ago because you can tell by on our feet they they know everything you buy you don't even need a receipt there they know everything you buy you've taken a nap oh good I'm glad so who else is doing their summer projects I'm gonna do my I've got some atcs to work on I have my my journals to finish I've got

air-conditioned or a body of water all the time I do we were all the time you guys I have to woo myself crazy you guys I have to I do it every day multiple times a day depending upon hello I'm doing by Malia we love you girl you guys go over to lovely Malia go to three dots to the right and check out her channel subscribe and hang out with her Lily and veer ma Brian you can take your kids outside and hose them down oh you're so funny we love you Amelia so while I'm doing my last pull you know so lately what I've been working on it you guys can work on anything it's not like you know your energy is like it's like modeling clay except you can model it with your intention you know so my intention every day is to raise my vibration to the highest level that I can easily and effortlessly accommodate at this moment okay because for me you know I like I don't especially if I'm like spilling down in the dumpster I'm having a little bit of a rough time or you know lately I've just been kind of going through my own stress of this may excite I'm excited about my new job but I'm also a little stressed about it because like I you know like finding the right employee whatever nonsense I cause for myself and it's just nonsense of icons for myself so um what I invite you to do is I invite you to bring to mind whatever it is that you really want to release and let go so for me it's been a lot around hidden fear and anger like mostly at myself you know this is really like anger isn't I'm so angry at you but that hidden fear fear can turn into for me not saying for you I'm saying for me fear can turn into stuff that makes you feel hopeless or helpless right it also can snuff out your potential and then if you're like me and you're really self-critical then that's a critic it can turn into frustration and anger and it's self directed right because for whatever reason so I've been working on that myself I'm working on you know being more aware of my inner critic not listening all the time to my inner critic letting it go like letting whatever comes up come up and then just letting it go like flying into it so if I'm feeling particularly anxious which can happen I'm feeling particularly anxious or I'm feeling like if I'm if something that's happening it makes me feel fearful or nervous about something I really try to go inside and ask myself what is it and can I release it do I need to hold on to it or release it and I'm finding from me that I'm only limited by my but what I see myself doing and what my imagination is but I'm also not unlimited I can also release this fear and I don't need to pick it back up I don't need to know the origin of it like I don't need to know that if something happened to me when I was three and that's why or whatever all I need to know is that I can make a choice to release it or hold on to it so yeah I will all the time especially if I'm like freaking out yeah inner critic I have the biggest inner critic hi Marabella mom thanks yeah the job did come to me I wasn't looking for that for that anyway so I'm sharing the reason I'm sharing this with you is because I know sometimes some of you go am I the only one experiencing this or am I alone on this journey or this is really overwhelming and I don't know if I can deal with it or whatever it is that you may be feeling that's related to fear of becoming fear the fear of potential fear of your potential right fear of your potential fear of your like fear of living your best life whatever it is because we're all absolutely completely perfect we just let our thoughts take a take over sometimes and we sometimes think we're our thoughts but we're not we are not our thoughts right our soul is a vast limitless being like sometimes you compare yourself to others you go okay so why does you know why does this person create without fear like can manifest without fear that whatever it is like I don't know a car or a house or something their optimal health right and why can't hike you can the only thing that keeps us from doing it as our thoughts it's thinking and believing we can't I'm June to read those books by oh my gosh all those people are thinking Grow Rich although all the all the free thought movement that was around like a long time ago yeah we do forget that the critic isn't isn't you right I forget it's not me you know like you know like I don't know so so like you know I know that I've done amazing things in the business in my business world I mean I have a track record of it but yet here I'm standing on the precipice of like a whole new venture this inner critic is like totally there right like saying well good luck with that you're never gonna you know what I mean whatever good luck with that all right no maybe you won't find the right employees or maybe you will have to work 91 hours a week why did you get yourself into this I mean you know it's like it Bruns mess up Napoleon Hill right Napoleon Hill and Joseph Campbell and a lot of a lot of people in that I think it was called the new thought movement so I'm fight you to bring those things in to this energy work and allow whatever it is step keeping you from your living your dream life leaving your highest potential living war whatever it is you think and see that you want you know realizing that the only person that you can truly affect as yourself and by raising your vibration you raise everyone's Oh big give your give give pause man our love barb love you girl we love him enjoy your coffee so bring to mind anything so for me I'm bringing to mind the anxiousness I have surrounding this job I'm bringing to mind my long commute everyday I'm bringing to mind well I find about the questioning I have in my mind well I find the right person to work or people to work with me I'm bringing to mind how am I gonna pull it off like these are the thoughts in my head what's going on in my head that sort of thing but you can also bring to mind maybe yours isn't anything like that maybe your says I have a lot to make some pains in my body and I'm bringing that to Mike I wanna clear whatever it is in me that holds on to that energy right maybe have like somebody you're really concerned about neighbor friend animal you can bring them to mind to you don't it it's not just it's not just dependent on on you on you where you can bring anyone or anything to mine goodnight Mary Lou I hope you have a wonderful night with dinner I hope your dinner is that great so this meditation lasts about 10 minutes and I need to do to participate its breathe

this moment the option to clear any and all fear any and all thought forms and the easiest gentlest way that are holding you back from being your perfect limitless divine self if you have your body personality permission to receive whatever energy it needs to raise your vibration to the next level to receive clarity balance peace and freedom okay let's get started so I need to do to participate

it is it's you filled up with you so you've called though you've called yourself back in yeah you're welcome Mirabelle you've called yourself back and you've allowed yourself to return to you you're giving yourself permission to be who you are so that's why I like so many of us are that's why I do it all day long because you know what I know I'm not my thoughts I know I'm not my mind and I know I'm not all that then I get caught up in it like I get myself all anxious like I'm gonna find the right person and I know whatever kind of silly stuff that I do to myself right we all do it I mean you know it's just sort of like how it rolls and then suddenly you're like when you're not in that space you're like oh my gosh and me now and I don't have to end everything's actually in divine order and I don't have to worry about anything and you know so like it's one of those things that's all it is you know I wasn't sure if this job is the right one for me but you know I have to take it as it is because it did come without me looking and if it's not I'll know soon enough right so I'm excited to see what what comes of it but I'm also excited to see how I can just utilize my own you know we're not giving my energy away your migraines got oh that's so good you would like to take the job you know the really sad thing Angela isn't it doesn't it doesn't even pay enough to pay for the cost of living here it's ridiculous you guys living here it's like so expensive and we've tried to move trust me we've tried to leave we've done our hole we've done all kinds of stuff and we just keep getting sucked back in so I just have to trust that it's the right thing you know I hope so at least I didn't roll all my clothes away cuz you know I was doing my calamari and I did you guys I did let go of a lot of my clothes I gave I think I only kept like one pair of pants maybe two I'm hoping I kept two I found one I washed them I found a couple of jackets I'm lucky that the pants are just black so like everybody will just think that I'm wearing the same you know when I used to work this kind of job I always wore black not because I'm like oh and love black but because when you sell all right you don't wanna compete with the art you know so I wear black I'm not selling other people wear black but that's what works for me so well thanks you guys if you lived here you know what Angela I'm

we're going to play with folk arts painted finishes and i'm going to use rust light rust and dark rust and what this is you can use it on non-porous stuff so it adds like a rustic kind of you know something something to your stuff it can be used indoor or outdoor and it's non-toxic and it can be used like I said on so many different things wood metal play aesthetic you know um I have a lot of things coming up for us mixed media artists to use this I'm very very excited so I thought since you all know i love the creepy dolls and i love creepy stuff i would grab some of my dolls i got from the thirst or and playground for a few so let's get started now first I want to show you this is a wooden leg from the hardware store home depot lowes wherever you go you can see at rosen on the bottom if you make a table or whatever and i kept the tag on here just to tell you the name because i know a lot of times you guys want to know the exact names it is a six-inch traditional table leg and i got this at had to be loes and it's number 2 406 i don't know what that means anything but that is what it is so I'm gonna fill that away now alright so i have this and i have a doll i got from the thrift store which I don't know if I want to destroy her head yet i might i don't know but i love the blue eye shadow and the and the lips I don't know she has one arm um you know so and she's hollow so I can use her like this so I'm debating i'm debating i'm debating you guys know I have to talk through everything to get it straight in my mind and this other thing I saved the a packaging for you guys I got this at the craft store had to be a see more or Michaels and it is a air freshener doll I don't have any idea what that means but it's from fiber craft and it gives you directions here's that here's what this looks like right i just want to show you last just in case you guys want to get it it had to be a couple bucks that's probably all i would have spent on it it has crochet instructions so you can crochet a dress for her I guess instead are on like toilet paper roll or um I swear back of the day my grandmother had one of these in the bathroom like all crocheted up and sitting on toilet paper or something maybe a air freshener one of those cone air fresheners maybe that's what it is because that's what it looks like and then it comes with directions to make the doll where you can crochet and it gives all the crochet info and weight of the yarn and all that good stuff in Spanish and and uh uh what do you call it Spanish and American and um that kind of thing so just so you know but I'm found on a Y and this is it so she has hair I don't like hair so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna leave her body because I think I'm either gonna get Dave to cut this nobby nobbs off or because she won't really fin on that like I want her to you see what I'm saying I mean I could maybe slice it and glue her on if I wanted to but she fits real good on this side but I cannot sit it stable as you can see so that's that but I think the hair whoa you guys get so upset when I do these things I'm gonna color here off and I want to do everything on camera so you guys can see so if you want a less less instructions of me talking and showing you can go to my website knitting and things calm I'll put the link down below and I will have a basic written instructions on what I did with some pictures but you can also for all my peeps out there like me who need video sometimes I'm going to do a video all right I'm just cutting to the best I can because this is like that crazy hair gosh it's not gonna cut my dog's hair here um you can see it's like only glue it in on certain parts it's like mr. Magoo or something oh just cutting just cut and cut and cutting you know I cut I love destroying baby dolls and then making them into other things so I thought why not today why not play all right well that's it I'm not gonna I'll probably use modeling paste or something to put the rest of that down no big deal ok that's it for now just so we can get started on the fun stuff because I'm all about the fun stuff I don't mind cutting hair off but I swear I'll be itchy old days anybody else like that you're just gonna be itchy you just accept it even though it's not even real hair it's plastic I'll vacuum later he's not gonna worry okay so now we have this now we have her and I have my scissors away for now I have one of these brushes that you use to do your hair with you know to bleach and color your hair not that I color my hair you know what I'm saying I just found that one anyway you didn't get to use at a dollar store sometimes you can get them you know if your color in your hair or you're not going to use again that works or you can use a sponge brush which you can get just so inexpensively at the craft store even the dollar store at times and you know our normal our normal brushes okay alright so I'm going to start with this and I'm going to use the rust and I'm going to go dark first I'm going to try it I'm going to shake it up because it says to shake it up we're shaking and then chicken it up get all that goodness on the bottom and I'm just gonna honestly I'm coat in both of them you don't exactly know where I'm going to go with these I've not um not thought about it I just kind of want to go with it now when you open it you can see it has a seal on it and you can find these at your local craft store you can find them on plaid online.com I will put the links down below and um have a pair of sensors to open up oh the nails it's why didn't color them I didn't paint them last night i knew that i'm going to be dipping in paint but i love when things are sealed because I tell you truth can't tell you how many things that are not sealed did I bring home that are not good and that's never good okay so I'm gonna have to pour it in something so I'm gonna grab this plate it's just a plates I had glitter in or something I'm gonna lie it here for now and I shook it up and I'm just gonna pull oh it's like sick mmm yummy yummy all right so no don't eat it's just the until I'm gonna take this sponge brush first and we're gonna see which one works better let's go over her first let's just destroy her oh yeah this is going to be sitting outside now the hair I'm not real sure about what I'm going to do with but i'm just going all in because i don't know if this is going to cover the rest of that hair or not and if not like i said i can go in with some modeling paste or clay not too worried about it all I'm going to do is continue to to cover this with the painted finish in the dark rust and I'm going to do the wood and then I will be back okay so you can see I have the first coat on and again this was the dark rust and the painted finishes and um you can see you can see the things are there now I'm not worried about those little things that in the flesh color that's showing because I'm going to go on with the red the what's it called light rust so I'm not too worried about that at the momentum and this remember this is the hard plastic the doll and this is the wood oh I love it and again for is any light spots I don't care look at that I might like really on this because you really I just love it now let me tell you a few things before we get continue on you can see I have a mess going on here and i'm using my plastic what's called nonstick mat so i highly recommend if you're going to use this to make sure that you use newspaper you know your mat you have old clothes on because it can be you can see it's a it's a little messy and it dries like concrete it dries hard um and is it a horrible thing no but you just want to be prepared also I was using my sponge brush for these and that did not work at all when I started using my paintbrush it worked so much better so definitely use paintbrushes now I know that plaid also sells paint brushes that go with this um to you know put stuff on and and that kind of stuff so I would recommend you know getting them or like I said use using old paint brush it works so much better the sponge just wasn't the sponge is what it was doing was it was sucking up the liquid and you can kind of see on my plate it sucked up the liquid that is in here to spread and then it only had goop goobie goo blows um and I went both I want liquid and goopy goopy so I stopped using that used my brush and it was fantastic so very very happy so now what I'm going to do who is I'm gonna shake up the light rust know you can hear me shaking it and rolling it around and I'm taking the lid off and I'm going for it all right now I yep that is closed as well this goes on the cap now that does anything but I don't oh look at that mama mia mama Mia all right I'm gonna take off of their first cuz you know I am cheap cheap cheap cheap gonna be back one here there we go I'm cheap I'm cheapen I'm not ashamed all right so you can see right here I'm gonna take it off y'all put some on there and let's Wow to do this first and I'm just gonna go and I'm likely look home doing I'm holding it back far and I'm just letting it do its thing grab on Oh sucks Laden and I'm gonna tone it I'm not going crazy now look there are a million different ways you can do this there's also a million different colors i might do some green on here too i don't know but you see what I'm doing I'm just running it down grabbing those bumps right oh gosh this this this this that's all I'm gonna say and then you can go the other way I think you grab more texture going the other way but I like doing both ways cuz that's how I roll oh my gosh look at it I'm going to pay my pawns no no don't pee your pants just paint just paint all right I'm getting some more let's work on this baby doll for a second just to see what we can get here it's some other wrong just very lightly oh yeah and I'm just running it over running it over right let's do this oh girl run it the other way grab up her nose look at that oh my goodness okay oh the excitement is just be like I can't even I can't even look oh my god oh my gosh so now I'm gonna do the back I'm gonna show you this and I'm gonna continue on and finish it and then I will be back to show you what this looks like when it's done and what we're going to do next also excited okay so as your concern we have this all leg doesn't look anything like I did before and that red on it oh I love it I just I just love it I just love it and then we have our baby doll look how cool look at that texture oh so cool okay so what I decided to do because I just can never leave anything alone I'm gonna move back just for a second old ones and good take either trying to decide either dark moss or a light moss and i think i might do both let me go try both I'm gonna shake this one up um and just run a little bit over it and then a little light let's see what we get again very well sealed only take me three hours to get into it who knew childproofing things would be such a struggle for me all right so I'm going to pour just the littlest bit I don't want to waste it and I tell you you get a lot in here for um you know being a bottle so I'm glad with that because you really got ya you really get good projects projects all right so one more I'm going to do the light green moss okay and let's pour a little bit of that in that one's thick come on bad boy all right all over my finger because why not why not let me just rub uh I probably don't recommend this bomb I'm just just gonna rub it cuz i have it on my finger I don't want to waste it you know I'm thrifty I don't like wasting stuff I'm just kind of rubbing it on you see like it's just gonna give some other look to it like a little moss is growing on if you saw my roof because we have a lot of trees as a lot of moss I'm just kind of rubbing it all around oh I just I i love mess i can't even stand how much i love this and there's no right or wrong see that's the great thing because it's why ever you want right okay let's get some of the darker green i'm still using my finger probably shouldn't even though it is you know it's not harmful I just kind of want to rub it I should use the brush because I know a lot of you will not like using your finger and um I don't want you to think that you have to let me get my brush I'm drawing it I don't want my brush wet you know i rinsed it off in the water but I want it and you see how well it comes out I've been using the brush and it comes right off with water so it's fantastique so I'm going to go in and kind of before I put any more in there I'm just going to brush this and pull down any extra ok I'm doing Hansel that's all right cuz we'll put some darker on there so she's just gonna look like a little mossy if you will I'm just kind of hit everywhere because you can go back and and I might go back and add a little more dark on it to flatten it out who knows with me but okay I really like that all right so then let's take a little bit of this darker green here on both ends i'm just gonna Pat it off a little bit and then I'm just gonna kind of make it look like there's a pattern here right not really a pattern but like moss has taken over look the more grungy for me you know i'm a grungy grungy girl stuff that i can do with this is so make sure you keep an eye out for another a quick video of how I'm what else I'm going to do because you know I don't care what product it is when I get a new product I like to find every single possible way to use it in all of my art I hate getting items that you can really only use in one way now mind you I know there are some out there that are like that and that's okay and I bought a few but I like to get bang for my buck I like you guys to get bang for your buck so you know here we got a thrift you can get this at the dollar store you know I mean you can get a Barbie to dollar store and do this and this is a piece of wood um so you know this is very very easy but I'm also not going to leave my mixed media gals down either um so you know make sure keep an eye out for a video from moi all right now I'm just kind of more like where the sun's not gonna hit like well it's sitting but I'm gonna put this out my front garden so excited but I'm just patting now here's a thing let me see make sure I'm getting everywhere just patent look pen pen sorry I think like I said I'm gonna go over it with a little dark just to it I don't know we'll see yeah that's the fun of creating things is that you first of all you can do it whatever way you want ain't nobody gonna tell you no different and um and it's just to have fun it's just I'm fine but remember we're not going to forgive this bad boy down here nobody's really gonna see it but for up here oh my my my role okay and if you sit like that when you do it although matta alright so now this is the lighter color of the moss ami right so I'm gonna put some of that I'm on their turn my brush I like to turn my boss you know both ways because well whatever okay so and now I'm just going to kind of like very lightly touch some of that right on the baby on the doll just run it through oh I love this chunkiness I was gonna give it a mohawk but then I changed my mind I thought how much creepier could that be all right so I'm just kind of rubbing it very lightly oh gosh the law just I'm so happy okay so i think you get my drift tail all right i'm gonna let that dry no you know what I'm not gonna let that jar I'm gonna clean my brush put the lid cuz you know we've got to put the lid on everything I always do and i forgot on that one but I'm gonna take more of the dark rust I'm gonna shake it like this so I'm gonna shaking it like that shakin shakin shakin sugar sugar sugar shakers okay oh the projects in my head I'm just gonna pour a little bit i don't want too much and yes I wipe this and I scrape it in because I don't like wasting I know it's an awful disease I have okay now I'm gonna take my paintbrush again you know what I'm gonna try this time I'm gonna try my um this is one stroke these are from donna dewberry and it's a brush uh-uh so what it's called what is a scruffy brush because like this you know I'm talking about like stencil brush holders so I'm going to take some of this we move over just a tad all right and I'm gonna gonna kind of go in scoop up some of that delicious loss pound some of it off and I'm just going in lightly cuz I just want it like flecked does not make sense let me hold it maybe I could flick in the air okay why I find myself so funny is beyond me but I do okay look I'm just kind of pouncing it a bit because I still want that green coming through but I want to push back so think about it like when we're doing our art journal pages or mixed media we like you know you like all the nice colors but when you put you know when you do this kind of thing in mixed media it pounces it all back right so nothing's like sitting up at the front if that makes sense your eye looks at it and everything it's just so interesting and intricate and all we're doing is making some of us go to the mach go to the back of the class there we go just so the green isn't as bright I'm just pounded pound some pounding whatever word turn to a little bit more here because I want it to be rusty and gross and like look like it's peeling and what the heck is she have hanging out you know what does she have out there now if you can see I kinda I'm gonna cut it right knock those back to I put bread in the eyes because you know I'm creepy I like creepy things excuse me um I got a kick out of myself with the green eyes and then I choked of course trying to talk and laugh at the same time because I can't even walk down the steps without falling okay we're choking for that matter and you see how I'm doing it nothing nothing too crazy but see how that like pushed it back some and it just looks like something you would have found in a like that was metal that you found in a junkyard right and I'm just doing this up here now you want to add more red go ahead it's i rhymed a rapper who knew it I'm just pounding it I'm not not worrying too much so look at it and turn it around and see I think that is fantastic okay so now I'm gonna let her draw I'm leggett on this bad boy I really am digging this way it is don't necessarily want it too much darker but i'm going to take let's rest left here and i'm just going in like that just pushing some of it a little harder here because it's wood and it ain't hurtin ain't nobody got hurt it and nobody got a harder just get it everywhere now i'm gonna let this dry I'm very happy with these the way they are and and you can remember once we like put everything together you can definitely go back in and add more if you want it doesn't have to be a patina Inge and aging and rusting all at the same time if this is a little brighter but I don't know I mean I'm kind of I'm kind of digging on that I know it's hard for you to see I don't really need it but I in look at that I am digging on that it just looks like it's a million different colors I might want to do a little darker just let me just do my brush in there might be better just pushing it back some a little more that's not so you look weak and when you look at things differently like I'm looking at it I hold it up and I'm like oh okay it might could you you know could use maybe a little bit more not much you can brush it you don't have to i just don't want to brush it too much because i want that texture I want that text you all right I think I'm good with this though I love that red it just looks like it's been painted a million times okay I'm gonna put that in there I'm going to let this dry and um when I come back we'll put it together and so excited okay I'll be back in a few hey guys so let me tell you what I did I'm gonna show you my finished pace and it's gonna stand on its stand look I'd say oh I love how grungy and Omar Bono's look that's a plastic baby doll and then that's the wood oh my gosh it's fantastic it is fantastic now what I did was um all I did was I took Oh Michelle Yeoh some glossy Mod Podge I put on the thunk ow and I covered everything with it I am so in love with those I'm so in love with us so look I used like three or four different colors you don't have to you can use two colors they came they come in pairs were light and dark um as you see like the moss there's like a lighter color green and a dark and then there's rust which is like a reddish and then a darker and um and then I just threw some of the folk art metallic gold paint on an i love it this was a plastic baby at all come on now now all of you who have been following me for a long time know that i love this now my last thing I might do I don't know though um I don't know I might just put this out in my in my front yard I just love it I was thinking about taking nails and putting them in the head going across like nail heads coming out and rust in those as well if I do I'll take a picture and down the road and show you what it looks like I'm not going to do that right now but I'm thinking about it but I just love this love it and it was like two books to make with the you know as far as the wood and the a few books you know for the wood and the plastic doll and um I'm just so on the line it so excited so and it's you know it's gonna sit outside look at how cool I am I in my

urban culture here's the bag that it came in and I got a little pin to go with it as you can see it's a urban culture pin and it's pretty swanky dankey pretty hanky panky cool so anyways what I'm going to do apparently this is like really high in THC content this is probably the highest THC content cannabis that I've ever indulged in so I'm going to read you the the ingredients here the terpene content THC a is 26.3% so that's like really extremely high CBD is zero beta-carotene is 0.09 and that's good for pain relief anti-inflammatories stress relief and anti-cancer and brain function alpha pionen is 0.52% that's good for anti cancer it's good for anti inflammatory it's good for improved respiration and it's good for brain function beta my racine which is good for brain function is 0.76 percent or petaline which is good for sedative and anti-cancer properties is 0.03 percent beta pine which is good for stress relief anti-inflammatory anti-diabetic anti cancer is good at 0.13% delta limonene which is good for pain relief reduced appetite antic anti-diabetic anti-cancer stress relief anti-inflammatory now is your relief is 0.19 and lean Ahlul which is good for sedative anti-inflammatory anti-stress anti cancer and brain function that 0.08 awesome assuming is 0.20% human which is appetite suppressant is 0.05% so that's the content list of this and we're going to go ahead today for the Maryland connoisseur cannabis users we're going to go ahead and use the andg ball class art instillation and so we'll go ahead and just put this nug in there we're gonna go ahead and take this and just swishy dishy put it in a little Bowl piece and now we'll try it out this got like a real diesel taste to it like a real like Sour Diesel he tastes like like kind of diesel and sour and skunky is how I would describe this flavor it's good it's very very flavorful actually I really like that kind of like diesel e skunky sort of flavor that you get from some of these Terps and your arm like already kind of stoned from it because of the THC content being so I would I recommend this yeah sure it's a sativa dominant strain a sativa dominant hybrid but it's pretty good and I'm gonna do just a little bit more and then so here's the nug as you can see it's pretty good the picture quality images that I took earlier in the video are probably better quality but um for that but that's what that is that's good so that was the coffee oh gee and I did coffee little bit and I'm feeling pretty good it's a good body huh it's a good head I - really feeling really alert and on top of my on top of my game and she's gonna drink some coffee yeah it's a really like uplifting kind of you forward feeling with this strain so I like it for that it's good yeah peace out you okay after about 10 minutes of sitting with the capo G I determined that it's a good strain I'm not experiencing any adverse effects side effects the grower was pretty good I think it was like grow west MD yeah girl West MD and so it's good it's a clean kind of hi I'm just probably gonna make some food in a minute and enjoy my breakfast and slash lunch brunch thing and I don't know maybe listen to some music or something and then call some people about a job interview so that's pretty much what I got planned for today nothing bad to say about the flower thanks to the distributor and thanks to the dispensary so peace you", "rWZ9VOCEdFc": "say is before we even get started once again into the case I just want y'all to let me get through the facts that's all I said but just let me just get through the face but it's it's gonna be I have a tasty morsel for y'all tonight so i'ma go ahead and get started so let's get into this criminal law and procedure because this is something that could be of interest to business owners and I do want to advise you at the supper to if you want to participate in that you may have one question and so the online activity that you're going to do next week is going to be on the same in the same place I think it's like 35 question is a questionnaire and so this is where you're gonna go in to do that alright so I'm not to talk about okay and so your book talks about this modern Penal Code now let's just be clear about this is not like I know it sounds kind of very you know but it's not a law okay this is like a model adopted by the American alliance - and most states modeled their criminal laws based on the model Penal Code so some of the statues for burglary these types of things larceny you know these types of things are modeled each state off of the model Penal Code but it might not be exactly so this itself is not the model Penal Code it's not a law so speaking let's only talk about criminal law versus Criminal Procedure okay in criminal law consists of a body of law that for the purpose of preventing harm to society declares what conduct is criminal and prescribes the punishment to the impose this is the substantive criminal law this is where the actual crime the law that talks about a crime of burglary larceny whatever they assault battery the criminal law of that is going to come from the what we call this substance of criminal law and then now when the time comes for the DA or the prosecutor to bring that criminal law case against the defendant then that person is going to have to follow procedure that is prescribed by the court the defendants attorney and the prosecutor which brings cases on behalf of the state let's say for example the state of California versus John Doe okay when the prosecutor or the district attorney gets ready to do that he or she has to follow certain criminal procedures in the exercise of bringing back the law by following certain criminal procedures regarding the criminal investigation the arrest the trial the singing saying all of these things happen to follow a proper procedure okay you can't just go over there without a warrant and going to the punch house and get evidence because then that is not following procedure this 3/8 way to distinguish a criminal law versus the civil law civil laws we talked about earlier like negligence those types of things civil laws have signed a compensating party money damages so to speak like if somebody steals something from you you can take them to court get a judgment for money okay on the other hand if you press charges against that person for stealing something against you then if the prosecutor the DA decides there is enough evidence then he or she may bring a criminal case against that person for that at which time that person will be adjudicated for that crime and they may receive some type of punishment jail time probation they may have to pay a fine but this is the difference between these types and most I mean most criminal laws don't come from a criminal statute that is based upon the model Penal Code may not be exactly but that's what those statutes are anything and then you have to have a burden of proof that is different in a criminal case that is in the civil case in some case like in that Martha Stewart case one of her problems was that they that the prosecutor was trying to prosecute her based on a preponderance of the evidence standard and it just said none of their known this is a criminal case and so you're gonna have to you can't just the proof that you have does not meet the standard and so that is why the particular count like county 9 was overturned because the standard of proof that was used was to not be on the reasoning or reasonable that a juror based on that evidence that was providing could have could have made another determination it was not home beer on a reasonable doubt which is what you must have in a criminal case because a person you don't Jim can go to prison and then from a legal perspective a crime has two parts okay our book tells us that it has a physical part whereby the defendant committed an act or an omission which is called in the Latin or what we call in the criminal vernacular the actors greatest and then the mental part focuses on defendants subjective state of mind what we call the men read so and then we distinguish more practice [Music] requirements action factor sets out the elements which translates into the guilty man or person a general requirement that community they represented degree degree of culpability with regards also called the edge with we talked about this before some people wanted to take the heavy feet Lady and Senator jail but she did not have the intent the intentional mid-rare to cost of their child's accident if some here are some stuff defenses that a person could assert if the prosecutor is acting in self-defense that could overcome those elements that are required for the actual crazy I'm just and then I guess sometimes some people can say I did it under arrest or intoxication and then our books tells us that some of these crimes are classified as several different kinds of ways we're going to have our felonies and then we're going to have our misdemeanors yet though these are really serious crimes and they can't carry a conservation for a year or more whereby you're misdemeanors are crimes that carry up to a year of incarceration sometimes these are going to be given collation or something like that or fine and here are some examples of some cries Bechet books talks about fraud Ponzi schemes conspiracy racketeering we talked about insider trading problem bribery obstruction of justice the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act these are just some examples of some times gives me mostly misdemeanors especially everything especially if it's like the person whose first time the prosecutor is probably not going to even if that crime has a penalty of incarceration rarely do they go for that there's usually like probation there usually look for probation [Music] well yeah get a good lawyer because because see you don't understand the prosecutors them come in harder strong they don't come in for the highest thing they come come in for and then what we end up doing at the end of the day is we negotiate and meet somewhere else down at a lower level climate so that's what attorneys are doing you know they want to bring you in or some type of let's say felony assault and battery or something like that oh it's so good I could go in and maybe somehow get that down to some type of you know I forget what you call it but it's like this this public disturbance disturbing the peace or something like that bring it down to something that's going to be a misdemeanor you know that's what we do we you know I go in I say okay you know and you really want to bring this in for trial you know most criminal cases are tried in front of a jury so you want to you know go through the whole process of bringing in a jury and all is this person first time being in trouble you think the Germans you know but you know come in with all kinds of you know I've had situations in the past I have tried some criminal cases in the past of one in particular not necessarily did it reach a trial but we were able to negotiate I had a client he's driving a vehicle he's driving a vehicle they find a gun in the vehicle and some other items they were not on him okay and so you know I go we go to a whole lot of different kinds of you know discovery process so I say to the DA okay let me have my expert to examine the gun examine these items see if my clients fingerprint is on it then oh all of a sudden I've never been able to find that it's always the case that when I'm gonna take the gun for analysis there's no fingerprints whatsoever because they like it are clean so that's what they do and I don't know that for a fact so there are no big friends to distinguish who actually was holding so because my client is just driving up in Carson you know possession what they say possession is nine-tenths of the law he's driving the vehicle so everything in the vehicle is his and so so at the end of the day were able but this guy was a career criminal so ended up having to do some time but you know we get that down to something lesser that on the actual drug charges instead of it you know we break it down to something a little less than what it actually is and get the sentence down to something more manageable or instead of sending him to a real penitentiary let him do his time in a state jail these types of things that's what we work on yes ma'am [Music] they did they did I think he got a couple million dollars on bro but but he said obviously it does not make up for whether there is a statue that says that if that happens that they it calculates how much the state has to pay person for that he got a couple million dollars yeah it was in nano many years I'm just on no evidence but that comes down to 30 cops not just dirty cops but not having good intention yeah because you know because I'm going I'm going in if it's me really we're gonna do battle and so and I will tell you overturn because sometimes you know judges they have to bill appoint people to represent and over time you know I could see judges they say oh yeah this will be a good can't fight they'll get they'll see an eternal attack and they'll say oh let's bring in miss Blackmore this will be a good I mean I have really I'm really just resting in the pasture right now because it was really it's really hard work you know understand because you really have to do battle because the prosecutor it's like three of them they you know you have to they have three people working on a case and so if you don't have a good lawyer yeah you can find yourself in jail for a ho-ass a jail incarcerated for many many many many years so I was a very serious thing I mean I tell people all the time I mean you know even people for DWIs you know they'll pull you over on the side on road you know I you know choked I mean you you don't have a obligation to help the state to prove their case if you think you're going home don't you just need to assume that don't blow don't you know don't give it in any kind of way you know now they have will give you a blood test non-stemi don't submit to any of these types of things because you are incriminating your own self and so wait if they do it anyway if they do it they have the law now where they can't take your blood which I really think if I did ever get one of those cases I just I just don't I don't agree with that law but there's a long hour they can in some states where they can take your book or what I would say is there somebody's trying to get you to do a breathalyzer you need to say no and then you need to try to get a conversation or lawyer they're gonna I mean people you cannot be scared of going down there to the station and get the kitchen lawyer because if because I mean there are all kinds of things now because they can they can suspend your license right then and there you know so you don't consent to a breathalyzer thing you automatically never suspend it could be it's different from every state in cuz I said your Lord is tops like coming down overturn that absolutely yes I guess that's how all this work so and then I don't think that just because it's a business that you cannot incur criminal liability because you will see that it can the business and its officers can be held criminally liable for certain business types of activities and so I am gonna just show you a little bit of this that was in the textbook and so these are some of the ideas that we've talked about just now but here it talks about recall from chapter fifteen corporations of course different corporations exist as a separate legal person so just remember that from that point on chapters before in criminal sector seven race the concept that a corporation may be charged with the crime along with apart from his principles or a chase and the Congress has specifically included business entities in criminal statutes and areas that attached businesses included broad obstruction of justice health and safety requirements which is what we're going to talk about this evening and because of the inherent difficulties in terms of proof most edges do not require the specific mental intent they do not require the specific mental content guilty mind those require from other clients and so then our book talks about this pop doctrine and so it talks about the park doesn't spell it by the United States Supreme Court in a famous 1975 case in which the court held that an individual corporate officer could be held guilty in this case of a misdemeanor crime under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act that far along food to become adulterated while store in a corporate warehouse and so since in 1973 drug the FDA observed and advised Park of unsanitary conditions including rodent infestations and his Philadelphia warehouse in 1971 the FDA found similar conditions at his Baltimore facility after the violations were not corrected the government charged athlete and park at leading business and park individually with a misdemeanor under the FDCA although Acme pled guilty talk argue that he could not possibly hit the Russian city knowledge necessary to commit the crime a jury convicted Park eventually and pretty important part of the conviction the court pointed out the nowness of the decision but nonetheless a far that corporate agents have a high level of responsibility when it comes to the well-being of the public first of all they know that a condition they told him about it he was on notice so he knew about once you know about it then you can't come back and say I didn't hit I could not have had the intent required we're talking about food that people are going to be consuming which could be very dangerous you know could cost someone today I brought in federal court because there are federal those federal crimes of federal statutes that we're talking about in the park case they cannot be adjudicated by a state court it has to be a federal court okay so here is our data sheet here so this is the lead I'm just gonna look at the docket sheet first for this cases in Illinois in the United States District Court in the Chicago division and this is the little moon case and so this what I'm going to bring in the information about it but these are the facts that this particular business and its officers were charged for slaughter poultry in compliance with existing laws and Abed cell transport adulterated dr.dre food and we'll talk more about this food was about red but these are some of the charges that were brought [Music] this particular person and so it's going to start out in federal court with an indictment and actually what happens is this goes to a grand jury okay and so there's usually a grand jury that's already that they bring people in for Brender and they kind of sit on that grand jury for that particular court for a couple of months at a time and the prosecutor brings several cases in front of them bring the evidence and then requesting and an indictment on those charges and so this is what the indictment looks like these are some of the defendants and in this all of different counts so this is just a grand jury indictment and then at the end that's just count two at the end then it's signed by the grand jury foreperson and the prosecutor the United States attorney and then it's filed with the court and that's how the criminal case begins against that person okay this is the case and so just you know let me get through the fact that but this this one was in your book so I'm sure you there was an excerpt of this case in your book but just here are some of the background settings based on severe rodent infestations and Senator problems at immigrant distribution systems warehouse the crew was convicted of 30 felony counts the group was sentenced to a five-year term of probation these four felony counts and he was able to give probation ordered to pay a total restitution of 8.2 million dollars jointly and separately with co-defendants and since was a total fan of tomatoes so jointly and severally so now remember what I told you about what that means so somebody won't get stabbed that's right all the defendants so once I get that judgment if I can get all my money for one I can't because they're jointly and severally okay any one of them if other ones don't have any money any one of them I can get that money from them and so he now appeals okay so we've gone through all of those stages that he now appeals the conviction and the citizen they really they really affirm all of it but they affirmed three four and five eight and the 6:00 news for those and they remain so that doesn't mean that he won't have to win assent and remanded they mean they're sending it back down to the district court for the district court to do something you adjudicated in a different way you still have to probably have to come up take some type of a fine or conviction for that count as well but for some legal reasons they vacated and remanded for sentence so that the district court case can reset and so here we go with our facts the conditions that the cold storage warehouse in Chicago boarded up deterrent even the most enthusiastic for anyway so the Pershing Road warehouse was a coal storage facility that stored raw fresh and frozen meat poultry and other products he did not own any of these products but he was in the business of storminess for different business you know like the restaurant they may not have the room to store their food so they had it stored and then it just go and get it you know what they need from this facility and so he's keeping other people's property there assuming that he's keeping that that's what they're paying to keep it in a in a state that people can consume it I mean that's what they're paying for and so based on the trial testimony of Magoo's manager David Smith it is clearer than the group was aware of the problem in 1999 in January 1989 Smith one of the co-defendants now who he owes already pled guilty to misdemeanor charges and so that's how the government does they'll flip a witness so that they can testify against the other he was hot as major of the person role warehouse when he started he noticed a rodent problem specifically Smith learned that the groom's the groom workers found for rodent droppings and occasionally caught rents in traps throughout the warehouse dissin was announced books so dr. Smith approached the group but moons president mr. Stuart Jack Stewart okay so he's another co-defendant he's been sued in his individual capacity he's the president of the company about the rodent problem at that warehouse sniffing Stewart discussed the growing problem they knew about it and it does they frequently discussed it unfortunately it got worse according to Smith in 2001 the group employees were catching more rats and finding more rodent droppings if testified in that in late 2001 or early 2002 the Google warehouse workers read early hot wax at least one to two votes per day and discover a rodent rat droppings and wrote it nod products in the warehouse rodent damaged products will come in from all over the warehouse with the bulk of the damaged product coming from the basin but a new cottage in the basement so testified although employees were destroy the product than had been nod the crew did not conduct a test to make sure that other boxes that appeared okay were not similarly contaminated by the Romans eventually the rat problem case no bed in the group assigned warehouse employees to rat never trolls to search for her head in a Red Robin I trust either port back to report that to him about the number of rights they were removing from traps each day at one point the Rat Patrol patrols tally as many as 50 trapped rapes but we're talking about a very not warehouse because at one you could see that it was that when I see like 2 million pound of yes of meat coming out yeah this is huge yes so the cost of would be a lot of money you think I know what you're gonna say definitely less than what you have to pay but yes right but if you know you got rent you have to do something about it why didn't you just move product okay well hold on first you do the product they move up where any sense being up leave it out of the basement okay wait a minute okay hold on so what let me hold up figure out what you telling me okay let me just get this straight because then cuz he thought this exactly what you thought so maybe this is acceptable for me if you got my beat over there and you have one rep let me find out if you got that one is the Belgium realize that he had a problem right the first thing that the manager should have done is move the product get the rope move it later I don't but I do have one rep in that whole building on the first third floor on the basement anywhere we have not read you can't be champs every Montgomery is in the building you know you got rest eight one rep yeah well yeah I agree with you by oh is he telling his clients that we're hot okay so hold on so where we met with representatives on Macleod Oh yeah it said the one at when I checked barely hold it oh they're breaking up oh not the old bean just back risk in everything I'll be moved the brisket little daughter at the Oslo okay okay before the cruise ships with brisket its employees inspected the boxes separate boxes that appears to have rodent damage and the boxes so we're not successful in all the damage picking up some of the boxes although that we usually know that part of damage on outgoing fields of land to customers the groom did not tell is customers that the damages caused by rodents is that the goon strikes us to tell the customers that the product had been thrown out because of warehouse warehouse damaged such as from boxes I was in to depreciate the rodent damage from other warehouse related damage upon discovering and the glue employees were using the mm notation for rodent damage Stewart is sugar sack doing it and cuz declines with us okay we'll just mmm stand for many customers did make claims with marriage product one customer as a group if they had a rodent problems because the customer had received a machine from the groups warehouse on several occasions specifically boxes with not non marks and host in response the group sent a letter explaining that there was a small area of the basement with growing activity and a it would move the product out of the basement to be stored somewhere else in the facility [Laughter] she came to the warehouse I would do she went okay so before Rhonda came and discovered or back mess uh-huh the cause of risk kids are going into a restaurant yes if you're never bad because did I get really sick is suing the owner of the restaurant obviously gonna go in jail and his restaurant is gonna close uh-huh okay so then after about obviously after spending losing everything I'll go back and recuperate for these losses so that again he would still have to work he could actually go back to okay but listen there are people to get sick in restaurants all the time you would have to it would be hard to know exactly what caused the person to be sick I mean yes they could say okay well I have brisket but but what I'm telling you is that the person at the restaurant they don't even know so they would never probably even click that this is going cuz you would you uh you would think maybe it could be from the fact that it was that the food maybe he was not kept at the right there are a whole lot of different things that could cause people to you think you see it's hard to draw a straight line to the reason and they would never click if they were not Rhonda and they had been out there to see these conditions they would never even make the connection I wonder what because that's what you see that's my job she's the Quality Assurance Manager for that particular company they're storing their food there okay so that's her job I mean yeah to make sure the quality of their product is up to standard she's gonna go out there and check on on their property and she goes out there and this is what she finds okay so in her later corresponds between Stewart in a royal the blue refused to pay a claim so she made a claim in the Hughes case any further Stewart represent or raw foods that the pest control company only found to tote with old mouse droppings and no other signs of infestation and that a recent American sanitation goes to to inspection did not find any box well wait a minute for the steward representing so I mean this is from his testimony now I mean he there he's the upper level manager that's working in the company the prosecutor has now gotten him to plead to a lesser charge to grant him to testify now again and so I guess you could say is hearsay but he has first-hand knowledge but that's a good this information provided by the groom was not true at the ASI representative spy at trial one of the critical issues anti-flammable wrote in that too moreover so so this part is not hearsay moreover a report from a cloud pulls the inspection company to establish so so eventually on May 25th 2002 huge McCauley a United States Department of a USDA food safety inspector went into the warehouse I'm assuming that you know somebody probably talk to him to do that okay one of these inside people are somebody at that time the glucose reprocessing hams for freezing without the benefit of USDA inspection in addition the hams were uncovered I'm assuming that you must have some type of USDA inspection before you can process him anyway and then they they were uncovered McCauley notify other you SPF issues and K called the USDA and compliance official went to the warehouse on May 29 palms notice that in the warehouse freezer the hams were being stored where the hands are being stored the walls were deteriorating the ceiling air structures will rust detained McCauley conducted a more detailed examination of the conditions of the personal homes as our homes of their models in the walls with glue boards and in front of them crushed rat droppings on the floor of the food storage areas and boxes of lead product they have been nob progress and was different homes and products meant that no cool products will be allowed to come into on lead the basement of the warehouse is just a basement are these people mean either because I see one rat and I'm Audi good back after the USB is but it's not stupid at my Smith store he advised Smith to start cleaning up the warehouse consistent with this discussion Smith and approximately 20 McGrew employees clean the Pershing Road warehouse and surround meat boxes and help the following morning 14 us camp you have authority to go in in anticipate section prior to arriving at the purging warehouse USDA officials and representatives from other federal state and local health agencies so now this is how they are able to build up the criminal charges as a result officials from the the Illinois Department of Public Health Chicago Department of Public Health and the Illinois Department of Agriculture assistant in the inspection when the officials arrived they observed and photographed dumpsters and Tobias from a meet ice to green palette and packing a series but his findings were discussed with Smith who acknowledged that he and other employees had been there all night cleaning the warehouse in anticipation of the inspection and so there's letters found and photograph the final solution in a person warehouse where rat drivers can't recognition to the chillers drive the warehouse including next to and on Carter Road on wrote it poultry live wrote it by chicken blood from meat products on the floor mix what wrote it to drop in and rat tail marks dirt and debris on these potential rodent access points including open sewer drains and openings from the doors hold the ceilings walls and the floors ice build up on the ceilings directly above store product and wanted to confirm these fillings on the product mold and choke on the walls sincerely several inoperable bathrooms which forced warehouse workers to use broken toilets and flush them with buckets of water and run sewers and standing water on the hills this is after they went and cleaned all night when your for you what they do obviously [Laughter] [Laughter] poultry food products at the warehouse will order detain and the bill was issued a notice of non-compliance on May 31st approve the grooves Pershing Road warehouse has shut down the 22 million pound in front of store at the warehouse were either destroyed or to me this oh I'm sure there other people who do this oh but you're right there yeah right so they're out yeah so there yeah and so I'm assuming that's why they try to decontaminate yeah well because these people this is their property this is not their he does not own it so these companies are relying on yes they have insurance well I was seeing what I was talking about there were people who sued him and they were able to do whatever because I'm pretty sure they didn't want food he's just storing it or let's say Applebee's they already bought this meat they don't have a place to keep it so they're keeping it here so when they need some based on whatever they're going to be cooking for the week what every baby has medical and pick up some piece some of it and bring it to the store this is there they've already this is their product that they've already paid for so now once they take it is gone they have to buy more and so so you know so at the beginning of the case it tells you that he was found guilty and what all the times were so now he appeals he argues at the district judges jury instruction and properly subjected him to strict liability for the felony offenses what he's saying is that thing that we were talking about before that you know then he should not be I mean what he's I think what they're what he's trying to say is I other people in the company did this I did not exactly there's no way that I can you can say that she's my buddy I can't or the knowledge he didn't have the knowledge I see I know now that he had to our knowledge you and I we all know because they would bring him but what he said is that whatever they did I get these things I did not they just did this is what they did I didn't you know I didn't know about every single thing that they did he's trying to say he did not instruct them specifically to do some of the things the employees did as far as and so they are doing the same thing that the guy was arguing in the park situation and so sorry what we have learned though is that he cannot you're going to have a higher degree of probability when it comes to those types of crimes because we're talking about that's what parts am a CEO or okay or some pilot officer is not company so right yeah officer on bag bags it it's pretty much look alike because how did you knock that means you have to business this warehouse in two years in two years in the sea live rats walking around I think that's when he that's what he's saying I might have been negligent but I didn't know each and everything that's what he's trying to say Anna Jerguson know this is not just mere negligence you knew and intended to be new the judge they also gave the jury the Seventh Circuit pattern jury instructions strengthen it corporation acts only through his agent so he's kind of saying they did but the judge saying no no knowledge and intent means that the that when the corporations and they're acting on behalf of the company and so whatever the employees do are unknown the corporation is going to be held to also know and have the knowing intent so in the jury that the judge gave the jury like biased information that something that would make them like sort of like sway that decision not necessarily sweater decision see when you give the jury instructions you give you instruction based on the law okay he's saying that the judge gave him the wrong law he I'm a defendant so I'm I don't do everything I'm a I'm an officer I do all these little things that River will be happy to pull a case and I was telling y'all you know somebody new you know it's but you know so corporations will try to act like they don't know because they're uh sure you know somewhere else I'm not people one of the office they're the White House right so you can't say that I knew her head intent to do this because I didn't know that's really what he's saying he's saying sure should have given them instruction finally the judge definition of the doctrine of the groom so he offered his own jury instruction based on a different law that's what he wanted the judge to give to the jury and the judge said that that particular juror instruction that he wanted to use was not on point with this particular case he rejected his instruction because defendant in that case was convicted of the sale of adulterated be privacy which is different than what this case approved it says the cries charge he counts 3 4 & 5 acquire content before the defendant can be inconvenient to substitute the government or school that has been ignoring Lee didn't Act which the law forbids I don't see why he can't see that that's what he did it's because he was there making he he met with the don't his men not just Milken not to Smith but he met with the pest control P and the pest control and it's not there but he's trying to establish that he's a corporate defendant and then he didn't have the specific knowledge and from that sort of lying through his teeth that that's what he's doing the instructions of the tape explain that in order to make Magoo the jury had to find that an authorized agent or employees of the goon or leased or products under it which is what he did since my j9 this is what a court is coming in now and they're doing the announcement saying he knew he knew since 1999 when he had the conversation with his manager and several employees were aware of the Accenture conditions at the warehouse the group was aware of the rodent infestation from the formal report suggests the ASI report and from the pest control guy so see if they were not able to establish how much heat new provided like in the park case they he was like but I didn't like you know how was I don't know they were able to establish that he did we already told you about this you know you can't say who don't know he knew and this is how they're every because he himself he's not at the corporate you know in the corporate office and he met with these people personally so that's where he's like a push of charge and these three things together grew annoyingly stored these products under insanitary conditions mistakes mistakes the mid ramp remember from our textbook for the charges the guilty mind the mental requirement it's only bruised argument that the prosecutors passing claimed during but it turned the case into a strict liability prosecution I understand why he's thinking that but the fact of the matter is district liability because we're talking about boom good news for Emma I was thinking about when you're talking about all of them like putting office up in the top end I think about the Anderson in the thousand tons of like picking up things like threw away the Dave and good wait a sec yeah and so see ya so that's like that later but they got off and so then so and so if that's the case of David that is why I don't wonder he's arguing that case and he brings his case it's a court with him and the court says David Lee different gates I mean when I made the connection but it's a hidden edition well he was Arthur Andersen was the accounting company for Enron but he is he is a company for somebody like that he's kind of so yeah he's just saying he's just going for more support but his petition he couldn't his contention that a different jury instruction should have been used other than the ones that the judge you use well I'm saying the judge used but that's the one that was would have been given to the judge by the prosecution here Lacroix was charged with knowingly stowing the cultural improve punishment in senator conditions to determine need to prove that agents this is all they need to prove that agents of the corporation Norman's story that's his problem he's saying I didn't know they knew because they did it though so quarter saying all that is needed to prove is that the agents knew that's where the park doctor comes from all you need to prove is that the agents the people who work at the company knew then that's enough to assert liability on the corporation and the corporate officers okay so that is something that is very important to keep in mind because and I see that people don't keep that in mind when I go around to different businesses you know they let their employees do things and they'll just ruin the business but what people need to know is that in certain instances you can be held liable for what that employee is doing even if you really really really don't know all the government has to prove is that the agent knew and that makes the critical difference here that's like holding the parent responsible for the kid this so did they take away his prop his probation is that what they was that what he got for the count five he got he got probation let me see here this is the amended judgement so what do you mean so if you get community service that is gonna be stick that's what's going to be stated now once you get probation you have to actually that has to actually be one of the things that you're given so once you get probation the probation officer can't say okay go do community service the judge has to yes when you say you walk free he got probation I was able to walk out after doing all of that damage to how many businesses eventually people's lives and the employee whatever company that new job then then you'll be you're ready for this question well what I find about you are you always want to send everybody to jail yes we know yes yes that won't change so that's not your quiz okay so no I'm not gonna do that see I can only do one thing at a time on that that's the only problem with that so but hold on I'll give you a question anyway yeah cuz I don't want to mess up that so we can do that no you can't because yours is not 31 your system or no that one does not go for you that's goes for somebody else not for you but here is your question okay do you believe the Guru deserves more punishment let's say tomorrow okay so more like how what what else would you say that you put it down that in the face for a week [Laughter] so I wanna make sure there are", "oP7CxrcWLDw": "[Music] hello Pope's this dog man he's up he wants to be untied so bad like so bad you have no idea how bad he wants to be untied he's driving me nuts to the point of croc I need a drink I just opened it what a crazy hot day crazy hot day like just look at me I'm glistening I look like Telly Savalas all right let's go do a water check which is the best way to go in dip in the pool I'm not dipping in this pool hello Inga's house in got today well I see you were here better question is how much wine have you drank so tomorrow we're finishing this off hey it's uh he came up with a really good idea all of this dirt we're gonna put it right here to extend the back off the garage I'll be able to get rid of it all and then we're gonna then he's gonna dig this back farther because it actually it's like it's gets way wider actually the width of it at the back is the width at this front so like that's how much bigger it's gonna be like all of this right here is getting dug out tomorrow all right and then he's going into the swamp area behind there and he's gonna do the landscaping they'll be done tomorrow night two days get this dies out unbelievable unbelievable two days finished looks like oh man oh man what okay this is really tricky walking thankfully I'm wearing my new rubber boots that are really high so all these trees are going and this trench is gonna get retrenched so it increases the water flow he's gonna do some Dillard tomorrow's gonna be a good day at Deakins there's like there's I gotta show you that water look at this it just keeps flowing out of the ground like you know it's not sad to see these aren't trees Jennifer this is the bleed route these trees are 25 years old they never grow they grow they die they grow they die they grow they die that's what they do they're their swamp brush night they're not technically even trees and a real tree couldn't grow there anyways because it's too wet the trees can't grow in saturated ground I don't believe it's way bigger than I thought it was going to be but hey what the hell so tomorrow this right here he's gonna go behind there by the next year a year from now it'll be all growing up and it'll look really good it's gonna look rough for the little house yeah willow said they're gonna be an option now man I don't believe the flow of water this is gonna be so good all right let's get this it's like it's crystal clear water all right let's see what she does see what temperature she is [Music] Oh nos not in the water that's why it's not going down Oh Matt I'm so focused on the camera work that uh I don't even have it in the water okay oh you can't see it okay where's the temperature here I'm looking I can't get an angle to see it in the screen I can't see it here and uh looks like 18 degrees Celsius 18 here yeah it's it's looks like 19 degrees Celsius 67 degrees Fahrenheit yeah that's what it looks like not as cold yeah 67 degrees that's actually pretty warm for water coming under the ground it's got to be really really surface water like traveling underneath all the hot ground but it is a creek you know it's way warmer I actually I anticipated it to be in the high 50s you know high 50 like like 14 Celsius type temperature so it's obviously it is it is not it's not a spring it's a creek and it's an underground Creek that's running just under the surface that's why it's so warm it's getting heat and heated up from the the surface temperature of the soil I know I should be actually it should be right around 1214 degrees here's what it really should be actually honestly it should be like a 11 11 degrees 52 degrees Fahrenheit so it's obviously going underneath the surface of the water on a surface of the ground which is very close to the surface well it was a creek not a spring I know that that's what the survey said on my property she's filling up it never stops running year-round let's measure this water over here it's running pretty good too all the Ducks are no your hobby the doctor happy right now there are the creeks at the death Creek the problem is this water running on the surface - that's the thing is we're not really getting a true temperature really come right down to it what is this yeah this is 22 degrees 71 Fahrenheit yeah 22 but it's running on the surface it's almost a lake but all of this will be gone tomorrow all of this is good check a deeper spot Tammy it doesn't matter it's like the waters coming out of the ground up there the deeper spot actually be warmer because it's over there on the ground the coldest is gonna be coming right out of the ground but what a difference with real equipment what a difference Wow it's fast and you just make short work of it but the machine was working hard and he only came this morning they only had he figures it was over even half and three quarters tank of gas it wasn't full plus it was hot and he had enough he says even with air-conditioning so the machine was getting too hot it was it was just lugging he said it wasn't as strong as it normally is plus he said this stuff's really face it's really hard to dig because it's so wet it's heavy really heavy seyton stuff that way so tomorrow it'll be done they'll be here at 8:30

system or you get degraded sound the sound sucks because you're only getting like half the signal because Apple makes their microphone input which is a headphone input it has to be compatible with the iOS Microsoft system so he's using a regular microphone on an i/o on an iOS it's like man you can't do that but it works on my DSLR forget about the DSLR man it's like it's the Magoo sliggoo though

crack that whip get the whip out oh please take me on a wheel ball ride you guys are so pushy I want to see Matt crash and burn I want to see him crash and burn live on YouTube I'm so tired that's like it's like a wall has hit me as it feels like the heat today because I was sitting there and I just there was no way I could get any shade at all was so brutal that's why I went into the hole the reason I went down into the hole this today was because the water I had my feet in the water because then my rubber boots were cool and that was that was cooling me down but when I was sitting up top my boots are getting hot and it was like I was just cooking I was like God so hot it was better once I got into the hole and I got my feet wet because they can feel the cool water right through the boots I don't believe what we did here today that's a massive hole massive don't forget we got another guy hit a hundred reviews on Google and a hundred on Facebook it's what we got to do we got to hit the honda teach 5-star ratings one hundred each if you want to see the whole but it was cherry want South Korean girl you can't possibly read everything what are you doing did I miss something important what did somebody want Tracey wants me to take her into the hole go back to the beginning of stream a very mystery I was in the hole the beginning the stream Tracy I was in the hole yeah the diggers they're sitting here Paul ladies gentlemen oh man I just got hit by a massive wall of exhaustion yeah I did oh that's crazy I think it's the heat it just hit me or that bar OD sound which just went right to my head not gonna be at the barley sandwich because just went right to my head that might be the problem as it was pretty tasty and it's pretty empty a little bit so we had a good day on the duck adventure we hit our target and gofundme we dug a big hole on my property and tomorrow we'll continue to dig the hole bigger and I'm thinking I'm thinking I don't think it's gonna be full until I'm thinking at the rate the water is coming in this let's bet let's bet on this let's get a wage or hopping in here I should have done a vote on this on the stream I'm thinking okay today's Monday Friday night choose today Friday night it'll be full right to the top Friday night right to the top full full full that's right that's what I say Friday night that's what I think David you think three days that's a big hole man that's a big hole inga things Thursday I'm thinking about it you guys that's a big hole i unless tomorrow we hit some mother lode of water which is totally possible because tomorrow we're going that's what we're gonna go back there and dig some more so we might be it might be we might hit with a little water tomorrow and we hit a mother lode of water then it could it could come right up Oh leras jeering be more realistic Saturday how many bodies in our bore burry none none yeah but nobody's gonna own up to lose him where justice is due fun no no

yeah I saw this afternoon I acknowledged that about the zika tense and there under your name you got a rain check but I don't need one one permanent one that I'm gonna put at the at the pond winner gets the t-shirt no winner does not get a t-shirt the winner just gets the knowing that he guessed right that's it I know you can pick one up and leave the other one there's no problem but they don't have him in stock right now else if you told me this afternoon I read the comments you know I figure out what's wrong my iphone why he wouldn't I couldn't really wait yellow because I turned on the night thing shook my head you're like coca-cola I like South American coca-cola don't like North American cool cool I want coca-cola me with sugar cane now coca-cola me was was high fructose corn syrup so I guess I don't like it here's that live in North America is there a difference what about behind you what does that mean yes other questions I don't understand I try so hard to figure out what you're saying I got the boots for return by Tom yeah I got that yeah Mexican coal person sells American coke these sugarcane look behind you coca-cola yeah yeah I know this yeah the rock it's just that it's just a plastic Rock I think it's from I think it's from little bottles it's an old plastic rock from little bottles the little coke bottles I think that's what it came from I forget exactly and I bolted it to the top of the tractor to hold tools in it see it's bolded I think it's little bottle who call a trade I think that's what it is I'm pretty sure that's where I got it from I have two of them I know it's screwed now as I've drilled some holes in the bottom of it to bolt it but I have one that's not screwed that I guess it's vintage but I'm not selling it it's just a perfect thing because a milk carton was too tall and it's low and it holds everything oh and mr. Robinson hast to be blocked why would he jump on here and tell me to a few myself like did you block him block him get the hammer out and hit him boys and girls there we go like why would he jump on and just do that like why do you jump on a stream and just tell the person to do oh man society is so screwed up like just to just run around on streams typing after you like I get confused by today's society sometimes you know oh but I'm insulated I live in the bush with a bunch of ducks and a dog I'm a serial streamer so I really don't have complete grasp of reality I mean I live in a like a bubble to a certain degree but then the news every night i OD on news so that takes me out of my bubble Patty's going to bed glad patty hello miss Scott girl are you ladies and gentlemen think I'm officially fried I think I am I'm officially fried Oh Debbie don't ignore the news well don't watch mainstream news but the real news like did you hear the latest news this is not covered on TV did you who did you did you hear the latest news that the us-backed rebels on Sunday in Syria killed a Russian general did you hear that one you won't hear that in the news lieutenant general was killed by mortar fire shot by us back rebels that's World War 3 stuff guys that's how Wars get started when you start killing generals I read that today I was like dad's bad news that's really bad news there really makes you think you know that's it's it's it's like yeah and the media is not going to tell you that they're not gonna tell you that you know a Russian general got killed by us back rebels and you think Russia is gonna sit back you know they already sat back once when turkey lost a fighter jet or when turkey took down one of their fighter jets accidentally this I don't think they're gonna let this general go something's gonna have it I can't see them just letting this slide you start getting generals knocked off and you let that slide no this is not a good thing and they've proven that US Special Forces are fighting amongst the Isis and the moderate rebels in Syria they've got photos photo proof that US Special Forces are working with them like photo proof the US forces are hundreds of US Humvees mingling commingling with the rebels and then a general gets killed man oh man if Russia starts killing US soldiers what's gonna happen guys like I'm gonna be sitting here and looking off in the horizon and seeing a mushroom cloud going off over Ottawa hey anyways just a little bit of reality reality on the duck show hey guys we had an awesome day we've dug a big hole it could potentially be my next bomb shelter it's just gonna figure out how to keep the water out of it and let the bombs drop no I'm kidding anyways I'm getting in the old wood new katawa I don't know you

"NoLSlw5WidA": "hello perfect hello good morning perhaps we slowly start the rust treaty was Muslim emotion pista peonage yet so my name is Michael Jaworski I'm a Bloomberg specialist for derivatives a structured product minister with Mikulski a manager Paris which is here with the focus that Sankey spoke to the product of Bloomberg I cover Russian market for many years I see some familiar faces I work in the bank also in Russia for before in for many years yeah I'm not girly at the numerous races America me a visual Nagas nakumo elite and I was invited for this conference to share Bloomberg experience and also to talk about how in European Union the banks are facing new regulation in terms of transparency and protection of the retail customers yeah he'll go paddle it's given open bloomberg attacks ATM card reservoirs legally revenue yes I use a Robles is a sheet a client so let's talk perhaps first in the beginning about the Russian market so as you know probably much better than me but because we are we I work for Bloomberg I need a lot of customers like structure product market is booming crazy for at least last year yeah by that you've matured estimates and a system allen key yeah Roberto Bloomberg miyajima privileged Naga client of a structural basis of a structural in Boonton are serious patrina me live passionately good so as you know probably because of much lower yields or rates in the United States and also because the legislation is changing with 93 G's boolean ischemia stuff come if se you next set of tags takaki res cadet E is Minear very cool Ronnie as you know retail investors are start to look for enhanced yields and banks are looking for the way to cheapen the option the customers are buying a quiz nitrogenous th every map OS oval each each chip ribbon ste post variant of stable Odisha Viki instrumented likely an tough so perhaps let's start with to discuss a little bit the investment product first and the white cap sodium invest its own product about Imperium derivative or customers still the most popular product a capital protected notes or deposit when the customer has a full guarantee of their investment rotation a client of Simone popular name productive as Toyota not as a sheet a capital at which the client to guarantee writ was wrought in this easy as you know the banks are all the time adding new features to that so adding baskets worst of so this capital protected know they becomes a little bit more structured than before cocoons net you know a characteristic a de poblet past a another stay that ends Permian test I know it's not as a sheet as shown m capital M bullets to good name Shambo arranger the second group of products is reverse convertible products when a customer is not buying an option but he is selling a simple put option again with very different variants if terror up to at a boom aegisub is eaten a converted say wax a toys taken yet visited Stokely and occupied Arab zone the next one I'm sure you all know it of the collar balls very popular still in Russia mainly for qualified investors but hopefully with the legislation change last year it will be more available to the broad and scope of customers so very popular group of custom when the product could end earlier but still the customer has some downside risk at the end kaku's not a treaty product novena columns nakum Horatio of Tamati Chesky why my racy new Naga investor of immediate westosha qualification Onodera selenium the Canada technique was more zesty the product bootable - Eric Opera Mini adhesive and say the client uploaded on this coming senior so the next of the next group of products is the credit credit credit products and they could be formed after credit linked nodes fast to default basket some simply product when the customer is facing some kind of a risk credit risk of some counterparty negotiate a credit any product Oakley and yes abalone readme a risk and of course we have hybrids so now because of lower rates in order some time to construct this kind of products you met you have to mix together all these features to create one final product for the customer yes can you sneaky Brittany product a boolean is key staff key he such a tired resolution a product estaba with August as that get over additionally a client so if we talk a little bit more about other products other derivatives and go a little bit more in details I just put on the slide the products which are mainly price or we ask for help to price them in Bloomberg what de Rugy producted roogie derivative yes dismissed illness like nama bruschettas pros by such that sin of take a product of Bloomberg so of course I split them by on the line so by type of asset but of course as I mentioned a lot of these products they have some kind of hybrid feature or mix feature when you put different underlines and exposures together yeah but as Delille category em no cannas 'no unni highest s mission a holistic a product of is resolution a category so fast equity of course the most popular for investment product be recognized in the season a product of it from the wearin kisum a popular knee and as you can see it's different kind of baskets west of options or correlation products VDT receive it occurs in would see hood see product Akali Yahtzee Asians so again a way to cheapen the cost of the option yes very on testable ethnicities Thomas Absalon memorable features so the customer can enhance the coupon also look back which also works more the same way it's a positive feature to customer to guarantee some kind of rates yes the variant is permit youi absalom a variant a guarantee worship Liliana stuff compliant Oh so I mentioned another correlation products and also quanto this is very very important a lot of these products are issued in dollars but we see a growing popularity of ruble nominated bonds or notes so you have to quanto all this option into into rubles VDT product a gorilla a product you want a different era when the church F 0 of dollars no rested popular honest Roble he more productive demeanor a true black it's mainly towards so target redemption for words also other correlation product baskets on currencies and things like that venerian key for external tariffs no tax is Gogi product akhirah let's say a basket attack Dahlia interest rates it's mainly different kind of swaps but national bread sending stomach was not know Brazil each DVD swoop of so fast range or a vast range of swaptions callable swaps well sugar persons up to one of swaps was motionless to that's rich nor poor Garcinia Qantas walk-off in terms of credit products it could be some kind of simple CLN or CD s so credit default swaps sometimes tranches product like first to default baskets we also see some requests from the markets but nationally did Nick product of atomo good bit rustic redid Nino tech tree didna default needs warp it attacks a movie James burrows now tech instrumental here with Paul mal Chen you of course all the kind of combination of this you can use Nancy vida can be not static reductive just to let you know I hope you already know all you use in bloom pack we have a price which is called D deep when you can price pretty much all this kind of products using our methodology our data and we believe you can get very close to the market price you can also risk manage this product and you can also have a way to distribute it to to the customers most beta V a polls it is with latest of Bloomberg Conesus instruments and abrazo Vanya is Puma show at our instrument emotional structure ooh-oh product ability no bliss Cochran is net senior operability risk me at AXA errors fidelity product lien pool what is interesting we also have a scripting language a programming language when you can create whatever payout you want so as you can see it's really flexible that instrument Oh gingy BAC is excreted which is a grammy ravana blockade erica pore removal mortises that ruby variant we put of course you have a price or dilip but you can also manage the whole portfolio of this kind of instruments in risk system which is called Mars Vanessa system a risk of keturah NASA Mars villaggio profligacy impart phylum instrument and of course you can get not only valuation but also scenario analysis Greeks profit and loss and so on you can use the way little commodity at saenko or pelagic no tax analysis Teneriffe sensitiveness t pretty with Kofi tag Dalia so what is interesting that most of our customers banks brokers and so on so on they have their own front office systems store interior merchants were another client of Bank a broker it animates often a system of run to office and of course banks are more less happy with them the problem is that in the systems you can't really properly hatch and manage very structure of very bespoke products conditioner monkey was not the most rabbit at it instrumental no problem of Tom store system in the net

system be well we moderate Apollo GT needs a visa move at sense of CA the product of Atmos perhaps do you have any questions after first part yes Louisville Pro suppose Lapierre HST No so what I propose now I know that the Russian market is thinking what I have what kind of regulation you should you should implement in terms of informing the customer about the risk of the product presentation of the product so I was asked to to share our experience because we have a regulation which is called trips which was implemented almost two years ago in European Union which exactly is designed to inform and create a presentation or a time sheet for the customer yes now esto resistor in exam oh it's an ATM kaki requirement in academia Letta washed away in Farmer erratically and productor II mean Susan bull yes I use it requirement prima donnas at numerous casual supremes packet retail investment product is a directive which the main source of regulation with the main idea and aim is to produce three page document which is called heat information document so with all the details about the product to the retail customer ribs Illya Paco venustas own a product a Larry Schneider Galli Istra Havana at direct Eva glove net sell Kotori a besides as devotee in the community in other words a takumi inclusive o in farm at sea at la rosa Schneck client of what is interesting it was implemented the same time when method so a lot of customers think that cribs is part of method but actually this is separate regulation interiors Nestor the comment will video on this there at Ninian as the comment I mean feat m\u00f8 Nagi do much though I knew them as resin and know it ideally the community to let you know creeps regulation is about 150 pages long then you have technical assets technical annexes around another 70 pages and it only describes the methodology how you should describe the product which language you should use and what quanto analysis you should input in order to calculate for the risk of the product the comment drips stupid sells Susannah might see mrs. greynitz dr. technique a pre Virginia Yamazaki Krab is wet product quanta analyst Kotori is pull the vegetal of blue church WebAssign a product so the European Union they really input a common methodology for all the asset classes all the products in order to create comparable products on the market and the comenta map is a methodology Kim Oh blossom actively episodes databases that revenue me a product a merengue Souter ethically the same product sold by two different banks should have mall as the same kid with the same number the same group and so on toys the theory teaches katate product cattle prod and Vermeer resna me bank me dozen imitate acoustic rich the commune's krajowa in format says horny so here on the slide you can see the main parts of the key information document it consists of seven parts as distance lady priest Avelina Glavin HST the community college avoid informatica Teresa states images t so five of them are just purely descriptive two of the parts are really counted at if that is a thst apposite inherit it Alicia's to inherit them so first of course you have to describe the product receives evoke Aniston knows new episode product then what is the risk and when I get in return so this is the competitive parts first dance ecologist VHS take away risk issue I apologize I mean what happens if Crips manufacturer is unable to pay stop renewed yet he asleep raised by detailed lips a nice pass Fabien Prez Vista vibrato how long should I hold it and can I take my money early dog a doze in Jersey at a product e Magoo Li apology TF that my dinky runner how can I complain katya mokuba dissolvable what are the costs Kakui is DX key and this is also part of method you should disclose all your profits or the cost margin to the customer yet attack the chess team if it withers new era Street client OCS very prettily image rule and other information he drew guy in format say what is important because sometimes it's not clear and it wasn't clear in the beginning we tell sorry Torres na music the Jasna ea7 of Magellan if sick the Panny Aetna retail customers in the understanding of method is all the all the customers apart professionals so it's not only consumers but it's also small and medium enterprise Nnamani mi theaters in sneekly ENT at client a Couture a knee-length professional Metro cetera natalka indeed or knee pad rib italy nota a molly is read near propriety and what is interesting is not only investment product but any derivative so if you sell forward a color or swap for hedging purposes now or from beginning of last year you should also prepare the kids for this kind of products of a simple derivatives innate Anatole enlisted zone product a no tax a derivative a yes Tina premier we ever do a swap Natalie Petra Lavinia tax regime of purgatory appear the Community College ago in pharmacy this is how the kid looks like so you can see on the page the key information document this is direct print screen from the regulation so you can imagine how crazy detailed the European Union or the regulator described every piece of the regulation and every part of the document with EDTA screen Attaway the comment occlusive are in formats a Viet Rama is requirement of Emergency Preparedness colca certain pneumonia ditalion a piece on tribology chassis developes is a use I know some customers who even copied the exact colors from the annex is now a negatory client of Kotori data touch now it's vitarka Peru etc Virginia what is interesting is banks normally decided to go two ways or split the product into two ways interest nest or Bankia bushnell result as bt producted Lumias possibly me so for more vanilla derivatives more often traded like let's say simple effects forward the bully one in the high derivative of iodine as possible they prepare it they prepare something which is called generic kit so they don't input the exact details of the transaction but they put in the search engine on the web page like let's say dollar ruble forward one month three months six months buy sell and they create some kind of generic kids meaning not specified for this transaction but for some kind of group any episode taking instrument of balsa Petrovna see us as the youtaite a generic option Gerardo command krajowa in format see avoided polka options VD near that - - more value to bleed over because simply if a bank is trading thousands of forwards or FX worth of option it was impossible to create the tailored made heat for for this specific customer for specific product in the Premier Bank a product ECG forward maker product of a new a smoothness as that the comment will achieve our infirmity prob needler touch the cava reducta for more bespoke products for structure notes investment product more exotic products which you don't trade so often and you have time to prepare the kids then the bank will prepare the kid on it on a poly exotic a product of struct or not the druggies at each product is every Mia but Gaddafi keypad Rodney the comment will achieve our infirmity one more comment which could be quite important is that manufacturer of the product is responsible for preparing the kid version commentaries to preserve a detailed product at VHS that or stupid gato with the common college even farm at sea so if local bank just resells the product from some other let's say foreign bank they will get the kid from them the only thing they will do is probably just translated into Russian yes limini a bank prepared IOT products chasm in a stand of a banker unusual polluted the cumulative environments in volcanic edema wooded PDV Steven eros Kissick and this is how one of the analysis for one of the products look like so this is a capital protector no no I hope you can see it so overall in the upper part of the screen I'm sorry I can't I can't reach it you see the risk of the product so this one is capital protected product the customer has a guarantee of 95% V DT is this analysis novel is product provision and not as the shoshone epic poem that is validity so as this Davina's pet present of systole risk the whole analysis and this is required by regulation it has to be done on Monte Carlo simulation with 5 years of historical data this analogy at a tree about realignment dodging which is Dilma Delhi Montek para is posed when he says Potvin steady chess kick done and you have to calculate some kind of a value at risk even if I sit at a tennis tee but now a new crisco we just transferred in overall scale of the product from 1 to 7 1 being the safest 7 being the most risky he sank idiotically at Aetna boxes me product add in some Ibiza past Nasim snabel system so all the rivet ifs simple derivatives straightaway 7 so the most risky derivative press the seam a taboo did some way discover knee in this case because it's capital protected it's quite safe the risk of the product is to being quite safe I've done absolutely a disk postulated the wire but a motion as decision and poppy column that will not be the past a product then again using the same Monte Carlo simulation you have to create the performance scenario meaning you have to show the customer how much you can make man in positive scenario neutral unfavorable and the stress of crisis scenario is pulls a model simulates a Monte Carlo nuke adem\u00e1s as the rochester nari optimist each nation air in it Ronnie scenery negative machinery is stressed with scenery and of course you also have to inform above the cost to the customer a canister news 9 for me lately and above 6 the traitor as you can see this is the print screen from Bloomberg system so again we're able to calculate and provide you the proofs analytics meaning all the analysis you need to create a kid almost for any product you want visited a screen system Bloomberg emmamorgan Van Breda steric analytical bribes Bastien Lupo product Kotori buddhini redeem if you will be interested I would like to to speak with me I will stay a little bit more on the conference of course you can ask your colleagues from Bloomberg yes Lee with the interior oven Peugeot varied some know yeah I knew Nagas at the roost Nichkhun theory and second is the velocity of Rashad's a gallium is Bloomberg and of course if you have any questions now I'm more than happy to answer any questions efficiency Chesley swap Rosia budeau ratatouille to be honest I don't think so I'm not aware of it justin is now I think you can check in on stock exchanges because a lot of these products are traded on stock exchange like Deutsche Bertha so I said that a lot of these products are traded on stock exchange so you can check on volumes on stock exchanges but I don't think it impacts the regulation it impacts the market in that sense that downplaying the market I think the market is still booming because on normal products deposit the yields you getting a solo that for example still auto colobus in Europe are very very popular are very high in demand yeah need emerge to begin regulator of liao negative nostril - product the bottom product of a teapot a monster or which the product of people watching in iske e vitamin a premier kill money after colobus product a Visakhapatnam so you can check on stock exchanges but overall in European market I don't [Music] another question perhaps the way to miss reports so Yahshua's history in the pros kiryusha trophy ensues partners viscous alia comes to charity just keeps it either don't know but per quarter Liban even teach live so X lava if tompa can you shoot I'll add knock yes justice television store as nimah Tiant a kid the gutter with Paris Nomo it does just McCrory Mitaka Casals Brittany risk distribution recreation fees Akita Bank a shootout no premier trading fees patent parametric a kitten yet test car quad mama clip normal deserve a tip panel on khaki khaki fizzle as a crostini with rotten wood to the graffia so that's very good question so as I said the methodology is crazy detailed and for most of the product the numbers should be the same corrosive applause meter dialogue cochin-china of the yatza of de tolly he questions his future see for 8,000 imagine a kawaii still the methodology is not perfect for all the products certain committed even less productive for example on interest rates because for example euro didn't move almost a doll in US v yes it's not really great presenting start a new vision here a partisan and still even if it's very detailed some banks they have different interpretation it really results a multimeter the hook you bank of resna stock Albania so for example for auto callable products which can end before the maturity they could end after one year two years and so on some banks for example they calculated for the total period some banks the does do Monte Carlo on the on the on the paths which end all each to maturity the premier radical systematic in odds of a monkey Ishita Peres nummy Paris new connector is an issue video nuclear just yet nice to play near the university so even if regulator really tried hard to unify and to to to compare and to to in order to get the same numbers it didn't succeed in hundred percent there is the regulator watching asteroids when you consider which top really I did not she's known as the president of neo day yachts ahead as dealer juice Pearson to be honest the same with the cost some banks they show a little bit different cause than others because some calculated from me to offer they include some extra cost some doesn't he integrate the military bulky the pony to me is that relative over still I believe overall the methodology the regulator is forcing to use I would believe for big majority of the product is working quite nicely I mean who's that pounding UW purchase a product of reported the will najara so I think we reached the time no yes leo solution intuitive vision the macabre show Impossibles interiors never drove name first up linear I will stay outside if you still have some questions no procrastinate are progressive period es tuyo chasing of nauseous leadership an alligator Ubud position a structure unproductive Laros", "zMJA3OZocgo": "um i hope this video doesn't pull you off when it comes to sugar waxing good morning guys welcome back to another video if you're new here welcome my name is cintish at scentishly i always call this a space for solving our beauty problems because i do a lot of beauty related videos i do waxing i do skincare i do hair i do makeup and obviously recently i've just had a baby so i've been sharing pregnancy and baby postpartum related videos if you like this channel make sure you hit that subscribe button before you leave if you love this video make sure you give this video a like before you even finish watching so guys today we're going to be doing a waxing video and because i was pregnant lately i decided to really stick away from anything guys that was a high like i decided to just keep away from anything that was really really painful because i'm such a low pain tolerant person like i hate pain so throughout my pregnancy i decided to go with the easy way of actually removing the hair in my underarms i decided to use the nail cream i'm gonna think i'm gonna show you guys okay i don't have it here so i went on with using the nerd cream throughout all my pregnancy just to like wax my hair my underwear hair and all of her body hair that i had however finishing with that is left my underarms looking really really dark that's the only that's the reason why i was even using the neck cream i stopped using the nail cream in the first place but because i was pregnant and i wanted to stay away from pain as much as painful i decided to use the nail cream so now i'm left with really really dark underarms and i know that i should be showing you guys this right now but i wanted to show you guys me trying to sugar wax for the really really first time the first time i waxed myself i used the hard wax which was a lot painful but i love the results in the end so right now i decided to actually like trying a sugar wax and i know it's gonna be painful but i really wanted to try it so let's see how it goes so the one i have right now that i'm gonna be using is this one i got this from amazon like couple of months ago and i didn't even use it so i thought today would be the great time for me to actually use it so yeah i'm just going to show you what it looks like it looks it's kind of liquid um it's like near liquid foam already so this comes out you will literally just heat this up in the microwave i think for a few seconds and just let it cool down and start using it so what i'm going to do now i'm just going to go ahead and heat this up a little quickly and then i'll be back actually just hit this up in the microwave so it's a bit runny right now and it's quite a haul so you what you want to do i think i'm gonna be leaving this out for a little just to allow it to cool down because if i was to put this in my skin right now i feel like this is gonna burn the hell out of me so i'm just gonna let it cool down just to be to be kind to myself and my underarms even though they've looked really dark already like i don't want to make it any worse than it is right now so i'm just going to let this to cool down and what i'm going to be using to actually remove the wax guys is this white strips that i have i hope this works with the white street um because all the other sugar waxing videos i've seen i don't really think i've seen anyone like use a wax strip but i'm actually gonna try to see if this is gonna work with a white strip seeing that the consistency of this is kind of liquidy so it should work okay okay so i'm just wax i'm just wiping my underarms with some rubbing alcohol i don't know if this is safe but that's what i can get my hands on right now so i'm just going to use this to wipe it just to kind of get rid of any type of oils or dirt that may you know obstruct i haven't um exfoliated my underarms in over 48 hours so i believe that is safe whenever you're planning to do like a wax you want to avoid exfoliating the area at least 24 hours beforehand so that you don't irritate yourself that's a tip what i learned from my first underground waxing experience at home i learned that like a lot of people came for me in the comment area and i've got also some really great tips i was told to really use like baby powder because it helps with making the area less oily and less painful so we're gonna do that right now i'm gonna apply some baby powder okay that was not open let's apply some baby powder i'm gonna take a little bit just like this and let's go so oh i'm just gonna apply oh that's quite hot actually that's all all right so i have a mirror right here and i have a mirror right there but i think i'm going to go ahead with this mirror because it's a bit closer to me and i want to use the white strip on time before it gets cold and then not coming off again so we are going to do this guys pray for me this is gonna be so painful like i hate pain i'm scared of pain like pain is the worst thing for me and guys all right so we're gonna put this up let's count one two three okay so i have a little bit of hair come out can you see that yeah i have a little bit of hair come out but not as much so i have to do this again all right yes i have a little bit more come out but this is so painful like if anyone told you this was not painful don't listen to them like take it from me this is painful [Music] can you see that that's a lot more hair but i wish i hadn't i wish i could really stop it right now because this is too painful oh i don't think i'm doing this right for some reason i feel like i'm not doing it right [Music] okay that is it this is so nasty like this is gross i know but i just want to show you what's coming out right now can you see so let's go all right so i have this really thick um area right here that it's not coming off which is quite a shame considering all the pain i'm going through right now this is not what i should be seeing right like this i think i'm gonna fold this like in a square makes it a little easier and wow do you know what this is looking like a felt the waxing thing oh all right this is so painful i'm not going to lie i feel like the areas with less hair are a lot less easier to come off and a lot less painful and so if your hair was a little bit less than mine is right now i feel like this will be like really great for you to do um i think i left my hair to grow a bit too much so this is really really bad i'm actually going to wipe this off all right so sugar waxing is literally meant to be water soluble so once you apply water to it it should come out pretty easy so i'm just gonna wipe this um i'm just gonna try to take this off by applying some water and using a towel to wipe it off [Music] okay so i've actually wiped it off and this is how much hair i have left i feel like i haven't actually done anything because i did the amount of hair right here it's a lot so it's a lot so it clearly did not work i'm gonna try this again okay so once the powder is on you can actually see how many hair is literally left with me applying the powder you can see the hair really well i'm going to apply more powder can you see you can actually see the hair even more now um i'm wondering if i should let this to cool down a bit more because it was a bit hot the first time i applied it so maybe it needs to be a little bit cooler for it to be able to work so yeah [Music] oh came out is so okay i'm really gutted i had to come to this i honestly wanted this to work but i feel like i actually bought the wrong um wax i don't know how to work with this that's why probably not the right one or i just don't know how to work with it but i have to use this i'm just gonna have to use this because i've tried this like so many times and i couldn't get all the hair to come out i still have a lot of hair in both underarms which is quite not great so i have a bit of hair come out in the middle here and i still have some hair on the side and my armpits are killing me right now now i cannot do this for today so what i'm gonna do i'm just gonna use this and just get rid of the hair give myself a week and then attempt another waxing so let's go [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Applause] all right so this is it all right guys so this is not what i wanted this is not what i wanted but it had to resort to this i tried shigo waxing and this happened this literally happened to me so yeah it's quite embarrassing right now like i feel really embarrassed that i have to share this with you guys but i wanted i really wanted to share um so what i'm gonna do now apply this i have this after wax spray that i use with my other wax skate so i'm just think i'm gonna apply this just to you know all right [Music] [Music] okay so yeah um i hope this video doesn't pull you off when it comes to sugar waxing obviously there are a lot of other better sugar waxing options out there um which i'm definitely going to be trying this is not going to be the last go i'm obviously going to find another one that i've probably seen other people use and use that one that might probably work out for me apart from that this is a fail like i feel really really really embarrassed and ashamed of my self i've used how many wax strips and paint and i couldn't even get the result i wanted all right guys so i'm gonna hang this video right here and say thank you so much for watching this video and guys i'm obviously going to be trying another one if you have any other tips of any sugar wax that you recommend please please leave it in the comments area let me see if i can get like something that will definitely work for me and if you've done this before and if you saw that i did anything wrong let me know i obviously want to get this right because i feel like this it's going to help my underarms in its healing process so yeah bye now", "59N6HfgnEj4": "hello name's Karen swagger Darwin Canada see Shannon Kane and history kavita most awaited topics mother Susan a vaccination bug a

naturals llc hi guys i'm candace with trojan naturals and today i'm here to talk to you about the silky smooth sugar wax the silky smooth sugar wax is going to come in a 8 ounce glass mason jar and with the silky smooth sugar wax you can do full body waxing um yourself it's a diy type of thing pretty smooth sugar wax consists of sugar lemon juice tea tree and distilled water when you use the silky smooth sugar wax i recommend that you sit the container and hot tap water to soften it and then go for use it's not something that you have to put on the stove and warm up type of thing it's a hard wax but it's not the type of hard wax that takes excessive heat as you can see it doesn't come directly out of the container but i'm still able to squeeze it you know without breaking the container so when you use these sugar wax you are going to take your 8 ounce mason jar that you will receive your sugar wax in and sit it in hot tap water this will allow the wax to soften as you can see it is a hard wax but it's not extremely hard and it's not runny so it's going to take some softening um for it to spread like it needs to to spread your sugar wax you will need these popsicle sticks you can get them online and you will spread the wax in the opposite direction of your hair growth spread the sugar wax in the opposite direction of your hair growth and after you spread the sugar wax in the opposite direction of your hair you are going to take your choice of black strips i use cloth reusable muslin cotton wax strips i got these off of amazon so when you apply your wax strip you are going to place it on top of the wax and you are going to rub it in the opposite direction of your hair growth the same direction that you put the wax on you are going to rub in the same direction with the muslin cloth laying on top this is to help make sure that the cloth has contact with the wax so when you pull the wax strip off it's going to be in the direction of your hair growth so you're going to put the wax on in the opposite direction of your hair growth with the popsicle stick and then you're going to apply um one of your muslim cotton strips or your choice of wax strips and you're going to lay it on top and you're going to rub it in the opposite direction of your hair growth the same direction that you put the wax on with the popsicle stick when you pull the wax strip off it is going to be in the direction of the hair growth and one of the good things that i like about these you can reuse them and washing is very easy i like to let mine sit in warm water warm water dissolves sugar so i let it sit in warm water and loosen up all the sugar and get it off easily and of course it's easier for the hair to come off that way so you can just agitate it with your hand a little bit and then after that throw it in the washer when you finish washing they will not be like this they will come out all like this so one of the ways to get it back like this is to iron them i iron mine and make sure when you order yours if you want to do the reusable ones is you wash them first always wash first um and of course this is a wax that you can use for the entire body and those are the things that i have to tell you about the silky smooth sugar wax head over to trojan naturalsloc.com and place your order today", "WSegFf-NziE": "my name is Glenn and I'm addicted to waxing hey guys what's up welcome back to my channel today is obviously about good ol waxing and I'm sure a lot of you probably shave your arms your legs your armpits around your face and you know nooks and crannies so today I'm partnering with nads and I have already previously partnered with them before because our product is amazing and letting you know how you can get smooth hairless results for up to eight weeks and I have gotten Glen obviously into the game of waxing now this is probably one of my favorite products have from their line and this is the nads natural hair removal gel now this is their original formula like nothing has ever changed and everything is natural so since this is a natural product there is sugar a water honey lemon date extract and also vinegar and it's also so natural that you can eat it so with this wax what I love the most and why this is probably like one of my favorite products from their line is that you do not need to microwave this wax when you place it on your body your body's natural warmth helps warm the wax itself I just love how you can just pop this out of the kit this is what the box looks like the original one comes with all these wax strips and it comes with two other packs of these and these are rewatchable so it's not like you're gonna just use them and then toss them so you're not being wasteful you get to actually just wash them and reuse them and then it also comes with some of these little cleansing wipes as well and also where is it the moisturizing soothing balm for the after hair removal it is hypoallergenic washes away with water and also dermatologically tested got everything in one box now I'm going to show you some demos I do Glenn's back obviously I showed you a clip from his link from the beginning I also show you how I do my whiskers or my stash and also around my eyebrows so let's get into the demo well we got some lovely hairs right here or on this side too I don't know if you guys can see them in there but they're pretty long babe tell them how you like getting waxed ah I like it because I hate hair I think disgusting the cool thing about this wax is that you just put a thin layer place it over the hair and you don't have to heat it up so Dylan went back hairs they all grow like in different directions has went along with some short ones here they're kind of all going this way so I'm gonna go with the hair place a very thin layer he has one up here too we'll just do a little section right there now I'm gonna immediately put the strip over and I'm gonna push down do about four swipes in the directions they here one two three four and I'm gonna hold the skin taut right here there you go there's that one hair that was up there that's super long and go in the directions of the hair just do an even coating just position it where there's no previous wax go down again one two three four maybe five for good luck five hold the skin taut and then pull look at all those hairs right there so now all you do is you can take just one of the little cleansing wipes right here just wipe it and you are done the gnats also has this moisturizing and soothing balm for after hair removal in case you wanted to place that on any of the areas that you wax afterwards hey guys so today we're gonna wax my stache oh and ignore this homie right here Gerald he came to party and then I kicked him out or popped him I'm gonna be waxing my upper lip hi is you two saying my whiskers cuz it sounds a little bit more cute my whiskers with my upper lip I've been waxing it for years and I actually learned this tip from my nail lady when I would get it done there I still get my lip waxed and one like I'm lazy to do it myself but when I do it I do a section my section just very little just because I am sensitive in this area as opposed to just doing the whole entire area so I'm gonna take my wax right now I'm going to show you so if you guys have any sensitivity or you just can't handle it just do little by little and it's not as bad you may think like the more you go like you're pulling so many times but trust me it's not as bad and I love that I don't have to freak your microwave this so I'm just gonna dip very very little you don't need a ton of product a lot isn't gonna you know take out more hairs another thing that I like about this is that since I don't have to constantly like have this warm I can take my time like right now I can pause the video and tell you because with other um waxes you have to like constant like heat it up if or else it won't spread is quick and I have address and then they get there right here and right here and I'm just gonna do one little spot right here and bring it down I usually do it quite a few times just to kind of heat it up just for my finger and then just make sure I get all the area it's and bring it back you can see my hairs in that section that I pulled and then another thing why I look like this is I'll just take like a little makeup remover and I'll just go like this and it gets a rid of all the other excess wax and then I also do the same with my eyebrows except for my eyebrows I never wax underneath this portion because I barely have any hair that grows but I wax around my eyebrows just to keep this whole area right here and right here clean alright guys well that is it for this video I hope you guys enjoy this quick demo and review on waxing another thing is is this can save you a lot of money sometimes I get lazy and I do get my stash my whiskers and my eyebrows done at the nail salon but a lot of the time I do just wax myself here I also do Glenn's eyebrows as well which we didn't do on camera but I just you know we just do it here because we're saving money we have the kik here so why not also if you haven't subscribed to my channel I'd really appreciate it if you subscribe and also hit that little notification bell so you can get notified whenever I upload and I will

a solid practice back to review if you don't like it you can do what now say with me so far there but but oh yeah yeah welcome welcome my channel my name is Michi Rochelle meet you 69 I floated on Mondays over anime on other days and I do crappy comedy and review it's like tons of cameras cuz I'm a medical cannabis patient in Florida so if that's your bag subscribe it says to my channel sis and if you new here welcome if you're here welcome back and if you're hater oh my god okay so let's address the elephant in the room um my hands are a little it stain from cooking and there's no no pause but besides that my eyeshadow it's flawless I mean let's get into today's video so today I have a little bit of a dispensary fail so I went to cetera and I picked up some shadow the shadow that I picked up was the string called sherbert and it was really burning my throat I mean hella bad I did a review on it and I didn't even upload it because I wasn't quite sure if I was getting sick or if it was a product so I did some quality control it was the product so I returned it and I picked up some one this is what I have left of it it's like orange II there it is this was my kyon ativ which is a hybrid Leslie sets and here's you not leave Leigh sad I could not find this [ __ ] on Leafly or anywhere so uh what did they make up the strain I know it's florida finest but it makes for a really good read because apparently the guy who made this I don't know he's in [ __ ] jail for something or went to federal prison I don't read the article it's like I say read your Donnelly please that's okay so first of all I want to talk about the shatter I really did like the effects of it but it was just making my throat [ __ ] light on fire so I was like okay I'm big you know we refi they gave me credit I'm actually give me $50 credit so I didn't spend $10 and I got this mkhaya native but there is an issue with it so I'm just gonna let you guys know I have already returned this product of course they let me keep it and I'm gonna show you why and I did get some flour in replacement which was kind of low THC I haven't even smoked it yet I'm gonna do a different review on that so that being said let's talk about this wax and what's wrong with it so at first it doesn't really have much of a smell the smell that it has is pretty much identical to how it tastes which is actually I mean it's pretty good you're gonna see what the problem is in two seconds let's take a DAB so we got my dad too and I'm gonna do a quality assurance check with you guys just so you can see what I'm talking about I have a different banger originally when I made the video and I had problems even when I put it in my nectar collector it's gonna do the same thing let me show you guys what it does yeah some on here good I'll listen I have my and I'm gonna show you this night temperature I don't know if it shows you but it's at 595 97 it's definitely not too hot let's get it on alright it's still smoking cuz it has stuff in it so that being said I'm showing you there's still stuff in it burning off and earlier all right here we go listen what in the actual [ __ ] was that did you hear the sizzle it's like bacon grease by the way if you're new to my channel um I do have a new adapter to my rig this is called key bucket I also have the flower pot this is all by new vape you guys go check out their website the links down below and save yourself five percent by using code Meucci 69 okay so hmm and I actually wanted to do this review because somebody requested that I do more wax and that's what I was up to man I was like I'm gonna go I'm gonna I hunted it down and I got some more so that being said I you know was in a couple groups and they're like yeah you need to call this so I called them and they told me to bring the video down to cetera I brought the video down and I showed the management and he was like what the [ __ ] hi yes editing michelle here from the future the video in question is the video that i made with its sizzling in the bucket like that that i posted on a few groups so i believe i posted it on my Instagram check it out if you want to see it oh I think this by the way I think this was clocking in at like 69 percent convenient I did like the taste I like the takes I like the effects but that to me there is either like some butane in it or some ethanol or something that wasn't cooked off or water and that they told me that they thought there was just water in the product so they did actually give me store credit again kudos to them for backing up their product I definitely will say that picked up some I picked up some LA Confidential and some something cush it's something cush whatever I'll review those for you so I don't know if you guys have already had any problems with products like that like that [ __ ] was like bacon like [ __ ] that is terrifying so any out yeah what do you guys you know what do you think have you so if you guys are having that have then with your products just know that is not oh it's supposed to be and I'll do a quality control real quick I'm going to show you guys the quality control just so you know that it was not that banger okay so let's do this doing a comparison I'm almost done because I eat a heart that says old I'm gonna show him that it's it just is I don't know why all right for shits and giggles there's the 9 pound hammer shatter they made a little the beginning because there was still some on the end of that but there is no more now as you can see temperature for the same put two different products it and they did tell me it was not supposed to make this myself you guys are getting wax and it's making that noise in your rig please go return it that is not how it's supposed to sound I'm throwing that out there because that's not that's not that's not cool but like I said luckily they had no problems they corrected the situation but the [ __ ] flour I got was low THC go figure at least I'm glad that I got it so it is what it is so keep your eyes on your meds if you're unhappy with something do a little research call him up take it back I mean that that again kudos to them for rectifying luck to find situation that was awesome Oh quarry teams making me go [ __ ] nuts I hope you guys are doing okay and I think that's it we have made it to the end of the video so if you've made it all the way to the end of this video you are awesome go ahead and drop a like you can be a [ __ ] and drop a Dick's Lake and hit the bell to get notified when I post later [ __ ] but but but by qivana that she needs to go I'm just saying okay bye", "nEHRymKCAPM": "hey guys it's Melanie happy Sunday today I actually have a vendor wax haul to share with you guys I'm in full disclosure waxy dude did contact me on Instagram and asked me if he could send me some of his wax melts to be able to share my thoughts with you guys and what I really also appreciated is that he sent me a coupon code to be able to share with you guys and so I'm going to take you through the box of goodies that he packed for me which is amazing and by the way you've actually already heard me talk about waxy dude in the past because he has a dupe for and he tossed some in here for me where is it nutmeg and spice from Bath and Body Works where is it I was snooping through the box so I'll have to find it but yeah he has an incredible dupe for Bath & Body Works nutmeg and spice so if you are like me and you hate Bath & Body Works for never bringing that back sorry did you guys hear my dog sneeze if you miss that fragrance I'm telling you he does an incredible dupe of it his has a little bit more cinnamon than the Bath & Body Works version but it's so so similar anyway let's talk about the code that he provided for you guys so he sent me a nice little sheet of paper um so if you guys use the code Melanie so mal anie all capital letters you can get 15% off any order so whatever you guys have in your cart 15% off with that code which is awesome and it's not like Commission thing like I don't I don't get anything if you order it you know I'm very thankful that he sent me this stuff to try but I don't like get anything else so you guys know the promo will expire at 11:59 p.m. on Monday April 30th so make sure that you guys order in the next few weeks if you're interested in trying anything from waxy dude I'm also follow him on Instagram I will link his Instagram and down below and let's get into my way I'm so excited ma I've already sniffed a little bit okay so here we have cardamom and teak so this is one of his clam shells here and I did knock this box around a little bit while I was moving so some of the lake little designs and stuff got broken but that was totally my fault oh you guys this is a really beautiful scent this is not something that I will probably keep I think this one and there's a couple other ones that I know that my brother would absolutely love they're much more manly sense and cardamom and teak is a very masculine scent it's beautiful and if you are looking for just a really romantic slightly more masculine like bathroom type scent this would be amazing you guys I really get that like woody teak note and I also get a little bit of that cardamom um I will of course be melting these over the next few weeks and be sharing with you guys my thoughts in my weekly home fragrance roundup so do stay tuned for some reviews of these next is oriental tobacco which is another one that I think my brother would love tobacco scents are usually not my favorite this one is lighter it is a much lighter scent I also pick up a little bit of citrus in this one for some reason but there's also that like earthy like spicy type of note as well which is what I'm guessing that like oriental note is in here it's really nice but it's definitely a dude scent it is very much a dude sense so there's that frosted lemon squares I'm excited about this um it's so fresh and you know what I actually get a crust in this like a graham-cracker type of crust no but the lemon is not a lemon pledge cleaner scent at all it is very like fresh-squeezed sugary lemon it's really nice I cannot wait to warm this in fact I think this one is probably gonna be one of the first downstairs now I do want to cure these for just a couple more weeks before I actually start melting them but I'm gonna like start designating them to like their rooms where they're gonna melt and then in like another week or so I'm going to cuz these are like all pretty fresh pours so this one is he says melt after four or five so he may have actually already cured this I'm gonna try it if it's not strong enough for me I'll cure it for another couple weeks and then I'll come back to it um this one was poured 3 to 18 so this one's probably good this one's over a month old ooh this is downy April fresh just going in my laundry room this smells exactly like downy like the original downy oh that's good that's totally going in my laundry room so excited about that this is southern sheets this is another laundry scent that I loved when I open this I was like oh this is more of like a line dried fresh cotton type of scent this one's beautiful you guys and I love I love this type of bar where like you have to like chunk it up yourself I think it's nice to have these like individual serving sizes but I also kind of like the bars where you have to chunk them up yourself I just think it's fun to do that um so here's the nutmeg and spice here it is okay he totally tossed a couple of these in here for me because he knows that I love it you guys it's so it's so almost dead on it is so close the only thing is that there's just that hint of cinnamon that is it's almost just a touch too much cinnamon but it's so incredibly close I actually just went through all my candles and organized them and I found my remaining two nutmeg and spice and I compared it by side it's incredibly close to you guys so here I have Hawaiian pink hibiscus and then Jen's lavender caramels I haven't opened this one I want to have your caramel this smells mostly just like caramel to me no there's some lavender there totally is a little bit there is just that like tiny hint of lavender but it's more caramel and it's like a rich like creamy caramel that's actually pretty nice I don't normally like caramel too much that's this smells like Hawaii this smells like a tropical flower it's beautiful that's the name pink hibiscus right that's beautiful I really really like that one that's a nice floral so let's take a look at some of these different formats here so these are like kind of a larger scent shot so this one here is cotton candy mmm about this this one's it's cup it's pretty light but it does very much smell like a clean cotton kit like like a blue raspberry cotton candy not like the pink cotton candy like the blue raspberry I think I'm gonna keep this one for this room this one is blue cotton candy so funny I think that this once more smells like the blue raspberry cotton candy than this one does I take it out of here this one doesn't really smell like cotton candy to me it just smells like sweetness like sugary kind of generic sugary sweetness not like generic bad but just sugary sweetness I guess that cotton candy is fun shudder so there's that but anyway we have so many more to go through are there any other format okay how about the cute little shapes all of these little funnies they're so cute mom's peanut butter cookies yes totally smells like peanut butter cookies you guys that's good okay that's staying with me my brother's not getting that one oh that's good that's going in my kitchen uh tropical cake this smells like pina colada I don't get cake I smell pina colada I smell pineapple and I smell like coconut cream it's nice but I hope I get some cake when I'm warming it so that's going in the kitchen oh my he packed this box fool you guys this was super generous of him um peachy keen rose I don't know that I'm gonna have time to go through all these because this video is gonna be so long but peach and Rose that's amazing I would never think to put those two together oh you guys should try this okay if you place an order you need to try this that is phenomenal it's not old lady rose it's like fresh garden rose and like fresh juicy ripe peach one more blackberry Moss that's different that it's slightly masculine with that like green earthy moss eerie note and then there is a fruity it's a fruity berry note I don't know that it's blackberry necessarily but it is a fruity berry note that's really good these are also good so he also sent along tiki bar watermelon salad okay we have to smell this one this smells like a watermelon pina colada that's talk smells like it smells really good that's going in my kitchen kitchen pile um what else do we have here beach hut pie more nutmeg and spice oh I'm gonna have to board these for Christmas time okay put that in a special spot um rainforest sugarcane Billy's garden what does Billy's car Gilly what does your garden smell like Oh Billy's garden smells like green grass very like green fresh grass nice garden Billy Honolulu's son nutmeg inspired southern sheets and lilac gardens you guys look at this little like waffle thing here oh that's adorable whoo that's another that is another whoo that's going in my laundry where I wash my laundry room pile mom where are you where's my I don't know where my monitor room pilus did I miss this velvet macaroon how did I miss this this smells like almond cream Oh oh that's good that's going in the kitchen kitchen pile all you guys it just keeps going this is amazing thank you so much Billy Lemonheads is another one Cuban pals I bet this one it's like a cigar yep this smells like like a cigar that's that's one for my brother for sure he'll love that thing oh that's the door it's like a like a like a poop emoji MMG but pretty I guess it's a swirly so this one is lilac gardens and lemon verbena I only get that lemon verbena was just really nice that'll be actually great in the laundry room as well and let's weekend let's see is this a do it's totally a dupe you guys this smells exactly like back at Bath & Body Works endless weekend if you want and last weekend I would get that eucalyptus spearmint coconut banana cream pie okay we have to smell this sorry I was like I'm not gonna smell all these but I have to Oh oh that smells like that smells like banana cream pie I don't get much coconut but I get like pure banana cream pie with the crust at the bottom Oh oh that's good okay look how pretty this is oh my gosh Billy you were like way too generous this is amazing um the spring flower stroll and then this magic Tiki look how massive this bar is like this is gonna be so many melts I have to sell this one oh that's really pretty it's very fresh but also perfumey at the same time and maybe a hint of like masculine like tobacco type note that's really different I've never smelled anything like this if you're looking for something totally unique I have never smelled anything like this magic Tiki it's really nice so I'm excited to chop that up so that is everything that Billy sent to me you guys this is amazing of him to share these with me and again I'm going to get to melting these I think most of them are probably actually ready to go because he has to pour date or the melt after date on each label which is really nice so he must have already poured these and cured them so the ones that say that they're ready to go I'm gonna just go ahead and try them and then I will be sure to let you guys know starting next week how the melting is going so thank you so much to waxey dude for sending these for consideration and again you guys the code is just Melanie and I will put the link to his Instagram page and then also his website down below so check him out thank you so much for the coat because that's awesome for you guys to be able to get a little bit of a discount so let me know if you have any questions thank you again Billy and I will see you guys tomorrow take care fight", "1QDfdLybcCo": "[Music] hey everybody sold check it out for today's video I'm going to be trying this Jesus oh gee by dab society here and this is a pho sugar wax coming in at 63 percent THC with no CBD and it's got 10% terpenes overall terpene content in it at 10% so that's gonna be good I love those terpenes god bless those terpenes anyway we're gonna go ahead and open this this right here this product was cultivated meaning that the farm who grew the bud by pilot farms okay so cultivated by pilot farms and go ahead an easy to open package I might say pretty easy got your little you know information sheet and then here we go BAM got our little glass container with our sugar wax in it and I have a problem sometimes the glass containers just because you know you sometimes you can't get every last little bit you know I have a way around that though so if you're someone who's got sugar wax in a glass container like this you can get a straw like you drink with like a drinking straw and you can get down in there on the sides and everywhere and get the rest of the dabs that you left behind so use a straw get all your dabs don't leave no gap behind all right I'm gonna smell it for the first time so here we go oh man oh that smells good oh oh I believe I believe the terpene content now I believe that like that is pungent all right I'm really excited I'm gonna show you guys there again just kind of what it looks like overall let me know what you're smoking on today in the comment section below on this video again this is the Jesus oh gee by DAB Society shout out to dab society that's good now this is an Oregon product by the way so if you ever come to Oregon or if you are here in Oregon you should check out this product let me know what you think anyway so let's go ahead and take a dab of this let's take like a good sized amethyst you guys ready all right got a nice sized app here of this sugar wax I'm ready to try this I am so ready for this all right the rig I'm using today it's gonna be by Empire glass work so it's a nice UV forest rig got some mushrooms and all kinds of cool stuff in there man then we got the tur pearls in the banger right there highly recommend these tur pearls and something tur P is this this is gonna go great with these pearls man who can't wait so I'm just waiting for this to cool down here to the right temperature don't want to be taking a hot dab especially with something as Turkey as this you want to taste those terpenes so we want to get it at a nice low temp I don't want it for me personally everybody has their own me personally I don't like it getting too low I don't like it puddling up and leaving a puddle behind but you know all right much love guys this one's for you guys Jesus Oh G [Music] Wow Wow you get like a super lemony almost like a super lemony earthy taste that's really good [Music] all right thank you uh I think we can reheat that just a little bit I think we can get away with the reheat there just a little bit so 1 2 3 4 & 5 [Music] [Music] man that's really good it's really good I really enjoy that maybe that tastes phenomenal but then again it is sugar wax and most sugar waxes taste really really good most sugar waxes have a high terpene content so you can't really go wrong the only thing with sugar rat wax for like me per se is that I take you know good moderate sized abs you know so it doesn't last long you know I'll be through that within you know probably tomorrow you know what I mean so the only thing with sugar wax that's like ah you know I can make a gram of snap and pull or shatter last longer than sugar wax so yeah anyway super dope break shout-out Empire Glass Works and man Jesus og I really like this product I really enjoyed it it's been a while since I've had dab society and the last product that I actually had from dab Society I was not too impressed with but um it was a while ago I believe it was like back in 2016 but wasn't that pressed with so I kind of you know stayed clear a little bit for a while there and now I'm kind of like damn I've been missing out like this ear wax is really good I really enjoy it and at that price point at $24 a gram for rec again like 20 to 18 dollars for medical depending on what dispensary you get it from and that is a great price point for this something like this it's got some good test results with it the terpene content is really high and you can definitely taste it in this product you can definitely taste everything that they listed here on their terpene content on the back here you can definitely taste okay you can definitely even just even if it's just a mild taste hint of it you still get it so that's awesome I love when a company does that and I love when a company displays their terpene results on their packaging because that's always a good thing to know you know what I mean especially for something that's packaged you can't smell open it up anything like that before you buy it so it's really good to know your terpene content especially for dabs that's like always my kind of look to to on packages you know what I mean I look ok terpenes alright alright terpenes good Terps alright we're good to go so much love guys I hope you guys have a good one please give some love to dab Society they make some good product as you guys can see here on this video

really soon so much love guys thank you for following my channel and you guys are all awesome [Music]", "YtaftNQkt-k": "hey everyone welcome to No [Music] hey everyone welcome back to my channel or welcome to my channel if you're new at my name's Ashley I hope you're having a wonderful day or night or whatever time it is when you're watching this I hope it's going great today is a new day what's the date a is June 9 it's a Sunday and I am on my way to sugared and bronzed in I think it's in Beverly Hills it's like right by the Grove and I am going to get a full Brazilian sugar wax the only thing I've gotten waxed is my eyebrows and even that I don't like I maybe go twice a year because I have my eyebrows filled in right now but normally my eyebrow hair is blonde so you can't really see it anyways but when I shave down there you know I get razor burn all the time and it's really annoying I just switched to a safety razor which to it to benefit the environment so I got rid of my plastic razor and my new one should be coming in the mail hopefully today my safety razor but since that is a new razor and it's kind of hard to adjust to and then also I'm really scared I'm gonna like cut I don't mind cutting my legs but like other parts of me I really don't want cut and so I figured I should try something different kind of skeptical about laser hair removal so I figured sugaring was a good option because it's not as painful as waxing hopefully and it's not lasering and I not going to cut myself by shaving so I'm gonna bring you all along with me and we'll see how this goes alright I'll see you there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay let's go I'm gonna spill the Starbucks mango dragon fruit refresher instead of the team about sugared and bronzed though I just got back from my first appointment at shirt and bronzed I got a full Brazilian it was well first of all okay so it's really clean there and the people who work there are super nice they didn't make me feel weird it wasn't like uncomfortable at all they were really nice but as I said before I've never gotten like waxed or anything I typically just like shave down there and everywhere else but since I switched my razor I wanna try sugaring yeah I already said that okay focus you walk in there like hi they greet you since it was my first appointment I had to fill out a I don't know just like an information sheet like you understand all of the risks and stuff like that went with a woman named Tori she basically I walked into the room and she was like okay here's like this wife if you want to use it and here's a towel to like cover yourself with and just lay your clothes like on this thing in the corner like okay cool so I got undressed I used the wipe just in case not that it smells but you know just in case because I never had anybody all up in my private areas and this is oh yeah definitely it's just to be safe what else did I do put the towel over my area which like I get it but it was gonna be off the majority of the time anyway so I guess that wasn't really necessary I don't want to be like here it is and then she kind of let me know that like the first one or two sessions is the most painful especially since I've been shaving basically just because like when you shave it makes your hair courser and that sort of makes it workforce and then also like you start growing multiple hairs per follicle which is how you get like ingrown hairs she was explaining the whole thing to me I was like wow this is super interesting I didn't know any of that she started on my right outer side just so I could kind of get a feel of how it was gonna feel even though that was not the most painful part going on I think they go against the hair that's how I feel like they go against their hair but then when they pull it it goes down the hair so it's the sticky substance going against make your hair growth and so that that in itself hurts and there's like pressure like they put pressure on it obviously so that part hurts and then when they rip it off it doesn't hurt as bad because it already hurt going on which is way different than waxing because waxing kind of feels like good going on because it's like warm and it's just like smooth and then they rip it off in this little Bowl so yeah I kind of liked that I like that it was like painful for the majority of the time if that makes sense it was really really painful because it was my first time and then she got to some like more sensitive areas and that really hurt I recorded a little bit of my reaction which you saw but then I had to stop recording because it was hurting so badly that I was I literally just recorded like the first part like the first like three poles maybe but it was hurting so badly that I was like okay I just need to focus on this I need to like not worry about filming so sorry for the lack of sugar and content like this weirdest thing because so I was sitting there I was like this hurts I want it to stop but then I had to keep reminding myself a gear Pig to get this done you came here you wanted this been like you can't even be mad about it and so I was trying to remember that while also being in pain and then some parts were like so sensitive that my legs were just like closing naturally because it was it's like I just wanted her out of there I was like okay so really nice she did the part that would be like a bikini wax first so just like around the edges and she was like okay this part would be a bikini wax and we could stop here if you'd like if it's like too painful or some things like no I came here feel a full thing I'm committed let's just do it she kept going but I thought it was nice that she like stopped and asked he's really nice she was talking to me she actually asked about like my youtube channel and genuinely seemed interested which was really nice for watching this hi thank you for making me soft doing things to distract me I don't think she's purposely doing it to distract me but it was working to distract me and then also she was letting me know like this is a really sensitive area so like take a deep breath cuz I was kind of forgetting to breathe during part of it and I'm just trying to see like purple spots I was like oh my god I'm gonna like pass out because uh it hurt that that was painful I think waxing would have hurt a lot more though cuz I can't even like get my eyebrows waxed oh my god what is that noise the whole session was twenty minutes so it wasn't too bad but at some point I started like sweating so badly like not not just like my armpits or something but my hands my hands have never sweat and my hands were like way I don't know if I was like nervous I think it was cause like my adrenaline was pumping I was trying to calm myself down but yeah that it was really painful so I advise you to be aware of that if you're going for your first time they had a special going on like a new client special and so basically I paid for this session and then my second session was gonna be free oh she also at the end I didn't know that this was part of it but she was like oh do I mean do your back side too like my like butt crack but that part was gonna be painful because I've cut myself back there and the back hurts a lot yeah that part actually didn't hurt too bad there was a one spot that kind of hurt but for the most part that part didn't hurt too bad she was saying that a lot of her customers like cuss at her or I honestly had some points like my leg I could feel it like wanted to like really act and like kick her but I didn't I like held it down so my legs were like shaking because I was trying to hold them down but also because it was hurting really nice because basically it hurts for like the 20 minutes that you're doing it and right after I left it not hurt at all which I feel like with waxing it hurts for at least when I get my eyebrows waxed like it hurts for the rest of the day I don't know how I'm just really sensitive or what overall they were all super nice especially Tori who did my Brazilian and the facility was super clean and I mean it's pretty reasonably priced it's sugaring in general is just like better for the environment because you're not shaving and so you're not like throwing out like the plastic razor heads and then also it just not like harmful chemicals like waxing is as you go along your hair gets like thin or finer I don't know if it's thinner and with the differences she was saying that it gets finer and so it gets easier as you go along I think I'm I mean I'm definitely gonna go back for a second one in a few weeks and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna keep going because I like it a lot more than shaving I don't feel like I'm gonna have like razor bumps err and obviously I can fear bumps cleaning is a razor but I feel like I'm not gonna have like ingrown hairs none of that hopefully fingers crossed I'm glad I did it and I'm glad I'm going to probably hopefully keep doing it I'm glad I went with sugared and bronzed also and that specific location I'm sure all the locations are like super great al for a whole bunch of other services which like maybe I'll get some other stuff sugared at some point but for now just the Brazilian I'll just take it one step at a time that was my experience getting sugared I hope you all enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching let me know that you like this video by pressing the like button or press the like button if you also enjoy getting sugared or if you like sugared and bronzed if you get other services there I don't know like tanning or something I'll see you all in my next video subscribe if you want to see more from me or if not then that's fine - I can't make you do what you don't want to do see you all my next video bye", "ai4YIZQKX3k": "what's up guys today we're doing a review on uh this is orange skittles from uh sticky frog this is a terp sugar live resin looks like we got 73.16 on total cannabinoids and 6.66 on terps that can't be good definitely smell some orange definitely some gas smells like orange gas um real crystally looking too real sparkly that stuff sparkle to it yeah it's pretty hard there's some uh flat pieces in here which is nice very orange too in color all right let's fire it up this is a cross between agent orange and was it agent orange and skittles orange skittles it's real dry it's not wet it's real dry all righty it's a real dry product like that i move the banger around like that it kind of hops around it doesn't really stay in the middle some of the other products like gems and juice or the cake icing it stays right where you put it me wow really nice flavor let me taste the orange mostly gas though this is a very chronic chronic flavor very tasty very smooth too very nice i'm actually kind of impressed usually when the products dry like that it can be a little bit harsher so very nice all cleaned up in the banger very nice nice product that was my first rip of the day too oh my heart racing a little bit so it's a hybrid it's probably a sativa leaning hybrid though cool eyes getting heavy yes sir all right loving it sunday morning dabs that was sticky frog orange skittles give it a 8 out of 10. nice product", "vwf4bpSzZGA": "[Music] then [Music] what's up everyone it's your boy p2 peeps and today we're going to be checking out beazle's uh tropia sorry i kind of forgot what it was gonna be and uh real quick before i show you all anything else i just wanna show you guys this man so this is i mean this is the product but this is the one of the parts of the board that my uh [ __ ] lovely girlfriend gifted me uh it's from rosineer and pretty much it came with the this is the other side of the board the lighter it didn't come with but look at that guys look at all that all these tools here's a a glass compartment to put you know wax and stuff in i decided to just go ahead and put a little cleaning alcohol in there for myself and then it came with this silicone um container as well but yeah it's really awesome tray shout out my girlfriend i guess shout out roz and here you know finally i now have my own official uh dab tray not just using the some wooden cutting board that i put stickers on called it the dev kudu board but this is the new dab kuduri board and yeah so before we get started here let's go ahead and show you i mean you guys just saw it but i want to show you guys again off the osmo's camera how that chopiah looks in that direct sunlight man so hopefully this focuses in there we go yeah it took a while to focus in but yeah this is live resin sugar i thought it was sauce it is sugar um it doesn't look too much like sugar though it looks more like a blob of sauce that just hardened up and uh you know with this one this bezel product we are working with about 73 total milligrams of uh wait milligrams sorry 73 total thc yeah this one doesn't have cannabinoid percentage on it much like a lot of things uh that we kind of see in the store in cali and that's unfortunate but it is what it is tropia is a cross between tropicana cookies and papaya and you know you guys know me i'm really i've been really digging the papaya strain and just the genetics of it so i'm really enjoying this one as well so i'm gonna go ahead and get this hit packed up and i hope you guys can join me on this one man here we go just gonna show you guys the slab of the dab we're gonna take right there we're using the little field dab tool but there's that little speckle that we're gonna go dab maybe not too maybe not little but you know so i got my head ready to go it's all packed up in there heating it up as we speak i hope you guys can join me on this one hope you got something packed up ready to roll ready to smoke ready to heat up whatever it may be and uh on another note i hope you guys are enjoying your days today man i know the days have been kind of rough for a lot of people in the years but you know all we can open is just you know for things to keep getting better cheers everyone [Music] oh [Music] oh sheesh all right i just had to hold up the window but since we got our first rip off the divine tribe v4 and that sick cup uh you know for those who are wondering that what's the device uh we're getting that full flavor you know especially with the sit cup and what i'm tasting here okay i don't know if i can uh pick out the terps directly myself because um sometimes i ain't gonna lie i still i still get the names mixed up but i'm getting a lot of that i'm getting tang i'm getting sweetness i'm getting a little uh a tiny tiny bit of spicy kind of pepperiness not not too much um and uh maybe maybe a little pininess on that too yeah so uh the thing that stands out the most to me i feel like is the papaya itself within this strain i don't really taste much of the tropicana cookies you know i get a little tang from them but not not too much this papaya though is is standing out really really strong so the smell off this i know i didn't talk about that much which i normally do but it smelled fantastic and it smells a lot like papaya just the strain papaya and you already know the strain papaya especially in its wax form kind of smells like the fruit papaya so you get if you get good you know strained papaya then you would know because it has that kind of kind of slight funky papaya smell to it and it kind of has that taste there too in this tropius strain but that's about all i'm picking up in terms of the you know that flavor profile here's a little look at it again but it tastes really nice i'm rocking with the flavor and i'm rocking with the potency too here you know 72 thc like i said uh earlier in the beginning and you know it's not always you know the main factor like i talked about a lot in these videos guys you want cannabinoid percentage more uh on the box you know if you can see it that's a lot better for you um to know whether you know how much more is going to get you then thc percentage would uh so yeah i'm assuming that this is around at least the 75 to 78 cannabinoid percentage range you know maybe even a little bit higher but it is it is very nice i really like the high this is an indica dominant hybrid so you know you should kind of know what to expect when you're coming in coming in and looking at these but of course all strains are different even though it is an indica dominant hybrid it could hit a little bit differently this is one of those cases it kind of has like a sativa kind of uh set on i guess you could say um i i feel like that might be slightly from uh maybe i mean you know it's probably from some parts of the genes of both the papaya and the tropicana cookies so yeah we're going to take one more hit here guys um before you know we jet out of here and i hope you all can join me man and if you've been watching up to this point please don't forget to hit that like drop a little comment for your boy let me know what you are smoking on and what you think of the you know strained papaya or genetics papaya and uh don't forget to hit that you know little notification bell if you don't have that already on and subscribe if you haven't already so i'm gonna go ahead and pack up another rip i hope you guys can uh you know scroll down over and grab pack one up two and join me for this next one and here is the hit that we are going to be rocking with on this next one all right got that packed in cap that up let's go hope you guys can join me on this one man i'm gonna go ahead and get this you know heated up but my closing thoughts on this you know is a quick review i guess you could say because well i don't really have too many uh gripes with this at all i really like this thing and i'm really enjoying it i i find like i'm getting tongue tied but i can find myself you know maybe grabbing this once or two more times man cheers y'all [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] still a little bit more in there one thing guys okay so my closing thoughts on this one guys just to kind of wrap things up really fruity taste really really kind of nice fruity taste there tastes a lot like papaya the strain and you know on the terp level smell and very very nice little funky sweet tangy and i like that man you know sometimes you know sometimes you you gotta like that little funk that no you don't say sometimes you want that in some flowers or some wheat products because i mean that's how it is sometimes you know people like that skunky skunky sometimes man that's that's just some preferences me it depends how it is this is definitely a real nice one though and um yeah guys so that about wraps up the video thank you guys

Terps Terpening three point three six five percent sixty five dollars eighty dollars a gram let's go ah next one next one next one what else we got here that's pretty high itself 3.36 right and then we're gonna get out beta Merce is coming to 0.55 I'm looking to see if I doesn't miss I miss when you're going fast right point three eight point three seven point three four so we're all right there with the pine the lime and the car 65 bucks so after my discount tariff either it's 59 58 58 bucks okay I'm not going to complain about that we have Auto Burke bought this at let's say beyond hello Westchester it would have only been like 50 what is a 65 so 1313 right it'll be like 50 no that's not right secondly do them 65 - 13 yeah 52 right that right yeah that's right 50 bucks right we'll

that for that I really am NOT I just it's just not cool you know it's just not cool I don't know that's just my personal opinion if you're gonna do that like you should charge yeah if you're gonna if you're going to consistently have concentrates and the the percent on the concentrate right that's right with me and the percent on that concentrate on the Terps is average between 5 and 11 or 10 percent you can't go drop something with 1 percent and then expect everybody to jump right on it be like ah you need to come out with cured need to come out with cured stuff but like 40 50 percent

good for that temperature man we gotta watch it for me it's like 650 I'm cool step on it I call you know 6 to 650 I don't call 650 700 I'm coughing you know love Cresco love it recommend it to anybody I mean 65 hours for life when other companies are charging 70 80 [ __ ] 120 yeah I mean 100 I just wonder who's gonna be the first I've been saying who's gonna be the first $50 live gram who oh it's gonna be angry kind probably not maybe to bribe me Cresco they've been straight for 65 bucks and then they had their little issue right we all know what the issue was the issue was the grow we didn't have enough room for growth PA put the cart before the horse and they approve more more conditions right while find conditions and medical conditions and they didn't let the growers expand the grow square footage is simple math let's say you have one plant per patient and then they're only allowed to grow thousand plants so they can we have a thousand patients but then if you not that number to 2004 whatever you have to up that square footage and they didn't do it like they needed to give them the square footage ahead of time so if they're having a thousand plants a thousand patients right and not like yo we're gonna we're gonna approve these conditions you need to give me you need to give me at least at least 120 days advance so I can start growing you know start to finish get er done right four months get set up right get it right get it get it good and I feel like they just approve the conditions and didn't let them do that and they just now I mean we know this they just now in January lifted to grow as much as you want just [ __ ] new cares and that's the answer it's the only answer I have to be honest with you absolutely the only answer is that so my point is they've always been 65 bucks man and I've I've rode with Cresco and Terrapin since day one and and all the other companies came out I just stayed with them and it's not just the price right okay well I go to moxie I like moxie I'll go to moxie it's the quality okay look perfect example they're charging this is $75 a grand cuz 150 bucks for this is two grams but is usually 80 bucks a gram okay 80 bucks a gram now I'm gonna read these numbers off to you all right I'm just gonna give you a side-by-side comparison okay a 65 bucks a gram 80 bucks a gram all right we'll read these numbers I'm hitting both live okay now this was produced on 327 okay these are both bought yesterday by the way and this one was produced on give me a second 225 so a month apart and why is this a month older than this one okay the date was a lot for what is it I don't know Easter's on Sunday that's all I know all right the THC let's go to cannabinoids here THC on this one is 0.3 damn candy [ __ ] you can carry on your tongue THC a huh on the on the moon rise of GTI is 89.7 the THC sorry THC on this one is 0.3 the THC rather spraying like chemicals and [ __ ] man holy [ __ ] they literally just lit up lit up my backyard chemicals brow duh [ __ ] trying to trying to get ahead of the Chinese [ __ ] lantern flies or diverge at whatever [ __ ] there alright so right there for me it was produced a month earlier okay sooner right closer to the date of purchase and the THC is higher and the price point 65 this is a newer product and the THC is 1.15 so so far this is running winning three rounds okay THC a of suicide by side comparison 89.7 mmm 81 okay so there you go so we're three points to one point okay let's see here now the total cannabinoids on on this one is 91 and on this one is 81 383 okay so this one wins mmm so three to two okay um let's just go we can go top top 2% will go on this first top 2% top 2% on this is 0.7 mercy top turf on this one is 3.3 percent typically clear win okay alright so now we're at 42 right or no we're at work 5 to 3 sorry 5 to 3 and then let's see here total Terps on this one is that like 5 like 5% quick math and this one's 1.1 percent alright so you know that's really it that's it this is a [ __ ] win like this always will win out like so for me that's how I listen that's how I compare it well what else is it strain strain aside take the [ __ ] strain alright now look at it right look at this I'm gonna spread this out spread it out I'm [ __ ] on okay yeah let's do one more I'm on like I'm like the only thing is if you have anxiety you will not [ __ ] with this one do not [ __ ] with this one not in the dab you can [ __ ] listen you can [ __ ] with live skunk if you if you get in a cart or it has a higher CBG or CBG a okay my personal opinion CBG cpg a needs to be looked at as also an anti-anxiety medicine absolutely curbed my anxiety but this will give you anxiety in this form I know 100% there sugar sketches me out see my igniter I'm I have to I had to give him a jump start oh not bad for a year old right literally use a thing probably ten times a day like that so legit Cheers so good right so good so good it's so good so good so good so good so good so good so good I wonder if I understand something there's a need for me for Terps and this okay but also have a need for just cheaper THC like cheaper stuff because I want to make strain-specific edibles but I don't want to have to pay [ __ ] $55 that's where I need me a $20 booster right that's why I need me $20 poo now 13 $10 poop I need me $10 poop all day all day cuz it's Eddie's Eddie's you know that's that's my thing and so like I do know that you know there is a lot of talk about here in PA we're paying a lot and we are you know we really do and it's it's it's just that my only complaint is it's gonna continue to be that we don't have a selection we don't have a various like all right so you know other than expections for everything right we almost of us know about the spectrum for autism and and you know you can if you can really take okay so like you know there's there's there's levels right there's like a little bit to a lot con if you want to think of like an empty tank right like look at your gas tank gauge and it goes from e to the full right and E to fool to say there's two hours this is a fool is it but it's it's in a semi-circle alright so picture your semicircle in your head okay now that's we're just gonna go ahead and put that as like this is like a generic version of a spectrum okay so picture a semicircle so you got your semicircle and your semi circles popping alright you're like yeah I'm a semicircle boom now look at that now you take a semicircle okay take this half this [ __ ] circle right here [ __ ] circle right here take this [ __ ] circle right here yeah yeah yeah you know if everybody didn't get their goddamn panties in a bunch I just really beat me all the way that's good semicircle okay boom Oman n you got zero on the other end you got a hundred and twenty okay and I'm talking about this should be the you know obviously free to a hundred and twenty this is our concentrate level we're right here we're actually like this actually 120 s yeah so yeah we're right here okay this is where our spectrum starts at our spectrum starts at a smidge past the middle at 55 degrees 55 dollars right so your gauge like if this is your gauge and you're half so this would be 60 bucks right ours is right here 55 to 120 55 is the end 120 we don't have words worth fifty where's 45 verse 40 verse you know 35 30 20 10 zero where they at we don't have and that that is the [ __ ] problem in PA that we don't have a spectrum of prices we don't have a selection of prices so that to me just let's say let's let should'a everybody know you know and another example Alera prism is Alerus prism to Alera is what double bear is to Terrapin they're the extractors it's just a sister company or whatever they call it these days that said this stuff used to be 60 bucks it was 80 for a long time then it went down to 16 ounce back up to 80 does anybody remember because I remember when I reviewed it when I went down to 60 finally and then I bought it with my discount and then I only paid like 50 something bugs yep New York diesel go look at if you don't believe me hmm that's number that pretty sure it was 60 bucks huh same thing with standard farms why you've never seen me review stick yeah we're standard pharmacist concentrate that it's all in oil it's all on cards all carts right where's the product set anyway I can bash everybody I can plant the flaws but mmm this is what we do as humans I know I don't really particularly want to point out the good stuff that you know people are doing because that's just you know that's what I do every day so I'm gonna sit here and a car I'm always praising people always man like I give credit mmm Big Ups yeah I mean like for real bang it be honestly a lot of this should suddenly get ridiculous we're in the middle of a pandemic some people aren't gonna get money for like months that's the thing like a lot of hate and discontent is gonna happen you're gonna see a lot of people getting stuff being like damn yeah how come they got theirs but I didn't get mine yet the [ __ ] how's that fair see just because the government has a rationalization doesn't mean that every citizen you know shares that and it's that the government's always gonna pay the people who worked first obviously if you don't realize that then I'm sorry for you I feel sorry for you because we're the ones who [ __ ] put pay money I work I pay taxes so if I work I have a job I pay taxes my entire [ __ ] life okay my entire life I've worked paid taxes since Alice 13 I think I think in 93 is my first reported wage so I've been legally paying taxes since I was 13 maybe 14 it might have been 14 you have to don't you know I think I'm not even 14 but I worked at McDonald's in my first legal job taxes so I've been paying into Social Security since 94 right so what's that almost 30 years almost 26 years I've been paying taxes and all that and I see a lot of these people bitching who aren't even [ __ ] 26 by the way about their money that they're gonna get that it's not fair that everybody gets it first yeah well I'm telling you right now at 39 years old I've been paying taxes for 26 of those 39 years so you know the first 13 years that was cool and after that I've been paying they've been paying the government to live in this country that's how you that's just the only way to look at it you pay for the luxuries that you get if you don't want those [ __ ] luxuries then don't go work don't pay you know that's just I know it's [ __ ] up but I don't think I didn't think of it then I just was like I just want to [ __ ] here's how it was for me yeah you want some [ __ ] go work for and there wasn't no selling drugs in my area and I know that that's a lot of people's like only option because I've met those people you can say what you want but until you absolutely meet somebody whose only choice is to sell drugs because that's the legit hit and I mean that by like everybody they know sells drugs around and that's all they do it's like a family business well no [ __ ] that's what they're gonna do you know come to [ __ ] off your high horse so the thing that really [ __ ] me up is this like I understand I can definitely put myself in the position to analyze their arguments and try to try to I cannot do it but try to look through their eyes like dude that's [ __ ] up like just because of X Y & Z and I just look at it and that was tough this person I've had these conversations about these exact same things similar situations nobody's ever got instant let's check like this cuz the government shut down but in prison like but broad like when you were 18 and you realize that this [ __ ] was wrong or whatever like at some point you rise it was wrong because you told me this yeah bro I know it's wrong with this all I know but I'm saying like you didn't want to try something else so that's where the excuse for me is is it see once you realize something's wrong in your situation you don't do anything you change it you're now wrong you are now just as wrong as the situation you are in because you could change it like I say you're working a job let's say in this example I'm just on the corner or whatever I'm hustling for my dad right boom alright for a town I have an eight-hour shift because I visit legit they've run shifts eight-hour shift alright you're on the block whatever your shift is from [ __ ] 7:00 to 3:00 do you run like a legit job alright thing is you don't get a lunch break you don't get none of that you're on that block eight hours straight and that's that I run that concept in my business motto but you know the government has rules so they don't there passes for a straight up eight hours on your feet no breaks yeah you might [ __ ] around look at your phone maybe my [ __ ] around smokes cigarettes maybe getting stoned whatever but you're on that block [ __ ] honestly all right boom so you're out there seven two three now you're telling me once your eyes is wrong like damn I can't wait to get the [ __ ] off this block is [ __ ] out I can't be doing this and as soon as you get off the block what are you doing the better your situation hey man you man stop what are you doing I'm not saying you had to go to college but I'm saying like what are you doing what would you do after work tell me oh man cannot go see my girl whatever get some [ __ ] okay man all right besides the eye again like what else [ __ ] man you know take shower get something to eat [ __ ] go out stop right there what basic [ __ ] come take shower eat go out go out after work every day is not basic [ __ ] man [ __ ] work bit I get it it sucks you just said it you know it's wrong so instead of going out why don't you next time write the worm prison I'm talking about this next time when you go home do the same [ __ ] cuz I get it it's just a lot of these dudes they go right back to doing the same [ __ ] cuz you know that's all they can and I'm trying to tell this like so y'all instead of doing that when you go out go home take a shower read a [ __ ] book man learn a trade dude take some classes online and write this is coming from a guy who never knew you could do any of this shag to see it on TV all right I was in jail for all those crazy things I didn't I missed all that online college all that [ __ ] that [ __ ] was like just starting up when I got booked locked up in 2010 so I'm trying I mean you know you don't know how are you right true now I do so if anybody wants me who I had conversation with in prison listen I'm telling you right now all that [ __ ] after I come home take a shower is [ __ ] come home take shower you [ __ ] get that [ __ ] nose and get that knowledge better yourself because like I said if not you're just bitching and you just fall right in the suit so now once you realize it and you have the means like what the [ __ ] if you got enough money to go out every night to the [ __ ] bar or whatever you know do your thing and whatever the [ __ ] that means you know I'm not judging anybody I don't give a [ __ ] what you do but don't [ __ ] at me when I'm like well there's a [ __ ] flaw in your whole [ __ ] thinking man sir I know it is like and and the other thing is don't like don't try to talk to me like I haven't gone through the worst to ever like I've been through probably I won't say the worst but I've been through probably 90% of people on earth have had it better than me maybe maybe eighty back is on the earth in America you know if you were born here and I'm not saying cuz I can't say immigrant cuz that [ __ ] mother [ __ ] walk in three thousand four five thousand miles to get to America just to go work for some bum [ __ ] [ __ ] waging and live in a house with thirty people because you don't make enough money to pay the rent it like cuz you said go [ __ ] I'm not talking about then they're different breed I'm talking about if you were just born here like me just boom your parents [ __ ] how came you ten months later welcome to earth [ __ ] there it is and then thirteen years later when you had the opportunity to get a job just like I did hmm now I get it okay well I had to go work the block alright cool so you work a block until you legally are not allowed you don't have to you can change that once you realize I started going out at what sixteen seventeen yeah man you know [ __ ] go to bar go to this go to that [ __ ] you know chase [ __ ] whatever hang out my dudes I get all that man and I'm not saying thing but come on man and that's the thing is like a lot of people just don't have that person me in this situation telling them like oh you know usually just change it calling them on their [ __ ] cuz there's a lot of [ __ ] in America and it will just I see it real big in the society yeah we enable people and their [ __ ] because most people don't want to they don't want confrontation so it doesn't right with whatever anybody says like oh yeah like yeah after work that's cool right yeah that's cool bro go ahead man you served in Boston Steen whatever people just yeah it's called rocking you to sleep man they just tell you whatever it is man just to get you just shut the [ __ ] up [ __ ] that man I'm gonna tell you the [ __ ] that you need to hear like the truth right it's not nothing that anymore I don't know there it is man a little sample of how [ __ ] crazy Lyme skull can get have a good day", "8iADEmVjckM": "this rolling up to blue marlin is certified by hey smoking on one of my night table that's super flavor let me put it on spindle like we're gonna be looking at some CBD shatter so without further ado let's jump to the close up get to the review all right Burke that was get some little bird emojis clapping in the comment section as we get ready to review this CBD product right here they were looking at this CED shatter and it's this Sour Diesel this comes from [Music] it is 99.6% CBD zero THC so this right here will not get you heart but it's another way to the CBD and at ninety nine point six percent is pretty pure let's open this up until you see what this looks like all right bird club just right here it's our diesel shatter [Music] pretty solid form right there that's all CBD trichomes we're going to take the little piece of this off put it in this woken disposable little atomizer you get a nice little pure taste of it let's see what it tastes like I'm the CBB so if you know anything about CBD is very helpful to your aunt a bernoulli system um there's many blocks how you about it so if you don't know I suggest you read it up CBD is really good for you um and this is just a doubt the weight to the stump so everyone to break a little pieces off put it in the atomizer see what it tastes like now to get some of this now tell you the truth I've seen cocaine looks like this I don't believe it's not the same consistency or texture as THC oh Shannon like like that turns sticky again after a minute this isn't turning sticky screw statement I'm gonna just break a piece off they were pretty disruptive see with taste they break grace apart real easy vambrace for it real easy that's a decent sized piece of God right there so won't take for this Sour Diesel see me deep-sea um they got actually Sour Diesel taste too [Music] [Music] God is slinging real [ __ ] I got Josh no that was a little harsh [Music] [Music] that's not easy to do that's not you know there's a nice taste to it it doesn't doesn't have a lot of the terpenes or the marijuana taste to it it's very like um vegetable Ike him um yeah I don't know that there's enough Sour Diesel terpenes in here you do pick up a little bit of the taste on the aftertaste but not really funny inhale again it may just be the way down assuming it was just atomizer maybe it's heating up too hot can you do is try to smear someone this blood see if I can get get it the cold like that rate being so stable it's gonna be kind of hard to get it on here let's try it out so what I did was set it on its supply right here see sterling now they melt it utterly down in round black it's just smoke it's having a very uh MP flavor and set air and to smoke [Music] it's not it's not bad way to consume CPD's I'm sure we're using a regular dad break you can probably get better hit soft but um I want some if we use them to be clean break it down inside of my butt so the very next Rock will do what I'm gonna do please I'm gonna add some CBD flour some of the CBD shatter home some regular dance it's a rather explain minute put it together see how that smoke where the without um I will say this put a link in the description for um techne website out they got they got a couple of different uh strains in this um if you're into you the CBD again this is a different way to ingest it also if you're using their a this is another link do it to that to the Marley I'm out burka [Music] really by flowing away

somewhere where medical marijuana and/or marijuana are illegal do not try this at home sup guys chefs here a chef's calm put together another concentrate review for you I'm looking at some killer concentrates nug run lazy OG shatter lazy is going to be a good hybrid I'm guessing probably 60% indica 40% sativa depending on how much food I have on my in my stomach it hits me either way if I have an empty stomach its first thing in the morning and I haven't eaten breakfast or anything like that and I take a big fat gap with a lazy eye hypnotic a sativa a very energetic very talkative dry mouth right away if I eat a big meal like if I have a huge dinner and then dab some lazy right after dinner it's a completely opposite effect the way it hits me is more lethargic more relaxing more completely indica like my head would get very very numb and relaxed my body gets really relaxed my eyes get real heavy and red right away so for me it's a true hybrid that hits me either way just kind of you know depending on what I have in my belly as far as looks go it doesn't get much better I mean it's crystal clear yellow gold very very pliable very workable - some people would call this a SAP instead of a shatter but it's definitely a shadow I've had this piece you know maybe to my fingers here so it's a little bit warm but even with its warmth it pulls right apart like that as you can see the smell it is pretty unique - lazy it's very spicy I'm picking up a little super Silver Haze in there it's really nice the taste with a the the smell comes through into taste a lot of times that's not the case but with the Lazy what you smell is what you get a nice clean piece with some cold water and the flavor is unbeatable an average sized dab is all you need with the Lazy I'm not really feeling the need to take big giant globs in order to get nice and high the the THC level is high enough that just you know an average-size the app puts you right where you need to be let's get right into this Cheers [Applause] then they'll just ate up that Deb completely desire vaporize in a half a second real clean flavor a little bit of maltiness a little bit of sweetness that I wasn't expecting but real spicy like I said the smell if you like the smell you're really gonna like the flavor they were very similar but when I exhale the inhale it's real spicy but when I exhale I get this a little bit of like a vanilla like a malty flavor almost no complaints at all real nice I've been munching on my bag of cookies here as you can see I'll talk about this later so I've got a pretty good amount of food in my stomach and the amount by the immediate feeling is just relaxation my eyes get a little bit heavier I can feel my back you know they let the aches and pains I normally have in my back slowly they'll start to get a little bit that they'll start to reduce a little bit here and there but for the most part the thing I like most about it is the immediate hit I mean as soon as you exhale you know you just took a really good dad I just realized what time it is I have a meeting I have to head out for so I want to wrap this up if you enjoyed this video click the thumbs

difference and that's it seaweedy versus THC and what's the difference between them dabs and I've seen some videos on some flour but let's do the dad you know so we're about on the channel might work sucks oh my bad so I've had this DVD wax for a little bit I've been dabbing on in here and then but it's nice inside it's like you know what let's make a video with some CD wax versus THC wax and what's the difference i'm b'fer so why not so that's what we're doing today starting off early and just being started now a lot so come into the channel soon so we're almost like a giveaway we're doing a nice thing out of the city and thinking that I staked out some Mac one and get this for you going it's a way to get half of this beautiful wax into that nice little chocolate this is some Maggie's nectar a Maggie's spawn up in our screens it's the box box that's the shrink nice range but look it's a cross of life something cherry but we ready to get the Apple bit we got different table walk on my table on my garage so I was like you know what just switch it up so now we got this table different it's bad it's more stable bit more stuff on in and better than other one other way hopefully I'm gonna break my [ __ ] right that's not so we're almost right there at the right mental house that six very last time I love should be I've got six 2015 so yeah hmm they're coming - TV Dean didn't I can [ __ ] as much as I got regular dad I'm like chasing and that's a good taste I I always get like I don't know the only CVD wax I've ever tried I was like price to lift and then it's just like charities well you know what I think that I actually did trying when I was going to the special ball back just people had some see me wax there's some crystals mmm I'm saying like the same taste of this right here but they got cherry cases has like that Terry cheese nothing I'm complaining it - it's a good taste but I feel like every Stevie webhead have tried how their days I've tried one that has like a gassy taste or you know like you know I mean like a big bomb tastes like I like cherry but someone's you want to try some CDs listen to that cheering I would like to try some CBD hash for certain if someone's making that let me know we want to try that out all right so we do have that one here stabbed this Mac one this Mac one's amazing I have a reviewer on my channel check it out barbar stuff so let's get right to it one more time but it's okay we got time for that so we're trying to get the room set up better so we can have more stuff going on so we can have better things going down get up the TV in here I'm not gonna watch TV when I'm making videos but we're not you make my videos always sitting all the time how to set up everything now it's getting high has a little AC in here so we get her fan on whatever it is just to keep cool I'm gonna top data's it's nothing just edit my videos on here just I get it some quiet decent thing smoke hello trying to make it the smoking round so here we go it's heated it up scared nice and warm to the nice down I mean except to hot sorry about that kind of close sums you know Manchu yeah wait our hostess crevasse another way thank you posted take a dad at the same time yeah ready yeah but that thing out good stuff right here good good stuff there you know get a little DAP going so we could um get it going this DVD wax drop everything and add with Mexico really relaxed um he doesn't get you high it's just like makes you feel relaxed about that psychoactive fact to make me go man just like it makes me feel relaxed like get a long day looks like some of the nice Bowl make you feel relaxed without [ __ ] like crazy hit hi so bomb yeah yeah so how do I feel after her Nadav of that it's all nice and high you'll medicate it um still get relaxed and like that's like honestly gonna sleep eating something maybe first in gonna sleep but hey Mac ones really bomb good taste Terps are off chance that one so what's different one gets you high one doesn't one can make you feel really relaxed just with one down so smoking the flower can make you feel real relaxed too but you have the easily like smoke hole joining smoke people you know that you can get them more will affect this right here you could take one dab of it to make it go nice and relaxed if you don't like to feel like that's like after the fact like it's too much for you then you I would recommend adding CBD if you want to put that sucker up the track you want to feel like more down like like you want to feel that the head filling high I wouldn't recommend everybody see this cuz it's better if you're like paint it's gonna work this DVD does work really good for pain too but the psychoactive effect is not as not high in the CBD there's a little but when we have THC it's an MPhil watch longer so I just recommend mixing them honestly you just could get a nice combo let's mix them and you get the best of both world even be thinking dad said I think a dad first of this and then you feel really good chilled out this will make me feel relaxed and this one makes me feel really higher so this the both of let me just go like mmm I want to sleep

as possible and today we're gonna be checking out this crumble or this bubba kush crumble by Regulator extract and with that we're gonna go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC a comes in at or actually THC comes in at 60 to 0.5 they don't have a whole lot of other stuff but as you guys know I don't buy my candles based off of THC the reason I really picked this up was because it looked really good and it was a steal so I can't hi guys know I don't really mention prices so I'm not really gonna go into it but just know that this was really affordable this was definitely something that I would consider budget-friendly and I'm trying to open this right now and it's not working give me two seconds there we go alright so sorry guys I've been fighting kind of cold so if I sound a little funny I apologize all right so here we go sorry it really is that far off camera I was so as you can see this looks really really good zoom in for you guys so you can check that out let me educate this and play with it a little bit so the color that comes off on camera is about two shades lighter than the color that's in the actual like in person I would say it's a little bit darker than what you guys see here but it still looks really really good ooh as far as the scent is concerned it just has that really clean floral you know good concentrate taste but with that I'm really excited to try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this hey guys what's up I went ahead and tried that bubba kush and as far as the flavor is concerned it doesn't have a whole lot outside of like a regular clean concentrate floral flavor then the hai itself is more of a relaxed stone enos that kind of hits the body but that leaves your brain kind of clear-headed this one was a good one I would say it was a little bit longer than I expected it to be especially for the price and then the way that we ended up smoking it for the majority of the week and I think we still have a little bit of it is we end up topping other stuff that isn't quite as strong or just like you know you dip it in you know you take your other concentrate dip it into some of this and the combination of this with other stuff has been really really really good I honestly think we might end up picking this up again just for the simple fact that if you do end up getting something else that's not quite cutting it you can just dip it into this and boom it's good to go so all around a really good concentrate if you're a newbie I would say you could probably just go ahead and try a normal-sized dab with this because it's not gonna throw you so far out of your element that you're gonna feel uncomfortable and it is gonna give you that concentrate kind of feel if you're a newbie also remember that the THC percentage isn't relevant to you any concentrate is gonna get you higher than any sort of flower that you've ever had before just because it is a concentrate so just keep that in mind when you're out there purchasing your stuff with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "NVdBpWquAVs": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 I don't know what that was this is a medical marijuana review for those over the eighteen and medical patients all right guys you know the deal if you haven't subscribed hit that button leave me a thumbs up like say hi to everybody out there all right we got where do we go so Tara soft wax Mike have native to review we also got a flower haul from true leave we'll do that at the end and there's a new product coming out and some new I guess you say prices on some flowers in other places so make sure you stay tuned to the end for those mmm you guys can see that it takes um that let's roll some out first yeah we've got dirtied abdill's let's clean that one up all right cools off y'all Miller wax up you back for now alright let's give a little hop out there and we'll spread it on the paper you guys can see that it is kind of orange like punkin orange or something I wanted to focus on their real good to spread some on the paper and roll some up and talk about it get up here where I can see it get a little more glob on there so how's everybody doing out there where you got smoking on tonight it's a rain in here so it's a crappy night hopefully clears up so I can get some work done tomorrow or we'll stay at home and shoot some videos one of the two all right we got some of that roll down there you can see that a little better but it is got an orange look to it now I've been doing a lot of research on this one and trust me it took a minute to figure it out well not really to figure it out figured it out pretty quick but to get confirmation that I was correct they advertise this as soft wax and if you looked on their website it even showed a picture in the picture they showed was more of a I don't know like a butter consistency you couldn't even see through it this stuff is got a clearer consistency you can kind of see through it a little bit all right got one twist it up you can see the wax in there a little bit out spider this up all right so this is the my active native was coming at 69 percent THC almost 70 69 and a half that's about all it says on there now from looking at it and I've been tricked once or twice before I kind of knew something wasn't quite right it wasn't you know wax wax and I called the call center a couple times and I will say something you can sit in a parking lot at the store see nobody in the store called a number from the store and they'll say we're helping in-store customers and they'll switch you to the call center but option for on the call centers if you have a problem with the product hit for when you get four it says something about our products are on the on line and the hang up on you so the customer service isn't the best for that I called the call center probably three or four times and asked different questions on it and kind of got to run around each time but finally when I got in the store again you picked up some of the Tillamook strawberry we'll do a quick review on that here for the end to the girl did in it this is this distillate the same thing rides and bike ran tried to put in the chart and tell us there was something different now I will say because I'm not a dis little to fan at all I think it has a waxy taste to it when you try to dab it and just not a fan out this I will say is the tastiest distillate I've had so far like I said I tried true leaves when I first started out you know because people's refilling the vape carts with those I didn't care for it it was too hard to draw on and then you know by decaying got me with their honey well they said kept saying was a honey consistency which ended up being distillate in the jar and then Rises terpene nectar or turkey soup whatever it was was just a little of flavoring but that's what this is it's gonna be a distillate we do have our banger nice and clean up so we'll take a little dab it is very quick it is just just a little with turf flavors in it and it terpenes like I said it does taste good it spreads good it works well on the paper for me crap so if you're using it to spread it in a joint this stuff works pretty good it is a little distant a different consistency as what your true clear would be this is a little thicker and not quite as you know true clear is a little runny and drip you kind of like thick syrup this is more like and it kind of looks like caramel in there but it's more the consistency I'd say like butter so it does spread good let's do a little dab of it and see what it tastes like I got my little dollar tree timer here so we're gonna heat this up for a minute now the Maya cat native said it was a sativa dominant hybrid I found it to be a pretty you know balanced hybrid in my opinion at least how it works for me but like I said when I first got this and brought it home and opened it up you know if you can't see it in the store and like I said if you go on the ceteris website and look at it and it's like to the side it'll show another picture worth a jar open and it has like a it looks more like a butter it's more yellowish sort of mine's more orange so like I said it had different consistency than what looked like what I got so that was a little bit upsetting and I didn't try it for a few days because you know I don't care for distillate wasn't that cool for a minute but then I kept getting the runaround you know I kept calling the call center and I'm like you know cuz a good thing to check for if it's dis Liz ask him if you can eat it if you can eat it it's definitely distillate because shatters and waxes aren't D carved and they're like well you can but you won't get the effects you're not supposed to this and that well like I said when I finally got into the store the girl in there is like yeah it's distillate that should be cool enough we'll see if we can get that in there and get a hit on it yeah I'm not a fan of dabbing that oh yeah then we add it Terps just don't dive right my opinion oh yeah I'll keep putting that in joints I have a spicy taste when you dab it and maybe a little soapy yeah well something I don't care for that like I said it's good in the joint though damn glide it and dab that the first time cuz I'll probably put that back out oh so that one oh man I can't get that taste that one out sorry it just join again that's one I would say get at your own risk it is distillate if you like distillate and you like to dab distillate give it a shot if you want something that's gonna be easy to roll up in a joint that's gonna work too if you're looking for something for flavor I wouldn't pick that one maybe they the strains might taste a little different I've never had this on the flour the flour they did have in was like 12% into my echo that's my passed on it yeah sorry guys spitting in the trashcan don't order target that taste out yeah I'm not care for that but like I said teachers home you might like it you might not everybody's got different flavors out there or different taste buds and all that like I said we did grab some flour at true leaf they had I stopped in there on Monday after work I don't know what is it today Tuesday the only thing they had left was the gorilla grapes which was surprising cuz he said this was the highest THC coming at 23.8 do you think the highest stuff woulda went first you guys know I'm not a fan of the taste of the gorilla grapes really I don't really like to grow a glues at all this is better than the grow of glue it doesn't have that strong rubber glue taste I did pick up two of them you know 27 bucks you can't really beat it nice looking bud nice whole track thumbs on there this stuff does give me I think we've already did a review on it before so it gives me a little bit worse cottonmouth the grape flavor is a little dry to me but grapes in general you know if I eat grapes I'm thirsty grapes kind of give me a dry mouth and then I did have 10% off for my rewards that you want to get like 500 truly points you get 10% off so they had some of the skunk ape a few you guys said it was good so we're gonna give it a shot they're like a dumbass I didn't ask the THC count on it and it's 15.8 so we haven't even opened this one yet don't know if you guys was was 15 that said was good but hopefully it was the mines good they're sparkly I don't know if you can see that look dry just a little bit on the outside but I can feel a little inner little craft a little moisture packing these and these aren't the minis these are the full size so this was 43 well like I said you can see the little shine on the hairpin there I think it ended up being 38 with my discount breaking these open hmm it's got a different smell to it so yeah well freshen that one up we'll do a review on it so let's see we got some new products and some new price structures grow healthy has got a new price structure well I guess not a new price structure they got minis or popcorn whatever you want to call them now they sent me an email a day or two ago hang on a second nose is still running you know saying they was gonna have smalls or popcorn whatever they call them the eighth was gonna be 30% off so it made them $35 and ate 50% off when you bought a hat so a half pounds cuz they're 50 our ate said grow healthy so 50% off the half is $100 for half ounce which isn't a bad deal makes it a little bit cheaper than true leave if you buy it by the half ounce if you don't you're paying $35 so you're back up to you know like Rises price but they haven't had any in yet I don't know why they drop that knowledge and we'll get to the second one here in a second and then not have that product in I called the last couple days and they're like still nothing I don't know why they did that now fluent which was formerly Knox they're gonna come out with no I say come out with the sit an email out so it could be six months down the road we never know if you remember truly said months ago they was going to have snow I think it was and sauce in there blue river rosin wine we started see not yet so don't get your hopes up too much yet but it could be out in the next couple days you never know I'm hoping maybe on Friday or something but they're going to come out with the Oh what was it well it looks like bubble hash they're calling it a melt but it's an ice extract this is what the packaging said because that's all I send you as a picture of the packaging it's was an ice water extract so on the guess in the melt is going to be like a bubble hash and inner Oz and it's going to be pretty much impressed bubble hash so I don't know if that will consist of if it'll be live browsing or if they're going to use it from dried flower so it'll be but it's something different or at least a different process of getting the rosin the bubble hash will definitely be new but like I said it bitten pests that specify in there if it was going to be from dried flower or fresh green buds so I guess that makes a little different to what the end product will turn out to be but they have released a price or anything like that on it yet also you guys if you had noticed we're doing a collab video it's me le k Celtic tech and me t69 me 269 already put her video out you guys can go check it out I plan on getting mine out here before Christmas I think Celtic tech is gonna try to get hers out before Christmas or right after she's not feeling good right now so and then I'm not sure I think Ellie K is gonna get hers out in the next day or so I'm not real sure on that one but make sure you check out all three of the other girls if you haven't subscribed to them subscribe to them I'll leave a link in my video when I posted here the next day or two I might have a chance to do it tomorrow if there that's right and now so my works outside tomorrow so cos rain holds up I'll be holed up in the garage again so mmm and I think I said everybody else is still doing you know some discounts for the holidays true leaves running through their 12 days of Christmas sometimes in their um your leaf is doing something different every day too but you have to show the email is what it says or you have to show the text or whatever so you just can't go in there and say I've seen it on Facebook or something like that so if you haven't signed up for their emails and text alerts you might want to go ahead and do that also when you do that they send you a coupon that you have to show that text to I guess and they get you a flat flower price of 39 bucks and I believe that was till the end of the year I thought it was just a one-time thing but I thought I've seen somewhere else that was till the end of the year that flat flower price but that doesn't work with any other discounts or anything like that but even if you get a discount that flat flower price on some of their $53 strains still might be a better deal I think that's it not too many people is doing a lot of discounts it seemed like it was just truly a purely if invite a can is the ones I see doing a daily deal I guess move is to but there's or just seems like they're not every single day it's like the deal last a day or two long and then they have another one the last two days long if you can just have to go their website and look I don't get notifications from them either for some reason and that's about all I see I didn't see a lot of other ones I haven't seen anything really from grow healthy except for the the littles coming out and like I said that was two days ago this doesn't bid any littles so terror doesn't really do discounts at all I don't believe that much I really haven't seen anything from them all we gots our flour from now we didn't show that we talked about the one day but I don't even think I ever showed it got one little nugget in here now this was the Tillamook strawberry which I was kind of excited about you know because I'm a flavor guy so the strawberry was calling my name this come in at 16% now I would like to add something here because I see a lot of people you know I'm around on Facebook all that crap and like say the northern hash plate come out on Monday everybody will show it that from any dispensary wherever it come from they're all going to be 19.7 across the board I don't see any fluctuation in the same batch that comes out no in ceteris I've seen people I just watched Lake I think it's l.a yke he's a new medical marijuana here in Florida he had this today and this was 14% and they're the same you know batch numbers they only had one batch to come out so far so I believe cetera is really testing a lot more to where other ones aren't so - whereas this might say 20 or 19 it might actually be 17 you know if they talk they're just testing the top buds on the plant and not the bottom ones or the biggest best-looking playing how the whole guard and not the little scraggly ones but it seems like sorter is doing a little bit more testing because their THC is a little bit more all over the place and you're not seeing that in other dispensaries so that's one good thing I will say you're actually I believe you're getting exactly what they say you're getting here now this wasn't bad you know it's got some little crystals on there there's a nice tight bud structure Teva dominant for me and it wasn't a bad strain it wasn't a bad high but the flavors wasn't quite there was supposed to be like you know a strawberry field in the middle of a gas station or something like that it had like a berry taste to it but I wouldn't go as far as to say it was strawberry um and it had a little fuelie taste but I wouldn't go as far as to say twas diesel II I would say it was more of like a very fuel and it was supposed to be more diesel e strawberries so I'd say that flavors was definitely not quite to where they should be on that like I said it should have more of a robust strawberry taste and a you know with a diesel taste to it and it didn't it taste it more like I don't want to go as far as I say a blueberry but maybe like a blueberry with a mixed berry in it you was little blueberry in theirs but more of a fuel than a diesel taste you know I mean I don't if that makes sense to you guys I don't know that it's best way I can explain it but I don't like I said I don't think the taste was quite where it should be it on that better than that it wasn't bad it was thirty bucks I'd probably get him again I'll probably give him a couple a little bit see if they get their act together a little better and plus the only thing they had here was that my akan native which was down like 12 or said I'm not a fan of the granddaddy purple and that was their indica the Jackie girl was pretty good but it was a little bit probably more sativa than I like so I probably wouldn't get that one again I probably get the strawberry again I like the effects on it we just hope the flavor would come out a little better next time but like I said if you want something a little more sativa a little more energetic Jackie girl wasn't bad I was cutting the Jackie girl with some of the decorator wasn't bad you never know I probably get that when he gave it anyways it wasn't like I said a bad one was a little energetic I do like an energetic sativa all right guys that's gonna be it if I hear wind fluent is gonna come out I tried to make a few phone calls today and nobody just knew it nothing there like we all know what you get that a lot in this industry I hear this nobody knows anything that's going on and they don't communicate with their staff very well put it that way but like I said as soon as I find out when it's gonna be released I'm definitely gonna take a drive and try it out because I've had never had bubble hash or ice water hash or whatever you want to call it so we'll definitely see what they're like and I guess that's it guys hopefully you took it on something good out there hopefully you're subscribed to me and like I said if you haven't seen meet these videos meet you 69 check her out like I said I will leave a link I'll put a video up here in the next couple days I don't know quite well in the title I think it's going to be the top strain for 2019 or something like that or something but that's gonna be the collab video like so she put hers out yeah but I will leave a link to her video and a link to Ellie's channel if you guys don't know who she is I don't know where you've been living um and then Celtic Tech she's on here all the time you guys know her I think that's it guys like said make sure you subscribe if you haven't checked out those other guys check them out check out lake - I'll leave a couple link to his channel in one of my videos here coming up soon I got a kind of special video I got a couple special videos coming out I

with a slight yellowish tint", "nKVA9Wj_KNc": "[Music] [Music]", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "ZISALawcB5s": "so I'm super excited about this guy's wildflower hemp company CBD shatter I asked what strain this was and this is a reseller so who they get this from they believe that this is a batch of multiple strains they're gonna be looking into that and if I can find out that information I'll update the description but if not then I'm not sure what strain this is under the impression that it's multiple also so I will note with it being such a small bag it was a little difficult getting this out but just have some patience and you'll be able to figure it out I've never seen a concentrate come in something like this before I went through with my air conditioner on and you know hey it was all smushed out so I had to go and fold it up and layer it on top of itself but it doesn't stick too bad to this paper if you just pop it in the fridge real quick and then take it out and peel it off gently you should be able to do it but this is the most insane Mouse clean CBD concentrate I've ever seen in my life whoa every concentrate for CBD I see is usually just some isolate crap or something some sort of hard something or other or just some like crappy wax this this is crazy guys and it smells like like like shatter like it smells like shatter this is absolutely incredible you guys I'm gonna be transferring it from this to some parchment paper so let me do that and I'm gonna I'm gonna weigh this out for you guys and see what how much this is this is almost a one-point to my friends absolutely there was that one seven but absolutely incredible guys keep going up still I cannot cannot wait to give this a shot I have my email going right now I'm gonna give it a dabber few try to see what temperature's best so I just don't have like a reviewer fail so I'm gonna take a couple small dabs of this just to see what temperature it's best at and then I'll be right back for you guys it goes sorry for the really poor lighting there's just not much I can do without getting a whole lot of glare that's why I don't do really I don't take hits on camera anymore just because it looks like crap but I got this at 475 right now the terpenes on this are absolutely crazy it tastes incredible like absolutely the effects are so great like for real guys like this is such a mood booster it really will get you through through the day tastes amazing guys oh my god wildflower hemp company wildflower hemp cocom I'll leave the link of the description actually in between showing you guys this and taking the stab I have been talking with the person who runs the show over there they're gonna be taking through the steps that they can to prevent squishing during shipping [Music] great great great quality I've never seen CBD shatter like this like you guys have no idea what this means to me and at 30 dollars a gram head shops around here or selling [ __ ] for like I don't know 50 60 dollars a gram thirty dollars a gram for this beauty guys right now it's on sale for 25 I don't know how long that's gonna last yeah hahaha y'all need to try this like 100% the taste I don't even know how to describe it it's just

guys that point ok back here again and welcome to another video you guys in today's video we got a wax review of somebody's if you don't know what buddy's is it's a California wax company and we're going to test out 2 grams of their [ __ ] the 2 grams that we have to test out today is some blue skittles libraries in as well as some wedding cake times watermelon scandalous live Reds and sugar in it so let's get down with this y'all was getting ready like a [ __ ] titty in this video let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section below and let me know if you're watching inside or outside of the United States I'm curious so let me know and let people know to be interactive with you each other down in the comment section below man make some friends man make some virtual still new friends during this whole of the [ __ ] anyhow let's get on it look today's video let's get lenny like a [ __ ] City and let's test out this eats too bad so the blue skittles I kind of dabbed a lot out of so I'm going like go off like about the smell high and taste so woods I started off by smell I almost wanted to say taste every time that I do like reviews like this I like it mine for some reason so what smell does damn as somebody screamed Santander getting murdered outside it just kind of has like the standard like it kind of smells like the standard skittles like smell if you guys like if you guys have ever had skittles before it if you guys know what I mean it's kind of hard for me to I kind of explain it but has that classic skittles like smell must be about my magnifier in the video if you guys have never seen this before this is how I read to shirt so on the box so that these skittles it's an indica like that's and like I said total cannabinoids is 88% so this has 88% cannabinoid so I would assume this has like around like this is in the high 70s lower 80s of the THC range it doesn't have the THC percentage in there I think I think I accidentally boarded up like it had like a little thing attached to the [ __ ] it up bottle so I kind of goofed up so 88% cannabinoid so let's try this which gets Lydia like a titty I know you guys are probably in here to see me take some badass tubs [Music] they got a nice one to start off the video so we'll take two dads in this video we got the rainbow bob marley's rig from the hippie butler box if you guys didn't see that livestream go check it out I have it uploaded on the channel so let's heat this up this is my own banger the banger that came with it [ __ ] broke the bucket snap ball so well just whatever but I already know I'm going to get a lot of [ __ ] down in the comment section yo your [ __ ] fingers all [ __ ] up yeah I know but again I'm visually impaired so it's like it's hard for me to Deb sometimes heat it up a little bit more [Music] this is what I'm going to do so I okay I think I was too slow y'all all right all right y'all let's seek this dad we're just going to take it hot those bucket Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] holy [ __ ] [Music] oh all right so the taste it tastes kind of how it smells man just an it it's just like it's just a classic like skittle steep like not classic but it's kind of the new screen but it's just that like it's that it was tasty you like you guys know what I mean if you had if you guys have had skittles before so this one this is the last month we're going to be trying on the video today and this is like I said what do you think legs watermelon skittles this is also in declared by President this is eighty six point twelve percent total cannabinoids so this is probably like high 70s low 80s THC percentage for sure like they said kind of lost oh wait what's my life [Music] so it's kind of weird so like the smell I like the smell because this is like a weird smelling drain so it's not like a combined wedding cake with watermelon skittles it's like two separate smells so you're able to smell the wedding cake and the watermelon skills like it's weird like the watermelon kind of overkill it's a little bit of the wedding cake snowing but overall it's kind of like a balanced mix and alloys look like a little bit more of a stronger like watermelon smell Ben the cake that you can smell both of the you know but it's pretty much like it's a smells really good so I think we're going to be a nice old all right we're going to take at wrong G dad Chompy Chompy Chompy superplex and shonky but anyhow what should I heat it up cheers y'all alright not cheers [ __ ] I'm not [ __ ] smoking that yet but I haven't decided yet if I'm going to edit out the heat ups or not so we'll see [Music] but get y'all what you just take this chunky down Cheers check out Betty's if you haven't already I'll talk a little bit more about Ichigo [Music] holy [ __ ] [Music] [Music] who would steal reheat whoo man that has a really good super super good taste I'm getting [ __ ] up by from both of them honestly [Music] all right let's go on for the reheat sure y'all [Music] whoo holy [ __ ] you're all right so I'm not going to be talking too much about the individual strains themselves because I really do not know much about them if you guys know what I mean because I'm just dabbing them and just sitting here just getting Hines book and I'm trying just raiding the company over all off these two strings that I bought so the wedding cake times watermelon skills super [ __ ] interesting I love how they [ __ ] decided the [ __ ] Constitution's really good idea it came out to be a really good [ __ ] like live resin same with the couscous really good white resin like super like it's super good like I'm really [ __ ] stoned right now but it it's not like an indica like every time that I take dogs they always kind of like affects me like sativa like it kind of gets my brain going creativity so this is a really good really good product so if you guys have are in the California area at all check it go check out buddies they're really good company I got both of these brands for forty forty five dollars each so if you see them in it and they're in your area go check them out so peace out y'all I'm going to end

definite and only [ __ ] be stressing it and only [ __ ] [ __ ] test when they guess in it welcome to today's video today we're gonna be looking at some concentrate sent over by hemp elf in the goods lines which you'll see here we've got some skittles CBD wax we've also got some pineapple Express CBD waxed we've also got some Blue Dream CBD shatter which is CBD isolate coming in at 99% CBD these products are perfect for anyone looking to get really high CBD content the waxes come in at 80% CBD and then as you will see the CBD shatter comes in at 99% CBD so you're not really gonna get it any stronger than that and before we get in to smell in these products I'm gonna tell you guys hemp bastard actually send over a little chat which shows you guys which terpenes have been added to these products because these concentrates are chirping infused so if there's a specific chirping that you enjoy more than others you can see if latter being has been added to any of these concentrates and by that specific concentrate and tipping's are a huge part when it comes to cannabinoids it gives the flavor it gives the smell and also gives different effect so you can pick specifically which tipping you like most and by that product depending on which to beam you like most so there's a few ways we're gonna use these concentrates the first way being the dynamap with the Dyna coil this is pretty much the primary way I've been using these concentrates the Dyna coil works perfectly with these concentrates but also I'm gonna get myself a concentrate pad and try these concentrates in the mighty the hemp elf did actually send out some rolling papers to which is force and they've got the all-natural rolling papers the pure hemp papers and the ultra-thin papers so we are gonna roll a joint up with one of these papers and use some of the flour that they supplied and we're going to crumble some of these concentrates in to give us that extra added CBD boost to a joint and then we're gonna get this glass piece we're gonna fill the bowl up with some flour we're gonna put some of the concentrates on top and then again we're gonna go through some combustion with some flour and add some concentrates on top of that but again the big big CBD boost so let's get to what these concentrates smell like we're gonna start off with the blue dream which is the CBD isolate and this one's got a really nice fresh smell but I'm gonna go straight to the terpene breakdown that hemp elf did send over because it's pretty much bang on this one's got a very strong piney smell and quite a strong close smell to it it seems like the breakdown when it comes to what happens they've added to these absolutely bang-on because it seems like while they're saying they've added it's exactly what these concentrates smell like which is good this one does have kind of like a strong cleaning product smell to it but it's not bad really strong really fresh smell to this one so next up we're gonna look at the skittle strain which is the CBD wax and instantly and get a slight citrus smell to this one but this stuff has got quite a woody smell to in and I've always said with these waxes they've almost got like like a toffee or a caramel like sweet smell to him but this one in particular this is called quite a few smells come into it it's got a sharp citrus smell it's also got a sweet smell to it it's got quite a woody smell and there's probably a little bit of pine hiding in the background of this one as well but another super strong fresh smelling concentrate so we're gonna put a skittles down now I'm gonna pick up the pineapple Express where the skittles had more of a sweet smell to it this one has more of a like a sour citrus smell to it similar smelling but you can definitely tell the difference from the skittles and the pineapple Express and the one thing I've got to say about these concentrates is that they do actually smell how the tipping breakdown says they should smell if it says they've got a peppery smell they definitely got it if it says it's got a citrus smell you can definitely smell the citrus so use that chirping break down to pick specific smells and tastes through these concentrates because they're pretty bang on when it comes to the smell and quickly now that the smell test is done I want to show you guys what these are looking like up close so first of all we're gonna start with the pineapple Express and this is what the pineapple express looks like a closed super clean almost looks like orange peel and then we're gonna look at the blue dream up close and as you can see here the CBD isolate looking super clean really crystally as well and lastly we're gonna look at the skittles up close and lastly we've got the skittles looking just as beautiful as the pineapple Express these concentrates are clean so there's nothing else I can really do either then show you guys using the product now so we're gonna get a little bit of this blue dream the Dino coil is already in the dynamap I'm gonna get a little chunk and put it on top of the Dino coil and then we're gonna put the cap on and we're gonna heat this up and I'm going to show you guys the vapor production on these concentrates is amazing it is actually a lot different than flour the flavors a lot better the vapors a lot better my normally got a few seconds after the click super smooth it has some great flavor and the flavor profile I get off this is a really clean pine taste that's kind of really one of the only tastes I'm getting off this but it's really clean no throat irritation super vapor clouds and a nice strong pine taste let's go for hit number two whoo-whee blown out some clouds here and one thing that's different about concentrates from flower is just how long the concentrates go there's so much stronger than flower and you can just go hit after hit whoo I felt that one in my eyes in my nose in my brain and normally I'll get about to heat up with the dynabar we're going into the fourth heat up here I see how much papers left from this blue dream who still get in amazing vapor I'm not sure when this is gonna stop so one of the things I really like about these concentrates is the fact that they don't have any cannabis smell or cannabis taste some people might want that personally for me it's awesome to have a concentrate that you can use any time of the day no matter where you are because if you've got a concentrate pen or a Titan of app with a Dyna coil or the mighty with a concentrate pad you can take these around with you all day and no one will ever suspect anything because we're CBD flour sometimes you can have the worry of nosy neighbors worrying about the smell all being up in public and wanting together a little CBD hit but I want to light up a joint this stuff is perfect there's no smell to it so you can actually take this out in public a normal micro dose with some super strength CBD so we're going in for another heater we're gonna get any more vapor from this Bluegreen whoo-hoo Wow that is still next up what I'm gonna do is only get my mighty an attorney it's a 210 and then I'm also gonna get half of a dosing capsule without the lid and I'm gonna get a little concentrate pad and I'm gonna put that into the mighty and I'm gonna conceal that heat in there so once the concentrate hits that concentrate pad it's gonna completely melt straight away and we're also gonna put it through some water this time there we go we're at 210 which is the highest temperature for the mighty it's gonna take that cap off I've actually got a little chunk of this skittles so what I'm gonna do is put it straight on to the concentrate pad and that is gonna start melting that wax now as you'll see there so I'm gonna put the glass adapter back on leave it for a few seconds for that concentrate to melt into the concentrate tab and then I'm gonna get my glass and let's try some of this skills these concentrates in a vaporizer through water adjust summit gals super clean super cold hit and that skittles in this vape through water the sweetness is the first thing you taste so that's going for another hit whoo amazing I kind of caramel toffee taste is coming in a little bit now but the sweetness on this skittles it's amazing these concentrates amazing for anyone who smoked and are looking to get into vaping because I feel a lot of the time the one thing that people struggle with who smoke who want to get into vaping isn't a chest hit the throat hit by heavy vapor and I feel a lot of our of the time when you're vaping and less you have really good technique with very specific vaporizers it's quite hard together big cloud of vapor but with these concentrates you seem to get really big vapor clouds all of the time which may satisfy some of you smokers out there looking to kick smoke into the side and get into vaping let's see what these vapor clouds are like no this isn't smoking in fact this is probably one of the complete opposite things to smoke in this is probably one of the purest forms of vaping you're gonna get super clean super tasty flavors on this skittles are just amazing they don't seem to deplete at all I'm getting sweetness I'm getting that like caramel style taste I'm getting a little bit of a piney taste and as you will see the vapor just keeps on going whoo yeah I'm definitely getting a lungful of vapor with these concentrates super satisfying vapor production super satisfying flavor I see if we got any more in this mighty whoo I think this mighty could probably go all day so we're gonna put that to the side and now I'm gonna pick up a little bit of the flour that they sent over I'm gonna pick up this glass piece and I'm gonna hit some of these concentrates mix them with some flour and see what they like with some combustion they did send over a grinder so I'm gonna put it to use I'm gonna put some of this skittles CBD flour butter sent over into it and we're gonna grind it up and then we're gonna fill a bowl pack it with some concentrate and see if we can get a big CBD hit Oh skills flour it smells amazing super super sweet-smelling strain there you go we've got some skittles CBD flour and some skills concentrate so I see what this tastes like through some combustion that is some amazing flavor now I can already feel it go into my head the flavor on now was amazing that was probably one of the best hits through combustion I've had the flavor was unreal and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna grab some of these all-natural rolling papers we're gonna get some more of the skittles CBD flour we're gonna mix a load of these concentrates in and I'm gonna really try and make a really tasty joint also these papers super handy because they've got the paper and the Roach in the booklet so all you need is this that is actually really handy so for this thing packed up and I'm gonna hopefully try and show you guys what this joint looks like on the inside because there's wax there is shatter there is there's everything in this and I'm hoping you can see it let's roll it and smoke it so you've got a little power joint what we're gonna do is take this little hat off quick and there we go nice light and in this joint guys I crumbled up all three of these concentrates and I used some of hemp elfs skittles CBD flour mix they're all up put in a joint I see what I look like after this has been smoked while I smoke this joint - one thing I want to say about these concentrates on the cannabis side is that for me I feel as though they make my high so much cleaner there's no paranoia there's no anxiety there's no bad feelings every time I use these concentrates with THC whether I'm smoking or I'm vaping them I feel like I never get that really fast shoot up to being high and that really fast come down or now really slow come down I kind of just go in and out and the high always seems a lot more comfortable when he's concentrated involved I keep taking drags of this joint and I just keep randomly getting super citrusy and super piney hits which is really nice yeah yeah you can death from now drag just then I could taste the CBD wax whether it be the skittles or the pineapple Express I could definitely taste one of them them and could differentiate between the wax and the isolate which tells you something this the taste of these are super strong I'm getting some crazy flavors through this one second it's the wax the next minute it's the isolate the next minute it's the flower every drag is different I suppose now the sessions done what do I think about the looks at least concentrates and for me they're amazing from the wax to the ice a lot they just clean the wax is really nice and orangie golden with an ice crystal shine on it and this blue dream shot it's almost like rock salt is had its crystally is shiny and again super super clean and now let's talk about the smell guys and like I did say himself actually sent me over a little picture that tells you all about what to expect from each team that's been infused into these concentrates and again they're clean they're fresh they're strong and they've also got their subtle differences as well which means you can pull them apart and they all don't smell the same the wax is more of like a caramel toffee sweet smell to them whereas the isolates got more of like a strong cleaning product smell to it very piney smell to it as well the one thing I do like about all of these concentrates though is when you open that lid the smell hits your nostrils these concentrates are really nice and strong smelling now let's get to the taste I'm gonna say the taste is very similar to the smell when I was using the Blue Dream it had that piney taste very very similar to the smell that piney peppery taste when I went to the waxes they add that more toffee caramel like I've been saying that kind of taste to him with more of a citrus on the pineapple express side and more of a sweetness on the skittles side where there is a diner vapp with a diner coil the mighty with the concentrate tab the glass piece with the combustion or the joint all of them had really good flavor and the flavor came through no matter how I consumed these concentrates do I think these a day or a night time strain and like I said earlier they're amazing for actually using up in public because they normally have that cannabis smell to them so I would say these are great for the daytime or the nighttime pain relief throughout the day pain relief before bed these things are perfect no matter what time of day you use them and now let's get to the effects because I felt as though there was one category where these beats pretty much everything I've ever tried when it comes to CBD and that is pain relief these concentrates for me were just pure pain relief if I needed a big strong dose of CBD to get rid of some pain these were perfect weather I've a deal where I smoked it these concentrates absolutely melted my pain whether it was my muscles whether it was my joints whether it was a headache it didn't matter it seemed like every time I use these concentrates they just wiped my pain away and when it comes to the effects I feel as though these are a lot different to flower actually when you vape or smoke flower you get the heavy head burs you gather heavy eyes you sometimes get that couch lock feeling I feel as though the effects with the concentrates they were a lot more clean I didn't really gather head burrs or all those heavy eyes I feel as though I could use these and get on with my day which is why I said these are perfect for pain relief because you could use these at any time of the day and not worry about things like smell and such and and get our pain relief that you need these concentrates would be perfect for anyone that's looking for the benefits of CBD but not really looking for the heavy head bus heavy eyes couch lock feeling that CBD flower gives you and overall guys these have been super fun to use super easy to use when it came to the diner coil and concentrate pads in the mighty was a little bit of an extra when it came to adding it to the joint too because the flavors were just so much better and I feel as though these definitely serve a very specific purpose for me if I need pain relief if I need that extra super intense dose of CBD I'll use these will they come into play all the time no personally I'll always go back to flower but like I said these are perfect for anyone that doesn't want that couch locked feel doesn't want that CBD buzz that sometimes you do get from flower and you just want Percy BD relief pure CBD benefits these are perfect super clean super smelly super tasty these have been amazing to try out unless a guy's some super strength CBD right here 80% and 99% these are gonna push a flower so much favor if you want to use these with flower imagine super sticky weed that is what this is like when these concentrates melt on your flower they just push your flower so much further really nice on their own but also amazing to mix with flour this right here for me is just pain relief in a little jar these are like my paracetamol and my ibuprofen these are pain relief these are what I use for pain relief if I need that super strong dose of CBD these are what I go to if you guys enjoyed the video click the thumbs up put some comments in the comment section hit that subscribe button must be yeah I just speak Jam [Music]", "al6-nQkbQXk": "it may be the color of honey but the high you'll get from this cannabis concentrate will be anything but sweet if you over consume shatter can contain 80 to 90% THC but what is it and how is it made find out on this episode of Wheaties II by the growth up you might have heard of shatter a potent cannabis concentrate made from butane hash oil it's one of the many forms of butane hash oil or BHO in league with wax and cannabis oil used in vapes shatter is the solidified hardest form of BHO earning its nickname because it's transparent and can shatter like glass it's highly potent containing 80 to 90 percent THC according to Health Canada and its effects come on quickly and can last for several hours for that reason it takes far less shatter to get you high when compared to cannabis flour which generally contains up to 30% THC but how is shatter made and how do you consume it firstly shadow is made from the trichomes of the cannabis flower click the letter i' in the top right corner of your screen to watch our video on trichomes and learn just how critical they are to your high to make shatter the trichomes of cannabis buds are separated from the flower using butane and extremely flammable and dangerous gas once separated the trichomes are collected and heated to remove the butane the new substance is mixed to a creamier texture and then solidifies into shatter making shatter is very dangerous and it's not recommended to do it at home people have died or been seriously injured trying to create shatter and this is definitely not something you should do I this is because making shatter or any other BHO involves using butane gas in the process in the extraction process butane gas becomes a liquid and then evaporates when heat is used to remove it from the concentrate since butane is heavier than oxygen after it evaporates it can fall to the floor creating a very hazardous situation especially over a hot stove top this is not the only risk when it comes to BHO though any form of BHO weather shatter or otherwise is highly dangerous to consume orally there's the real risk of poisoning here so shatter and other be a chose shouldn't made into edibles that's because there's a possibility that not all the butane was removed when creating the BHO with all that said shatter can be a pleasantly potent concentrate if used correctly and with care shadow is consumed by heating it and then inhaling the smoke you can consume the shatter by adding a small piece of it to a pipe bomb hash pipe vaporizer or dabbing rig be cautious with dabbing rigs however because they can reach temperatures as high as 400 degrees Celsius and should be handled with care and keep in mind that while shatter can be baked it might be trickier to do so and you might prefer vaping another type of BHO very potent and not for the faint of heart shatter is one of many concentrates available from the cannabis plant and likely better suited to more experienced users thanks

little bit interesting because this costs more than your average bear labs well at least around me the typical price of a bear labs wax or gram is usually 25 25 at authentic but this one specifically lemon sorbet was 29 so you know it definitely had to peak my interest you might have seen this wax on my previous video where we went to pinecrest but i really enjoyed this wax so much that i figured that i'd do a video dedicated to that itself and uh yeah i didn't really smoke much of it on the trip as you can see i probably only filmed myself once or twice once in the car and once when i got there um so i i didn't really use much of it but uh i was really impressed of the taste very very um lemony very pine salt salty it's very refreshing taste you know and i'm gonna show you right now how it looks pretty much uh your typical bear labs they have like a white waxiness to it but i really enjoy this because i mean it's very easy to just use you know i don't know uh where my pen is here it is so i'm gonna be using the utility five you guys know the deal and we're gonna pack some of this good stuff right here hopefully you can see it i did break my uh tripod so i'm using like a little box right now i [ __ ] up [ __ ] pinecrest i also like to let you know that this is awake and bake i just woke up when i got home i took a shower last night i didn't blow dry my hair and that's why it's all spiked all crazy like vegeta or some [ __ ] i didn't do this purpose on purpose okay just thought i'd let you guys know oh yeah we're getting rid of this cheers [Music] boys so like i said in the video very much like a lemony pine salt it's like if you bit on a [ __ ] lemon and just like had it there chilling very refreshing uh i don't know if lemon sorbet is a sativa or indica or hybrid uh but generally with lemony stuff you're gonna get a sativa uh but i could i wouldn't go far as to say that it might not be a hybrid as well or like a sativa dominate hybrid so cheers boys yeah so i'm gonna pack another hit by just one i kinda wanna show you without the fan on because with the fan on it just blows the smoke all over the place so it doesn't really look as appealing as it should be so we're going to take another hit off this bear labs very much enjoyable i can see why you have to pay an extra four dollars for this bear last specifically there's other bear lives that cost more don't get me wrong i've seen their diamonds i've to this day i've still never tried their diamonds but it's on the bucket list guys oh well fat hits all right cheers boys oh just for you guys i'm gonna show you how much smoke i actually i'm gonna face it that way as well watch well there you have it we got the bear labs lemon sorbet hopefully you enjoyed the video i know you guys have been [

have a lot of patience with Russian language and Russians and stay subscribe to us and subscribe if you haven't subscribed yet paka paka hi welcome to introduction to Russian my name is Alicia and I'm joined by hi everyone I'm kata in this lesson you'll learn the basics of Russian pronunciation Russian pronunciation is arguably easier to learn than English consider the following English words the first word is pronounced Colonel not Colin l the second word is pronounced arise adding an N however doesn't give you a risin but arisen the last word is pronounced eight but adding an H doesn't give you hate instead it becomes Hite English is notorious for being a difficult language to learn and it can be very frustrating for learners due to the fact that its pronunciation rules often don't make a lot of sense Russian on the other hand can seem like a blessing when compared to English boob vadym ghom russian is primarily pronounced as it's spelled there are some exceptions but they're governed by more defined rules compared to English even long words like the greeting you learn in the previous lesson a largely pronounced as written brestrogen all you need to learn now then are the sounds of Russian there are many vowel and consonant sounds in Russian luckily Russian puts its letters into two main categories of sounds hard and soft there are a total of 10 vowels in Russian and they're divided equally there are five heart bubbles which are a little similar to English ah air all hmm and five soft bubbles these are bubbles that have an inner glide or a wild light quality making them sound softer yeah yeah he yo you please note though that the number of vowel sounds do not equal the number of vowel letters they're actually more bubble sounds than represented by letters similar to vowels consonant sounds can also be hard or soft but me what the do see unlike vowels though consonants aren't differentiated into separate letters based on their hardness or softness alone a single consonant letter is used to represent two sounds one hard ma and one soft yeah this is because Russian is actually read in blocks we use the closest vowel which comes after the consonant to indicate whether to pronounce the consonant hard or soft if the consonant is followed by a hard vowel then the consonant is also pronounced hard ma masla on the other hand if the consonant is followed by a soft vowel then the consonant is also pronounced soft now Massa the many contrasts between hard and soft consonants and vowels is what gives Russian its distinct gliding sound we saw before how a relationship exists between letters and sounds based on their hardness voicing is another quality that's important to be aware of when learning Russian pronunciation voicing simply refers to whether or not your vocal chords are vibrating or not vibrating English has voiced pairs as well consider the following letters put but to cut good do you know ship between these letters the letters in each pair are pronounced exactly the same the only difference being that one requires your vocal cords to vibrate and the other to not vibrate sounds that do not require vibration of the vocal cords like all the ones on the left hand side are considered voiceless while sounds that do require a vibration of the vocal cords like all the ones on the right hand side are considered voiced consider the following example in Russian this letter is pronounced good but this word here isn't pronounced BOGO but whoa notice how the latter group is written which is a voiced letter but is actually pronounced as the letter could a voiceless letter so what ended up happening the final consonant is a voiced consonant but when the word is being pronounced the letter is actually read using the voiceless counterpart instead this occurs to all words that end in the final consonant in Russian final consonants are pronounced voiceless so despite was written always pronounced the final consonant in Russian using the voiceless version but zoo zoo biz the key to perfect in Russian pronunciation is domestic hard and soft pears and moist bears unlike many other languages Russian pronunciation is heavily affected by sounds that are adjacent to each other often adopting the sound qualities of the letters that surround them once you understand the concept and the relationship between hard and soft pairs and voiced pairs Russian pronunciation actually becomes quite logical and easy to learn ok let's wrap up this lesson by recapping what we've learned in this lesson we introduced you to some important concepts for learning Russian pronunciation you learn that there are hard and soft pairs in Russian about voiced pairs in Russian and that letters can adopt these sound qualities hi welcome to introduction to Russian my name is Alicia and I'm joined by hi everyone I'm Katya in this lesson you'll learn the basics of Russian grammar word order refers to the order in which words are structured to form a sentence in a given language consider the English sentence I ate an apple but first let's remove the article and here for simplicity so we're just left with I ate Apple the basic word order for English is subject verb object or SVO for short if we break down the English sentence I ate Apple we can see that the subject I is presented first followed by the verb ate and then finally the object Apple is positioned last this is the basic word order for sentences in English Russian uses the same word order is English as vo fighting kapil sabha qu fighting the subject a guy goes first kapil the verb bought goes second and sabha qu the object dog goes last this means that you can create any basic sentence in russian simply by exchanging the english words for russian words using a dictionary and still be understood isn't that easy in fact russian word order is much more flexible than english compare the following examples cats eat mice if we were to swap the subject with the object we'd get mice eat cats as you can see the SVO word order in english is fixed changing the word order changes the meaning of the sentence completely Russian on the other hand is much more flexible starting with the SVO word order course King idiot mache we can swap the subject with the object like we did for English and yet mache yet koshkin the meaning of the sentence remains the same in fact we could swap the centre's any which way and it still wouldn't change the core meaning of the sentence like English Russian doesn't rely on the word order of the sentence to signify if a word is the subject or an object because it uses special word endings that act as markers to indicate the role of the word in the sentence in this example we use a word NDA in mache to indicate that mice is the object of the sentence and so we can move it around anywhere in the sentence and it still be the object now you know how to create basic sentences in Russian but how do you make a sentence negative negation in Russian is easy just add new meaning no before the verb on speed on near speed yes now yeah news now unlike English Russian permits double negatives so in English you would say nothing happened but in Russian we would say nothing didn't happen achieve whoa my appraisers law you can form many basic negative sentences in Russian by placing no before the verb turning a sentence into a question in Russian is even easier than turning it into a negative sentence simply raise your pitch at the end of the question as you would in English unlike English though you do not need to rearrange the order of any words simply say the sentence and raise the pitch at the end clip on you mush the upon you my to ask more than yes or no questions you'll need to learn question words some common question words are stall cup full Oi kaga will cover this in future lessons on Russian grammar well done let's wrap up this lesson by recapping what we've learned in this lesson you learned that Russian sentences can be formed using an S vo word order just like English additionally Russian uses markers to indicate the role of a word in a sentence which allows the word order to be much more flexible you make a negative sentence by adding no before the verb and to create basic questions in Russian simply add a question mark and raise your pitch at the end of a sentence [Music] hi welcome to introduction to Russian my name is Alicia and I'm joined by hi everyone I'm kata this series you'll learn everything you need to know to get started learning Russian that's right and we are here to help guide you through your journey in this lesson you'll learn the reasons you should start learning a new language why you should learn Russian in particular and how to get started let's begin with the most obvious question why learn a new language there are countless reasons but perhaps the biggest one of all is that it could actually change your life learning a new language unlocks new pathways that are off-limits to you now there are certain things that you simply cannot do without having the technical or cultural skills that come from learning a new language like working or living in another country knowing another language provides you with greater job opportunities you have the freedom to move to another country halfway around the world and be able to earn a living or even better yet build a career from it instead of just being stuck in one place language allows you to visit or live in places that you may never have even considered going simply because that wasn't a possibility for you knowing another language simply gives you more options to choose from and learning a new language also helps you to be more open-minded and see the world from a new perspective language and culture go hand-in-hand the world is a big place and by broadening your understanding of other cultures it allows you to be more empathetic and understanding of the many different ways that people live their lives with language you're able to see and experience more which helps you to grow as a person learning in your language also improves your memory several studies have consistently shown that those who study another language have improved memory as opposed to those who didn't learn another language learning another language also keeps your brain healthy by significantly delaying the onset of Alzheimer's and dementia this difference can be as much as four to five more years of quality life and those are just some of the reasons you should learn another language the list just goes on and on now you know the benefits of studying another language but why should you learn Russian in particular everybody knows that Russia is the largest country in the world but did you also know that Russian is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world - Russian isn't only spoken in Russia it's actually the official language of many other countries like Belarus Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and the list goes on and on and unofficially is also widely spoken in Ukraine Latvia Estonia and many other Slavic countries in fact Russian is part of the larger family of Slavic languages that are all very similar to each other I came to super languages like Chinese Spanish there are around 300 million Russian speakers worldwide and its importance as a language can be seen globally as it's one of the official languages of the United Nations all meetings and official documents drafted by the United Nations are spoken and written in Russian learning Russian also opens up many other business opportunities as Russia leads the world in many industries such as mechanical engineering refining shipbuilding automotive aerospace microelectronics and much much more what about the poetics of the Russian language itself in the words of the 16th century emperor of Rome Charles v I speak to God in Spanish to friends and French to my enemies in German and to women in Italian and to them the Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov famously added that if he'd known Russian he could speak to all of the former because Russian has a grandeur of Spanish the vivacity of French the strength of German the gentleness of Italian and in addition to that the wealth and brevity of Latin in Greek indeed Russian is one of the most interesting languages in the world it's the king of Slavic languages it's been set by language learners that if you learn this language you can easily learn any other language in the world no matter how difficult it may seem ok then we've talked about why you should start learning a language and why you should start learning Russian in particular but how should they get started Katya well it's as simple as learning your first word in Russian and building up from there the good news though is that you already know some Russian it is picked fail good as you can see Russian is much closer to English than it seems initially because it has had ties to English and English expressions for some 200 years let's teach you something that you might not know dress to attend this is a common Russian greeting that roughly translates to hello or how are you dressed idea that's a useful phrase can you explain a little bit about what these symbols are though sure much like how English uses the letter script in its writing Russian uses another type of script called it's really script and those symbols are actually letters of the Russian alphabet and similar to English one letter usually corresponds to one sound and Russian will introduce you to the writing system in Episode four of this series for now let's put up some Roman transcriptions so you can follow along Natraj Twitter repeat after Katia brass Twitter addressed to it Russian has a lot of consonant clusters like the ones found in this greeting but don't let that intimidate you pronounce each consonant going from one to the next without adding any extra vowel sounds start off slowly and read them in the correct order straw Stewie tear drafts twitch in brass torture we can also abbreviate this phrase to make it more casual Drive smooth just remove the last syllable tear to say hello casually to a friend or relative it's dry smooth the drafts to me well done now you know how to greet someone in Russian we've covered a lot of things already so why don't
