{"QR28aT45Y8I": "what's going on out there youtubers mr. weed Lee with the joie de lis show gonna do a just a quick cart cartridge review some cheaper cartridges going around adding two weeks in a row now Keene cartridge got a lemon and a Bluegreen 1/2 gram and a 1 gram legally completely different cannabis oil me inside of these two different size cartridges I have no idea why I'm glad I tried the second one is it was night and day difference I have no idea why that is a half gram cartridges or I found this one little dispensary Nirvana not my favorite just been three but they just print three as well you know they they have good prices on car projects especially if you buy two i got the half gram king the lemon i don't think it's a lemon OG anything like that i think it's just dad living food terpene it was a really really dark oil pretty much empty you can kind of see how dark it is in the bottom there compared to that [Music] but the Blue Dream you know it's a cannabis strain terpene or carpet lease boy that I don't know lemon 1/2 gram OG get it out of here crap you only got 20 bucks both taxes what that was hey you get a buzz you know just a taste wasn't the best $20 can't can't beat cannot beat the one gram here get them at the same place there are a lot of other places I'm sure mr. 17 may be dropping some around may not I don't know if he's gonna even go that route maybe just better ones definitely try the one gram the last one I had was a wooden ship it was really good this was a black porcelain tip it actually says something signature on the it is some kind of a brand name cart if you can see when it does have on the stem their signature lol of something signature something I get over but it's been a good one [Music] I found this you can get these at that same shop I'm the cheapest I've seen him as 30 plus tax for the one gram and that's I take 40s a more normal price own but you know go to that one shop buy two you get them for that along tons are my one you can get them for that so it's definitely a budget budget cartridge but I am on a budget so that's good that's good I might actually probably be rolling with these quite a bit let's see if I can keep the people in they keep the quality up and the price of that same price but that one dispensary I might be on me [Music] you don't know about the damn care that's the white V to fix this king cartridge amazingly you get the v3 pretty soon probably when they hit town all right I'm gonna make this quick little download over 420 already though so everybody have a good one big shout out to the man here up and get great medicine all over this town so see you guys later take er easy keep it growing up twisty twisty OKC Thunder seed mmm I like that started to stretch I got it fixed she's doing great so twisty coming along and the other one didn't do so well but it was a random I got all my faith in these twisties everybody have a good one and take her easy again", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings

coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a

as my thank you to Keira leave who delivered my order yesterday Sunday one hour away I ate 16 in the morning so let's get to it today I'm gonna tell you about the king louis xiii 85% vape cartridge that I picked up from Keira leaf I paid $51 for this cartridge and it didn't come in at 85% it was eighty six point five percent THC the packaging that comes in is perfect to store in the drawer and the little tubes they come in are perfect to keep a few different strings open at the same time safely and separated correctly the cartridge is a csail cartridge so it has a ceramic coil which ensures you get accurate flavor it tastes and smells like I imagine chewing on a cinnamon stick will taste like the effects way way make up for it but you know this now in case you don't like spicy or cinnamon flavors on to the effects the first effect I felt what's the treatment of energy which started low and grew nicely from there then BAM though intense inner joy this one wasn't subtle but I needed that hand in hand with that came into happiness with permanent smile that only got bigger through the duration of the offense literally I had woken up sideways one of those days where the dirt and leaves are on my way top a day then I hit the cartridge three or four times five minutes later no more anger no more stress no more anxiety the stress based and society attacks stop for the sad amped up my creative juices plenty and like that wasn't enough then it took all my pain away makes me super happy to see somebody having in stock and treating me with respect the king Louis thirteen straight can I work on this dream yes I was able to work on this cart fill us with the vape cars you feel the effects within one to three minutes that way it allows you to know if it's starting to slowing you down you can stop on time and not let it get past that and that's a great plus to know that fast I recommend this King Louis 13 cartridge for midday through all the way to the end of the night youth I hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "FBru-i5Xf5g": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well hello everybody welcome to a brand new podcast today again we got another cartridge of you but today we're gonna be doing something a little bit more different I've only tried this brand at least like once and it is the king pan brand honestly the reason why I really I wanted to make this I had to make this video like I have to make this video I have to show you guys exactly what I really think about these and the only issue that I have with these but other than that I think King pen is hella fire it's I guess it's one of the world's most awarded cannabis fate I mean I guess I could believe that because this [ __ ] is it's pretty far is it better than raw garden heavy hitters you know what it's on its own it's on its own level so today I got some Cali oh it's eighty-three percent THC checked it out and I got a Minuteman I mean the design of this is pretty sick you know I think it's pretty dope it's powered by loud pack if you got you guys to see that right there and it says right here a 1 3 second draw as I see while serving so like always everybody you know a 3 second drag that's gonna be equivalent to one hit and let's seize cartridges king pan cartridges are available in indica sativa and hybrid proud to be the most avoided cannabis bait in the world okay in the world but hey man you guys better be cool watch out cuz you know seven 10 laughs who knows how their cartridges are gonna be raw garden to a man everybody's trying to come on big fan of raw garden because everybody that I know that smokes cartridges and I'm talking about like you've wired from like different cities and stuff they're all going for those rock garden songs oh man you better watch out cuz you might not be the most awarded soon so bono so I've actually tried a couple of these before I do have another flavor King Louie Oh got some King Louie og but I wanted to save that for another video but shout out the packaging but let me just show you guys one thing because these are just again everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the sales of these products and I don't sell anything on this channel or I don't push anything it's just an educational review it's for cannabis patients 18 and up you know people that are just wanting to look for a review so let's go right here oh so got myself a little half not too bad not too bad I do want to take this sticker off Rennie let me say [ __ ] it maybe take it off there's a little sticker right here sometimes the sticker kind of kills the color it doesn't get you like that full color if that makes sense you know kick off that sticker there you go slowly nice and slowly BAM oh okay look at this this looks kind of fired I do like the logo right there you guys see right there okay you guys see the logo and it's just some clear wax - and this is clear - like the liquid inside is so clear look at that look at that let's do a little test there you go it's not moving at all we got some sativa on our end so you know I'm trying to wake up but like just one thing I can't everybody I've talked about this in different videos don't get me wrong man these King pens are fired I like them to me they're kind of like equivalent to like a heavy hitter so cheers everybody let's try it out whoo that flare mmm that [ __ ] is so fiery literally just tastes like gum kind of like an orange that's like an orange e flavor and you can just tell us a tivo right off the bat honestly sometimes a lot of people could smoke a sativa and they feel like they took like a shot of coffee you're like a little cup of coffee which is kind of crazy to me it's the other way around I feel like sometimes I could be slumped but smoking sativa it kind of does kind of wake me up like mentally it's like a it's like a mental wake-up type thing you know the physical wake up I feel like I'm a little [ __ ] little tired just cuz I smoked it you know but here like hey I'm show you guys king pan BAM eighty three point zero three percent THC so oh well like how these hey the design is pretty cool you know it's kind of heavy notes made I'd like a little likes a little type of metal but one thing I really do like about the kingpin is that some other flavors are just like lose it they got they got a good taste you guys like I I completely like I approve of the taste the taste is pretty nice hmm oh yeah let me tell you guys one thing though and I know I feel like a lot of people are gonna be able to relate to this but let me know in the comments down below but check this out so if you guys see the very end of this so yeah I see the bottom of it right there like this bottom right here I feel like some some of the liquid stays right here you know it's it gets stuck right here and I feel like you don't 100% complete like you don't want a hundred percent like all over the juice doesn't go inside the you know like the little coils inside if that makes sense you know there's always like a little bit left over that's just stuck in there and that happened to me like two times already I bought two cuz back then I used to like the king I used I select heavy hitters brass knuckles and King pens those were like my two daughters before I even knew about like raw garden and all these other cartridges it was always it was mainly brass knuckles I don't really like the brass knuckles and the heavy hitters see here and there I came across a king pin but actually I think yeah cuz my first cartridge ever was a a brass knuckle it was some sv og I remember that I was the SF vog and it was the full gram and I remember when I first bought it I first bought my first pan I was so excited I was like bruh I'm gonna get so late sigh my room while watch a movie watch a show I'm like ooh it's gonna be sick and that's exactly what I did you know I freaking got my home chart I mean I spent without any somewhat charge but I thought it was in charge so I kind of charged it up you know put it in and I was just like oh dude I'll if I can get it can I can remember to lose and it was in the next room it was the next the next door room I switched rooms in my apartment but back there I was inside yeah this is a tea but I feel like I'm kind of like can look creative you know get a little bit like let's [ __ ] get this bag baby let's look in yes but I remember that's - I freaked I think I watched the epic movie you guys remember that movie those like dumb parody movies the epic loot it was like scary movie epic movie disaster movie [ __ ] love these those lows those stupid parody movies I think they're so funny they're so interesting cuz I'm late half the time but in reality they're they're [ __ ] shitty movies but I always thought they're hella interesting the one that I really like oh my god you guys should go check that one it's called Stan Helsing it's a parody of Van Helsing but that [ __ ] is just ash it's just so funny honestly damn I feel like one thing about the King pens is I feel like the airflow is really nice like there's a way too much now way too much air flow but the air flow is just like on [ __ ] point what's my name before I do remember it was like I forgot what 2014 what was one out like I was first introduced to a couple pens no yet no 2013 Oh 13 or 14 yeah I think it was 13 or 14 one of those years but it wasn't like a it wasn't like a cartridge like a wax cartridge you know like like like distally you know it wasn't stuff like that it wasn't like live resin - it was more like a little globe it was like these little globes and inside was like a little like a tab it was pretty much like you're taking a DAB and there was like a little piece like a little coil in the middle there's like a globe and inside it was like a little coil and it was like heat up so you don't have to put your dab on that stuff you'd have to put your down on that and then you would hold it and I should the coil would heat up and then that's when you take it out that's what I remember the first pens that's that's that's what I'm I'm you know like what the hell is okay to smoke out of a pin likewise and after that that happened and I made like a year or two after that that's when all these like distillate that's when all you got all these like wax cartridges all these like random cartridges coming out and they were fired you know I I came across like for sure a lot of real ones but I'm not gonna lie I didn't come across maybe here and there - three of them that were for sure fake and that's cuz again I've talked about this I say this in every single cartridge video if you guys if you guys are buying those fake-ass $20 cards to stop buying that [ __ ] man don't just just cuz you're you okay right now you're in your head you're part like all 20 bucks bro [ __ ] that I'm not gonna go buy a $35 half gram or a 55 or $60 a full gram at the club and I could be buying a full almost a full gram on 20 bucks just like you guys man you guys are smoking those deadly pesticides you guys are smoking that fake [ __ ] I don't care if you're like local drug dealer or whatever selling guys now man this is some fire that's just the real [ __ ] nah man [ __ ] that if he's selling that [ __ ] I got 20 bucks unless you personally know the person and you know that he's making it and you know exactly what's going on that [ __ ] don't trust that [ __ ] bro cuz if you're paying 20 bucks even 20 bucks for a half gram bro I don't think so no but hey sometimes you guys could get I mean I mean I'm not gonna lie something you guys could probably get like a nice little there's probably people out there that get some nice little plugs or you guys you get some real [ __ ] for really low shout-out to you but majority of the people out there hell nah man you guys copy nothing [ __ ] just save your money and just go buy yourself a [ __ ] full gram of like a heavy hitter you know raw garden you know like cuz I know a lot of people that just mind some fake [ __ ] say it and say this real [ __ ] but I don't [ __ ] I don't think so I don't know I would I wouldn't risk it because at the end of the day she guys's body you're not gonna feel the damages that don't see your body right now but you're gonna feel it like maybe 20 30 years down the road when you're like and then you're 50 60 s you're gonna be like tan mask [ __ ] I smoked all that fake [ __ ] this [ __ ] sprocket effect is 2-1 like 50 60 who knows hopefully now but [ __ ] that's what we're doing that that's why I'm doing this review you guys so [ __ ] makes you guys drop alike man drop a comment what you guys have favorite flavor if you guys have tried kingpin and if you guys are new hit that subscribe button click that bell so you guys can notified every time we upload but sure y'all want to take a hit like what's up I bought a when I first found out that there was fake cartridges out on the street that's why I kind of like completely I'm like [ __ ] that dude I'm not I'm stopping I'm not gonna buy off the street I did a couple times here in they're not gonna lie but this was like maybe like three years ago yeah this happened like maybe three almost four years ago I bought a [ __ ] cartridge it was a brass knuckles cartridge and I bought it for 30 bucks at 30 for a $30 full gram and I'm like okay this guy that I knew at the time on this guy probably bottom and bulk got him super [ __ ] cheap he's just adding another extra five you know another 5 10 bucks to the price to each cartridge so that's that's cool you know he's making a profit I smoked like maybe like one third of it in like the bottom of this she started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] was it getting black I started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] dude this [ __ ] is not normal she's starting it I like what the hell's inside this cartridge so I showed one of my other friends but if you like it's obvious I doing this is fake bro you're smoking like fake wax fake this to it you know you're smoking fake distill fake to steal like he's like nah bro just don't [ __ ] away so what I did I was like [ __ ] the [ __ ] grabbed it screwed it off I just did that [ __ ] away and from there I was like dude I can be something you can't be something that fakes you do I did know some [ __ ] one girl though I'm not gonna lie like she [ __ ] oh my god I'm just disgusting but I mean she wasn't disgusting what I'm saying like just she just had no idea one time like [ __ ] I met some girl that had a cartridge that was so [ __ ] dark so cheap you can tell the plastic was so cheap like I asked her I was like what you are this [ __ ] I bought it for my friend house like let the [ __ ] how much like it's like 20 bucks and I was like bro what though it was so dark she was smoking like black tar [ __ ] wax or some [ __ ] ha and I was like dude throw this [ __ ] away and she's like nah and I was like okay cool you know I wanna I want to like taste I'm not gonna inhale this [ __ ] so I took it here oh hell no my mouth too blew it out as [ __ ] tastes like plastic oh she pointed and she part finished it knowing her knowing that chicks you pod killed that [ __ ] she got laid off her ass how [ __ ] all these deadly pesticides all these like chemicals and [ __ ] I have no idea but I don't know I just don't think it's worth it honestly I think it's just it's best just to go to the your local club you know like just go to the local dispensary these brands I know it might not be like 100 percent safe but they're free share you're way better than the [ __ ] that people caught cop off the streets and I talked about this in almost every single cartridge video because it's just so important to not be smoking these book these nasty like chemicals because it's not it might not affect you right now but it's gonna affect you down the road so [ __ ] a lot of people say they leave comments down below saying that I need to take I need to hold in my heads for holidays but your lungs instantly absorb all the THC one day when the smoke goes in your lungs it like instantly [ __ ] absorbs all the THC you know so it's not like you have to keep it in there for it till I grab the most tasty you know but oh that's why usually I hit it I hate it make sure it goes all in the lungs and I just blow it out right away so I'm like yeah I got all the teasing I needed I don't need to keep that smoking my lungs I'm already I should that's about to be wow I'm lit can't even talk

review for Canada's patients 18 innit you already know", "wGsPh51K65M": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughhouse to use welcome to Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be

[Music]", "iXOiyo5eYW0": "while we've probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any additional questions or concerns be sure to leave

subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want

excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative entertaining I

would come and smoke how often oh I couldn't go longer than like 10 15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos here thanks for checking out the ABC News youtube channel if you'd like to get more videos show highlights and watch live event coverage click on the right over here to subscribe to our channel and don't forget to download the ABC News app for breaking news alerts thanks for watching", "iLSo9L4uOkw": "THIS MORNING WE\u2019RE HEADING TO A SCHOOL TO SEE WHO CAN SPOT THE SCHOOL TO SEE WHO CAN SPOT THE VAPE.

this anonymous guy is coming for the kraken look at them come for you carlos would like to talk to you about this investment opportunity wait did this guy just bid on his own bid what do you mean by that it only shows this guy outlier oh jesse withdrew his uh previous lower bids oh okay i wonder why what is is there a reason for him doing that or just a style style i think no i think when you when you bid it puts it it puts that money in escrow so you can't so wait these guys probably remove that so that he could then put in a higher bid or not i don't know but i think that's how it works yeah so this guy outlier has he doesn't get his previous money back that makes sense what was that 17 whoa crackers 1776 baby let's go america crazy the kraken 1770 we got some patriotic music going yes america was american independence baby read it and weep is he american i don't know he may have been canadian or some i don't know what do i know jesse the kraken out here on full display what was the river washington went across the delaware the delaware flag in hand to liberty liberty for your currency 18 ethereum almost carlos wow oh this is crazy this is crazy it's up to 32 000 this is [ __ ] amazing because i made a pledge that this would be the one and only time we make this to keep it rare and valuable do you think frenemies is included in that i don't i do think it's different so maybe frenemies but um it's up to you ultimately i do want to say if you want any of the other coins mining elis there's still some left i'm going to be deleting them they'll be all that leftovers will be erased should i do it like after this or like maybe on monday whenever this expires i think yeah whenever this expires it's the end oh there's an expiration date on the other ones oh and this expires yeah when this okay so after this after this live then we're gonna have to crush all those tokens digital fire jesse coming in hot wow all right we're down to three minutes so we got the crack up in this love the crack jesse you love crack don't worry i was gonna be done at 10 that's crazy 17 yeah that's crazy 32 000. there was predictions that somebody someone predicted it would go for 50 which seemed far-fetched to me 50 ethereum didn't use no or thousand oh fifty thousand well we're getting kind of close to i guess 20 ethereum well you're you're pretty close at this point it's pretty amazing is the kraken gonna try to assassinate me now so the spur the purge of his coin goes up because if i died he could resell that for sure yeah you better watch out oh you know he's got the means he's got the capability got the resources huh i don't know if i see that kind of personality in him right but it's always the ones you really suspect right it's going to be able to be resold for i mean multiple reasons it's like everything's documented in these episodes you know like auction every lore yeah and he has the whole set wait did it go up again oh oh no we have another bid by this other mystery bitter this guy that i named the guy we have no intel on a name tell us your name we don't know who he is wow now it's up to 19 jesse just got cracked on how come the numbers are so random now is there any reason for that uh i don't know i wonder if the bidding increment yeah interestingly about jesse the kraken is that he has all of the other cards so he'll have a complete set right oh i think that's why he's so eager yeah here's his wallet wow he wants that 100 he wants that platinum achievement unlock yeah this guy knows an investment when he sees it right i mean the guy's got the foresight of a goddamn uh of a goddamn guy who bought crypto early nothing better than that ela said privately in discord i'm going to out her she said we're going to be here forever i

foreign", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe below to learn some more we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Tj3aCrUwy64": "yes mad at Rafal studios and welcome to my review of the Herpa 5g dryer vaporizer i would like to thank the guys at Harrah's tech for setting up and sponsoring this review if you'd like to learn more about this or there are many other products please visit Arras techcom now let's get started here's what comes inside the box with urbe 5g get in an instruction manual we also get a glass mouthpiece you get the USB ribbon charger a cleaning cord there's a little dab tool and of course the herb of 5g vaporizer itself very tiny little device now let's take a closer look at the herb for 5 G like I said this is a really really small vaporizer one of the smallest I've seen and has one single power button on the front and a LED light there's also the vents where the air flow through comes through for the chamber on the top we have the mouthpiece there it's a composite plastic mouthpiece and that is attached magnetically with a magnet on each side good strong magnets we have a pure ceramic chamber there all the way around ceramic chamber at the bottom we have micro USB charging port and then along the sides we have the little nipples or the little indentations there to help you get a grip really like that finish one thing I like about it is it includes this glass mouthpiece that's also magnetically attached mouthpiece simple glass mouthpiece with a metal plate on the bottom everything really tight and compact right at the top of the unit there ok so now we're going to test out the functions and features this device charges with micro USB and there's a light on the front indicates red while charging and it goes out when it's fully charged in our devices charged up and ready to go really super simple to operate this it's five clicks to cut it on and off and it has three different temperature settings that you change by just pressing one time so that's indicated by green as low medium is the medium blue and then the high is a light blue and we'll go over those temperatures in a second and you can see it heats really fast even if the highest setting there it was fully high within less than 30 seconds and you cut the device off with five clicks super easy okay so now I'm going to grind up some fresh herbs and this is some cannabis here we're going to test this out you always wanted to grind yours when you do a vaporizer to make sure you get a good even vaporization so I'm packing it up here one thing I find it a little bit difficult to pack this vaporizer the little hole and the chamber itself is really small and it's in sets a little bit a little bit tedious to get the cannabis down in there but it works fine and then the hits itself really really pure taste with this glass mouthpiece super impressed by the flavor and also really good puffs on it I'm testing it on the high setting which is 420 degrees not the highest that they go but it did a really good job of it as you can see that cannabis that came out was perfectly vaporized just toasted almond no green left in it and no scorching so really an excellent job there which brings us to the results in scoring pros are is really attractive and tangy little design it's got to pure ceramic oven with an airflow right at the top perfect configuration the glass mouthpiece is nice excellent performance on the herbs and it has three temperature settings 390 405 and 420 and he's really fast cons are it's kind of small battery and it's a little bit difficult to load but not taking that off it's a tiny device with a big punch five stars for the 5g dryer vaporizer really good job there era's tech thanks for singing this out and for sponsoring the review again if you'd like to check out their products please visit Aires techcom I

thank you for watching", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "I9babjQA-aM": "whether you got an exotic car or a tank art I'm going to show you how to get the oil up so this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got an exciting one for you today all right so a lot of you have asked me how can I get the oil out of my broken cartridge well if you've got an exotic card or a dead bank card or one of the many other cartridges that use this style of vaporizer cartridge I'm going to show you how to get the oil out of it first things first let's take it to the deck and introduce you to what we'll be working with all right so here we are first things first let me go over the utensils that we will be working with today this is a stand that I made myself to hold cartridges in while I filled in these are a couple of varieties of syringe that are available this particular style right here works adequately for filling and emptying most cartridges that you get on the market today specifically 1/2 gram cartridges and 1 gram cartridges this will generally empty most of those now this tip is a little short and as such I'm showing a few of the available sizes this is approximately 1/2 inch one inch and a one and a half inch tips right here in varying diameters for filling no next to it I have a 1/2 gram or 0.5 milliliter and a 1 gram or a 1 milliliter cartridge these are one-time use non reusable disposable cartridges these are also 0.5 milliliter or 1/2 gram and one milliliter or 1 gram these are refillable and reusable the mouthpiece screws off where these are a press fit and they have to be forcibly removed now these are the two styles that I recommend when you are replacing the oil into another cartridge as you will see the exotic cards uses a slightly different cartridge right there but I prefer when I'm refilling to go with a tried-and-true cartridge to ensure the failure does not happen again with that in mind the first thing we're going to look at is these tips now as you can see this is a one and a half inch tip right here this is an half inch tip right here no this is a half milliliter or 1/2 gram cartridge as you can see this tip would work adequately to recover just about all the oil in that cartridge very well in the 1 gram cartridge as you can see you would be able to recover most of the oil except for what is stuck around the chimney right there for that a longer syringe such as this is a much more adequate okay now that I've shown you a couple of the utensils let's get these cartridges open real quick and we can see what they look like all right here we are so this is a lemon berry Gang babes cartridge with a C cell with a pronounced THC of 90.9 9% here's a little bit of a close-up if you'd like to pause that to get a little bit of the idea of the flavor then this is a C cell cartridge right here just like it states C cell right there this one right here this I believe is an eye crusher cartridge and this is some fruity pebbles from exotic cars this has the hologram I'm right there and this is a hybrid this one here says it's been 80 and 85 all right okay and here we are now please bear with me this may take a minute for some of these I have found that on some of these cartridges this perfectly round tip right here does not always work and I have modified one slightly so that it is slightly oblong to fit down around that chimney a little bit and that's what I want to be using right now to ensure that I'm able to reach cover as much oil as I can I'll be working with this first one this is a fruity pebbles from exotic karts I believe this is an eye crusher cartridge what we're gonna do we're going to start off with just removing the lid it just twists off just like that right there you can see set that to the side now I have a custom-made stand right here that I tend to use to hold my cartridges when I'm filling them if it tends to stay pretty pretty good right there right and you're going to take your syringe and just insert it and start drawing up right as you can sort of these have both been warmed up a little bit to ensure that they do flow decently I definitely recommend that as you can see you want to try to get as far down into that that edge right near that hole right there as you can get and then lean that the cartridge as far away as you can and just try to recover every little bit that you can and don't don't be afraid to suck a little bit of air up in there I mean you really want to you want to be able to try to recover everything that you can there for sure all right there's a little bit there what I recommend you do at that stage is just set it on the side and let it gather on one on one side real quick heat that up a little bit let all that oil gather on that opposite side and then you can stick this back in there and and utilize it that way well this is warm I'm gonna put this into another cartridge real quick just to ensure that it flows pretty good like I said then just put this tip right down in there this is able to go actually down in there like this to recover oil from one of these are necessary and then all right there you go sit that put Leon that and remember this let these sit for a few minutes that then oil bubble down in his holes and if it's good and warm like this one is it'll get down to those holes no problem alright and that's basically how you do that one as you can see on this there's a little bit gathering down on that edge we'll just gather that up as much as we can right there and uh this here just set it right off to the side with the cap there and uh that's basically garbage now with the dank veins it's a little bit of a different different different ballgame here you've got to remove this mouthpiece this mouthpiece is a press fit on here it does not just come off so what you're gonna need to do you're gonna need to grab this with a pair of vise grips or a comparable pair of pliers and there you go alright pull that mouthpiece right off of there now we take our syringe we insert our syringe all the way down and get just down there see how far that went in and then we slowly start to draw that all out of there all right we want to put the syringe on the bottom edge and start drawing there we go he's just taking all that oil right out of there all the way down until there's almost nothing left in there she'll be able to empty that thing out completely alright and there you go that's basically one done unit that point you can get comparable unit exactly basically the same unit brand-new these cartridges can all be purchased at vape art smart comm there is a link in the description you simply take that cartridge you take that syringe you put it right in there just like you four set it right down near that inside down there just like that there's a fill up in there all right and there you go put the lid on that get that near the old vise press that in and WHAM bulb Lambo there you go let's get this back on top and I'll tell you guys how this works out alright folks well here we are back on top with the new cartridges we got the fruity pebbles crammed down into this bad chicken right here this is a refillable csail cartridge available in the description below at Bay Park smart dog on go ahead give them a click and I'll go check that out the syringes that I use also available at Bay Park smart dog but go down there give up click on that link in the description and go check them out we've got the lemon

right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss anything drop it in the comments below to spread the knowledge

"BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos like this thanks for watching peace", "dU9NVR4mOx0": "[Music] hey everyone today we're gonna be giving you a list of our top five oil cartridges so that you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best

smart the great way to check", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "BZDFXvM2MrM": "so after reading a few comments I decided that I wanted to make this video answering some of the questions you have on various things like is care T and muha med cards real and just a few various questions to help you understand vaping a little bit better and I thought why not make a part 2 of a video I did almost a year ago about how to get the most out of your oil cartridges this is gonna be a two part video so make sure you stay to the end so that you don't miss anything [Music] storage definitely plays a role into your oil cartridges we went over this in the last video but traveling at a higher altitude will affect your vape pen this is due to the change in air pressure the increased air pressure forces air into the device which can inhibit performance and cause leaking higher quality tanks are better equipped to withstand altitude changes if you plan to go to a higher altitude location purchase one that can handle these conditions or keep the rubber caps that come with the cartridges so I get asked a lot what is the best voltage for oil cartridges and I always say new vapors start low and experience vapors already no but if you are ready to move up to the next step three point two or three point five always works for me it gives me a big inhale but I can still taste the flavor of the terpenes but everyone has their own preferences but just remember that continuing to vape at max voltage for too long will burn out the card from sooner too much power could burn out the coil resulting in a burnt product with an unpleasant taste but what about the myth of leaving it standing upright leaving it standing upright is a good rule of thumb to have so that when you're ready to vape the oil is sitting down at the bottom by the airflow holes oil stick and can take some time to reach the bottom if you leave it lying on its side but it's not something crucial if stored in the right conditions you shouldn't get any leaks so what happens if you see your oil change color down by the airflow holes this is just your oil changing its structure due to the introduction of air and usually sunlight air and sunlight can change the color of your oil darker over time this is okay your oil is still safe to vape darker oil just means that the vapor was probably left exposed to sunlight and has darkened the oil through oxidization how do I make my oil last longer well that's up to the consumption of the user but getting the most out of each draw can help you from taking rip after rip absorption does not happen well if you let the vapors sit in your mouth inhale it down into your lungs inhale it deep and hold it there so that your lungs can fully absorb the vapor be aware of the voltage your vaping at also high as high and low as low as long as your vape isn't leaking or firing off in your pocket you should be able to recognize how long the point-five part will usually last you there's no blanket answer here everyone beeps differently do you leave the cartridge attached to the battery or remove it after every use I assume you're asking this because you don't want oil the link into your battery you shouldn't experience leaking if you keep your card can stored under 70 degrees Fahrenheit but after the seven days the structure of the oil will change and you might experience in very small amounts of leakage depending on where you store it so if you're still using the same car after a week then yes I would say cap it and store it in some place cool outside of the battery how long do you leave it in the fridge for oil cards don't really have an expiration date storing it in the fridge is just a way to keep your cards cool and away from sunlight you can keep it there for a while but you also don't want accumulation of moisture that's why I don't recommend the freezer either I've never kept mine in little fridge for more than about a week so but if anybody has kept it in there for longer please leave a comment down below and let me know what your experience is can you review hollow tip cards no because they're unregulated is KRT vapes a real brand umm they are real but there are also unwritten to my understanding I recently messaged them on IG and I'm waiting for a response I also heard that the blacklist hosted their testing results for clarity and past but you already know how I feel about our detest our glow carts real they are unregulated muh meds they also are unregulated so sorry about that guys I know you're hoping for the best there is a fake brands to avoid lists that I follow they try to update as much as possible but there's just a lot of brands and it's hard to keep up but this is the list that I use it really helps me out I'll put a link down below it has hundreds of brands on there so check it out share it get friends knowledge and finally is it possible to burn out or overcharge my battery yes absolutely when I work for a cellphone company we were trained in battery awareness so cell phones laptops camera batteries and bait batteries all need to expel energy it's a good idea to let your batteries die sometimes before charge me especially when it's the first time you get it not letting your battery die or using it before it's finished charging are ways for the battery to keep dead energy and the battery will expand and bubble up and never allow you to reach 100% again so that'll do it for this video guys we hope it was helpful let us know if you have any other questions down in the comments below like share subscribe this video and as always stay safe do your research and never vape underage peace", "y4pOw07iA28": "today i'm going to be doing a review on the kind pen twist variable voltage 510 battery so to begin to turn this pen on you click it five times just like that if you click it twice it will start preheating at the bottom of the battery you have your heat settings right here so there's a little red dot right there you can move that from four volts to two and a half volts or actually 2 volts i got this kind pen battery about a week ago and it's become one of my favorite batteries it gives a pretty good hit every single time and the battery lasts a long time also uh it hasn't uh broken yet because i've had a lot of pens that just break even though i'm pretty careful with them this one seems to be pretty durable and it doesn't feel like it's gonna break so that's always a good sign but um yeah that's pretty much it about this pen it's a solid pen it came in a cool gray color so right here i got the kind pen pure i just wanted to do a little height comparison to show you how big this battery is compared to the pure they both pretty much fit in the palm of my hand i would definitely recommend this pen right here over the kind pen pure only because for the kind pen pure you need a magnet to attach to your cartridge and i lost that magnet so i can't use it anymore until i get another magnet but the good thing about this one is you can just screw the cartridge right into the top of it so that's one less thing to lose for this pen i paid 24.99 which isn't bad um this isn't the most basic model they have they had one for 19.99 but i think this one is worth the extra five bucks let me know what you guys think in the comments section thank you for checking out my video please thumbs up and comment in the comment section and yeah that's pretty much it peace you", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it

just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking

today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest report the results of a year-long NBC exclusive investigation where she uncovers an underground army of child laborers in Africa they are digging up a mineral being used in everyday cars planes and cell phones that's where I'll use them we'll put a link to the special report on dr. oz comm I'll be right back [Applause] [Music] be sure to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything and remember to check back often to see what's new", "IxckcK20ET8": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're gonna be doing some OpenCart surgery I'm just kidding we launched we've all been there a kit that is gonna take care of a problem that I know everybody who's in oil vaporizers has encountered which is your vaping your favorite cartridge and all of a sudden it stops working or you're vaping it down to where oil is no longer going into the orifice holes and you have a bunch of your valuable oil stuck at the bottom of the cartridge or your heater gives out or your disposable runs out of battery life but you have a cartridges no longer functioning which still has some of your precious oil CBD e-juice terpenes whatever and you want to try to excavate them so what honey stick did it was we made it really easy for you by launching our oil recovery kit which is everything that you need to help get a non-functioning cartridge that still has valuable oil in it out of the kit in today's episode we're gonna briefly run through the contents of this kit and how to use it to excavate oil out of your cartridge now just to backtrack a little bit the way that that we got this idea is actually one of our authorized distributors and my buddy Darrell over a rich mountain distribution he sent me a picture which I'm gonna make the video guy find and put up here on the YouTube screen as it said modern-day roaches and it showed a bunch of vape cartridges that are you know like quarter full or half full and not working laying around like you know people would have these Roach jars of these little collections of people have these little graveyards of non-working cartridges and vape accessories with oil left and so I was like man I showed that a couple of our employees just to get a laugh out of it and they were like oh I have one of those I have one of those I was like wow you know everybody must have one of those so let's make something to try to bring those non-working vape devices or the valuable contents in them back to life hence our oil recovery kit and let's make it affordable and easy to use so oil recovery kit available on WWE stay calm is gonna be selling for under ten bucks if you use the promo code that I'll give you guys at the end of the video you get an extra couple bucks off so let's jump right into what the kids contents are and how we generally use it so just to come this real simple plastic container which a lot of stores that because we whole sale and distribute a lot can have them just hanging in the stores so they have a little hanger here you're gonna get your kit you're gonna have your contents of the kit on the back let's get a little close-up so two filling syringes four blunt tips two syringe caps and some VG PG solution so let's go ahead and jump right in you just gonna open your kit and it's gonna slide right out you're gonna have a nice tray to keep all your stuff organized in and you're gonna have a really nice large instruction card here that basically explains very simply how to use this kit but we're gonna go through all this in the video so let's even though I briefly ran off the contents let's go through what we have here so you have two syringes these are two medical grade plastic syringes that you can use and this is used for excavating or rejecting your oils now these syringes they have a thread on them right in here which you will screw your your syringe blunt tip the into nice and firmly to pull pull the oil out or to re-inject the oil and when you're not using it if you have any oils in them you're gonna have these syringe caps right here which you're going to be able to use to seal up your syringe to make sure that you have no leaking all right so let's go through what type of blunt tips we have and what really they're used for on this side over here you have different you have different lengths of syringe needles because you're gonna have different cartridges and different devices where you might have to get down either deeper into the device or you might need a skinnier device to work with because certain cartridges for example they have a center post which doesn't give you that much space along the edges so you might need a skinnier needle to fit down in there or with certain cartridges you might have a thicker oil that you need a wider gauge needle just so that you can draw it out so here we have our thinnest gage oil and I'm going to use this just to kind of pry out here you have a very thin gauge needle let's get a close-up of that this is like a teal green color in our kit very thin it's about a about an inch in length the the shaft here is about an inch and a half and then no it's about an inch and it has a very thin opening you're not going to want to use this for any oils that are really thick you would mainly want to use this for thinner terpenes or for very thin oils or for CBDs or even for a liquid if you have it trapped in a cartridge don't use this for thicker oils and you might also be forced to use this if you have a very thin area between a cartridge and a center post to excavate your oils so this is a needle used for those devices now if we come down here to the gray needle blunt needle tip you'll notice it is slightly wider but the shaft here is only about half an inch now what you would use this for is you'd use this for slightly thicker oils or CBDs cartridges that aren't very deep because when you get down inside the cartridge the oil is more than likely to be trapped around the bottom so this would be more for larger tanks that have very open areas Torrey you can actually put the whole needle down in there to excavate your oil and this is also a good needle tip that is used for dispensing oil so once you've recovered your oil from being able to shoot it back into your cartridge because it's a very small it's a very agile you know you can you can point it down into places you don't have to worry about using something that is much longer that might be a little bit clumsy or when you're dispensing your oil so that's what you would use this needle for here it's a blunt needle tip so here we have four even thicker oils you have your kind of a kind of a Shrek green colored cartridge here or you know like a little Oscar the Grouch shade you have a thicker needle with a longer base this is gonna be for also for excavating out much thicker oils so the thickness and the needle you're gonna use for what type of thickness of material you're trying to draw out of your cartridge so make sure that you use the right and you know because if you have too thick of contents you use too thick of a needle it is just not going to draw out or it's gonna be very difficult so you have this needle is slightly thicker then if you come over here to the very far end you have a needle that's slightly thinner but longer so this is probably gonna be one your go-to stand that's why we showcase it because it's nice and long so you can get down inside cartridges it's not overly thick but the ring gauge of this needle is thick enough so it's gonna be all draw up a lot of the the thicker oils or sludgy oils now the other thing that we have that we explained here earlier is your needle covers they're gonna cover your syringes these don't cover the actual blunt needle tips but they will screw in once you've drawn oil out and you you're gonna store a syringe for later use you simply screw it in to the syringe and then it's sealed it makes a nice airtight you don't have to worry about leakage or anything like that you can put it up for storage now here we have some pg/vg solution now before my purists jumped into the comments section of this this video and start saying you don't want to mix out with your oils this is really only to be used in circumstances that you cannot draw the oil out that is too thick you cannot heat up the oils it's not it's not going to come out or there's just too little oil in there so what you would do is you would take some of this pg/vg which is available and you take it you put some into your cartridges close the cartridge up mix it around it'll give you something to draw out because if you're saving oil saving some oil and being able to vape it is better than being able to save no oil and vaping it so this is only really to be used in very difficult circumstances where you're not able to draw your oil or there's not as much oil in there to draw out it's really just you you add it in there you mix it around let it sit for a little bit and then you would go on with your excavation process so there's really for emergency situations where you would have something difficult to draw now let's go into what the procedure would be we're gonna do some much more specific videos of some of the customers if you guys can drop into the comments section below what cartridges you guys have had difficulty with so we can get the type of cartridge and make specific videos for how to excavate oil out of those cartridges that would be really helpful to us and we can make some really specific videos for other people who are having problems with and getting oil out of a specific cartridge how myself or James would go in there and go about maximizing the amount of oils you can salvage out of your cartridge that fail but I'm just gonna run through a real general kind of basic procedure of what you want to go through when you're looking at any cartridge to save some oil and as you guys comment we'll make some more specific videos and get them up here on the channel for you so first thing you want to do is you want to have your cartridge now I have these little styrofoam blocks in our shop because when we're buying a lot of cartridges that are made of glass it's really safe to ship them in these but what you want to do is you want to have a cartridge and you want to have it standing upright on a surface where you can get at it and perform a little bit of perform your excavation process without worrying about the cartridge falling over there falling out of your hand and breaking so these things are just really useful to have you can really easily just cut out a piece of foam or whatever use a small vise or something but you want to have your cartridge standing upright in on a stable area to where you can use both of your hands and not really worry about what you're gonna do this was actually a child lock cartridge so it's locked but you want to have it to where you can access it you can see it and you can use both hands to jump in and perform what you have to perform in there second of all most these oils especially colder temperatures a thicker before you start any excavation process you want to get your oil as viscous as possible you want you want that liquid to flow okay and be as thin as possible so you can pull it out easier so what I recommend is once you have it sitting there get a hairdryer and heat up the cartridge if you're in a warm climate state we're in Florida a lot of you guys are in sunny you know Southern California you can simply just walk outside and leave the cartridge outside for a few minutes and it'll it'll get really nice and thinned out take a hairdryer if you're gonna use a lighter make sure you don't put the lighter directly on the glass or plastic or whatever you're drawing it out of because you could compromise the cartridge you could you know burn it you can have it react with your oils you can melt a plastic one so if you're using a lighter or something be extremely cautious to hold it at a safe distance so you're only using the outside of the heat cone to get your cartridge warm you don't need to get hot you just need to get it warm and then once you're your contents in there they're about as thin as they can be then you're gonna go through and you're gonna select the appropriate tool that is gonna fit down in there but still be thick enough to draw out your liquids if I have a thicker oil that I'm using then I want to make sure that I'm using a nice as we mentioned before a nice wider gage syringe tip blunt needle tip which we're going with Shrek green and you want to make sure that it's gonna fit between the center post this one does fit however because this has an edge here I might want to use something a little bit thinner just so I can really get down into there this one is gonna work a little bit better now the thing is is because this come this specific cartridge comes in so close here I'm never gonna fully get everything that is around the orifice holes I'm if I kind of heat and then I tilt it and I come in at an angle so you're gonna have to play around with each specific cartridge certain other cartridges you're gonna be able to just jump right in there but it really depends on where the where where the base where how the base is how the center post is and how big of an opening you have to work with not each cartridge is gonna be the same you're gonna have to tinker and tamper around with them a little bit which is why I'm really encouraging you guys to drop into the video section brand names of cartridges you guys seem to be having problems with so we can do really cartridge specific videos but I've taken our performer tank for example which has a really open surface that you can get into so it's really not going to be picky as to which blunt needle tip you're gonna work down and get in there with okay and I've even had our sub-ohm which for example if you had a heat or go out and you're trying to pull your oils out I have it open here it's not gonna be picky you could basically fit the whole syringe in there so what you're gonna do is you're gonna select your proper cartridge make sure there's the needle plunger here that's what they call this a plunger it's completely pushed in okay then you could take this and you can make sure that's firmly screwed in there so it's locked in there then once you've made it down heat it up the cartridge you go down in there and you very slowly place the needle down to the bottom but you don't push it down to the bottom to where the needle cannot draw up the oils or get off air this works on air suction from you guys who aren't familiar with it and then you're gonna very slowly just draw up the oils don't reject them and draw them up so that when you're drawing it the oil doesn't get stuck here in the in the the syringe valve and the so as you draw it up the oil is gonna travel up here even if you see that you've pulled all the oils out give this an extra pull so you don't have any oils that are stuck inside the blunt needle tip because if you just take it out of the cartridge and you stop you stop withdrawing and you take this off you can have a significant amount of oil stuck in any portion of here so you want to make sure to keep drawing so the oil makes its way past the blunt needle tip as well as the base and makes its way into the syringe and once you've drawn it out take one of your syringe caps here with the kit take off your blunt needle tip you can drop this in the isopropyl alcohol right away to clean it if you do have some stuck in there then take whatever new cartridge you would be filling it in to use your other syringe [ __ ] it back a little bit screw it on and then push down and it will shoot the oil the air pressure will shoot the oil into whatever the little remaining oils into whatever cartridge you are placing it into so that's just a little tip there once you have this sealed you can store these syringes even though it says discard after use that is for safeties you don't want to be constantly you know mixing stuff but these are cleanable you do have to clean them after every use if you're gonna reuse them we will be selling extra bulk syringes on the website so you guys don't have to buy the whole kit at one shot we will be putting those up a little bit later but this should serve as a very useful kit for those of you who have experimented with cartridges or just any type of oils or CBD mixing or injecting you definitely want to have one of these definitely come in handy I mean we've already had half of our employees have already taken them to go work on their graveyard of cartridges so definitely get a lot of use out of this get it will be

and may wish to see more so will follow with a detailed step-by-step guide to the installation and operation of our new 810 hotshot systems for openers you're looking at the number one reason you need our hotshot 1500 speed at the rate you're now watching you can fill this entire tray of 50 carts in a few ticks under 2 minutes without removing them from vendor-supplied foam blocks we'll show you how in the demo for now let's do the math 50 carts in 2 minutes 1500 carts an hour 12,000 filled cartridges in a single eight-hour day from single a 10 hotshot system reason to control and precision fill any volume cart from point 3 3 grams to one full gram with total volume control in point 0 1 gram increments point zero 1 reason 3 flexibility use our Hot Shot 1500 to fill any oil viscosity use it to swap out batches mid-run use it to quickly and precisely fill almost any style vape cart pen or syringe speed precision flexibility you're 100 percent card filling solution our new 810 hotshot systems are available in two models and both are detailed at hotshot cool jars comm check them out right now however there's a lot to know about the new a 10 and you probably have some questions so here's an in-depth up-close very detailed look how to put our new hotshot to work let's start with system setup this is the super speed 810 hotshot 1500 the fastest of the two models cool jars offers it weighs around 15 pounds and takes up about 2 square feet of table space just make sure it's on a stable level surface to start find the 16 ounce bottle of blue heat transfer fluid and pour the entire contents into the blue reservoir now slide the Innova stainless-steel immersion heating element into the reservoir twisting slightly to make sure it's fully seated positioned correctly you'll see three dimples level with the top of a reservoir next mount our black nonstick oil tank onto the a10 to ensure proper connection align this white cam with the slot in the a10 press down firmly until seated then turn clockwise to lock in place here's something that will interest you our oil tanks features self sealing one-way check valve so you can swap out tanks and batches mid run to remove the tank turn counterclockwise to unlock then pull straight up model 1500 comes with two oil tanks and you can order additional tanks as an option more about swapping tanks later next install an a-10 oil injection needle our component kit contains needles of varying sizes which gives you options to fit style cards your filling we suggest you select the shortest length you can to lessen pressure on internal piston assembly and thread the needle into port and use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit to tighten being careful not to over tighten now install your selected fill switch in our high-performance model 1502 options are available our new button activated speed tray plus our foot activated fill pedal both options plug into the USB port on the left front side of the a10 we'll use our new speed tray for purposes of this demonstration next connect power source plug the round mail and the power transformer into the rear of the a10 control box now plug the transformer and the Innova heating element into a switched power surge strip that's rated for at least 10 amps that's it for system setup let's talk about operation first activate the a-10 system by powering up the surge strip now power up the Innova heating element by pressing the red button on front of the display panel the button will display white when activated quick note press and hold this button for a few seconds to switch readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius press and hold again to switch back select whichever scale you prefer now pour desired amount of batch oil into the nonstick tank it will hold any amount up to one thousand grams per tank cover with lid next adjust system operating temperature using the thumb wheel on front of the Innova display rolled up to increase roll down to decrease you can adjust the Nova in 1/2 degree increments an initial setup adjust he's set into 170 degrees Fahrenheit to fully heat the a-10 system and set the onboard heat switch this is important when the a-10 system is fully heated actual oil temperature will be anywhere from twenty to thirty degrees lower than the Innova setting depending on viscosity of oil use a heat gun to determine the actual oil temperature then adjust the Innova as necessary to reach your desired oil temperature once the a-10 system is activated the main touchscreen will light up the screen will not show operational controls until a system and oil are fully heated if attempts are made to operate system prior to heating this waiting for heater message will be displayed when operational controls appear on the touch screen the a-10 is ready for use use a test screen for all inputs first select this casa t from one of three options available on the model 1500 olive oil glycerin and honey select the option that best describes the estimated miss custody of your batch at fil temperature now select shot size from one of three options point three three grams point five grams at one gram a custom setting is also available volumes are adjustable in point zero one gram increments next select speed using the up and down arrows on the five bar graph each bar represents a 20% increase or decrease in fill speed finally select end count to input the number of fills you wish to perform once desired fill count is reached the a 10 will stop flow of oil to reset press hole to reset for a few seconds to zero out the reading with these few settings in place they're ready to go following initial setup first prime or purge 18 system by holding a container under needle and pressing fill switch several times until oil is dispensed returned priming oil to main tank so you don't waste it next test cartridge fill volume using a very precise scale weigh the container you're using to prime the system inject a shot then weigh container again the difference will be the shop volume repeat as necessary adjusting volume on touchscreen to achieve desired amount adjustments can be made in point 0 1 gram increments as an alternative volume testing procedure way an empty cart before and after filling and make any necessary adjustments once made these volumes will remain consistent throughout the batch now let's fill some cards the a-10 model 1500 features a new high volume speed tray with a button activated fill switch it is really really fast to use it cut a typical vendor-supplied 100 card foam block in half and place a 50 cart block in speed tray this lets you fill carts directly in the block instead of removing and filling one by one now position needle in corner cart inject pre-measured fill using onboard switch and move on to the next cart you will be absolutely amazed at the speed you can achieve with our new 8n hotshot with speed tray once comfortable with the process you can typically fill this tray of 50 carts and something under 2 minutes even a 2 minutes per tray that's 1,500 carts an hour and that's 12,000 carts a day if you prefer to use our foot-activated fill switch there's no need to cut a hundred cart foam block unless you prefer to fill smaller quantities so you can cap them quicker simply position the foam block under injection arm insert needle in the corner cart depress foot pedal to inject each shot and move on when you fill 50 cards on one side reverse block and Faure it could not possibly be quicker and easier incidentally flow rates will depend on a number of factors including viscosity of oil heat of oil size of carts etc you can fine-tune your fills by adjusting viscosity speed and shot size settings to achieve optimum flow rate finally we'd like to show you a few quick procedures that will keep your oil processing operation running smoothly first a quick needle change demo use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit unscrew the needle and return the kit insert new needle tighten lightly with tool and you're good to go next a tank change if you're changing in the middle of a batch run the tank will be warm so make sure you're wearing gloves turn tank counterclockwise to unlock and pull straight up a check valve will stop the flow of oil though you may have a few residual drops to wipe up now insert a fresh tank it can be empty full or partially full twist a lock and you're ready to rock fix maybe 30 seconds since we're talking about the tank if you wish to do a total clean-out and would like to replace oring in the valve first remove tank as previously described and empty remove valve with three-quarter inch socket using six in one tool in the kit without the bit push up spring-loaded valve to reveal Oh ring remove old ring with a single edge razor blade replace the spare o-ring in the kit we install valve with socket and you're done additional earrings are available on our website if you're having problems achieving a consistent shot size it may be a partial blockage of the upper or lower valve due to oil residue here's how to replace both for the upper valve remove tank as previously

anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "orIZ08AVNLs": "what is up guys welcome back to more with tk i've been procrastinating i i've had this phone now for a little bit over two weeks this is the motorola one five g ace as you guys can see right here you can tell i'm traveling by my beautiful luxurious don't worry about that um so what can i say about this phone like right off the top is it is it worth the money this one um i actually picked it up through google fi it was 279 bucks 5g unlocked now for me had it been more of you know i could activate it via esim and then have a regular sim like it'd be better but when you can pick up right now at t-mobile uh you can pick up a pixel 4a 5g which is probably going to get updates faster than this in my opinion has a better camera and arguably a better display for 350 and this is 280 it's like you just spend a little bit more money and you get the better product that's just my opinion now does the phone suck um you know it's it's i will give motorola credit for a couple things they are making 5g phones affordable right they have made it where you know and oneplus was already doing that with the nord series at metro and t-mobile so this is nothing new but you know to look at this and see you see to look at this and see like the display is fairly decent we're gonna get into like specifics on the phone here in just a minute like the display is fairly decent um it it's it's fairly responsive it's fairly responsive but there's so many there's so many other phones at this price point that just do it better and i don't want to rag completely on the cameras and stuff on this but jesus christ they're horrible um for me and i know for everybody else on youtube it's all about photos and how good of a camera can take a picture of a phone like that you know can take pictures with a phone like this but for me it's about video and with the automotive channel and the the um aeronautical channel and and the finance all the other youtube channels that i run here on youtube when i'm out and about if my sony dies you know if my a7 iii dies then i go to the iphone or to or to the s21 ultra or whatever my phone of choice is now it's not fair for me to compare this phone to say an s21 ultra no i agree 100 but when you make the big thing about your big 48 megapixel quad camera setup on the rear and you put all of these settings in here where this thing is supposed to be a monster and you know it's supposed to do let's see here yeah it only it will do 4k in 30. if you go to 60 it only does it in 1080p what that's okay for a cheap phone um but it was you know you have all of these different settings and stuff where you think you're getting a camera that's going to be super capable or a super decent uh phone right well i mean as a phone because it is motorola let me just get to that too as a physical phone um i will say as far as dialing and making an everyday phone call and holding it to the audio and stuff if you use it just to make a phone if you're using it just to make text messages and stuff this is a good phone just like anything else if you're using it to be a smart or you're using it because you want to like have entry level and decent content creation don't buy this phone the camera is uh uh uh i can't even say it's passable to say best i'm just oh oh all right uh fingerprint sensor it's okay it works sometime yeah i think lg has the best back mounted fingerprint sensor but that's just me um and again recovering back over onto the display let me turn the camera around and show you what i'm talking about all right so just taking a look at the display on this it's decent like i said it's it's definitely passable okay you can you can all and it's also definitely passable for you to get a decent uh you can get decent photos decent um decent photos decent video and like i said for the everyday like for your grandma for your kid that's like 12 years old and then you want to get them a nice smart phone then get them one that's fine but for the average everyday american or not even american just the average everyday person because you could pick this up in other countries too is this thing worth it for what you can get for the same money elsewhere and i have to say nah i mean it just it feels cheap the fingerprint thing is a little nuts it does drive me a little crazy all right the cameras are not great the display is good it's okay it's not bad but for other phones that you can get in this price point this freaking screen sucks okay now here's why i give i give motorola some credit right you know it does it does what it's supposed to do like i said it's just it's a decent phone for the money uh it's not but for what people i saw the people posting reviews on this phone it was like this is a great phone if you're starting out and you want to do content creation the camera on this let me just say as an old phrase that we have here it is guarantee i can tell you right now it's not porn ready man it's just not it's just not porn ready but anyways just a first impressions video for me on this you guys were asking me about it i'm about to go to the track you see my lid right here time for me to go racing but um look man in my opinion there's better phones at the price point like i said earlier in the video the pixel 4a you can get for 350 right now 3 5g the 5g version the big boy 350 bucks right now if you have a lovely phone laying around or here's a little network hack idea um you know look if you're gonna use it on another network say it's like metropcs or something like that anyway or qriket for example you can go get a free iphone se on cricut or maybe it's like 99 bucks um and then you get your plan and do your thing you can trade that phone in and it will eat up 180 bucks of that 350 at t-mobile um or you know like there's there's ways to make moves where you can even get that pixel 485 g for cheaper than you can buy this phone that's all i'm saying um y'all can figure out the scum baggery i'm just giving you an idea but yeah man like i said it's not it's not a bad phone i just can't say spend your 280 bucks on this because there's way too many other good options on the market that said um if you liked today's video let me know by smashing the thumbs up button you know i said i was going to get more away from doing tech stuff over here and doing other stuff and um we might do that i might migrate my tech stuff over somewhere else we'll see that's a whole nother conversation but um you guys asked me about it i bought it i checked it out i actually used it with my sim card in it for two weeks and um it sucks so now i know someone just said tk motorola is never gonna send you anything i don't care i don't care i don't care nobody sends me nothing i buy my own stuff i buy all my phones so i don't care i'm giving you an honest opinion so if anything that should let you know up front i definitely didn't get this for free and i wasn't tickling somebody's ball sack to get this phone and i wouldn't recommend you do that anyway anyways with that said have a wonderful day hope you enjoyed the video catch y'all in our next one", "HgOezWgEGjw": "it started with two

"MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "ajCmAbusdHw": "hey guys what's up its Keith Ville here with the CVD stored comm so what I want to show you today is how to take those old cartridges and basically just refill them okay so it's pretty simple now there's a few different cartridges out there so this one here let me just move my mic out of the way but this one here what you do is you just simply unscrew the top okay if you can see that so now what you do is there's a little rubber piece here and you're gonna pull that out and you just want to make sure that you don't lose this little rubber piece say see the hole at the top okay so now what you do is you just take your refill container and there's a mail that will just go right into the female there of the cartridge once you fill it up all three quarters of the way or you know just below the top just put that little rubber piece back in let's screw that on hand tight like that and there you go and you can refill these cartridges right now there's different ones there's also um this is a thicker 350 milligram CBD oil so this one here screws off as well but it basically the top doesn't screw it off it screws off on the bottom so on this one you're gonna fill this up to the line max okay because when you put this back in what this is going to do is gonna push that oil all the way to the top so if you fill that glass all the way to the top and you put that plunger back in you're going to I'm spill the oil all over the place okay so this is what it looks like when you have it unscrewed okay this is the other part of the cartridge okay this is the mouthpiece and you're just gonna put that back in like that and screw that in so these are great when you buy a few of these what you can do is just refill them okay so you don't have to throw these out and a lot of folks don't know that so again you just unscrew this here and again you see that plunger now you could actually clean this out if you have a particular flavor in here that you know you could actually just clean that out with a a simple brush to get all that out of there or just rinse it out with some hot water but that's it you just put that together like that and not many people realize that you can filled with cartridges pump okay guys so that's it hey this is Keith with the cvd store look for some more videos guides we've got some great new products we've got the um some bee's knees 1000 I'm sorry 1200 and 3,000 added to the site those are on force we have our new 1000 milligram vape oil that is on the site that's in 12 different flavors so check us

certain vaping products that have chemical additives and Denver sevens Jacqueline Allen is joining us now and this follows reports that those chemicals are related to a very deadly illness that's right hundreds of people across the country have been diagnosed with this mysterious symptoms and now one chain that used to sell these products is calling for the entire industry to take a stand I went four cartridges today at this medicine man in Aurora customers can still buy vape supplies two canisters cartridges kat tanner just did the wakey stuff not the sleepy stuff but what's pulled from shelves here starting today any vape products with chemical additives propylene glycol or vitamin E acetate not everyone's happy if you're old enough to smoke or vote or die for your country then you can be smart enough to make your own health decisions it's only temporary you know I'd like to see I'd like to see some more research go into it before becomes a total ban nationwide vape products are seeing a 15 percent drop in sales although medicine man is the first Colorado chain to pull products and in an email to Denver 7 the CEO writes they only pulled a small number of vape cartridges saying there is no proof that this product is harmful and it is not related to the recent vape deaths those were primarily black market products we just did this so that our customers only receive uncut products at Colorado's only research licensed lab for cannabis chemists recently warned about a tie between vaping contaminants and a mysterious illness don't use anything that has propylene glycol vegetable glycerin MCT or anything else as a as a carrier and while medicine man is calling for other dispensaries to pull the products we checked with some of the largest chains in Colorado to see if they are and these companies either could not comment tonight or did not respond I'm not surprised I'm not going to touch another vape Tom Kelly used to vape but thinks it's time the entire industry be shut down if not by the government by one dispensary at a time I asked medicine man what specific products they're pooling and the CEO said they're not releasing the brand names because they don't want the companies to sustain collateral damage from that decision and interesting Thank You Jacqueline instead of punishing and suspending students caught vaping on campus the Douglas

50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available

did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "F8WG4RYHTpM": "if you guys clicked

logo right here we got some Eden Oh one thing about this - that I do like about this brand is that they have this brand hold on Cheers hmm tastes just like it bro tastes just like jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my

you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them especially this one and

first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't function high but it gives you like the [ __ ] right high like it's just as cool as to this fire I like it looking everybody we do not condone the usage of these products I'm Marti warning you guys and shit's not healthy for you even though you know it is it is approved you know it is government approved and all that [ __ ] but I do not condone the usage and I'm not promoting any sales or I don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody this is all an educational you know we're [ __ ] we're inside we're in the backyard you know cousin's backyard I take out a pen and I'm puffing on actually I'm like and I started coughing like I'm like I had a heavy hitter I think yeah I was like a heavy hitter right and I was like dude I'm like oh I'm [ __ ] I'm like damn so lately my cousin hit it again he's older than me he was like at the time he was like 26 and I was like 21 or some [ __ ] yes I said he starts coughing and one of our uncles like he's hella cool whatever you know he's cause dude he comes through he's like smoking his cigarette and he's like he's like what is that and I'm like oh this is a he's like he's like is that babe and we're like nice it's teach it's pretty much teach THC vape 16 C babe what the [ __ ] Hey they have [ __ ] like that and he's old school you know so I'm just like am I like Dan you never had this sheen there he does you know that he's like yeah and that we're like ganna try this [ __ ] out and he takes some red Bull he takes a rip oh [ __ ] [ __ ] man but think about it this was a Stoke head this guy loves stones anyway he's like this will [ __ ] um he rips that [ __ ] right he [ __ ] starts coughing all that she's like - his spies I would you get that she's I just go to the club you know go to the campus club he's like oh she's like I just and they're like oh we just like looked out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit because I used two views that [ __ ] and I would wake up like three four in the morning cough my lungs

this hippie headband channel this is a channel where we review carts and we review beat moments now before anything I want to start by saying thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to come watch this video thank you so much now today we got a little special product for you guys last video I did a little dancreep review purple punch not gonna lie to you change it changed my perspective on take beeps was not bad at all but now today you know we came in we came through with another dispensary [ __ ] I got two products for you guys today but I'm only gonna be reviewing one we got the new kingpins this is the Skywalker og which is an indica this is the gelato which is a hybrid now these are the new newest newest boxes so before I open this up I'm gonna show you guys how to make sure that you know if you get these new boxes and how not to get scammed so with these new boxes [Music] instead of having the seal that was more of you know it was it was kind of patched on this is fully printed on so this is on here you can't scratch that off for nothing like this this is on the actual box it still has all the same information it still has the manufacturer date the best body the batch number everything like that you know I'm saying and of course ingredients just cannabis oil and then of course one second draw is a single-serving you know they always say that but you know for today let's try out this gelato so today we're gonna be trying out this gelato kingpin next time why have the Skywalk OG the reason why don't want to do the Skywalker og just just as yet I had the Skywalker og strain and man oh man it is a night night hitter like the Skywalk OG is very strong in - that's the thing was trying to have you do it just it just have you all types are completely gone so let me start right here by Samuel it says on here this is July - of course a thousand milligrams the THC amount is seventy seven point 38 percent total THC is seven hundred and seventy-three point seventy six milligrams there's zero point thirty percent CVD and it's 2.99 excuse milligrams of CVD so push I already know C so don't judge me we're using a plastic knife today to open these up yeah sorry for that that didn't work so we're doing the crackhead way the only choices now if y'all haven't have this tool you need to use this please don't use this tool I done damaged up the box oh yeah I forgot whole sides both sides both sides now a lot of people was saying that with the kingpins you can get the stickers online don't be real with you for you to try to take this thicker Zoff as you can see watch I'm trying to take a sticker off and show you guys you can tell if it's tampered with you see how dingy and everything on top of that looks already so you can put like no and look I've ripped it off and you see what happened the whole bottom came on you bro you you know what you didn't when you know what you're getting this very very hard to do it with that look and I rip off the other side look what happened same thing with the other side you can't just rip you know rip them apart put a new one in there these kingpins are different they're different I mess with them heavy heavy heavy oh okay okay with these new boxes they went back with the regular black of course got the insert [Music] [Applause] [Music] got that my stinker there it is right there as you guys can see of course has the grommet of course has the grommet on each side just take off the holes take off the top let's take off the bottom this one no leakage at all I mean the last one was months and months and months old I live on the East Coast so to ship it and whatever it's been stored it kind of makes sense that it was a little bit of leakage so you know for that last King and it kind of makes sense with no leakage at all for this which should be expected the fact that it only has been manufactured about a month ago and other thing about the king pins where I don't know if you guys could really see but what the king pins being on here there's an actual physical reflection that's all in the back of it that reflects everything that says gonna sit on it so on the back of it it basically has the exact same thing as this kingpin is it has the kingpin man what is right honest so of course as usual we're using the yoke and mini today fully fully fully fully charged today for this video have a whole day rest in peace - Dex screw this all I [Music] [Music] [Music] already know kingpin oil is so thick so big so thick all right let's get to it let's get to it person oh what's the justice real quick let's give this a fool I remember with this review we reviewed three things we review the color taste and how medicated they get you but of course that says reach full its peace right now I can't I can't I can't pinpoint an exact taste but I said this again [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm sorry for that oh [ __ ] oh wait that just felt like my ancestors came back and slept this [ __ ] out of me for every wrong thing I just did what the [ __ ] gotta take this drink of this Depot ooh oh man let's take another three-second hit again [Music] so I mess up with this heavy and this is a hybrid - I'm messing with this heavy heavy but you guys already know always give you guys a 15 minute prelude to tell you guys the effects so that's what I'm gonna do we don't take one more hit right now and at this I'm I'm a class back in with you guys and tell you guys the effects what's up I'm clocking back in with you guys you know I'm saying it's been more than this move 115 minutes actually made of this video already looked at it I didn't like it so let's do our ratings taste I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact that I don't have like actual gelato tastes but I will say one out of five which is gonna be a ruby it's definitely only a three at the highest three entire three second we're gonna get to the color really nice color [Music] [Music] nice honey-colored so I would give that a fire of course and last but not least it's actually a really good balance of a hybrid - this is so for that I would definitely campaign so thank you for staying tuned for everyone that stayed tuned for this home time video and watch this video I appreciate you guys tenfold it's been hard to get a lot of these premium products that you see me getting now but I'm trying hard for you - I'm really trying hard you know I'm saying I get a lot of negativity and I'm not ever gonna respond to it I'm sorry because there's a lot of things people don't know what's going on in my life one time one last thing you find me this is the team hippie she's all team hippies and I'm appreciated all your team hippies and supporters has been going up and beyond for your boy so thank you to all my hippies thank you to all my hippies older keep me up on my social for anything if you guys ever want to see when something's coming out beforehand snapchat and I will see you guys later so I just want to thank everyone for tuning in like comment and subscribe and peace Oh", "880TLs3fjmg": "okay so I'm gonna show you how do you save my oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over sometimes I like to put it on a little bit of an edge so that way it will stick to that glass and that is how that is set up right [Music]", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now

"t5Mtbx-W0D4": "hey guys dr. Shawn Mira vici here and I'm gonna do another cannabis product review for you despite all the craziness happening in the world right now with Koba 19 I'm practicing very strict social distancing but that doesn't mean I can't keep doing product reviews for you so today we have the another vape cartridge product using the 510 thread system today is going to be the sundial Zen very also known as shish kebob and so this comes from sundial growers they're based in Alberta some things of note about this company is that they really emphasize that they're putting out pure products meaning that they're free from additives fillers and artificial flavorings so you know you're getting a really pure product they do a glass and ceramic cartridge so a very high quality cartridge and they use single strain extracts so it's kind of like a single malt scotch meaning that your extracts just coming from one strain rather than a mix of different strains a lot of the other cartridges out there are really a mix of a bunch of different strains so kind of cool that this is a single strain extract it comes in at around 72 to 82 percent THC meaning that it's very strong THC level it's available on the Ontario cannabis store retailing for about 49 actually it's exactly forty nine ninety-five putting it into sort of the middle midpoint range in terms of price for for a vape cartridge but I don't mind paying a little bit extra if I'm getting a really good quality product so let's open it up it's also got a sort of a unique box most of the other fake cartridges I've received come in this paper box this one is this plastic round container and you open up by you see those notches you match up the notches there and then you pull it open or at least you try to pull it open yeah there we go okay let's pull it out you could take a look at that looks really nice it's got their logo there a nice glass container and the tip feels really nice too so you could tell it's high-quality and that just fits into your 510 cartridge battery system you screw that in there okay and then you're ready to go one thing I also wanted to mention about this particular strain is that they're terpene profile includes cario Filene Mersin and humulin and alluding to its name they say that you're gonna get like a nice sort of berry flavor with this vapor and I agree so you'll notice like it doesn't really taste obviously like berries but there is sort of this hint of barrenness in the flavor i had previously ordered the aurora indica cartridge and that was just like really just straight-up like cannabis ii flavor this one definitely has a hint of barrenness to it so i've been using this for the past three four days not a huge long time but but I do like the vapor it's nice and smooth it's got that sort of berry finish to it it is quite strong and it's a creeper meaning that you don't really feel this one right away it sort of creeps up on you after about 10 minutes so definitely go slow with this one because it will sort of creep up the effects and they are quite strong so it is quite calming it hits Li you like in a whole body way but it's very short-lived like it only lasts 60 to 90 minutes and then you kind of feel a little sleepy afterwards so I wouldn't recommend this as a daytime strain definitely best suited for evening nighttime use and that's really what I've noticed about this product is that it's strong but the effects wear off quite quite soon after so like an hour to an hour and a half taking all of those factors into account so you know a good quality product stressing that it's added to three which you know is what I want in a vape cartridge it it's that single strain all around like a high quality product but the effects are short-lived and the price is sort of mid to high range so taking all those into consideration I'm gonna give this one an 8 out of 10 good product a couple limitations with it but but there you have it the sundial Zen berry thanks for watching be sure to subscribe if you like this content and want to see more content like this and i'll be back with another product review for you shortly", "YLRMMGW3ihM": "this is a really nice neighborhood homes in the half-a-million dollar range neighbors tell me the young men lived in this home and were renting it and they're surprised to hear what was happening inside cash guns pot and fifty five thousand dollars worth of cartridges containing THC the main compound in marijuana that gets you high this is what MCS OHS drug suppression task force seized from inside this home north of carefree highway and east of 27th Drive last week Thursday I'm just blown away that it happened here today neighbors were too shocked to talk on camera just a really quiet very friendly neighborhood I think the thing that we learned is this kind of thing can happen anywhere you know this can happen in any neighborhood deputies arrested Tucker Reis and Colby Stevens both 23 years old the two are accused of manufacturing the illegal vape cartridges the same kind found throughout the US and linked with recent vaping deaths Sheriff Paul Penn's own says he's not surprised I'm more so concerned and that's what this is right now we see the deaths across the country and in different forms because of things are being ingested he expects more busts like this one to happen because demand for the product is so high we can't wait for this become an epidemic problem we need to get in front of it the suspects now face several felony charges including conspiracy in Phoenix Maria hatch Innova for Arizona's family", "P1TkKEDw8uI": "it's been found in neighboring states now it's arrived in Northeast Ohio an old drug with a new twist the feds now seeing a lot more of it on streets across Northeast Ohio and Tracy Carlos live in the newsroom with another story you will only see on News 5 Tracy Frank tanita its THC an active ingredient in marijuana and it is now being used for vaping we're seeing a lot of it a lot of THC cartridges for vape pens cartridges similar to these that we found on the internet are now in the hands of DEA agents here in Cleveland it's illegal its THC it's marijuana the vape cartridges are filled with THC oil it's a chemical out of marijuana from marijuana from the plant it's extracted and it's mixed in with another substance and then placed into a cartridge and ultimately sold on the street recently DEA agent seized more than 15 thousand of them that will not make it onto the streets I would say we were surprised at the amount you know that's a lot when you're seeing you know thousands of those on the streets there have been seizures like this in neighboring states as well Indiana Pennsylvania and now here in Northeast Ohio assistant Special Agent in Charge Keith Martin told me once out of the box the drug is nearly impossible to detect can be smoking it and it's it may not be present in other words we wouldn't know you could be sitting next to somebody who's smoking a THC cartridge and you might not even know it and big bucks come along with a THC filled cartridges in Pennsylvania for example police seized not only the drugs but 3.5 million dollars as well live in the newsroom Tracy Carlos news 5", "gqGxit_NiQ4": "what's up guys be green 91 and today we're checking out one of the first legal vaporizer cartridges in the Canadian recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "bArnVbQVRdQ": "federal authorities are cracking down on dangerous materials on airplanes and the latest

lava core heated oil cartridge filling gun now a lot of you may be saying well what the heck is that well stick around to the end of the video I'll demonstrate it but here's what comes inside of the box you get the unit itself the heating unit and then the gun there's a couple of tubes that will show you what you use those for there's an instruction manual of course there's also going to be a power core to supply it the gun itself as you can see there a couple of tips and some additional washers and o-rings now let's take a closer look at the front of the device you'll see the LED control panel and the heating lights and the connector where you'll connect the actual heating gun itself at the back there is a rocker switch to turn the power on and off and the plug for the provided on a 20 volt outlet at the tip of the gun is where you will put the attachments there's a little pin or a needle type attachment that you'll use to fill cartridges with the middle of the gun is the chamber that's graduated to show the 25 milliliter capacity then there's a rotating dial that will let you dial the output of the gun from a half a milliliter all the way up to two and a half milliliters for different size cartridges there's a release mechanism that will let you release the plunger that pulls and pushes the oil in and out of the heated chamber at the end there also as an adaptor or a fitting where the rubber hose will go that you use to pull up the oil the function and features are pretty simple you power it on the top light the red one shows you the current temperature and then the green one at the bottom shows you the set to temperature and you hit set and then you use the arrows the directional arrow to the left to scroll between singles to ten to the hundred degree range and then the up and down arrows to set the actual temperature and then it heats up automatically [Music] and now for the usage of the gun the gun is intended for filling oil cartridges of 510 thread or what ever kind of oil cartridges the size you use but the tube that you see there is used to put down into the VAT of oil that you're using and then to draw it up into the gun you then use the trigger to push out the excess air that may have accumulated in turn filling then you put the tip on and then you set the size cartridge that you have I have half a milliliter cartridges here so I set the gun to half a milliliter and pop every time I squeeze it it puts the exact right amount into the cartridge of course this is probably for more for manufacturers than individual use but if you

be going over three ways to salvage your oil cartridges from empty or broken cartridges so whether you drop your bait pin break the cartridge glass in the process or your oil cartridges almost empty you just want to get those small remnants just below the airflow hole or maybe a cartridge is faulty and it just hasn't worked from the start here's a few quick reasons why you shouldn't throw away your cartridges just yet so the easiest way to get the most oil out of your cartridge is with a syringe but let's say we don't have one so we're gonna resort to some more primitive methods but first you're gonna need a few things plastic bowl ziplock bag a microwave and a sheet of foil you can also use a zig zag paper rolls if you don't have any foil if you want to transfer oils from one cartridge to another then you're gonna need a new empty cartridge too if your cartridge glass is shattered into pieces you run the risk of transferring oils with small shards in them and I don't recommend that but if it's just cracked and it's leaky then it shouldn't work all the same just be gentle with it but first put the oil cartridge that you want to transfer oil from into a ziploc bag and zip it up and set it aside for right now second is to get your plastic bowl and fill it with water then take it and put into the microwave for about two to three minutes or until you see it's steamy third step is to take the bowl out for the microwave and place the bag with the cartridge inside of it again make sure that's airtight so no water gets in and just pop it in there for about 2 minutes place the sheet of foil down on a flat clean surface this will act as your work station to catch any oils and then take the mouthpiece off of the cartridge and make sure that the heating post is exposed after about two minutes of the cartridge being inside the water bowl take it out remove the mouthpiece usually use a napkin or towel because it's gonna be hot and once the mouthpiece is off flip it upside down directly mirroring of the cartridge below and just set it right on top and I promise you that the balancing act is a lot more easier than it looks make sure not to get any oils down the heating post because that's where the airflow comes from heat makes oil less viscous and allows it to run so the oil should just slide right into the cartridge if you don't want to transfer your oils to another cartridge you can just put them directly on a cake batter or cookie dough you can also place the cartridge upside down on the foil to let it catch the oils and use it for later sort of the refrigerator use it for dabbing or use a dab tool to peel it off and put on your dry herbs once your oils are transferred to the new cartridge place the mouthpiece back on and you're ready to date so we hope this video was helpful to you guys if you have any other questions please leave them down in the comments below and subscribe to god me for more videos like this teeth", "f-zCVt_jgh0": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a new to us vape company and that is ocean cannabis co with their live resin uh today we are going to be reviewing their straw nana strain uh this is the one gram variety rocking 84 thc and 90 and a quarter percent uh total cannabinoids in there uh you usually see that big discrepancy in thc and tac uh when it is live resin because it has all those other cannabinoids that are usually lost in the process uh theoretically should be in here um so being a live resin cartridge uh it was on the more expensive end but cheaper uh than most live resin i've seen uh this one gram cartridge cost me i believe 63 dollars with tax in long beach california which again puts it on the uh more expensive end for a one gram cartridge but on the cheaper end for a one gram live resin cartridge uh so what are some other cool things about it well i really uh am kind of i was intrigued by their whole sort of marketing pitch and the reason they're called ocean cannabis co it seems like a pretty admirable goal to me uh they say on the back that they use all recycled materials in their packaging uh including plastic that has been pulled from the ocean uh so i looked at their website it's a husband and wife combo duo who are uh the head of ocean cannabis co uh and some percentage of the plastic that is in their packaging is pla comes from plastic that was uh extruded from the good old pacific ocean uh which is replete with plastic debris um i'm guessing you know it's probably not a whole lot of pla it's um hard to imagine it's made any kind of a dent but you know it's an admirable goal nonetheless uh so let's go ahead and get into it here this is standard 510 thread stuff so just your normal battery uh ah and here is that plastic that i was talking about that has uh some of it is uh ocean garbage which is again pretty neat i'd love to know the exact percentage the little press release i read online was pretty uh you know a little self-serving and smug but uh it's a cool again i do not want to dilute the coolness okay uh so we've got some different kind of child proofing here that i've not seen uh a line leaf with dot and push up okay so we're gonna line this leaf with these dots there's a little leaf there at the top it's kind of hard to see and it looks like it's lined with the dots and we're just gonna pull off perfect easy enough and there we are i found it curious that their website doesn't focus so much on the actual uh it focuses almost exclusively on their packaging and very little on the actual oil itself their their um their product they're trying to get you to consume uh but here it is and it does look fine that is some nice looking darker oil not as dark as some of the live resin i've seen out there but uh nice looking color nice consistency materials look pretty nice like that ceramic uh tip nice glass base and yeah looks like actually pretty decent materials all around let's get it on our battery here set the voltage at 3.3 ish and let's give it a try so here we go here is our first hit of our ocean cannabisco straw nana tasty it uh has those very strong nana e terpenes very sort of fruity and um uh yeah just a kind of a a sweeter tasting strain uh very delightful um i'm i don't necessarily doubt that this is live resin tastes like the strain there um i know live resin in terms of uh there have been some instances where companies have gotten in trouble recently for sort of deceptively labeling things uh live resin when they're not really uh that is a subject for a whole other video i don't know how to tell myself without having basically like a spectrometer um but uh i can tell you that this is still pretty quality oil uh whatever is in there and there's no reason to doubt you know they say it's live resin i'm sure it is okay well this is pretty quality oil and it's pretty strong i'm feeling it pretty uh pretty acutely after just a couple of hits there uh 84 thc so it is a high th c live resin which is nice taste is nice uh let me get another couple of hits in here i think this battery in particular has weaker draws than some i'm going to try turning up the voltage just a bit which don't necessarily do especially for live resin i'm not sure why but i've heard people say try to vape it on the lowest temperature uh you can but just to see if that'll help with the draws oh yeah there we go that helped quite a bit wow that is quite tasty quite potent let's get one more in here before we say goodbye for the moment yum wow ocean cannabis co uh this is a pretty good product i'm um more impressed than i thought i was gonna be uh i really you know i admire what they're trying to do with their packaging uh and the affordable price on this live resin especially for one that's as potent as it is uh makes this a pretty good value for a product um that uh you know the live regions usually come in that exuberant exuber oh i forgot how to say that word exorbitant exuberant no exorbitant [ __ ] i'm high [ __ ] 84 thc that right there guys is proof in the pudding the pretty the proof is in the pudding some kind of proof pudding situation it's all here uh big thumbs up from ocean cannabis co wasn't necessarily expecting the greatest things but uh really pleasantly surprised so far however like all of our wheats reviews we're going to review the whole thing all one gram here it'll probably take me about five days or so to get through it uh and once i do i'll come right back here and give you all of our wrap-up thoughts make sure that this straw nana is as fresh and tasty on the day we unpeeled it as the day we finished it that was never going to work but what will work is hopefully this for the next five days until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon goodbye hi guys welcome back to wheats it's been a little over four days since we started with ocean cannabis cos live resin straw nana this one gram cartridge you can see i've got a little bit of that live resin left in there not a whole lot it's actually hitting just fine i was just already out here at the ocean and i thought to myself what better time to finish our review uh our first half was really positive you guys remember i know i did really liked this stuff especially for the price and i also found their sort of recycling gimmick to work pretty well too or to uh to be um at least a a cool idea uh i'm not sure how it well it's sparing an execution but that idea of using ocean plastic as packaging is neat but the more important part is that the actual live resin is good stuff um and at that price i think it was what what did i say 55 something like that um not a bad price at all it might have been a little bit more for live resin which usually is like about 20 more or so than standard distillate so this is gonna be a big thumbs up for ocean cannabis co and their straw nana like uh pretty much everything there is to like about it um and i think maybe in the future we'll take another look at some of their products uh and then anytime guys we have one of these reviews that we like this much we like to give a little cherry on top dogs kicking up sand on my camera person as we speak how stoic is she any time we ever review that we like this much cherry on top i'm going to give you a perfectly perfectly paired cherry on top i don't know i hope i didn't mention this in the beginning the first half i might have if so that's okay because it's worth being brought up twice that is a twofer and the twofer is uh pbs's frontline documentary series all of them uh they're all amazing they come out with like 10 a year of all different kinds of topics but very specifically plastic wars from this year 2020 frontline documentary uh that is about plastic and plastics in the ocean and uh this sort of uh unbelievable fraud that is recycling plastic and how heartbreaking it all is uh but it's actually a wonderful documentary and has changed my views on plastics that is front lines pbs's front lines plastic boards something i highly recommend along with the ocean cannabis co live resin straw nana and that guys is gonna do for the cherry on top and the review efficient one today while we're out here at the ocean thank you so much to anybody who's made it this far until we see you for our next review that tractor says stay high more importantly stay healthy later you", "3q2qZEmOt-4": "our victory tonight quite a haul Milwaukee police seized thousands of illegal vape cartridges during a massive drug bust on the city's south side Fox's Madeline Anderson joins us live from 50th and Norwich where officers raided a house there just last week Madeline yet neighbors tell me five of them tipped off police that the couple inside this house was dealing drugs after conducting surveillance for several days police executed a search warrant what prosecutors say they discovered evidence of an illegal vaping operation neighbors photos from 50th and norwich capture an alarming scene last tuesday's absolutely was a surprise so surprised that we've never had anything like this on the court or even in the neighborhood witnesses say dozens of officers arrived just before noon in armored vehicles and with weapons drawn I just heard a loud speaker and I thought well it's from the park or you know squad or somebody's going down to hunt down the 50th the target this house where police arrested 34 year old Giovanni Molina and 30 year old Amanda where they're each charged with maintaining a drug trafficking place use of a dangerous weapon as well as possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver use of a dangerous weapon it's extremely surprising to me they were nice quiet people kept to themselves during a search of the house and garage prosecutors say police discovered 13,000 THC vape cartridges in packaging labeled names like King Penn connected brass knuckles cookies and dank the bust comes less than a month after a Kenosha family was charged in connection to running its own black market vaping operation worth millions of dollars and Molina and where's home prosecutors say police also found more than 20 pounds of marijuana nearly 1 million dollars cash a loaded handgun and 20 grand in jewelry a haul especially unexpected two people living next door who described the couple's lifestyle as seemingly modest no clue never would have known and over the weekend bail was

thank you and", "bD6ACtDcGSQ": "[Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "uFz9D4tbaxg": "GOOD EVENING.

difference between using a ceramic made cartridge and a cotton wick baked cartridge [Music] alright guys so when you have your 510 threaded cartridges this guy or this guy you're gonna have two types one of them is going to be a cotton whip like this and one of them will be a ceramic heating element like this guy well they both have their advantages and disadvantages if you're trying to do a lower voltage meaning the lower power setting you want to go with the cotton cartridge they can't handle such a high voltage from the battery which would mean you know if you know especially if you have one of the ones that are adjustable where you can turn it up or down you're gonna want to keep at a minimal setting because if you put too much power into one of these guys you risk burning it out early or you know you could turn your juice dark and black because it just stresses the heating element out too much now with our other guy these ceramic these are gonna be a little more up to date where you're gonna be able to run them at a higher setting not super high but with the spinner batteries or the adjustable voltage batteries you'll definitely be able to turn it up a little higher and will give you a little more of a kick with your v the way you can tell the difference is if you look inside the barrel of this one the cotton one you can see a little cotton poking out at the top of it as opposed to the ceramic where you have kind of a cage sitting down on it onto it and you'll have some wick holes where you'll see where the juice will flow in both of them are gonna be 510 threaded and both are gonna be acceptable for batteries like this so you know again just to make sure if you're adjusting you're gonna want to have a ceramic type that'll let you turn your battery up a little higher we recommend a voltage no real higher than about 4 volts that should be the highest you go if he's something a little higher but take it bit by bit and then if you're using a traditional cotton cartridge that's gonna want to stay at a minimum about 3.7 volts you don't really want to turn it up much higher than that and obviously the question too is well what if my battery doesn't adjust well then you're fine for both you know that's going to run at a lower setting that'll be acceptable for both types so if you liked the video give us a like subscribe and if you want any of these products

cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your

credited with tipping off investigators Sheriff David Beth says the 20 year old suspect shows plenty of promise as an entrepreneur but unfortunately who's doing something illegal and it's something he also thinks could be at the center of the vaping epidemic sweeping across the country and that condo they found an operation that really is incredible sheriff Beth says Tyler Huff Heinz had an assembly line putting together tens of thousands of THC cartridges over the last two years but it all came crashing down starting in July after two parents in Waukesha came to police after finding one of these THC products in their son's room we were able to work five tiers up the chain through the city of Waukesha Waukesha County that led us into Kenosha County they say these were found in all of Waukesha high schools many of the packages had popular candy logos and fruity flavors kids find appealing but they're far from harmless on the back it does say that it has THC in a very small amount and they're actually packaging these or filling them with 1000 milligrams of THC because of the size of this bus Sheriff Beth thinks it goes much bigger than just Wisconsin he's concerned it's the center of the vaping epidemic that's caused a half dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries across the country this is not recreational use this is a major marijuana operation that deals with probably distribution across this country and people are getting hurt and dying from this every single day Sheriff Beth says they're also looking to see if Hough Heinz alleged products are being sold at local

"hi my name's Peter with air vapor systems and today we're gonna focus on how to properly fill the C cell m60 cartridge now it's available in a 0.5 ml or a 1 ml a cartridge size we internally refer to it as the c6 cartridge so if for any reason you give us a call and you are looking for this cartridge you can refer to it as the m60 or the c6 cartridge however it is very tricky to fill there are a number of small details that you must pay attention to to properly fill this cartridge without any issues so I'm going to separate this video into two different portions the first portion we're going to identify the proper technique to fill this cartridge as well as the tools and techniques used to cap it now in the second part of this video what we're going to go into is more of a troubleshooting mode when we show you some of the common mistakes that can happen why they happen and how to prevent them so without any further ado let's begin [Music] so to begin explaining how to fill the m60 cartridge we will first review all the parts and identify each piece of the m60 so you know how they all fit together and what order they should be put together that's very important to note these should be placed together in a particular order number two I'm going to identify the tools that you'll need to put them together two of these tools are a blunt tip syringe as well as an arbor press now this Arbor press is maybe something that you have not seen or you may not have however it is available from air vapor for under $300 and it helps greatly with consistently and reliably capping these cartridges in fact it's recommended by the factory again we have these arbor presses for sale but it's highly recommended that you use an arbor press to cap these cartridges so that you can consistently cap them properly now to begin let's identify the pieces here of the m60 cartridge it actually consists of four pieces the two main pieces are here the cartridge body as well as the cartridge tip now the cartridge tip is available in two styles you have a round or a flat mouthpiece tip available these other two pieces that you see out here to the side this piece here is the mouthpiece cover it goes on after the mouthpiece has been mated to the cartridge body and this other piece over here is the bottom thread cover for the cartridge body this also goes on after you have maded the tip and the body together so these pieces last these pieces first to begin filling the cartridge properly you will first notice that the m60 here is a side fill cartridge meaning that you're not going to fill the center post in the middle although it may be tempting what you're going to do is you're actually going to take your blunt tip needle and insert it into the side of the cartridge between the center post and the the inner rim you're gonna want to use a blunt tip needle for this because blunt tip needles are not sharp and it will prevent you from injury once you have your material loaded inside of your blunt tip syringe you will fully insert it all the way into the cartridge and for this syringe I am using a 15 gauge blunt tip needle that a 15 gauge needle is somewhat wide and allows me to easily fill this using thick material I will push my material into the cartridge and begin slowly raising the needle as it fills taping taking proper care not to fill this past the bottom edge of the metal top metal collar that is the fill line for this cartridge the bottom edge of this metal collar is really where you should fill this too and not above the explanation for that will be later in this video then you're going to take the mouthpiece and place it onto the cartridge and you won't have to press it in hard all you need to do is place it onto the cartridge so that it seats it self partially and then you're gonna take this cartridge and put it into the jig for this Arbor press then all you'll do is take the handle for the arbor press and push the tip all the way down until it fully seats into the cartridge body you want to make sure that this kind of bottom edge here of the tip makes fully to the top edge of the cartridge once that is done you now have a fully filled and capped cartridge and then you're just basically going to add the two other portions onto it which is the mouthpiece cover as well as the bottom thread cover to complete your cartridge and there you have it a full m60 C cell cartridge okay now that you have seen how to properly fill in cap the m60 cartridge we're going to move into the second portion of this video where I describe to you some troubleshooting scenarios and explain the actual physics of how the m60 cartridge fits into itself so that you can see in diagnose any issue that may arise during filling now the m60 cartridge has a very unique capping system what it features is a tip that pushes down into the body and remains in place through friction the way it creates this friction is by having a reinforced rim around the top of the cartridge body and then a tapered plastic tip at the bottom of the tip so that when you place this taper tip into the cartridge body and push it together friction causes it to mate to itself and hold it in place much the same way that friction acts to keep these two plastic cups connected together now if you've ever pulled two plastic cups out of the dishwasher or maybe out of your cupboard you might notice sometimes these things can get really hard to separate well this action where two plastic cups fit together and don't come apart is the exact same way that the m60 cartridge fits to itself you have a bottom cup here with a reinforced rim this top cup has a tapered bottom to it and as I insert the first cup into the second you have this tapered bottom eventually widening out all the way until it meets this reinforced rim and with just a slight press down further friction begins to engage around the tip holding the two together now the two ways in which you can counteract that friction is by either a over filling this cup or by be getting material on the inside rim of it let me show you how this can occur so as you can see on this cup I have a fill line drawn on it this fill line is meant to resemble the bottom edge of this metal collar the top collar around the m60 that is the filled line for the m60 cartridge whether it's in a point 5 ml size or a 1 ml size the bottom of the metal collar at the top that bottom edge is your fill line do not fill past that edge or what I'm about to describe to you will occur however I'm going to explain it just so you can see it just a little bit better and see it in action using these two cups now to represent the material that I'm going to use I'm just gonna have this right here this is basically vegetable glycerin with a little bit orange food coloring in it I'm using it solely so that you can just see what's happening in these plastic cups now I have drawn a fill line on this Cup as I mentioned before and that is to represent the fill line on the m60 or the bottom edge of the top metal collar now when I take my material and I pour it into this cup and I do not pour it past the fill line making sure to not overfill what happens is I get a great seal because there's nothing preventing me from or nothing preventing the cup from grabbing itself and from friction engaging around the rim in the taper tip and you can see because the I only filled up to the fill line the material did not start creeping up the sides nor did it overfill however let's see what happens when you do overfill so I'm going to take this out here it's dripping a bit but let's overfill this just attach shall we now this situation here is meant to basically replicate what would happen if you were to fill the m60 cartridge past the bottom edge of the top collar basically essentially over filling it what happens when you overfill it let's insert this cup down again and see what happens hopefully you can see there that the liquid starts to rise up the sides as the cup is placed into this overfilled vessel here displaces the oil forcing it to go up the side so when that happens what you don't see is the oil starts actually pushing back in wanting to raise this cup up right now that is essentially what happens if you overfill the m60 what will happen is the oil or the liquid that you have placed in there will begin to push back against the tip as you push the tip down pushing the tip which will then force the tip to pop back up on you now if you really try to force the tip down this is what's gonna happen hopefully you can see all of this material starting to pour out the sides of the cup what happens now is basically this this VG juice does two things number one it's providing pressure against the cup so it's pushing the top cup out but because I've now displaced so much oil that is pouring out at the top what happens is it prevents friction from engaging around the rim to hold the cups in place essentially what the this juice has done is it's overflowed and it started lubricating the rim when it lubricates the wim there's no way that it's gonna hold you see it just comes right out because there's no way for friction to engage this is what happens on the m60 cartridge when you overfill it you either have the oil pushing back against the tip or you drive oil up the sides thus lubricating the entire rim and preventing friction from engaging to lock down that tip that's the tip pushes up and out or it easily comes out during use in order to properly seat the m60 cartridge you have to first ensure basically three things happen number one don't overfill it because if you overfill it this is what will happen you're going to drive oil up the sides or you're going to set the oil or liquid against the tip and it's gonna push it out number two try not to get while you're filling even if you can have if you avoid over filling what you're gonna want to do is avoid getting any material around the inner edge of the m60 so what that means is when you're coming in here with your syringe and you're filling this cartridge what you want to do is when you pull out your syringe do it cleanly try not to get any oil trailing into the inner rim of this cartridge or else that oil or that liquid will act as a lubricant against the rim and prevent the top from completely seating inside there and holding together that's the tip will pop out and third the most important thing which we reviewed in our vision previously in this video is to use an arbor press an arbor press will allow you to fully seat that tip all the way down and you're gonna want to make sure that the bottom edge of your tip is seated fully to the top edge of the cartridge body this is usually only consistently achievable if you use an arbor press I've heard of people with strong hands pushing them together I think hands get tired after a while and a press like this is going to be a much more reliable way for you to see if those cartridges there you have it if you have any questions please do not hesitate to give us a call or send us an e-mail which will be reflected below and

another vape cartridge. Hey guys welcome to the vape review how-to series. we're gonna take this olive oil we're gonna put it in the pan we're gonna turn it on and we're gonna let it smoke until vaporizes okay so after the oils been heated this is what it looks like the color is gonna change to brown when it's overheated the same thing is happening in your vape cartridge when you heat it up for too long so the question is how do we stop this from happening? here's a few tips tip 1 batteries matter all batteries do the same thing but they each do it a little differently so whether you have an Autopen a mini mod Conceal or a Manual battery there's a couple of different things that you can do auto pens heat while you're inhaling so tip number two limit your inhale to 5 seconds Tip 3 I also feel the pen for heat at the top right there in the connection\npoint just stop inhaling for about one to three seconds alright tip number four\nfor variable voltage batteries you want to always use the lowest temperature\nclick three times to change the voltage For manual push-button pens tip five\npulse the button this will lower the overall temperature\nacross the oil and the coils as you inhale The optimal battery temperature\nis 2.2 volts This ensures that you don't overheat your oil It's enough to vaporize the oil but cool enough not to burn it all right if you\ndon't want to do all of that stuff... Tip number six get a cold fusion vape pen it's the best of both worlds variable voltage down to two point two volts pulse chip technologies is integrated into the vape pen never to make sure that you \nburn another vape cartridge You can hold the button down on the green setting which is the lowest setting With two point two volts and you can hold it as long as you want If our logo isn't on it.

review what's up so my can of sewers welcome back to another shabbat short i hope you're all staying safe staying healthy today we're going to be looking at a controversial but highly requested product you may have heard about this company you may have heard about the slight little scandal that happened we'll get into that i'm talking about delta 8 from 10 cartridge now 10 cartridge gets its name from the fact that they sell 10 delta 8 cartridges now at first everything was super fine and dandy until there was a controversy over the cartridges that they were using being counterfeit not name brand which raises some concerns about there being lead and mercury and other things in there that you don't want to be inhaling and that's not that's not put there by 10 cartridge or anybody else who uses these cartridges these are cheaply mass manufactured carts from china and that's why it's dangerous now as far as i know 10 cartridge has since gone back and removed those cards and replaced them with safe trusted name brand carts i got the king louie the 13th very classic very well known strain high thc strain this of course is just the terpenes this is delta 8 distillate with king louis the 13th terpenes now let's just take a look at the test results really quick there is no detectable cannabinoids in this aside from delta 8 thc and it is 69.27 delta 8. if you're new to delta 8 or you've never heard of delta 8 delta eight is thc it just has a slightly different molecular structure from delta nine thc it has much of the same effects it does get you high albeit slightly less paranoid slightly less anxiety but it can definitely still give you bad anxiety it can give you panic attacks rushiness etc so you have to still take it easy with delta eight if you are thc sensitive the great thing about delta athc is that it is federally legal however there are some states passing laws that are banning delta hthc i just want to say that those laws are in direct violation of the farm bill all of these anti-hemp laws once they go to the supreme court they will be thrown out anyways though standard packaging clamshell packaging it's nice let's get that open nothing fancy at all got our cartridge right here little rubber stopper on the bottom and this one does say c cell on it but that's where some of the controversy was is that these might even counterfeit c cell cartridges i don't know if i got from the old batch or from the new improved guaranteed safe patch i don't know i'm gonna take one for the team though anyways i am pretty sure that all of the current stuff that they're selling is safe and trustable got it hooked up under the battery it's a 510 connection so it hooks up to any battery like this let's go for it that's a nice turkey profile it's um it has a good taste to it without being too sweet too overwhelming some some vendors and company some vendors really overdo it with the terpenes and it just tastes like you're vaping candy or something [Music] of course it's really smooth it has that delta eight distillate taste to it with the terpenes in front and that's about all i'm gonna do a couple puffs go a really long way remember delta eight does get you high it is not like cbd and other hemp derived products where it's almost non-psychoactive so with those three hits i'm gonna kick back for a couple minutes let the effects kick in i'll come back and let you know how i feel five minutes later all right i'm back now i sat here for about six or seven minutes let it kick in let me tell you any more than that and i would probably start feeling uncomfortable it is very potent very strong like i keep saying a couple of puffs go a long way if you want to have something that just gives you a slight buzz a slight cerebral filling like hemp flour i probably recommend you just take one puff from that if you watch my last delta 8 video i talk about how it's very strong it's very potent it's definitely psychoactive but it is less rushy it gives you less paranoia less anxiety so within reason if you use delta 8 within moderation it is better than delta 9 thc for those of you that are delta 9 thc sensitive but it still has its negatives and it is very easy to have a bad time i got overzealous with some delta distillate a while back i used way too much and within 10 minutes i thought it was dying it was not a good time it was terrible so you cannot overdo it anyways though 10 cartridge i'm going to give this a shabazz seal of approval i like the terpenes the flavors that they have available the price is great the effects are great it's potent this is just a really good delta h product and it's awesome that this is federally legal anyways though y'all that's the review thank you

runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "zjSLPXz_9dE": "i'm dena mitchell with secret nature and i want to talk to you really quick about our vapes [Music] our newest distillate formulation is averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids that's almost double from our previous batches hang on charlie i don't think they heard that right play it again for the people in the back averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give them a try white fire og is an amazing indica that's perfect when you need a little r and r pining and mircine play a symphony in this strain and leave behind notes of lemon lime soda this bad boy has 436 milligrams to leave you feeling amazing matthew says this is the best tasting cbd cart

it honestly tastes just like that this vape really helped me in the busy hours between work and feeling you get after smoking it is honestly uplifting and relaxing and i'm just now realizing that's the literal explanation they give you in the description of the vape i'm kind of mind blown that this has the effect that secret nature claims in those exact words chelsea we let the quality speak for itself that just about does it for today friends i'm dena mitchell and if you're thinking about purchasing a cbd cartridge look no further we here at secret nature got you covered with only the best visit secretnaturecbd.com for the highest quality cbd rich hemp products bye [Music] you", "C1ocH2KMqfY": "hey everyone this is concen and today we're going to talk about a question that we get quite a bit here at vaporizer review and that is how do I clean my pen vape and there's quite a few pen vaporizers out there but we're going to stick with the three general styles we have a dry herb we have a waxy concentrate and then we have an e juice style pen vaporizer here so we're going to go over how to best clean and maintain these vaporizers we're going to start off with the dry herb style I happen to have an at most Rx here I personally not a huge fan of drier pen style vaporizers they generally don't work too great often burn a lot so what we have here is a nameless rx with a glass screen down in there covering the herbs so we're gonna take a cleaning brush I find works best for the dry herb units and just kind of go down into the chamber and do the best that you can just simply take and clean the herb right back I they're just tapping it out onto a table into an ashtray whatever you have to just kind of get the herb out of the unit and with these pen units because they have the screep of the spring that pushes down on there it can be packed a little tight in there and when it all falls out if your pen unit happens to have one of the little glass screens in it I just take that and I put it into a little bit of isopropyl alcohol just a little bit of rubbing alcohol that I have here it's glass you can drop it in there and let it soak for a little while and while that's going on I like to just continue brushing any of the loose herb out of the drier chamber what you want to be weary of with these is there's a little coil right down inside if you accidentally snag and pull on that coil becomes loose in any way you're going to end up damaging the chamber and then this thing just ain't going to work right so you want to avoid pulling on the coil down in there just gently brush mostly aim for cleaning out the sides of the sir chamber there and when that's cleaned out some people like to take just a little bit of isopropyl and q-tip very small amount because you don't want to damage it holding it upside down take it and run it along the inside around the threading area this will keep it clean and maintain it without damaging the coil in any way and that's how we suggest cleaning up the dryer type of a pen style vaporizer very simple easy to maintain you know not the best it might end up burning but that's how we would handle the dryer now we're going to take a look at the wack style vaporizer and right here I have a micro vape nano unit very discreet very portable designed for use with waxy concentrates to go ahead and clean this one basically what we're aiming to clean here is the threading on it I like the pen style vaporizers for wax that are like a threaded connection and screw on as opposed to the ellipse style that pop off I think those atomizers they come free in your pocket easily I like when it's threaded on you know you have a secure connection to both the chamber and the battery will stay together well but one of the things you face when using that is you get some pretty gunked-up threading and when it comes to cleaning a wack style vaporizer you're not really looking to clean the coil you don't want to damage that because it's no longer going to heat up the whole idea what this really is to take in a q-tip with a little bit of the isopropyl alcohol and this is more about cleaning the threading on the wax tile vaporizer cleaning the threading is going to help keep it operating smoothly because you're going to be able to easily disconnect and then reconnect the top of the chamber to where the wax goes and with these style of cartridges where they thread off right where the wax goes it can be kind of a hassle if it's stuck together you're trying to open it so frequent cleaning of the threading on the wax tile vaporizers is really all you need that's kind of the whole goal you don't want to damage the coil in any way shape or form if you damage the coil it's just not going to heat up any more so when using your tool to load the wax onto there it's my suggest and all of our suggestions here at vaporizer review that you don't scrape it across there if you end up scraping it there's a very good chance you're going to damage it so that's something you're looking to avoid when it comes to loading just try and gently get it onto there do not be scraping across the coil and when it comes to cleaning all you're aiming for is the threading just want to get all the wax off the threading so you can unthread it and rethread it very easily we're going to take a look at now would be the less the pen style units we have here and this is the one mostly for like a juice I personally don't vape a lot of ejuice myself but I like a buck-naked style when it comes to these more often than not you're just going to change out the heating cartridge here the oil tank after a few uses if you're using different flavors it's not going to be that great but if you only have one tank handy and you do want to clean it out what I suggest doing is getting another one of the oil loaders and just fill it with some warm water the style I hear has a little bit of a wick so it's going to possibly retain some of the flavor but if you take a little bit of warm water and just kind of flush it through out there that's going to help clean it up a little bit and remove some of the flavor from it without having to buy a new tank every time you want to change the flavors that you're using in there a little warm water is all it takes you don't need to really soak it too much you want to avoid getting it down the hole in the middle as well as otherwise it might leak through there so avoid getting it down the hole in the middle otherwise there's might leak through on you and that's really all you need when it comes to the pen style close it up with that on there like this with a little bit of warm water in there keep it read and just give it a little bit of a shake this will help loosen up any of the e-juice that's in there and remove some of the flavor from it and that's all you really need to do when it comes to the EG style so that's our suggestions when it comes to cleaning pen style vaporizers if you have any further questions or just want to leave any comments go ahead and leave them down at the bottom of the video and we're here to assist you alright guys Cheers", "rckG6hjDasw": "absolutely Julie and that's why it was so important that they were tracking these shipments that were coming here to Butler County and those investigators found drugs inside things that looked like ordinary everyday items like lip balm and yes child's favorite candy the tootsie roll authorities have been working with the US Post Office as well when these packages reached the Hamilton and Oxford areas they intercepted them in totals investigators were able to seize almost 1000 THC vape cartridges about seven pounds of marijuana and $2,700 in cash they also found cannabis syrup and gummies alongside digital scales and plastic baggies the street value on the items that they seized is estimated at about 65 thousand dollars so of course not only is it important for them to get these drugs off the streets but just earlier this month the FDA FDA issued a warning that people should no longer be using vape pens or any of those cartridges that contain THC particularly the type that they found in these packages just last week because they're the type that are sold on the streets and can be unsafe reporting live this morning in Butler County Ellie Kramer", "n4mnfadLwJ8": "[Music] hi this is Mike haver thanks for asking me is possession of a THC vape pen cartridge a felony there's a big difference between marijuana and marijuana resins marijuana is a plant it grows in nature and while it can be intentionally grown and genetically engineered still it's not considered man-made on the other hand resins weather ink oil dabs wax shad or whatever you want to call them they are man-made Albea from a plant and marijuana resins are almost always designed to be significantly more potent than any natural marijuana plant could ever be in florida possession of under 20 grams of marijuana in plant form is a misdemeanor yet possession of any amount of resin is generally treated as a felony the way that the laws applied is clear but the law itself at present is not without getting too technical as of today and I'm sure this is going to change FS 893 point 13 the statute designating marijuana as a controlled substance in Florida does not identify THC resins so there's no statutory distinction between marijuana and resin however our florida standard jury instructions do differentiate THC resins are specifically excluded from any in all marijuana instructions thus the different treatment by cops and prosecutors setting these technical issues aside a clever defense attorney may be able to get your THC resin charge dropped from a felony down to a more manageable misdemeanor and thereby reducing your exposure from 5 years in prison and a $5,000 fine to a mere 364 days and $1,000 fine just hire the right lawyer and you'll likely get the best result by the way never forget to question how it was in the first place that the cops came upon your cartridge there may well be a Fourth Amendment challenge in your case for an illegal search and seizure

another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "Iv_gPNVA4Os": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is my top five cartridges but not of 2020 to start off 2021 because [ __ ] 2020 i don't even want to care about that [ __ ] anymore you know so i titled this the top five cartridges to start 2021 with before i start this video any further let's take a [ __ ] hit i got this bougie on a budget cart i i was just fresh off doing that video so i may look pretty [ __ ] high because i am but let's take a [ __ ] another hit here cheers and i might i say that this is a sleeper cartridge i just found out about this not too long ago i just bought it a few days ago and tried it today uh it's not going to be on the list but definitely an honorable mention like this is the only strain i've tried that's why i like i don't really want to like put it in the top five because i had my top five already set uh before making this video but this cartridge man this is this should definitely get some praise for what the price is and for what the quality is bougie on a budget um but i digress let's get started so uh let's just get done with the honorable mentions first uh we got raw garden i know a lot of people don't consider it live resin but i still do because it has the live resin terps which is what makes live resin live resin right the terps the initial terpenes from actually freezing the plants and all that stuff but they give the higher percentage of thc that comes with distillate as well so it's kind of like the best of both worlds but that is an honorable mention also i would say maybe select i've tried a few of them i've tried one personally myself that i bought and it was pretty good uh just it was all right uh you know nothing to really that blew my mind but i've tried another one from flynn it was pretty good you know um but let's get on to it we got number five we got buddies and i wouldn't be like mad if it was a little bit higher on the list because buddies has just been the brand of the year for me but in terms of cartridges i have to put it there because they do seem to like okay well first before i start getting into the list i should mention the things that i consider when it comes to cartridges is the hardware itself the oil the vapor production uh the price not so much because that's all based on location and you know buddies for me is cheap and sometimes it's cheap for other people too but it's more expensive for other people too so price even though i consider that one of the most important factors i won't consider it for the sake of this video um and also i'd like to mention that this is my [ __ ] list right so it's just me you know i'm not the cartridge god or some [ __ ] you know it's just some guy on the internet okay so like if i don't have a certain brand or whatever cartridge in your in the list like there's no reason to get upset put your opinions down below your top five and let's get started buddies brand of the year for me but uh unfortunately they just seem to really run out quick you know but they're priced so good but like i said price in this list doesn't really uh for the sake of this this video isn't really uh as important but yes buddies is there it has that cdt cartridges it has the live resin cartridges and they have a lot of strains to this day they have a lot of strains you know and to this day peach flambe upside down cake and orange eight are [ __ ] just phenomenal the green box ones just great uh and then we got coming in at four and uh three and four can be switched i mean actually no okay no it's a clear cut so four would be nug just enjoyable it's everything you would get from a green box buddies uh just last a lot longer than buddies buddy seems for me it just lasts like two or three days you know and uh i don't know it's just i don't know but nug just enjoyable i've tried a few of their stuff i think i've tried like three i don't have these cartridges on me but i will put videos on the screen as i'm talking about them because i've tried them and uh yeah nug was uh enjoyable cartridge lasted really really long compared to buddies and just the taste was phenomenal the live resin was true to the train uh but yes that will be number four number three uh like i said uh initially that i wouldn't be mad if you switched three and four is the jetties extracts their unrefined live resin just hit you can take a look at the classiest way to smoke a cartridge video or use a cartridge video money and me were just surprised at the wedding cake that i got from them it was just fat hits tasty phenomenal hits and this [ __ ] got me faded so uh yes coming in at three will be jenny's extracts and uh number two and number one can also be switched but based on just you know people being in the game longer than the other one you know i'll just i'll leave number one as it is and but for number two is alpine and uh i mean uh say what you want about it being a new live resident into the market they initially did you know this lit and other stuff it's fire like they have a ceramic car as well it's [ __ ] phenomenal the phenomenal taste it's true to the strain as well and it's just an all-around tasty experience the ceramic heart really makes it a difference when it comes to the taste and uh obviously you know the variety of whatever voltage used to uh changes the taste as well but they recommend it maybe 2 to 2.6 i would say but yes alpine live resin second in my book let's just take a hit before i reveal number one but i'm sure you guys still know what number one is i mean it's on my old list right so cheers good stuff number one is urza to this day urza has been established as the number one you know they're the first ones to really just come through with that ceramic i could be wrong but to my knowledge they had the ceramic cards uh i know walks has it now i haven't tried walks but i've heard walks and urza are like kind of the same company so um but yeah urzah to this day had just the most dab like experience from a cartridge the taste was there the smoothness of the hit was there you know a low temp dab obviously and it was just all around a great experience you know got me high um and yeah it was just it was just good they did have a few hiccups you know they had to switch back to the non-ceramic hearts but uh i think they're uh using dental grade ceramic now so all everything is good but yes there you have it for my list i know you guys have been waiting for this and it's been a long time overdue you know so i will take one lasting hit before i end this video let me know your opinions down below on my list and give me your list as well you know you know if you want to put mario karts in there and all that stuff for jokes as well because i know that's going to happen as well so cheers so oh okay all right there you go peace out guys [Music] you", "Zo5jiigf_JM": "So I've come to public-housing\nneighborhood in London, and I'm about to meet\na guy named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "YSjmQy42BWk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all that's the review make sure you go down in the description check out the merch hit me up on ig here here i appreciate everybody watching my videos if you liked the video hit like hit me up down in the comments subscribe to the channel and turn on post notifications so you can see when i upload new content i hope everybody has an amazing rest of your day or night and please stay tuned for the next video peace you", "tRBv42DgLsM": "hello everybody welcome back to the next episode of canada smokes my name is cody and i'm going to be your host on this journey as we check out some canadian legal cannabis products today i have another vape cartridge for you it's an interesting uh cartridge i've got it before uh it's called purple monkey it's made by a company called good supply this has around 79 percent thc it's got a fair amount of flavoring inside of it so if you're someone who likes to vape for the flavor you're really going to like one of these vapes here now the worst part about these is trying to get inside of these things these little boxes are kind of awkward so they've got a seal up top that you can bust with your fingernail you know or if you have a key or perhaps a knife if you're a redneck you might have a knife on you or if you're you have a kitty you can that has the shoots lasers out of its palms you can have it blast it run away like all the people on the beach here so and then there are these little plastic tabs on the side you push them in and then you can slide the box through all right here's our little cartridge inside once again this is the 510 cartridge the standard kind of thing you can buy 510 cartridges and batteries uh at any of the cannabis shops and they they work quite well you know these batteries will run you quite a few cartridges before they start to kind of lose their capacity they don't cost very much the batteries are only about 12 15 bucks and this cartridge was uh 35 that's canadian that's not a whole lot of cash and so anyway um here you can see the the color it's a nice light color it's an indica so it's pretty light in color for the indica in all honesty a lot of them are a little darker in color now uh all you gotta do is thread it on there just like i showed you once you put it on you don't have to screw it on too tight once it's once it's seated it's just just finger tight it's good enough you don't have to crank on it real hard or anything like that and uh these like i said before these have quite a bit of flavor and so just smelling it you can you can tell already that this is going to be a a pretty nice treat so let's go ahead and let's have a pull on it here and we'll see what we think here yep very nice flavor they uh very smooth these pens they're not too bad um you don't want to blow this stuff out your nose too much it kind of burns the nose and i definitely did a little bit of that you may have noticed that i just spliced two videos together and that is true i did the reason why is well it's halfway through no october in alberta and uh it's starting to get cold in my 600 square foot rickety 10 box house that i live in i've got a 60s mobile home that i live in and the walls are about as thick as a modern day hard wall trailer without the insulation so my furnace comes on a lot and uh it wrecked my previous video it did it sounded like absolute crap as it was blasting through so i decided that i would uh re-record hey canada so anyway these things are nice i like these cartridges and these pens these vape pens um they're a good little unit they don't make a lot of smell you can smoke these kind of more discreetly than you you could a joint if you're to burn up a big fatty and combust some flour that makes quite a bit of smell your fingers smell and all that now the worst thing is just try to get away from the red eyes no obviously you can use a lot of visine but i don't know how good that is for you either so that's kind of the telltale sign is some squinty eyes anyway um yeah you know if you're you're traveling through and you're curious about picking up one of these pens i highly recommend that you can rate yourself up for about fifty dollars and you've got a nice little little smoking pen there and um that'll last you for you know let's say a day and a half maybe two days depending on how much you smoke i know people that can make them last longer won't name any names of course um so yeah they're decent that's about all i have to say about that uh if you have any recommendations as to what you'd like to see me try please drop them there in the comments hit like maybe a sub that'd be cool check me out this is the third video going big time here maybe going to do a fourth video right away so appreciate everyone following me checking me out here um it's a lot of fun to be able to go down to the store and just pick up some some products off the shelf without having to try and find someone you know and uh make sketchy connections and sketchy places just for a little bit of chronic you know it's it's quite nice so it's one thing i'll give a little bit of credit to our prime minister for is uh the man has pretty much given us this market here that i don't think would have existed under uh a different government so there you go it's what as political as all i'm willing to get in any of these videos um yeah the the canadian legal market isn't terrible some of these vials these cartridges are down at reasonable in in price and they're decent in quality and if you're interested go out and grab one please always drive safely don't ever drive impaired enjoy cannabis responsibly keep it out of the reach of children don't smoke out children or people that don't want to be around it let's be smart let's be responsible let's be classy about it alright let's not screw this up thanks for checking out my video this has been another episode of canada smokes i hope that you will join me again and we'll check out some other products in this legal market that's all i think i have for now thank you very much take care", "8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah thanks everyone for watching if you enjoyed as always please leave a like comment and subscribe

how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "KJcjYTArjIw": "hi guys under here from Essex UK UK thanks for joining us today we're will be looking at how to clean your vape pen just a quick short video just to show you how to clean various pens we'll be looking at a standard Eagle where you just replace the head normally and also a slightly more advanced vape pen with replaceable coils in in the in the middle just to show a few extra tips basically on how to prolong the life of your vape and the main reason for keeping them nice and clean and tidy and so oh yeah so you will need a few things to start with first being cotton buds or q-tips whatever you want to call them next paper towels pretty essential really and also what I would recommend is a nice bottle of of just warm water well that'll do you nicely I've come across this that came in and another ecig kit which works perfectly it's got a nice fine tip so you can spray with it and it's very squeezy so if you've got one of these that come in very handy if not just use one water straight out really tough so let's crack on okay so let's start with the the Eagle tea setup here so this is standard pen with the replaceable end with your wicks in so normally what you'd do is you'd smoke this with a any liquid in the recommend that you don't really change your liquids using the same cartridge I don't have that much of an issue with it as long as it's quite empty but there is another way so they start by taking a report intake can remove the battery for now put the battery to one side so what we can do on the the atomizer side of things you can take your you tip off so you would normally fill it straight up through there and I've got a bowl here I'll just use this too to keep the little bits and bobs in so that's as far as this one breaks down it doesn't break down any further than that so you would normally just replace this or have a few spares so what I find is if you take your warm water in a squeegee bottle like so and just squirt it down inside and put your finger on the end and give it a bit of a shake then just discard the rest in here and do that a few times try not to overfill I can get the stuff down the middle in fact what I'll do I'll put the end on it's probably a better way to do it and give it a good shake again you can see the wicks are starting to come nice and clear all of a sudden it really works well it's quite an effective way you know maybe you've come to the end of an e liquid and you have another one and you just want to quickly give it a nice clean it's perfect where to do it so you can see all the the residue coming out here I think you can't anyway there you go so that's pretty much it so what I would do now is take a paper towel and just give it a nice wipe down and then ideally what you want to do is kind of try and shake out as much of that water as possible because obviously the more water you've got in there when you fill it with a liquid it will dilute so you can check out as much as possible it's quite a bit coming out there when I'm shaken into the ball but it's now running clear you can see that the the wicks inside are fairly clear they're not yellowy color off the the yellow liquid that I had in there there's still a bit of water in there I wouldn't worry about that too much you might even be able to get a cotton bud in to some elements of that too to dry it out a little bit I'll just leave it with the top off and leave it for an hour or so and that'll dry out nicely before filling it back up with a liquid similarly with the the top the drip tip should give that a nice wipe down and around the o-ring seal make sure that's sealed nicely and then you can use a cotton bud if it fits and just clean out the inside of the drip tip as well just to get rid of all all the flavor and all the residue that can build up because obviously over time the more that you use these things the more that the liquid kind of breaks down and can stick to your apparatus so that's it let's pretend that's dry inside so that's now ready to go another tip would be to make sure that the bottom doesn't have sometimes you can get a bit of e-liquid seeping into this area so again it's quite simple just give it a wipe round the dry or very slightly wet damp cotton bud get into all the nooks and crannies and give it a nice wipe here because at the end of the day this is where the electrical connection heats up the wicks inside off the battery so you need to make sure that's always nice and clean and similarly on the battery end of the connector you sometimes see a little bit of residue down in here see if I got a bit closer for you so again just clean that out with a cotton bud you should do this maybe every few days or at least once a week just to prolong the life and it genuinely will prolong the life of year your lluvia pad okay so screw it back together now you've got a nice clean atomizer ready for the same a liquid more e-liquid whatever you want but that will that be good to go so I would recommend that you dry it out because obviously the water will swipe you don't leave you a liquid but all in all that's you know it's good to go so let's have a look at a slightly different this one is an Apollo brand it screws off the same has a very similar battery again probably make sense just to give you a battery connector a quick clean but actually did have quite a bit of any liquid in there so that's nice and clean now inside there's that to one side and then we have this which is their atomizer which has a coil inside so this one does break down fairly well so first of all we will take the coil section off the bottom and I place that to one side for now now see if there's any extra a liquid few drops not much in there so nice smell this one this is watermelon so again take you your bottle with your warm water in and squirt it down the side like you would with a liquid then again finger over the end give it a shake pour away the residue and I would do this a number of times just to to get as much of that a liquid out as you can again don't fill it to the top leave some room so when you shake it has a room to maneuver around the getting the nooks and crannies there we go so that's pretty much running clean again so two squirts two shakes and it seems all good again and I can see through the the clear window on the side that that is really well it doesn't smell at all now again take a cotton bud and just clean out all or as much as you can of the actual drip tip and the same inside as well around here and then in this case I can't get my cotton got very far down inside so what I can do is I can just take of a bit of kitchen roll of a paper towel roll it out at the end that fits nicely down inside now turn that round inside and I'll get the rest of the liquid that the the cotton bud couldn't reach go that's gone all the way through so that is now perfectly clean as good as new so the coil and this is a bit more messy like I said this has a replaceable coils so this coil screws out like so out of the base place the coil on the paper towel for now and I'll just take the the end I'll just squirt some water over it there's no extra parts in there just to remove all the liquid there I'll take another paper towel and just give this a clean get all the extra water off the main thing to remember here is everything's cleanable with water you've just got to try and get all the water off again once you've finished the cleaning process so that's all good I think what I'll do is I'll take a cotton bud and just wait round inside with a dry cotton board just to get that residual water out here we go it's there that's a clean base and a clean top now the coil the coil itself as you can see if I get a bit closer there there's not a great deal you can do with this you don't really want to get water onto the wicks as such I'm going to try and avoid that so what you can do is you can just wipe it around on the end to get as much of that yield liquid off as possible and any residual stuff on the end get that off and the other end and if you've been really picky what you can do is you can roll some more kitchen roll up and you can go all the way through the section and down the down the center but I don't see too much use for that and at the end of the day these are replaceable coils but what it means is when you when you have a VM with repairs or Kyle's it does make it a little easier to to take because you can take it apart and makes a lot easier to clean so there we go so let's put this back together so the coil goes in this section and the whole thing goes together like so and pop the battery back on so there you have it we have two perfectly clean as good as new there and ready to go so I hope that's helped yeah you clean everything pretty much the same as what I've just done with these two examples or via pens working pretty much the same manner and yes the same goes even with so bomb setups with with saban tanks you break them down as much as possible clean as much as you can with warm water and for the same reasons it's just to prolong the life if you vaporizer you know so you don't have to to to spend as much on on replaceable x' as as you might do", "20W5V5QsDFs": "yo what's good boys it's your boy exotica and in today's review we're gonna be checking out the choices carts and i'm gonna be trying out the king louie next review we'll be busting out the juicy fruit all right open this from the bottom uh here's the cartridge it's a ceramic cartridge which uh this is honestly my first time trying a ceramic cart and i gotta say i really i'm digging let's go ahead and throw this king louie on this this little mod i got here but uh here before we i'll try to hit this let you know what it tastes like okay got like a berry almost yeah it's like a berry flavor almost i know i say that in a lot of reviews but those usually tend to be my favorite uh flavors but before we hit this let me get a drink of water and yeah we'll get right into this review okay so man i'll tell you i'm ready for this it's been a long day started my new job and man to say the least today was what a day uh my new client was awesome she was chill but some of the things i had to do today was just not enjoyable in the least i'm ready for this man wearing a mask [ __ ] eight hours that sucked but cheers dudes hope you guys are vaping along smoking along rolling your joints hitting a dab i may take a bomb rip at the end of this video i got some in my uh i always carry this is my everyday carry i just carry my dugout one hitter i got some cbd in the bottom mixed with some kush i'll [ __ ] throw a bowl in that but let's get right into this boys okay so for some reason first time you put a card on this says low atomizer or something but here let's hit this cheers boys really smooth uh it's a clean like usually to me carts aren't really smooth on my throw like they usually burn my throat that's honestly why i haven't been doing cartridge reviews because i just i don't like the way they personally make my throat feel afterwards i mean obviously me carts are a little harsh on my lungs so if i cough a lot don't take it too seriously or think the car is bad because it's not it's just my lungs but before i hit the skin so i don't cough snag another drink of the water oh and the aftertaste of this sticks in your mouth so uh so well so those one hit i wasn't high before i started uh before i started this video so just see how many hits it takes me to start feeling it and about how long uh don't mind the beanie i'm just wearing it because my hair is kind of messy and yeah my golden state had was supposed to come today naturally didn't come everything was running late i had some cartridges [ __ ] my dude didn't get his till late so [ __ ] put me half and wait to try these which i'm really glad it says uh lab tested and ensure potency no pesticide no bleaches no clay is made from uh made from 100 absolute pure delta nine distillate you can tell this is a black market cartridge just because the worrying that made no sense no pesticides no bleaches uh and then it said no clays and then it doesn't put a period or anything it just says made a hundred percent from absolute oh it's gonna appear oh okay i guess it does i'm just reading it wrong i don't know you guys tell me if that looks weird maybe i'll i'll do um maybe i'm starting to feel this car uh they say they're passionate about our products we pour our hearts into our products we understand the consumer should always be first only organic terpenes says our product contains organic terpenes and never will contain pg and other harsh chemicals ingredients it says premium donut9 distillate and the terpenes of course it's got your scratch scratch there for your code put that in your camera take it to the site you can check the see if this is authentic and i believe i did check this uh specific card it does tell you um like it's got all the tests like there's a lot of tests that it says it ran and it'll let you know if it passed and what it was i believe it uh i only seen the juicy fruit i don't think i seen the king louie but i'm pretty sure the uh the juicy fruit was tested in that 85 like i said i don't know if that's true it's pretty easy to mimic and fake stuff online so don't be one of those guys in the comments saying yo you're [ __ ] vaping dog water or hot dog water or some [ __ ] nah bro it comes down to who you're getting off of and honestly i've been smoking for years now i'm gonna know what i'm consuming not a hundred percent you know they could be bad [ __ ] but i mean that's like everything let's get one more toke i am feeling good off that one hit like i said it was a pretty decent hit but let's get one more also i'm vaping this at 5.2 watts if you were curious i also says full ceramic cartridges free no heavy metals and then it says no metals whatsoever which i mean if you look at that cartridge that pretty much looks just like ceramic i mean maybe after i finish this i'll go ahead and try to take it apart see if it's actually ceramic and yeah but overall i like the carp presentation it looks nice it's not over the top you got the nice see for choices and yeah overall i'm pretty uh i'm pretty happy with this i would say if you find in your area snag one yeah i'd say definitely try to snag one of these if you if you can find these in your area grab one try it out i would highly recommend if you can find the king louie snacky king louie so good um smooth i don't know if you guys want to see the bubble test i don't really ever do the bubble test anymore because i feel like it's pointless but as you can see that oil's not moving and there's the oil color as well let you guys get a good look at it [Music] there you go pretty nice color to it very very light golden tint pretty good oil overall i would rate the uh flavor i would give this a solid i'd give this a solid 8 out of ten it's pretty flavorful stays in your mouth kind of coach your mouth with those terpenes uh hi like i said i took about whatever it was two three hits i'm feeling you know starting to mellow out feeling good uh actually i kind of want to take a blinker off this this thing turns off after 10 seconds i believe to make sure you don't burn out your your vape uh this was originally for um like a regular vape like an e-cig but let's go ahead yeah i'm really ripped dudes this is an indica as well the king louie is or it says it's an indica which i would go with that does feel pretty much like an indica i'm like real chill laid back here we go boys i'm gonna take a drink and let's hit this believer in this video also drop a like uh hit this subscribe button over here i believe it's down there hit hit that subscribe button for your boy and uh yeah let's do this boys hopefully taking blinker with me if you are let me know how long your blinker is and uh yeah cheers let's get right into this get my breathing down all right let's go we're gonna go until this turns itself off uh my body feels nice and warm we're chilling you can see in my eyes we're at that level [Music] song again all right boys i'm not gonna cut out any of the coffin i smoke a lot of cigarettes so i'm gonna cough it's just part of it honestly you gotta cough to get off um come on where's my where's my lighter all right [Music] but yeah if you guys would like to see the juicy fruit be reviewed let me know and i will drop a video on the juicy fruit by choices good thumbnail okay and yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this review um potency i would give i'll give a solid 8 out of 10 as well um yeah i can't say i can't really say anything bad about them they don't burn your throat like after you you may cough but it's like a normal weak cough it's not like that my throat's burning because whatever is in the cartridge is not supposed to be there but yeah my sinuses are draining so i'm going to wrap up this video spin your boy exotica i will see you guys in the next one peace",

kk back with another review and i just want to show you guys a few other cartridges i just picked up get me through the week here this is a hybrid and i've never tried this specific strain this is loctite if i'm saying that correctly but if any of you have tried this please let me know i got this which is green crack one of my favorites this is a very good sativa right here we got g-leaf extracts mac now i've had this one before and it's the one i think that tastes like seven up and um that like seven metal yellow soda and then right here is a sour diesel uh premium vape cartridges by calypso so yeah i got g leaf i got calypso and i got standard farms and out of all of these i would say standard farms are definitely the best tasting and the best oil quality but uh yeah hope you

this uh new er new newer lp on the alberta market has uh forbidden fruit for its cartridge i'm really curious to see how it's gonna do and uh how it's gonna taste you guys so let's get this intro in here and dive into this cartridge before we uh before we go into our friday sativa strain review i'll see you guys on the other side of the intro where we're diving into the forbidden fruit cartridge by back 40. cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we're going to be diving into forbidden fruit from back 40. i'm really curious to see how uh how these cartridges are going to do they aren't a company i heard very much about but the packaging is very interesting and unique to this company the cartridge feels like it's got kind of a unique shape um forbidden fruit and cushmits being um the end of oh i i almost forgot about the super lemon haze so the super lemon haze forbidden fruit and cushman's from uh back 40 seem like really interesting strains come out with really rich flavorful strains potentially and honestly it just seems like a fun company to dive into and see how it's gonna do and after we did the sativa last week we're gonna be diving into an indica this week so the only information that i was able to find quickly for this strain review is on the global news wire it's an article about the back 40 company and it just has a little bit of information for each of its cartridges so we're just going to quickly rattle off for all three leading off with the forbidden fruits the one we're going to dive into before we go into the actual information on this package and then into our full review you guys so forbidden fruit is an indica with citrus and earthy taste notes from the d limonene and maracinine botanical terpenes cushman's is their hybrid option with a refreshing burst of mint taste with menthol and d-lemonine botanical terpenes and super lemon haze is a sativa packed citrus and floral taste with botanical terpenes of d-limonene terpinaline maracinine and carefully so this one we're gonna be getting a uh citrusy earthy combination i'm really interested to see how that combination is gonna do you guys we uh have that package ripped open there we are going to get the urban scale intro in here right after we give the information off the package 80 thc 00 cbd and a package date of september 19th you guys it's time to get into the full-blown urban scale i'll see you on the other [Music] side [Music] get this open comes with a nice simple package on the outside and all in all the cartridge itself is nice simple design good really interesting red mouthpiece on it but i don't mind the overall design of the cartridge we can get this thc sticker off you guys so you know exactly what i'm oh this one doesn't want to come off easily okay look at that clear sticker off let's try the other side i don't think this one's going to come off quickly and easily guys okay let's just forget about that and we're going to dive right into the taste from a g pen you guys just because like i said in the last one the fireside battery died on us so we are stuck just with the g pen until we can get some more 510 batteries in stock at the shop for me to be able to grab one but the way we do our taste through the vape is we run it with the lowest temperature talk about it a little bit then the medium temperature talk about it for a bit and then we run it to the highest temperature and finally talk about it through a bit there i find each temperature has a little bit of a different experience a little bit of a different flavor and that's why we break down like that after we then go through the glass and do the exact same thing all three temperatures through each piece of glass to see each experience and overall development of flavor as you dive deeper into the cartridge you guys and after that we give it the score for the g pen the glass and a score out of 10 for the high we are going to be using the more updated score the scoring system where that one to two range is gonna be non-smokable that three to four is going to be on the harsher side but it can still have some enjoying points five to six is going to be the tolerable where the enjoyment is starting to outweigh the negatives that seven to eight is going to be the enjoyable and more optimal place for these to want to aim for and the 9 out of 10 is pristine and that's really going to be my personal preference the my upper echelons of the buds this was recommended by some viewers and it seems like everyone enjoyed it the last time when we dove into it with the concentrate so we're gonna do it with the cartridge this time you guys but we've got the bak 40 forbidden fruit indica dominant cartridge on here we uh we should dive into this you guys and see how it's gonna do i'm really curious haven't heard much about this company but i enjoyed this strain when i smoked it from quest in the bud form so now it's time to see how it'll do in the concentrate form from back for you guys cheers and i will see you on the other side when uh we've got the first taste of this forbidden fruit cart down and out cheers wow you guys so first experience on this you did kind of get that earthy almost even kind of leafy that urban herb kind of taste the green greens of a plant kind of taste and then it hits you with this really heavy um citric not necessarily um not necessarily like a sweet lemon but more like crystallized lemon or lemon juice like the really tart and almost cool lemon citric attack for the flavor and that really was what it was it was an attack on my taste buds and i enjoyed it quite a bit you guys but it was different for the experience i've got the second temperature loaded up on here let's dive in and see how this forbidden fruit crossover of that kind of earthy leafy taste with the lemon is on the second half you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side hey guys so i found it had a really similar experience at this level too it really does balance a little bit better at the medium level it wasn't so much of an attack of that lemon flavor but more of a rush like it was like taking a drink of a lemonade that has too much too many lemons squeezed into it not enough sugar was really what it was or um like the straight lime curse out that you get in the bottle but they let like an extra sour tart edition of it or just straight lime juice like that kind of flavor and honestly it's it's enjoyable to have that wave of citrus but i wish it had a little bit of a sweeter touch to it just honestly for my purple personal preference but it's been enjoyable so far we've got the highest temp now ready to go let's dive into it and see how it's going to uh taste and overall how this g pen is going to score you guys i'll see you on the other side of this last rip before we dive into the glass side of the review guys um okay wow that actually kind of developed or deteriorated depending on the person that's looking at it i personally really am enjoying it and it does have an overall quite enjoyable experience but it's leaning more to that asset licorice flavor for me at that highest temp which was not something i expected at all it was not something i could have expected from this cartridge especially when we were getting that really earthy flavor into that really tart lemon combo i i didn't think a kind of an anise licorice combo would will come out of that but it's not bad it's just all in all different so i'll give it us you know what i am going to give it a 7 out of 10 because it wasn't enjoyable it definitely was enjoyable with the 7 out of 10. it just at the last one it was a little bit kind of like what so i would i would definitely enjoy hauling out of this at the lower temperatures as more of a sipping cartridge not really a like the tropic girl scout cookies from last week that's a haul cartridge but for this week this one's a sipper now we're going to sip our way through the glass we've got six rips to dive into you guys i think i'm gonna cough a lot on this one but uh what what can we do about it let's uh dive into it and see how this cartridge does when you add a little bit of some water filtration on it first two rips we're just gonna press the button and haul the last one we will preheat before we press that button so that we are taking it at the highest level because why not experience it all this ain't pokemon but it's a good hell of a good stoner close-up don't try and catch them all let's try and smoke them all cheers y'all let's dive into it so we pre-heat that last one let's dive into it y'all cheers okay guys we're about halfway through this and i've got a theory i'm working on it we've got three more wheat three more weeks we've got three more rips that will really make the determination on uh whether my theory is right or not um i'll let you guys know at the end but uh hopefully i don't get too high and forget i don't think i will but i'll see you guys on the other side of the next three reps cheers well folks let's let's dive into it again cheers lowest highest i'll see you on the other side and we'll talk about my theory let's dive into it last time preheat it and dive into it cheers okay guys now should i give you the score or should i give you my theory first you know what i'll give you the score and then i'll work it into my theory afterwards i think that'll be the best way to do it so the score is going to be a 6 out of 10. so it's right on that top upper end of the tolerable side now that actually does feed quite well right into my theory so most of these 510 cartridges are going to be heating up to 0.15 of your oil in the chamber that actually has the wick and he is heated and vaporizing every time so with a review like this where i'm pounding out this many um this many rips between 20 to 30 minutes i'm breaking down the terpenes and not giving the cartridge enough time to cool down and really have everything balance out um to give it the optimal flavor between rips however i think this is going to be allowing me to review the the cartridge a little bit more honestly because if the flavor is just as good on the 12th with 12 13 14 15 rip of this review if we have the second battery 12 if we if we don't um if it just there's there's just disappointment when the the oil and everything starts to break down earlier and that's that's really why i think the way i'm smoking it is going to give you guys a more more honest review because that oil and the flavor should hold up and really the tropic girl scout cookies from last week that's going to be my card to compare because not only did it hold up on that review it's still holding up today it's a little bit softer on the flavor but not much definitely a lot less loss in flavor than i was originally expected so it's still doing incredibly well in a lot higher standard than i was originally expecting but it it did really well you guys and that's why this cartridge is going to get that 6 out of 10. now moving on into the high i'm going to give it a 6 out of 10 as well it was somewhat enjoyable until we got about the second rip into the glass you guys and then i started to get this creeping headache and every time i sipped that a card out afterwards it just built and built and built and now it's a really heavy kind of back of my head headache that creeps into my neck and it just kind of tension my shoulders and in my traps and it just it's not enjoyable you guys and i i'm not having that bit of a time however on the lower level this is a really nice card i am feeling that this card would do incredibly well as a complimentary or a balancing card where you're smoking it and there's something else that there's something else that you're smoking with it to get that heavier high and honestly it's it's enjoyable and it is something that i would consider trying again but it's not something i would consider buying again you guys um but the other two cartridges from back 40 definitely would be interesting to try out i've heard the cushions is quite minty quite menthol experience and i was a fan of the house too that was like that and i'm just a fan of that really cooling mint experience so we might have to go and check that one out as well but for the time being you guys we're going to wrap this one up tomorrow it is looking like we are going to be reviewing the uh mimosa strain from wink i'm really excited to try that one out it's been a while since i've smoked the most strain from a new lp or a new producer so let's see how it holds up because we've got citizen stash and best buds to compare it to so let's see if it does well you guys but for the time being we're going to wrap this one up when my end card slides in all you got to do is hover over my logo and click that subscribe button when you do click the bell notification beside it so you know anytime one of my videos

you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax cartridge I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys drop a like a comment subscribe again this is the podcast thank you guys for tuning in

"kBbqaEMgesc": "hello and welcome back to another video today I would like to talk about a really really common problem and it is the center pin issue what is that you may ask the center pin issue is if this little plate inside here is too low and doesn't make any proper connection anymore with this little pin inside here with the atomizer positive pole or with sorry with the positive pole of your atomizer which is this bit in here most people think the battery is completely faulty and can't you can't go to work any more that's actually a little mistake because you can get it to work if you bet this Saturday the center pin actually can be too low after week of use after 2 weeks of use after 3 weeks of use or even after 6 month I don't know the reason for that is actually some atomizers have quite outstanding opinion here some batteries have a pin in here which is a bit lower or which is a bit more inside and therefore you can experience these these contact issues unfortunately and in this video I would like to show you how to fix it all you need to do is actually to take your battery and take your needle I take this needle from a multi meat for my multimeter now and you go inside see carefully and now you move this plate a bit into this direction and then you turn your battery around like so ah that is not easy doing it in front of a camera and you move it back into this direction and now try to get into the back into the middle again like so I really hope you can see that properly and then screw the atomizer back on it let's check it I hope you can hear that so this is working in again so all you need to do is actually just erase that center pin a tiny bit with the needle or something like that but do it careful and then you on the safe side and that's actually it so your battery's probably not faulty it's just a little reconnection problem and that's it thank you very much for watching and I speak to you soon gyah", "hnnaYoVUoZM": "roll roll roll your blood

you are in the notification gang gang gang gang you got that notification build it up then i salute you um with both hands get it i appreciate you now what we do here is oh i'm sorry how rude am i not to introduce myself i go by the name taz and i review [ __ ] mainly hemp um and today we have a product coming from one of my favorite companies i saw this little team i saw this little team it's really a two-part review i saw this little team uh and i've used it in one of my lives and i had to crack it open for you guys in this review it's coming from one of my favorite companies which is called black tie cbd uh you may have heard of them oh oh something that doesn't mean a lot to you can mean a lot to someone else like one right there and hitting that subscribe button so what we have here today is the jupiter c cell palm power supply that was a lot and that is my rosary hitting my whiskey decanter that little ting ting bell you heard um this is the palm uh power supply it's like let's just open it up let's slide it open it doesn't make a magnify magnificent noise when you slide it open and here is what you have they put their logo on it black tie now what this is let me show you what all you get in here i'll turn it around so you can see the back side see that see that now what you have here is uh this is something that you can use for your cartridges um what i've learned about this thing is also that the battery on this when you charge it up last a lot longer than the uh your average pin you know how you usually just put it on top of your little pin uh but the battery on these last a lot longer in fact let me show you how to use it i'm gonna put that right there and i'm gonna try to open up this right here what we have here now what we have here is a little something special a little something this also comes from black tie this is the cbd delta eight vape cartridge so this is not just straight delta eight by itself it has cbd mixed with it which is my favorite way to consume my delta eight uh some people say that delta a kind of gives them a little bit of anxiety you know similar to delta nine uh but i've noticed that when it's mixed with the cbd it's tends to be a little bit smoother and less anxiety causing so this is one milligram and this is not the kid so it's just going to be the cartridge by itself and black tie again they gonna they gonna put a logo on there i do like that um it's child proof so you gotta push this little button and pull now i will say this i've never hold on oh this is the first time this is the first time that i was actually able to push that button down which makes it child proof and slide this out now this is the pineapple say it with me pineapple did that pineapple this is that pineapple this is what your cartridge looks like when you take it out see that voila good and thick good and thick lightly golden lightly golden now what you do is first you take off this little part down here at the bottom wow voila and see this right here oh [ __ ] okay so your palm power cell comes with these two little screw devices so let's get one of those out they give you two in case you lose one so what you're going to want to do is you take that put that down you screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like so screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like that now now you're ready to insert it into your palm which it'll just go like this see that little slot made perfect for it you put that down in there like that and it has a little bit of magnetization to it i don't even know if that's a word but it's magnetized so you put that down in there look watch this again and now it's in there will not come out or anything the next thing you got to do is just simply pull on it you just pull on it so um before i take my first pull let me say this salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please please get to the closest man tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself that's some serious [ __ ] my brother would say that deep little bro and i like it when they do that salute okay and this little thing is tight it's tiny and comfortable i don't know why i like this more than the pen i don't know if it's because i can grip it like that and it's wrong it's gone you know i can be you know at work stepping out on breakfast like huh what today no no no i'm listening nothing rather what's in my hand nothing i have nothing in my hand nothing at all i let the smoke out on the side like so the pineapple flavor is amazing i feel like spongebob squarepants oh my god the pineapple i thought i loved the banana excuse me yeah i thought i love the banana and i do i do love the banana don't get it twisted i do love the banana but the pineapple oh my god it tastes beautiful this is beautiful this is gorgeous i like this a lot i promise i don't know why i like this so much better than the pen but i really do and i feel like it gets more airflow excuse me what i really like about is just this little square design it's easy to just slide down in the pocket i'm good to go and like i said the battery lasts longer in these than in your average pen now when you pull on it there's a little light let me see if you can see that no you can't but anyway oh i'll show it did you see that little light that lit up when you pull that's how you know you're good to go oh my god oh huh okay now to me the effects of the delta eight for me oh if i get my breath from coffin it is a focus type feel um you i feel focused when i'm using delta a creative um i don't have that frontal lobe like blurry feeling like delta nine gives me it just gives me that focus feel and then i get the from the cbd i get the relaxation the drop in the shoulders i get the i can feel the anxiety begin to leave and then i just i it just genuinely makes me happy one million trillion percent gives me the money though i can tell you that right now uh but genuinely just a relaxed feel relaxed and focused feel and in the little palm palette i said the palm palette they used to be a phone i'm showing my age uh but in the palm power supply i really really like it now the pen gives me that feel you know it goes between the fingers so i can but it's a little heavy i don't know why because this forces you to grab it like this or like this it's just like second nature and it's just easy right i'm i've been literally going back and forth in my mind trying to decide if i like the banana or if i like the pineapple better i was so so so impressed with that banana the first time i had it i'm still impressed with it but this pineapple is so on point like i don't know how they're getting these flavors to be so on point the way they are but this pineapple it really does not taste like some artificial fake pineapple type candy type thing it literally tastes like a fresh slice of pineapple it tastes boozy like pineapple not pineapple pineapple that's what it tastes like listen uh black time i gotta give you two thumbs up again man i gotta give you two thumbs up i've tried the banana delta eight i've tried the delta eight card that just had um it was not flavored at all it was just mixed with cbd and it was not flavored and now i'm trying the pineapple and you guys have not let me down yet man and i'm just i i'm sold on the on the palm power supply it's a must so far black tie is my favorite place to get my delta eight and i'm gonna tell you why it's the only place i've gotten delta eight and i trust them as a company that's why i go to them i know it's not gonna be no bs product and sometimes things can you know you get let down so when i want certain things i go to specific companies because i know i'm not going to be let down and this is one of man shout out to aka mr copius i appreciate you and shout out to you guys the pineapple is definitely worth checking out this little contraption this pawn power supply it's definitely definitely a win for me um thank you guys for stopping through as i like to say on smoking legal keep it positive we'll keep it pushing get it keep it positive or keep it pushing if you have any questions for me uh ask them down in the comments if you know anything about the channel then you know i try to take time out every single day it's actually part of my morning routine i drink my coffee and i go through the comments when i get in the bed i go through the comments and answer questions and just respond to people because yeah my people it is so salute to health wealth and self i like you", "IoInXZTovgM": "a Kenosha County man accused of running a large-scale marijuana

pounding on the door is pounding shelly de bello woke up to noise and chaos right next door to her condo last Thursday morning I just looked outside and eventually Kenosha County pulled up several days later she's learning it was for a raid of a large scale marijuana operation that she had no clue existed doesn't even seem possible actually because we didn't I didn't see any of that but maybe it's the position where I am but I didn't see people in and out of there Kenosha County prosecutors say for the past two years 20-year old Tyler Hofheinz had 10 employees making between 3000 and 5000 counterfeit vaping cartridges per day that were filled with THC oil from marijuana authorities seized 188 pounds of marijuana valued at 1.5 million dollars along with eight firearms and about 20 thousand dollars in cash I didn't even think anything like that was being made you know locally or you know out of somebody's house another warrant was served at Hofheinz family house here in paddock Lake neither sir any relation to Tyler finds is there anything you'd like to say about the allegations the arrest comes as health officials across the country and here in Wisconsin investigate hundreds of vaping hospitalizations tied to severe lung disease while it's unknown whether Huff Heinz alleged operation is linked to any illnesses doctors warned against buying counterfeit vaping

in the village of Bristol Ben Jordan today's TMJ for", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "5WulyTJgX0k": "[Music] hello my name is Ryan and today we're gonna be checking out the Jack Herer vape cartridge by Absolut extracts I love this strain just because it's a great cerebral high so I always use this during the day so let's go and check this out the packaging gives us a lot of good info it's hybrid meaning it's a strange combination of sativa and indica Jack Herer is more sativa dominant which is one of the reasons why I love it turn to the side you'll see it's 60% THC and now to the back they'll let us know there are no additives and they use a clean co2 extraction process which is proprietary to ABX okay let's attach the cartridge to our ABX battery you can buy this too at hello MD comm or use any 510 thread battery you already have it tastes great it's an earthy flavor with a hint of dried berries I'd recommend that you take one puff and then wait about 15 minutes before you take another you could get this now at hello MD calm until next time guys have a good one [Music]", "_dwDGj43WRM": "hey everybody it's Jay again with a brand new video on how to fix a broken vape pen cartridge this is an extension of my previous video which I'll put the link right there for you that I made last year on how to do this exact same thing but in that amount of time I have learned a couple of new things which is going to be number four and number five and in this video I'm gonna go through everything that I explained in the last video but I'm going to do a little faster so hopefully that'll make some of you happy that don't like sitting through very long videos but it is important that I cover all these details so that we know what is going on so without further ado if you like these videos please consider subscribing I'm a stay-at-home dad and if you in these videos helped you out please consider donating to my venmo @j Andres or to my cash app j1 two to zero so without further ado let's start off with number one is the air flow disrupted let's check all four areas so number one is the mouthpiece right so our cartridge our mouthpiece on these particular cartridges these are the kingpin brand the mouthpiece actually comes unscrewed so if we do unscrew the mouthpiece we can see real easily it's not clogged so there's no reason to go any further with that one if you had a severe oil leakage your oil might be clogged up inside of there and then in that case just use a pipe cleaner to get that out of there or a little rolled-up piece of paper towel or something one thing I notice is I just knocked off this little rubber washer so I'm just gonna put that back into place there you go nice and sticky there's also a rubber washer right in there to go up flush against that glass to keep that that oil from leaking out so let's put that back together so area number one is the mouthpiece we just check that it's good area number two is the bottom air hole so the bottom air holes right there is it clogged obviously if it's not obviously clogged then we're just gonna skip that what we don't want to do before I go any further I know we have some different tools up here I got my little paperclip and I got pipe cleaner and all that what we don't want to do is please do not stick anything through the entirety of your cartridge because we have these little wicks that are inside of these two little holes right there and right there which are the same as these two little holes right there and there this cartridge the glass does not screw off I had to break it off for the demo purposes of this display here okay so is your mouthpiece clogged is the bottom air hole clogged number three of this section is the side holes near the bottom of the threading this is the bottom threading there are air holes right there so when we screw on our cartridge to our battery those air holes receive air from the fourth section the air flow slots at the top of the pen which are right there they look like little castle teeth air will flow in through here and then it will enter the side holes near the top of the threading and then also - it will enter through the bottom this is the contact pin that makes contact with this little plate of your battery that sends electricity to this and then this transfers electricity to your wick coils there are two four one two three four this coil is missing the wick because I took it out the wick absorbs the oil from your middle cylinder so all of your oil will be in here and then the oil will go into those holes right there into the wick the wick receives electricity and heat from the coils and it turns your liquid into vapor which you then inhale so hopefully that is a quick understanding of how that works where are those coils you might ask those coils are inside of the rubber gasket so the anatomy here is this center contact pin slides into this rubber gasket and then inside of the rubber gasket there should be two little fine wires which wrap around a wick on the outside of this rubber gasket there will be another set of two so there's two outside the rubber washer there's two wires inside the rubber washer what I believe is happening to a lot of people is that when you purchase these the cartridges unfortunately I think when the robots are putting these together at the factory the robots are putting the center contact pin back in for the final step of assembly and when they put this pin back in what I very firmly believe is this pen when they push it in there it is displacing the coil wires so that's point number two is the enter wick coil displaced and then not touching the contact pin that is the contact then this is the coil wire the coil wire wraps around a wick there should be two wicks which you won't see he should never see because if you see those then they're out of place those wicks again go through these holes they're right in the middle of these holes and this goes straight through you see that and there are two holes one two there should be two wicks inside of there nothing else if those wicks get displaced then you have problem number three so going back to problem number two is the center wick coil displaced and not touching the contact and what you would have to do is you would have to take your contact pin out like I did with my fingernails and then you would check no I don't know if you could see right there there are two little wires let me see if I could bring this closer in focus there are two little wires in there if you don't see your two wires and you only see one that means that one of them got pushed up out of place and now you only have one or maybe you like this better got pushed up out of place and there's only one wire because of the robots the evil robots now if they got displaced you can use a special tool which is use a special tool to recenter one or both of the coil wires what we don't want to do is when we're fishing in there for that wire we don't want to pull it completely out because it is not infinite length it is only this long and that long if you pull that out you're gonna pull the wick with it and then all of your fluid is going to go where into the middle air cylinder and you're gonna get a hard gurgling and you're gonna start losing a bunch of your fluid and there's no recovering that right so this is a tool from a sewing kit if you say we're threading a needle and you put this through the needle you could put your string in through that hole and then you would pull this through and it pulls the thread through the needle that's what this is from a sewing kit also - from my soldering kit I got these very very fine tweezers which are definitely going to be able to get that coil if you can get your tweezers onto them right if your coils are out of place then you're probably going to get a blinking error code when you go to hit this thing when you go to light it instead of it just lighting nice and smooth it might blink three or four times a weird color different colors and that is an error code letting you know that there's something wrong from the inner workings of your cartridge the electricity is not flowing properly do not pull the wires completely out or your oil will leak you might be missing a wire due to a manufacturer defect and if that's the case maybe go back to your local store and then say hey I think that there's a problem here I'm missing my center coil my manye for my bat my cartridge isn't working so hopefully if you live in a legal state you can go back to your store and you can get that replaced otherwise you might be out of luck and if you are out of luck in that instance then you might have to transfer your oil to a working cartridge like an empty one and empty working or non leaking cartridge so I always suggest keep these around when you're done with them when they're empty because if it was where if you had one that was working and you have say a brand new one that isn't working you could transfer the oil from this one to this one by simply unscrewing the cap and then you can actually stack these on top of each other if you have a steady hand and my previous video I did that so you could check that out you could put this part on top of the similar part and they will stack and all the oils transfer down the middle and go into the cylinder of your working cartridge so let's put that back on there before any more oil leaks out so that was number two is the center with coil displaced number three are your wicks out of place and now your oils leaking so you might say well what's the wick again that is the wick right there there should be two of them a wick that is wrapped with a coil and there would be another wick inside of this coil and those are inside of there those wires travel down the bottom of this cartridge and make contact with the center cylinder and with the bottom contact pin which will make contact with your battery contact plate all right so if your Center wick is out of place you're gonna know because you're not going to be able to draw a clean fresh smooth vapor out of your cartridge it's gonna seem to be stuck and you the tell-tale sign the very real sign is you're gonna hear a gurgling a slurping gurgling and that means that inside of the middle cylinder instead of this air and vapor going through you have oil leaking into these holes because your wicks are not in the hole they've been displaced so if they've been displaced oil is gonna go in the hole and you're gonna get a gurgling so if that happens that's number three while your wicks out of place transfer your oil your liquid to a working cartridge you can go to your local smoke shop and get a little ceramic tip we can get one of these not brand specific but you can get a generic one you can transfer your oil there it might take you some time but it might be your only option if you live in a non legal state number four these are the new additions did you try and screen your pen to increase the air flow well what what happens is over time the for air flow areas become clogged and it will disrupt your air flow so all we're gonna do is instead of screwing it on all the way nice and tight I found that sometimes all you got to do is just unscrew it a little bit and that will help increase the air flow into the side holes near the bottom of threading or it may increase the possibility of the airflow is going to go through the bottom air hole right there well minus the pen or a minus the contact pen so try unscrewing and to increase your air flow number five is your cartridge just getting old and clogged this is vapor it's sticky liquid and as you continue to use your product to the point of completion residue is just going to build up in there we all know that from smoking our tobacco pipes screens need to be replaced different cleaning solutions need to be used whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get air flow and these aren't any difference so as your a cartridge getting old and clogs so what I do is I actually inhale some fire lightly through the tip and blow out the melted wax so what do I mean by that is in my with my tip here I will just inhale put my mouth on the mouthpiece there and I will very lightly very lightly just a little mouth drag like you're hitting a cigar like a little give a little kiss and get kissed that the sticky oil in there with some fire and then blow it out below that sticky oil out right let me see if I could demonstrate this so not so much came out but maybe I could do it with already took these off anyway it works just try it out if you're not hearing if you just try it if you have this off and you try to take a mouth drag off it and you don't hear clean air going through it's clogged in there and that is very easily going to be your problem if it's if it's just getting old and clogged it might be new and clogged we don't know but just inhale a little bit of fire through that tip and then below that sticky wax out it will be hard sticky wax also turn to melted sticky wax and then you can blow it out let's see also - we can use the lighter to gently melt the thread wax on the cartridge so this is the thread the threading here that might get some sticky residue so we could just melt that and then just wipe it off and you'll get something same thing - with the inside of your pen just give a little just a little quick melt and then get inside of there and clean it out there's gonna be something and that something the threading if that threading gets all gunked up here and here then you're not going to get any airflow through the bottom hole which I should probably put that back so again one if we since I'm doing this let's talk real quick about is the center quit the Senator wick quill displaced when the robots are putting these back together when they push these in there I believe that this contact pin is pushing the wire is out of place and/or just snapping them on like snapping a heart sorry about the focusing on this camera let me see if I can fix it tada all right so when this is getting pushed in at the factory I think it's snapping these off or just moving them out of place so hopefully this video helps you out I've been I've been noticing when I've been using mine as they get older simply unscrewing them a little bit helps out a lot so just unscrew it a little bit and that should increase crease your air flow and then also to use the lighter trick to get them from being clogged all right so that's that hopefully this video helped you if the previous one didn't again sorry about the focusing issues I was unaware of whatever focusing issues were happening again if you like this video just subscribe they'll help me to get paid so you don't have to donate to me but if you do want to donate that would be super dope because you know I'm a stay-at-home dad so thanks again my name is Jay have an awesome rest of your day", "zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "wnA8RonpTcc": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today so if you keep up with my channel you'll know that I review a few different cartridges well in the last week I planned on going hiking so I picked up a couple that seemed to be good quality I picked up a pure which is premium ultra refined extractions limoncello alright this butane processed 89 percent for a total of 90 so it's a 90 percent THC cartridge or you know basically alright it's all it says and I also picked up a brand that I'm really happy with this is a Jack Herer this was a sativa from canna clouds hashtag kin of clouds 502 and this one here ninety one point seven percent THC or cannabinoids with the THC of 83 and TCA of 7.5 worked it out that's good cuz point twos right there alright this is persue stand produced and processed by eh farms this was done by eh o alcohol solomon extraction okay so we've got these two different oils we've got a butane processed oil we've got an alcohol processed oil both of them seem to be good there's one ever the other difference this cartridge right here is produced by C cell this is an M 528 Jupiter okay now this came from the can of clouds very nice this particular cartridge here this came from the pier this one as you can clearly see is an AV D cartridge I think we can see the model number underneath it looking at AV d 0 6 to 9 RP 1-800 - okay now well I was hiking I was utilizing both of these cartridges as they have different flavors and different effects and I was enjoying them immensely however I noticed before too long that my AVD cartridge which you can see right here this actually has a little bit of oil on the end right there and see it's actually caked all the way around the base of it here no for comparison we can get the C cell right here no oil in any of the pores the draw ports very clean very nice no you may think that this one was used quite a bit more than this one and therefore that may have been the cause that's not true I was utilizing them both through this vape mod battery it has a very simple magnetic connector you screw onto your 510 thread cartridge it is draw activated works very nice big clouds battery stays good most of the day not to worry now this cartridge which is only my second AVD cartridge that i've gotten recently has started to leak this of course is a C cell cartridge if you watch my videos you will know that I get C cells regularly for an example there are some of my cartridges from the recent days this is my only other AVD as you can see something is inside that cartridge I don't know if that was done when it was filling by the processor or if that was something left in there in the construction of the cartridge I'm not sure but this is my only other AVD I decided not to utilize this because that is an unknown factor it could either be from the processor or from the manufacturer but that being said these are all C cell cartridges they all work exceptionally well see cell C so C cell C so C so so that being said a VD I'm afraid I'm gonna have to buy another one and see if it does the same thing I am very happy with the quality of the can of clouds cartridges there were no massive temperature differences maybe 2025 degrees they were not sitting in the Sun at any point in time nor sitting in a freezing area this is something that does happen and it does occur so shop around a little bit watch some more of my videos and don't just watch my channel watch some other channels to see what they have to say about different cartridges that they've had experiences with because not all these companies are available in all the states that being said this is John with C&C connoisseurs you guys have a good day and I look forward to seeing you again peace", "x1SEo05vk5Q": "hello hello cannabis connoisseurs welcome back to the channel Kimo here with a brand new purchase just back from the store with this new paper cartridge called a collab project sativa 0.5 then we're really looking forward to tearing this open so let's get down to and see what's inside all right here we are so we got the collab projects at Eva is 0.51 510 threaded cartridge coming in at eight hundred fifty milligrams THC and eight point five milligrams of CBD okay let's check this bad boy out we have it so got your standard 510 threaded big cartridge here nothing too fancy or you know standard thing you th see warning label on here this little mouthpiece condom ah well alright yeah it's a nice-looking cartridge against as far as cartridges go let's just stick it on the old standard 510 thread battery any one of these bad boys will do for it of course and let's give it a go shall we see I mean yeah it's good mmm I don't know what a bit of a peppery earthy flavor to it definitely nice very smooth on the first draw here so first impression is very nice on this let me check another one out it's a very nice flavor profile going on with this thing I got to admit it's great it doesn't really see what the strain is on it just says sativa but this is really wonderful okay so I'm gonna put this thing through its paces here the next little while and yeah come back and let y'all know what I think of it overall okay so final thoughts on the collab project vape pen here I really like it I've been ripping this thing all day long gives you a nice buzz nice long lasting buzz it's energetic focused sativa buzz great for daytime use great wake and bake extreme it's fantastic the effects are great you're gonna get just a Teva strong sativa buzz out of this thing it's gonna last a lot and we're ripping it all day you know this tank is gonna last you for a while and you're gonna feel good about this little tank and get up and go here for you good value on it like I said went to the store wasn't going to buy this I was going to buy a San Raphael 510 cartridge that was 0.3 grams at 0.5 that was 73 percent THC is 85 percent THC this is three dollars cheaper so value wise this is very easy to recommend effect wise is very easy to recommend flavor wise very easy to recommend it's good taste you got kind of a spicy peppery earthy taste can find a lot of information online about the collab project it's at Eve is 0.5 like I don't know what strain it is which is a little annoying but whatever it is it's really good I don't know if it's all natural cannabis terpene in here if there's a some kind of botanical terpenes added I know they do that with some vapes nowadays I'm not sure but try to find out a little information I tried to get some more from the review I couldn't find much but whatever it is it's really good it's really smooth it's not harsh it's got a good taste good amount of vapor production so overall this thing is really easy to

min of vaping health scare the new hope police chief announced a record seizure of illegal vaping cartridges that contained the active ingredient in marijuana the bust happened in [ __ ] Rapids but was announced in New Hope because the lead investigator on the case is a new hope officer that officer was part of the Northwest Metro drug task force which sees 75 thousand vaping cartridges that contain potent levels of THC many of the cartridges were marketed toward younger users with names on packages like fruity pebbles and strawberry shortcake authorities say using illegal THC cartridges can be very dangerous because the ingredients aren't always clear I want to urge all parents have conversations with your kids your loved ones anybody that you know that are using these cartridges stop using them get help go to treatment have conversations about the dangers these types of products are available for purchase in supplier states that have already passed law as legalizing recreational marijuana if you think this is a problem now wait until cannabis products become commercially available in Minnesota this is yet another example of why we should pause take our time before passing similar laws in the state currently there are more than 500 people in the US with serious lung injuries because of vaping and that number is expected to grow", "evWCqaf4EX4": "hello my name is Kip and I'm the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "LUDYeJtJidU": "what's up everybody welcome back or welcome today we are going to see how to take apart a sealed cartridge now normally as countries they're either sealed or the screwed on and the round ones like these are usually sealed supposed to be sealed compressed into there and the they have other ones that have the fluted or the flat tip that are also compressed in there but this cart is still reusable so if you can get it open you can fill it back up we use it quite a few times before you have to get rid of it so you can't untwist it this is that doesn't have a school screw on her screw thread on there when you take it apart I'm gonna show you right now you don't want to try to turn it what you want to do is try and twist it and pull it twist it and pull it but you want to be careful you don't damage it because you don't want to grab it with the pliers and mess up the anything around it to make it sharp or this form so you've got to grab a towel then with pliers you grab this end make sure you got enough of a towel there okay okay and then you're gonna wiggle slowly wiggle slowly wiggle take your time just keep wiggling and bam you got yourself a open card now you can refill it reuse it you wanna be take your time be gentle cuz you can break this whole part often it's no good okay but if you keep wiggling you will get it out I've tried twisting it before and I've never had success that way but if you wiggle wiggle wiggle it'll come out mmm it smells like piney but oh you're on the mouthpiece there and they're still all your in there so this is still reusable there's no reason to toss it out if you can still fill it back up point I just refill it when you want to and to put it back together you're just gonna have to obviously put it back where it was in the slot there and push it down hard and you will be able to seal it back up there once it's filled up you fill it up like a normal cartridge screw on cartridge and then you can go ahead and compress it and it will go back into place okay it's a little bit far out there very little so once it's in place and you're not gonna spill your oil you can flip it probably down push it okay so I've had this problem before too so it's not sealing right now so what we're gonna have to do it's clean around the edges because it has oil so the oil is not letting it sit back down it's acting as like a grease so you want to clean around here okay and clean around here and then press it back together so that's what I'm gonna do right now I'll come back and you'll see it'll go back together okay so I've cleaned up both sides around here and around the inside of here okay you want to be careful when you're filling it up you don't want to get nothing in this area here because it won't let it sit back down so when you fill it up you want to use a syringe or clean it up after you fill it up - down here now that we got both parts cleaned you can go ahead and push it down you can leave it like that since you don't want anything to spill and push it down hard okay you see it even grab the towel there and then when uh you got it sealed a bit you can turn it back around see the back tight and there you go back to normal sealed and will not come out you don't want to do like I did don't even fix a towel there you see that so I'll take that off later but this is just to show you you can pull it out if that happens to you pull it out a little bit and pull it push it back in you can see it's right back in its place and it's not coming out okay usually when you twist these do not come out when they twist you can twist all day long and you're not gonna get them out okay you can only do it the way I explained there and that's how to use your shield cart a lot of dispensaries have this style as well as the threaded style so if you get this style running you use it there you go", "jQsH7R2eWMo":

little gap here shouldn't it should be like pushed down so that was another thing I've been looking but so this is the one I grabbed today the liquid looks legit the bubble moves a little little quicker and it's not too thick but I have had cartridges where the bubble moves fast and it still gets me guy and see the thing right here look at I said I don't know why this has more of a gap to it

truly for me to use it it's just for trying purposes and let me let me show you so basically what i got first i ordered it from a specific site that i'll put all the information down below because i don't remember i've been ordering stuff online like crazy hotcakes i've been ordering online i have packages stacked upon stack so i don't remember exactly it's like cbd pure i don't know i'm gonna put the link down below from where i got these but they came in separate packaging from their own specific company like i bought it from this site but it came from the regular from like like koi this is what i got some cbd gummies it's six in a bag for ten dollars each zero thc sour tropical fruit gummies all right i got this i got two of them so this was twenty dollars and then i had gotten this i thought this was super interesting this is kaya organics 200 milligrams cbd vape in like a berry flavor and this was buy one get one free they have a buy one get one free right now and this came out to 39.99 so it's 20 for each of these and 10 dollars for each of these and i'm going to give one to each of my brothers so this is a gift that i'm going to be giving out so i'm not going to try this i'm not going to use this this is what i bought though i'm giving these as gifts and you know what if i was thinking i have basically 573 or 78 followers right now 570 something i'm thinking for my thousand subscriber like celebration i'm going to do a giveaway i'm going to do a giveaway and i want to know what giveaway do you think i should do what's a reasonable giveaway i can do for my

your nerves i don't know what do you think tell me in the descriptions below what would be my future giveaway for my thousand subscriber and everything 1000 subscribers please help me get there that'll be cool so on that note i have also this is what i got for myself this is a cbd vape pen this is a higher milligram dosage this was more money this was much more money okay so this is the vape pen i believe it says and this is the bubble gum honey bubble gum flavor pure and clear so i got this because it doesn't have like all those types of i don't know explain it it says no pg or vg that's a type of ingredient they use that's supposed to be not good for you and i heard so i don't know i just got this this is organic hemp slim and lightweight adjustable heap settings preheat functions vape pen hemp oil concentrate cannabis derived tested pure blah blah blah mind body spirit fast acting really so this is 250 milligrams and this is 200 milligrams this is not bad for 20 200 milligrams for like 500 puffs or something i said i don't know but this is 250 milligrams what does it mean to experience pure spectrum enlightenment intuition creativity compassion vitality relationships and grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "EH4lQsdp6aI": "welcome back to the cannabis packaging show we are contempo specialty packaging episode 4 of the 12 episode saga talking about bakes and carts today Dan in particular wants to be on this show we're about to bring Nick on the show dan was like I got a lot to say here so we got a bunch of options we want to show you some creative options Dan anything before we kick this off let's jump right into it I love it alright and good so take it away okay original a sliding box kit you've seen that at the trade shows some people go up to make the traitors like I would never use that that is so different from my branding yes we customized things it's not for you it's all about what you're about this is another one that is very popular it's our that was one of our first products that people really fell in love with they're like wow I see how this is different I see how this is better that's out there it's a nice texture paper on the bottom and a soft touch paper with a black hot stamp on the top all right they're board insert in this one let's keep it let's keep it rolling rapid fire because we get a lot to go through this is a less expensive option it's our blister fold or I don't have one that's open but this is one long piece and the blister pops in and you fold it tapes together and you can customize it any way you want we can use all of our foils spot UV any kind of coloration you want or a nice textured paper if you want to go that route less expensive way that you could still make very customizable and look great so it's going to say is you have adhesive on that so you don't need any heat sealing equipment and that's something that a lot of people have liked about that concept all right customizable blisters is another two piece box it just has a nice angle to it so it has the colorful feel there and inside we have an Eevee a foam insert which is a dense foam it's a soft touch of varnish on it as well that's just a wood pattern that we printed it still has that you know luxe natural look folding box but it's on a foil printed on foil board so it has a nice shimmer to it a little more bling a lot of people they're looking at the cosmetic market as what their cannabis brands are about and I think it's good but I want to make a point that I think people should still because a lot of people are thinking that way make sure you still maintain your unique angle so don't go cookie cutter try to think of how you're going to be separate from other people who are thinking in this cosmetic mindset a lot of people are using the vault box for their cartridges this one doesn't have an insert the vault box exclusive to contempo specialty packaging yes patent pending patent pending child resistant certified trademark trademark the two began which we shown in our pre-roll show pr\u00e9val show but also another option so the dates this is a non contempo product but we want to show it because it looks great we have a pattern on the outside which matches the products on the inside I think that would be awesome with the disposable pen where you match the pattern on the pen custom pen match the pattern to the box like the Kate Spade pen so sometimes you can get inspired from other industries and do the same thing and get the same advantages that those people did but this is another paper product through peaceful signing box the feedback has been and I quote outstanding on that box and the texture in the field this is not a contempo product but we think it looks really nice it's a textured paper on the bottom on the top and it's a very simple on folding box good job it's not super sturdy but it still looks really nice and they have a folding board insert inside really cool of that contrasting look so you can have you know one look where everything's really uniform everything's really clean or you can have really nice contrasting you can see the color contrast the craft versus the board and then you can see the embossing contrast that they've done here really really cool look and again they've done it well so you can go with either of those and I think they've done a nice job on that and the reveal of this icon as you open it is also a really nice touch yeah so bloom farms has outstanding branding outstanding packaging this is a good example of how you can make something as simple as a folding box and still be able to charge a premium price for it and compete in that premium market so this is a $70 product here so this is a reusable vape pen along with the charger so again really good job here and using some nice craft board materials dressing it up a bit with your branding the branding does in fact match the pen that was included in the Box done a good job I think of also matching this story that they're telling like we talked about the Instagram feeds the social media campaign that the provide they live and really having that match up with the packaging of the story they're telling in the stores good company good things and just a couple of different options that you can use to put the actual product in this is a vac form in here which is molded plastic that we would mold specifically around your product for a perfect fit and this is a board insert much like that Bloomfield box the board just folds in to create the cavity and then of course we have the EBA foam these are not see our boxes nor was the bloom farmer one so it states that demand CR on the primary packaging that's not going to work in many states the exit bag is still sufficient until a certain point in time that's been marked so just keep that in mind that we're well aware of all the CR laws and we're showing you options because it's currently available and once the primary packaging is required to be CR probably won't be seeing these things from us but the wallbox is still a perfect option solves all the problems all the world's problems are next looking sharp in that suit you're coming on the next episode of hope you know that oh yeah of course all right good all right

and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway

each other out there Sheeran and chemo back on the channel here got another product to review for you today we've got a 510 threaded vape cartridge from sundial cannabis called lemon riot we got 0.5 grams sativa hybrid coming in at 791 milligrams THC one point five milligrams CBDs are gonna be hitting about 79 80 percent THC on this less than a percent CBD it's a heavy hitting THC vape cartridge from sundial tried this strain before in flower sundial product the lemon riot really enjoyed it purchased it a few times it's got a great taste a nice citrusy lemon taste flavor in the bud really looking forward to see how that translates to the cartridge here for some beeping you know what without further ado let's get this package open it's a little bit of a unique package I haven't seen one like this before um yeah it's okay I will let you know it was packaged in November 16th 2019 and like I said it's a 0.5 grams let's without further ado let's get it okay I'm really excited to try this guy I just want to rip it open so um we're gonna go to a so on the top here it says twist in a line and push up so we twist what are we twisting here yeah sometimes these things are not too clear okay there you go so we want to looks like we're aligning here Oh push the top oh look at that it's kind of crazy little pop so push the top off you got your cartridge in there just like that kind of neat let's take it out of here if we can yeah it's a little foam thing in there it's kind of neat like a little push pop so still some wasteful packaging right you know Canadian legal cannabis wasteful packaging but go to I mean it's kind of a neat package and I do like that you kind of have somewhere that you can put this afterwards if you in between cartridges so that's kind of cool so let's put that cool package over here and let's see what we got all right so here's your standard 510 threaded VAP cartridge oil looks you know not bad pretty clear not too bad looking for oil I've seen worse doesn't look too murky kind of moving a little bit in there when I move it that's good it's kind of what you want to see in your oil I think so for my experience this is a nice color you got the sundial branding on the one side and the other side you got your THC warning sticker along the bottom here says lemon riot and yellow let's take the little mouthpiece condom off and yeah we've got our most about the charger on our battery let's take it off standard battery here for a 510 threaded cartridge let's screw it on and there you go so looks like ready to rock so without any further ado and let's jump right in I'm really excited to try this out oh yeah you got that citrusy lemon flavor kind of a earthy kind of taste to it as well I was expecting to be hit over the head with just lemon citrusy flavor there's a bit there but it's got a little bit more of a an earthy flavor to it you know kind of hummus almost like kind of piney in a way yeah you definitely definitely kind of get those hints those notes of lemon citrus on the inhale and on the exhale you get sort of a earthy piney taste now this is a really nice balanced flavor to this I really like it but it's surprising I thought it was gonna be a little bit more like BAM you know hit me with that citrus lemony flavor but it is there a little subtle but it is a good taste I like the exhale flavor is a little bit earthy kind of piney good sort of a class of cannabis flavor going on with this um it's been about what 40 seconds since I took a drag I almost feel like again a little bit of effects going on here this is my first hit of the day haven't had anything before this I like to come into these reviews kind of fresh so uh first impressions packaging is pretty nice design I don't know no I'm not gonna give it any awards on design there's kind of a lot going on here you got the white top the yellow bottom you got the branding there it's not going on it's alright but for taste so far really enjoying it lemon citrusy piney earthy on you so it's really nice great flavor so we're gonna get this marinating here we're gonna check it out gonna hate this up throughout the day put it through its paces okay so for the last couple days just exclusively they've been using the Sunday lemon riot vape here I've got to say I like this thing hits you hard it lasts for a while and it comes on pretty quick it's it's good B it's about eighty percent THC so you know it's gonna hit hard but it lasts for a while it's gonna last you about one or two hours on set right away what you're gonna get is a nice daytime sativa high you know cerebral head kind of focused energetic happy overall gets through your day really good babe I like it recommended value wise you know these things run about fifty bucks seems to be about standard for a 5-10 credit card trade you get about they say 0.5 grams in there which is standard for these unfortunately we'd like to see something your tanks come out and some cheaper prices but what can we do right we're gonna get there for what it is though you get a good value like I said I've been reefing on this thing for two days oh three to five five second drags every time and you know we still got quite a bit of oil in the tank as you can see it's gonna last you for a while we're gonna get you through value eyes give it a thumbs up effects wise two thumbs up you know even the packaging I know I like to rip on the Canadian legal weed packaging I like this packaging you know it's got that pop top push pop you got a little container that you can put it back in here you want to switch cartridges back and forth is it a little wasteful a little much yes but I do like it what can I say I like their packaging this one so value effect is good values good effect is good taste flavor yeah this where you might be a little disappointed you're expecting a real citrusy lemon hit you over the head with flavor you're not going to get it that's what I was expecting as well - what you get is you know a little bit of lemon citrusy on the inhale on the exhale more of an earthy piney kind of flavor and that's definitely the more dominant flavor that's a tasty hit in the mouth afterwards I don't not like it it's not bad it's just not what I was expecting at all when I got when I went and got something named lemon right because I have had the flower before does have a really strong citrusy lemony taste to it didn't really fully come through on here but I gotta say I'm not disappointed with the taste that's there so overall everybody I'm gonna say definitely recommend a limit right sundial 510 0.5 sativa cannabis faith cartridge here for you that's the end of my review thumbs up recommended let me know what you think as always leave me a comment read them

"BmJZPhk9Y5s": "if you're not a canvas patient or of age please fight off of this video yo guys what's going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the dank tank battery so they did send me a couple of them so i have the blue one here unopened i have the black one here unopened and then i did open the red one for myself i already put my battery in and all that but here's pretty much what comes with it it comes with like a little lanyard a charger and then this one gram cartridge unopened obviously so i went ahead and put in my true leaf cartridge so it also does come with a magnet so since this is a half gram it does look kind of weird in here but it's not a big deal if you really want to keep it portable this is super super small so i'm going to go ahead and read off the back of it so i'm going to show you guys this and i'm going to read off the back of the other one so 650 milliamp battery i'm just going to read them the important things 3.2 volts to 4.2 the ceramic atomizer that's the ones that comes with it and then the charger and all the basic stuff nothing nothing too special but the lanyard does go on this piece right here and since this is the red battery came with the red lanyard i'm assuming this one is going to be blue and this one is going to be black but here is the cartridge itself the tree leaf cartridge i forgot the strain exactly but if you guys are looking at this battery i'm gonna have the link down below so you guys can go ahead and check it out it does help me out if you guys go ahead and use that link but let's go ahead and take a hit [Music] so you guys didn't see that this was lighting up but this is going to be the medium setting so it's going to be like purple and i don't know what the other one is let's see blue okay so it's like red purple and then like blue so this is the medium so it should be like 3.6 volts something around there and go ahead and hit it again this way you guys can actually see the color [Music] one second so if you guys are wondering why there was a cut i got a phone call so i was just answering that but yeah this little battery does hit well the good thing is that it's small and that's also a bad thing so it's kind of annoying if you like having a full grip on the battery but you can also palm this battery so you can't even see it if you really want to conceal it but i'm going to go ahead and take another rib i've taken like two or three already i'm gonna go ahead and take another one jeez all right it's like the third rip i'm going to take like one or two more i can see if they can take a blinker i don't know if this battery does but we'll see [Music] i don't know how many seconds i was but that was enough that i could take before i just coughed it all out so it would have been kind of useless of a hit because i wouldn't have been able to inhale it but yeah this is a nice battery i do have these other two maybe i'll give one away on my instagram and give one to my friend but you guys can go ahead and look out for that my instagram is at i'm ethan smokes you guys can go ahead and check that out but this is the battery like i said you guys can't go ahead and look at the link down below and if it's not there look at the comments because youtube is kind of annoying with the links and stuff like that so you guys can check that if not it might be on my instagram or my twitter it's the same handle so you guys can go ahead and check that out i can take one more hit and then end off the video [Music] thank you guys for watching make sure you guys leave a like comment

another episode I really appreciated all the support if you haven't subscribed yet feel free to go ahead and subscribe hit the notification bill today we're going to be reviewing shattered house now shattered house is a brand I don't know if you're familiar with the Central Coast of California but they have them in dispensaries up and down the coastline up there and it's a really really good brand so you know I reached out you know lucky enough they reached out back to me so I have this skittles right here now this isn't live resin or instead of C so this is a clear dissolute oil and we're going to take this out and we're going to go ahead and give us a test right here so you know it's in the packaging very very nicely packaged and I will open this up and go ahead and get to work on this well we are that is so like I say they have dispensaries up and down Central Coast if you don't know that's like soundless Obispo Santa Barbara all the way on down to Ventura Oxnard Carpinteria you know it's a nice little trip you never get to California check it out sometime so I have this cartridge right here already nicely thoroughly tested so I know it works see hit the button is blue ready to go this is a twist bottom but we'll talk about that in a minute let me go ahead and get this situated and we'll go ahead and deal with that in a minute so like I said this is clear distillate skills they pronounce it with that ass I mean as e-excuse me you know so if you see them with the S then it might be something different but the real skills they pronounce it with the Z is more like the gills as ki TTL use these gills so you know just so you know but uh so as you can see it's a clear Desa Li right there the viscosity level is looking real real nice I don't really get caught up in the twist now that I learned a little bit more because like if they just put something in here then they could go ahead and you know you can add it and tell you that it's really not the good stuffs not in there but the viscosity love was looking good like I said these are seaso cartridges but they still have the ceramic coiled it's a little bit different then they have the red top right there on there so you know it looks like gunmetal kind of a futuristic type of looks still looking cool so let me go ahead and put this on make sure that you have your batteries adjusted to the three point six to three point eight votes or supreme superior performance of the cartridge and make sure that your battery source is always fully charged the better charge the better performance so it's that 2.0 right now so we need to get it to you know and leave me I like mine at three point eight so we're going to try to get it as close as possible and put the cartridge on there and as you can see the desolate is clear nice and clear and everything is looking good so before I take the hits I like to first you know test it make sure that the cartridge is actually working then I like to very very nice very very nice you know it's good to actually you know it's good to actually it's good to actually have someone actually good cartridges that's actually good because now with the gang didn't so oversaturated with a recreational in dispensaries popping up everywhere people is just going crazy with the manipulation and everybody you got a brand and it's done another so it's good to know that there's still good brands out there like shudder house so I appreciate you guys stopping by oh these ones are hey nice you had to forgive you I don't know what I was thinking you judge uh-huh yeah told you shatter house so these ones are getting pretty nice you know go ahead and check out in the description you know for all info and inquiries and these ones right here you really need to check out I think they might be going down towards LA area you know so but go ahead and check out in the description Harlan let's take this last one together [Music] yeah which are next Wednesday child", "a9QBI4Cif10": "you guys what's going on it's your boy can we're back with another YouTube video real quick I'm sorry you might have just heard it if you hear that a little like chirping noise that's my stupid bird she just woke up so she's really loud and obnoxious so yeah I got to get the video down though so we're gonna go through it anyway I hope it's not too bad I'll try and make sure next videos she's either asleep or it's in a different location because I usually try to time it a lot of my videos right thing and she's asleep but not today because it is broad daylight [Music] so yeah today's parts are gonna be well it's just one car but I'm going to tell you about to today's first car that we're actually reviewing in this video is the vape n indica blackberry right there never had this straight before never had I can't say never had vape pen because I've had quite a few vape pens and then the one I already smoked that I wanted to tell you about was the vape pen hybrid which was called grape all I made this one was a really good part the grape was like an extremely prominent flavor after you finished smoking like hit it was like a lingering grape flavor which is actually pretty interesting you don't get like super strong fruity flavors all the time but like this one you did so if you guys like great go ahead and check out grape blind made it came out at 90 1.21 it's backwards from me so I can't tell exactly but ninety one point two one I think yeah so pretty good good ass number um I got both of these for 20 bucks each I think it was they usually run 30 so deals around here with like the coronavirus themselves and like the curbside pickup they're always like running a bit cheaper so I got these for 20 each so pretty great deal if they were full grams they should be 40 bucks obviously but these are just halves so like I said great great just like chill high hybrid so what do you expect but yeah the stellar think about this one is the great after if you do like that I suggest getting that Carter if you can go to a dispensary that sells them legally right yeah okay let's go ahead and pop this first one open here the only one this is the Blackbird and look at that guy's you already know my favorite part about vape pens right who doesn't love a sticker that's gonna get plastered somewhere in my room when I go on my phone and if you want my phone case so here we go here's the card comes in this little plastic container like always nice yellow gold ish tint looking thing there's a good old bubble in there when is there not right there gorgeous color where's the bag you guys know if you guys watch my channels you guys know I like these black tips better than the oval looking shoots just because you get West I feel like you get less foreign [ __ ] in there but yeah here's the oil up close out of the box gorgeous gorgeous color yes one thing about vaping is their coils are will be very consistent so if you get one good card or I haven't got a bad card from vape and I don't think actually the only problem I see with this is riku on that vent right there that one you can see a little pocket of air that's covering the vent that's kind of annoying it's great on there perfectly encompassing it well let's go ahead and pop this bottom part off we'll slide it on the new sublime pen that we got if you guys saw my last video that was a really dope video so shout outs to sublime you guys are awesome it's a been pretty dope and pretty humbling to get that kind of experience so if you guys watch this thank you very much if you haven't seen that last video go check it out just it's like a supplied care package basically they sent me a few edibles and stuff really dope I don't want to spoil what they are so yeah just go check out that with you what that's it um it's going to take a hit guys Cheers Wow okay you know off the first hit alone this is probably the best tasting cart I think I've ever had I mean this thing tastes exactly like blackberries like if you got a handful of blackberry started eating them you could basically eat this cart that is awesome and good for be good for vape and they got that black berry flavor autumn locked um I had some viewers recommend some different new baby pens that came out like the apple pie stuff like that and if man if they're tasted like this we're definitely going to be reviewing them so yeah another quart that he keep getting recommended to try is kind the kind garden um raw garden I'm sorry I'm so stupid frog garden and Susie those are the two main ones that I get all the time unfortunately I cannot get those at the moment I have somebody who's in California who could buy them for me I don't know if I'm gonna do that deal yeah I just don't have the money because they are pretty expensive they're not super bad but I do want to review my one point again I am in Arizona they do not sell live raw oh geez Rob Gardens here or Izzy's in any dispensary that I've seen I'm 99% sure on that if there is one island Chandler whole another city for me I might make the drive to go get it but I need you guys to what no but yeah if you guys want to be a blog for me let me know if you guys want to hit up duty and say hey this guy loves your [ __ ] I want you to review it make that work I don't know but uh it is what it is so let's do know it's almost like it's a bad thing it tastes like this because it's not like it doesn't hurt your dad or anything so it's like you could kind of chain hit this left/right central just does it tastes pretty good well wait hold on hold that thought hydration rate never go wrong with the hydration Bri yeah I do recommend this guy's Greek art they pen always has my recommendation I think in any video it's just their quality eggs hands big fans of it depends also what I wanted to say is still like I still look for in the comments your recommendations for cards to try I love going to different dispose and seeing all these different brands and like strange you guys you guys actually choose from you two reviews so that's pretty big don't try not to say like really you've a pen or like you kind or review like whatever it is like I don't mind just trying to give me like a brand or some extreme and I'll try to if if you do give me a strain I'll try to find a part in that cell that's rain shouldn't be too hard if you give me a brand and a strain I will try to my best to go find that for you and we'll make sure we review it because I don't know I just think that super dope that you guys like have strange you like want to try but you want me to try it first like a little guinea pig so we'll do this but yeah so about this cart we got quite a few bubbles in here but that's okay it makes it a little more interesting character this carts uh definitely getting me there I'm a tall one and one in 10 one to ten I'd say I'm probably a five maybe right now maybe a six so we're not taking too big a hit we don't want to we're not taking too big a heads because we don't want to do that we don't want to talk too much already taken three brand new cars we don't want to waste it so I don't know hydration break I've seen a trend where people take a water bottle cut a little slit in it with a knife or whatever stick your your a pen in there hang put your want ball hold it there tight stab a hole in the bottom with a half filter or like a little quarter field let it drain out I mean pop off the couch I really want to try that in my truck that was his pen if I do I'll try to get a clip of it and see if I can put it in the next video or some dumb [ __ ] so well yeah guys I'm I'm probably eight or nine right now I'm pretty toasted so that was three hits with it pretty high intolerance breaks I thought were it so really do recommend these vape pens blackberry number one recommendation right now from the pen number two would probably be the green this is green my main I'd recommend that one too I heard great planning I'm sorry hey I'm pretty toast so yeah you guys uh you guys like the video you know do whatever with it my crude subscribe or dislike or whatever you feel like doing it's up to you other than that I'm baked and really eat if I can do something else play video games I think if I want to play the video games let me know let me know PC all right well can you

the camera down all right so just a packaging it came with the the sticker on top I didn't show it it says a tamper resistant so it has the tamper stick around here at the top and in the bottom no the packaging would kind of messed up because I already opened it but I have like I said I haven't hit e it comes in this little plastic tube look at the oil oops full-frontal facial and exposed so that's the oil looks [ __ ] nice you can see I'm holding you straight up that is not moving that I focus this [ __ ] yes a [ __ ] but that all is not moving at all it's like clearly just solid now comes with the C cell cart we're gonna take this off it's legit now you're gonna need a real C so if you're gonna burn distillate like real distillate because all the other cards it just it's not able to burn good so what I've noticed so yeah I'm gonna taste this as a little the mouth cap and take it out real quick taste it does taste earthy it's funny because it tastes exactly how it states like the flavor it is right there for the flavor it says earthy woody and pungent let me actually taste this now take a draw oh wow it actually tastes more like the string itself when you're burning it then when you're just hitting it and I'm dragging it with that it's smooth tastes like I'm hitting an UGG I barely hit that - you see watch the light go off and so far so good now I know that they have a good planning debate from Michigan like other states I haven't tried those only try California and personally I like it it's not bad but take this sticker off it's not bad at all so I'm gonna be doing more reviews on just random dates and [ __ ] you know this is just a one shot one take [ __ ] upload I don't go try to make it perfect it's also like how it is so thanks for the news guys and all my subscribers I appreciate you guys you've watched my other videos thank you", "I7NPjm1VlrA": "hi I'm Nick and today we're gonna be checking out the Jenny gold dossier oh babe cartridge dosey doe is

hello MD calm until next time", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

boy cam and we are back with another review first things first it's like for somnium so it's not gonna be - out of a video hopefully second thing second welcome back you know I'm saying so we're here with a timeless cart review I had a timeless car and a long time I think the only one I've ever had I actually did a review on I think was the only one I ever had a couple months ago so if you want to check that one out go for it pretty decent one I actually watched it to see how they were before this but somebody was watching commentator requested it and then something else wanted to see it too so I got them the same takes they got a deal going so I was like sure why not I think they come at like seventy two dollars for a full gram so pretty pricey but like I don't know 60 to 70 to 80 around there he's like the average price here in Phoenix so for a full gram that is yeah so I bought this with my med card all my shits on there and guard you know I got two of them the first one I got was I had a pic because they didn't have too many left I went that I went pretty late in the day but this first one is called pineapple Express and I didn't review this one because I already did a pineapple Express video trying to think of who was with what brand I can't remember but I don't really want to do the same screen so I was like yeah but it was a hybrid so I wasn't lying I didn't want to get some hybrid so we got a hybrid in there this one I'm not to lie to you guys not the baseband if I did a review on this one I mean it wasn't very potent to me but I don't know that could just be me the taste wasn't the best either but yeah real quick the first thing I ever one thing I did notice right now about these cards that hidden before is I don't know if you guys right off the bat what's different about these two cards are these boxes so it says a thousand milligrams this one doesn't that's weird but this one should be a full gram because it was a buy one get one anyway which on the same stuff so hopefully this is a fulcrum for whatever reason yeah it is right there on the bottom but that's weird not sure why it does that whatever whatever all right let's get right into this so this one right here never had this dream before that's probably I could have focused too well for you it's right there it's called white circle set indica um extremely hyped you guys are curious what the hell that thing is that is a birdcage I got really bored and I'm like what's something I can do so I bought a bird yeah let's start this stuff yeah so to open the box you just lift this up a little magnet piece you you gotta cut this like a sticker here if you know I'll see been cut by now probably not oh my got it hell yeah boys cool okay holy [ __ ] oh my goodness this is just a mess okay there we go so with the little ribcage we got it guys um so I remember this with the last one the one I just had obviously and then the one before you might get this late nice protected box for yours and it's man this card's not breaking and this thing that's for sure oh my goodness it is lodged in there all right so we gotta pull it out of the styrofoam thing here itself and it comes in this nice little and the way I started opening it comes in this nice little like Capitol Hill keep your see this one's all night weird this is just a weird card I don't know but um yeah cool little cap if you drop it you know very cool eh then you push down hmm that was weird because like was a centered right and still not centered now it's centered there you go so supposed to look like that nice and like crispy little box so it's really nice to keep your [ __ ] all nice and packed so let's go ahead and pops of that off beautiful beautiful nice like amber color to the the wax actually let's see I'm trying to like look at it through the light see yeah this looks really nice Ches um pretty dark oil but uh let's see compared to my last one I think this is a little bit darker than that one was but you know the darker the berry the sweeter the shit's or something like that I don't know it's something I got this charged you know a holdup yes the darker the berry the sweeter the juice the darker the penis the bigger it is I don't know something like that but got the booze pen just freshly charged you guys are now I love to get that freshly charged pan out here I do not have any hydration drinks or anything like that so this is gonna be a little fun she's I think she's waking up so if she makes any noise I really do apologize she's not too loud so hopefully she doesn't but whoo let's do in case we were chilling at 3.9 watts 9 watts not 9 volts so that's it guys so already off the bat this one this one tastes a lot better it's not like a great taste by any means like I think I've had better cards but is a very good one the closest thing I can relate it to honestly is the bomb sickle by vapin if you tried that I had that one a couple weeks ago and I did my other vape pen reviews I didn't do a read on it I should have I didn't want to put three or more out so I didn't but that that's exactly what this tastes like so if you've tried that and this one is just like that so if you like that than this one Ahri's really good off the first hit I do feel a little like like calm relaxed numbness to my body so that's pretty cool wrong box here see fit I can't find any like THC percentages or anything like that on the leafy website I think they say that most of the cards went about 85 percent so it's a little bit lower than like pay pens but it's still really good number it's really potent number most like live resins come at at like high 60s mid 70s so this is like a solid one for it distill it let's go ahead and die take it number two and see where we're feeling after that one so Cheers good yeah singham taste is the bomb Segel really good like honestly it's kind of getting me a pretty fast I'm definitely feeling it like it's getting in your arms and legs first it's kind of like this I don't know how to explain it it feels really good I'm like vitamin chilling pretty hard here I do like it the one thing I will say is I wish I had a [ __ ] drink man but yeah this is some nice [ __ ] guys see if I'll show you the WAGs here they're the pride not showing very well but super thick I'm slim thick you know I'm saying just how much you like your girl's thing you know oh no but yeah no bubble doesn't move the last one I had man it lasted me a couple days because I took it with some friends and stuff like that but I love full grams man they always feel like they last forever compared to a half gram and for obvious reasons but yeah I know I'm super excited chief on this one for a while well let me know what other brand you guys want to see in the comments if there's any other ones like you want to see moon rock like somebody asks if you want to see more life resin cards I can get some more life raisin you want to see more in house cards I don't mind other than that yeah I [ __ ] got a new piece for my rig so I can start to think dabs now it's got to get a butane torch and some wax which is pretty cheap because wax around here is like 20 bucks 25 bucks a gram usually if I wouldn't get ones all the time so yeah so we're gonna go do that and then we'll take a DAB or something like that at one point yeah hopefully pretty soon hopefully in the next three videos guys next three videos is gonna be tab I promise so with all that I say like the same things over and over ice very good let's do another juice No Oh some old water not water I think I swallowed smoke who well well as I'm dying guys I'm gonna end it there cuz I don't want to blast you guys so thank you guys for watching appreciate the support go ahead and like

the mention items are in the description below please leave a comment with your favorite vape battery for 510 thread cartridges", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me

hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "gla2-EXesp4": "[Music] I'm going to teach you guys some ways to make your cards last a lot longer than they probably do right you can thank me when you see the results so step number one do not leave it out in the Sun if it's hot outside you know and leave it in your car something it's gonna eat back three you know it's gonna get so hot that it just disappears like for example have mine in my car and I came back and it was like nine it was like I was like what number two do not cheat on what people do is they keep on hating it and then and it goes down because you're constantly getting it hot and hot so the best thing for you to do is like take like to relax third tip if you are like public or like thank your friends or something there's a lot of people there yeah like you have used to / secret this is what I do and nobody knows but number four would be like can I leave it on the side like that well I guess I would I'm gonna teach you guys a little trick if you guys are still watching if you guys leave it on its side people say don't do this because you get stuck on the top [Music] another okay the fifth tip basically be to not overheat it like don't hold the button for so long so many people are like oh hold the book and hold the button for so long I like a make it a competition with each other and be like oh I hate about you oh I hate next to you it's like and then they wonder why they're continent turns blight or like or starts tasting right or it doesn't taste like the actual thing that's why it's because you are like you are heating it up for so long and the small little amount of cotton that's in there only have so much juice in the other time so it's like once you burn the juice in there it's just burning the cotton now this is an act I'm just so in the liquid a lot okay but um yeah so if you just take none hit two in wait let it at least for five seconds your penis like just let it soak in a tiny bit and then editing it it's like for me like I'm being honest like a car will last me like like a fool one last game like holy using all the tips tonight that's Michael eat a half part one last for like three to four days oh yeah here's another thing ready if you leave a cart like laying down or like just leave it alone for a long period of time it's simile it's gonna leak because you have it like lying down and then it's kind of just gonna overcome that's what happening I don't know happen to you guys but if it has then use the part like that and they're not meant to last you through and that's like that's probably all the tips I have for you", "0V9NRRk0FQA": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're going to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges we went through these features and on our channel at vapor store direct on youtube we have in-depth

we're going to be diving into today we've got that right here i can't wait to get into this and all the other goodies that are involved with the reviews today on the other side of this intro so i will see you guys over there when we've got the intro in and out and uh we'll be tapping into some information on this 20 to one cbd ease vape from sundial y'all cheers and i'll see you over there back you guys so as i said in the intro we've got ourselves a 20 to one cbd dominant vaporizer from sundial this is the only pure cbd cartridge on the market that i am aware of there may be other ones but i only know of this one right now so before we go into the actual information for this cartridge we're gonna dive into the information that's on the box so this came in with a thc total of 3.5 a cbd total of 70 percent nice and rich and high with that cb d on this cartridge it has a package date of the 20th of july 2020 and it came in right around that 49.99 plus tax so at 50 plus tax you guys is uh what the price of this 510 cartridge is going to be i do have the sundial cannabis website pulled up we're going to dive into that a little bit and cover this 20 to 1 vape information that they have there before we actually get into the urban scale and start smoking on it so the cbd 20 to 1 vape is a part of sundials ease series which is going to be primarily the cbd dominant strains so the cbd 20 to 1 is a natural cannabis extract high extract rich in cbd with a good concentration of cbg and cbc and only minimal thc this non-intoxicating vape is ideal for any time fitting into your cbd routine sundial vape produces sundial vape produce okay let's try that again sundial vape products are grown and extracted at the care of using co2 processing and packaged in a c cell glass ceramic cartridge that flows smoothly with every draw so you can get it in a 0.5 gram 510 cartridge which is what we've got screwed into the fireside battery here we've got a 510 car starter kit which is going to be the cartridge a power supply and a usb power charger then you get the all-in-one or disposable vape pen you guys so i'm really curious and excited to see how this vaporizer is gonna do um the missus tried it out last night one big thing i've noticed from last night to today is it looks like it's crystallized in this cartridge here and i might have just gotten one that's a little bit wonky but uh we'll we're gonna see if it functions i took one quick haul at the lowest temperature on the fire side you guys to see how it was the misses definitely really enjoyed trying it out last night so it's my turn to dive into it and really see what it has to offer so we're gonna start out with the fireside battery you guys after that we go to the g pen battery we throw in a little bit of glass to find the final taste to see if the water percolation changes any of the flavors that we experience then we talk about the high and the overall finally to wrap up the video we've got all of that we've got to dive into you guys but first we've got the urban scale intro before we actually get into the fun part the smokable part of this review i will see you guys on the other side when uh we're diving in with the fireside battery on this cartridge cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said we're diving into the fireside 20 to one cbd vape we're starting out with fireside battery so these containers at sundial puts their cartridges in are quite unique if you guys haven't seen the way these ones work you actually have to push that lid down and rotate it to line up right there before you can pop it off there we go come here line up and there you go pops off it just sits very deeply in there and i'm this type of packaging personally i would say is a little bit extravagant and excessive for what you're going to need but it isn't the worst one i've seen you guys now going into the cartridge we're going to dive in with the fiber side battery first and see what we get through here we're going to take a haul on the lowest temp medium and then the highest before we do the exact same thing with firestep battery then we bring it back to or the g pen battery you guys and we bring it back to the fire side we do it all over again but through the rigs so we've got a 16 holes on this no a dozen we're gonna be taking a dozen rips on this pen and maybe one extra at the end but uh the only way we're gonna find out how this cartridge does and uh overall experience is by tapping in and smoking you guys so let's tap in and start smoking this cartridge cheers and i'll see you guys on the other side of uh the lowest tampa rip we'll chat about it a little bit then we'll go to the medium and the high change you guys okay guys so it had a really light earthy kind of flavor it's nothing overwhelming it's not really it's actually reminding me quite a bit of the shish kabari the fireside cartridge you guys where it doesn't really have any strong overwhelming flavors or leaning towards one way or another with the strong overwhelming flavors but just kind of hit you with a really nice and light cannabis flavor that i'm enjoying quite a bit you guys let's take the next rip see if it continues along this way [Music] still really smooth really mild for its overall hit when you do haul off of it it is just honestly a really nice and light experience when you're smoking this it's not harsh by any means and it doesn't hit you with that heavy vapor lung that i found some of the other cartridges do but again it's just kind of hitting you with that generic cannabis flavor which personally i don't mind but i could see a lot of people looking for more that flavored kind of experience too where you get more that with the heavier thc stranger guys but we're uh gonna go ahead and take a rip of this at the highest level and see what experience we have to look forward there cheers you guys [Music] okay guys so i've got the fireside battery marked at a 7 out of 10 for the score it really wasn't overwhelming with its flavor or exciting or anything along those lines it was just kind of enjoyable and light and just that mild cannabis flavor there's nothing really special about this it's enjoyable and the cbd is definitely where i think this is going to be the beneficial factor of its where it doesn't have that heavy duty thc hit with it it's just the cbd and i think that's gonna be the winning point the flavor itself although enjoyable isn't really memorable or exciting in any way so that's why seven out of ten is the best i can do now through the fire side we've got the bigger ports on here so we're able to usually get a little bit of a heavier haul which typically helps with the flavor so i'm hopeful that we get a little bit more flavor and experience through this cartridge you guys but we will not know until we actually dive in and try it out let's start doing that right now cheers and i'll uh see you guys on the other side of the low temp through the g-pad again stage really smooth really easy to draw through definitely one of the smoothest carts i've had to draw for functionability of the the cartridge itself and how smooth the concentrate in and of itself is now we're going to bump up to the second temperature on the g pen you guys and see what it does through there before we finish it off in the high cheers again it's just staying that really light mild cannabis flavor that hints and leans towards one another but it doesn't like it it hints towards a sweeter canvas flavor but then it sits that on that earthy side hints towards a more earthy flavor but then it sits on the sweeter side like it's very mid-range non-memorable enjoyable but nothing really exciting you guys and even on the highest it just doesn't have the oomph that i'm looking for in the flavor to really get me excited and looking forward to it you guys i think i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10 still for the g pen just because there wasn't any different experience between the g pen and the fireside battery honestly it was just overall kind of a midline experience you guys and i although i enjoyed it i didn't although i enjoyed the smoke i didn't experience i didn't enjoy the experience that's the better way to go it's smooth it's nice to smoke on but it's just not exciting but we're gonna see if the glass helps out with that at all we're gonna take our way through all three of the rips starting with the lowest temp working our way up to the highest you guys and the way we do that is we preheat the last temp and we just quickly flash through three ribs so i will see you after we are done our three rips through the glass on this and then we'll uh be chatting about it before we move on over to the g pen you guys let's uh let's get going on this cheers almost running on the highest temp let's run on the lowest actually to start off choose you guys still incredibly smooth you guys and um but nothing really that exciting there's a little hint of mint on that one you guys interesting interesting that this is the first time i'm starting to get it but let's uh tap into the highest temp when it's preheated cheers all in all you guys not that bad not overly enjoyable not overly exciting but not that bad i'm uh impressed with the flavors that i'm getting off the cartridge for overall experience but they lack of like a memorable flavor is disappointing so it's enjoyable to smoke while you're smoking it but afterwards i think you guys will forget it quite quickly and it definitely seems more as a complimentary cart so it uh it would be great to smoke this and then start smoking something else that you have that stronger flavor stronger thc effect that you're looking for but if you just want the cbd this is definitely an interesting card and worthwhile checking out you guys i'm uh i'm enjoying it so far now we're gonna take our rips through the g pen before we move on over into the score for the taste from the glass and the high before we wrap it up with the overall yike guys but uh oh excuse me i'm getting ahead of myself let's dive into this cartridge combo with the rig see how it does y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of these three rips we will be pre-heating the last one like we normally do there's the pine starting to play a little bit of a factor what in the [ __ ] now we've got cart issues you guys and this one that's exactly why we had the crystallization in there is what's going to cause the issue on this cart you guys this whole cart has just solidified with the crystallization overnight what in the hell i thought we'd be able to get through this whole review you guys but we're not not getting anything through there let's preheat the water the hottest and see if that helps anything or is it that the batteries just dead we'll see we'll see [Music] okay that's all it is folks battery's dead cartridge still works um honestly i'm not that worried about diving into the other two um temperatures on here you guys i didn't get anything different from the g pen the first time i don't think i'm going to get anything different through this other two temps um the taste from a glass i i am going to bump it up to the eight just because that pine flavor started to play a factor and i'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt i am going to give it the benefit of the doubt with that g pen to be experiencing a little bit more pine a little bit more flavor in that uh in that rig you guys but it wasn't overwhelming it wasn't really anything that memorable about it but that little bit of pine makes it enough to go i enjoyed it you guys and i like i look forward to smoking some more through the g pen more so than the fireside battery just because the extra large ports and the easier the mobility of the vapor through there but the amount of flavor that i did have just doesn't constitute anything higher than a weak eight out of ten for the fire side on the the glass and the g pen on the glass you guys that the little bit of pine flavor that i was getting through the glass is the only thing that really can justify that eight now going on with the high i am i'm not gonna give this a 10 but i will give it a nine it is extremely clear-headed extremely easy extremely relaxing just a nice clear-headed medicated type of smoke you guys if you're looking for something to just give you that little bit of emotional support and emotional pick-me-up very very worthwhile cartridge to look at for an all-day smoke um saying that you're not going to get the benefit of the thc in there so if you're looking for the pain relief or anything along those lines you're not going to have that benefit as big of a factor as it is through the cartridge however they've each got their use they've each got the purpose they've each got their intention now using the cbd in correlation with a heavier thc strain is something i personally really love to do i really do enjoy mixing my heavy cbd and my heavy thc i find the highs are a little bit more balanced it's a lot more encouraging uplifting that like very much more of the assisting versus the recreational dosing that i tend to experience with just pure thc strength um the pure cbd are gonna be that raw medical that that just assistance kind of smoking experience that i have and that's really the big difference between the two you guys is i find that the cbd is more medical more supportive the thc heavy thc is more recreational it does have its medical place for certain people myself i like a combination of cbd and thc to kind of alleviate all the uh all the stuff that i like and prefer to use cannabis for versus pharmaceuticals or anything else you guys but um for now we're quickly going to wrap up i'll be back when i add up the overall and uh let you guys know how this cartridge did 31 out of 40 it ended up doing for the cartridge which is surprisingly well it's not quite in that beautiful garbage i think it's only a point off but it it just lacked the intensity of the flavor that's really what brought it down if it had that pine experience and flavor throughout you guys i think it would have done well i really do i think it would have had eights throughout the flavor because that light pine flavor was enjoyable and hinting and just a nice and unexpected performance for a cartridge that i wasn't all in all expecting that much flavor really that well over performance from but it did well it definitely did a lot better than i was expecting you guys and i think it is worthwhile checking out if you like the cbd dominant content or the cbd dominant cannabis based product you guys um especially if you're looking at the vaporizers give it a shot i don't mind it myself but for the time being we're going to wrap the sucker up we're going to be diving into some oregon golden goat tomorrow you guys voted on it from canica you decided you want to see that strain so that's what we're going to be diving into tomorrow i'm really looking forward to seeing how that one does i haven't smoked that strain yet you guys so

my thing is kind of skulls i love skulls i got a big old collection of skulls here's just a couple of them but so you know i had to so you know i had to get myself the death bubba fate pen to try out sorry so instead of my ass talking all day let's open this up and take a nice look at it so it is a very nice classy looking vape pen it has a very nice design on it and if you take a look it says unicorn hunter certified so after this we might have to go up and get some unicorns you know what i mean just playing obviously of course nobody call peta or anything like that i'm just playing we're good so let's take a nice puff of this and see how good it tastes so i can give it a little bit of a reviewing so it has like a very nice sweet taste i'm sorry we had a little bit of a glitch there so it does have a very nice sweet taste and it does have a very nice like it's not like rough on the throat it's kind of like a nice like smooth hit and it does look like a pretty nice account nice gram inside so i paid like i think it was like 55 50 or 55 for this so it's not really a bad deal when you usually pay about 35 to about 40 or so for like live resin chatter stuff like that anyway so i'd say it's definitely worth it and i noticed that there's this little hole and if you push that you get like a harder hit quicker than without it it like stops the air from going in it to like i don't know kind of like like takes the air away so you get more smoke i guess so and i didn't mention that it has at the bottom a plug to charge it up if the battery dies on you and you can unscrew the top to unplug it so those are some really good quality features about it as well and it says that it's 93 to 98 percent thc so that's pretty good you can't get much higher than 93 to 98 unless you go to the one something percents just just joke no no so i know my humor is a little lame a little dry sometimes so i hope you all get it just trying to keep you on your toes you know what i mean so what we'll do is i'll give a rating of i'll give a rating of 4.5 for the taste and for design and packaging i'll give a rating of an overall five because i mean come on the packaging can't get much cooler very nice box to store it away when you're not using it so the kids don't get at it or something it's easy to put away without losing the pin itself so i guess i'll just give an overall rating of 4.5 to 5 out of 5 to the death bubba fate pin that is a very good choice and it does taste very good so if you ever get a chance to try it out i definitely recommend it it gives you a nice buzz too i'm already feeling pretty good so i definitely recommend it so if you ever get yourself a chance to try it out go get that and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good and i appreciate everybody that comes and spends time spends time over here at juvenile styles and i hope y'all doing good peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show you", "9NR7wfBPizU": "all right I also wanted to talk a little bit about the cartridges themselves and I'm actually pretty impressed the only thing I didn't really like the only complaint I have which also has a you know a contradiction to that has a counter-argument is the way that these suckers were designed down at the bottom you can see here and it kind of holds up the oil so there's you know it's like there's a couple little hits that you can't get at the end I was down at the end on my video where I actually sample it and kind of had to heat it up enough to just even get a little bit of something as you can see here yeah it's there solidly built it's glass obviously it's glass I had to break it just to get it apart on the mouthpiece screws off so technically if you want to you can refill these you know so I guess that is the counter-argument if you want to just keep using the cards and you do have a syringe concentrate that you can you know you can use that syringe and drip it in there and then yeah you'd be alright and then also the really cool thing is I didn't find any glue at all you see everything just like there's the little that's where the oil intake comes in and then a little rubber piece sits right in that thing it has a little coil and you can see the wire there's the wires come down on both sides and just kind of poke through the back of that little rubber housing and then it sits in there sits right in inside home well I kind of meant that part that's the part that screws in the 510 threading but it sits right in there on the backside and then the glass enclosure just comes right down on top of that and it's all sturdy metal glass solidly built little grommet there you see that that kind of protects the coil that's it", "ucZpFPZanTI": "yo guys what's going on Ethan here today I'm gonna be showing you how you can tell if your cart is faith so there's so many carts out there that are not good for you I've learned the hard way and I know which ones are fake and which are like black market carts so black market carts can still have good oil inside of it but they're not from the dispensary so I'm going to be showing you the difference so this is a fake cart now they do make these in real ones but this is a fake one so I'm gonna show right now obviously just by looking at it I'm gonna look at it right now just to make sure but yeah there's not even a THC percentage on this hopefully the camera can capture everything for me it looks just reverse but then once I start arguing it then it should look better right here is what it looks like I'm gonna get a little thumbnail picture right here for you trying to make it kind of clear you know I'm actually that's me pretty good so yeah real cards let me show you I'm gonna bring out two different real cards that I have so real cards will have a sticker on it it's not gonna have the THC and everything printed onto it let me try to focus so here you can see there's a sticker on side like her on the actual box so it's not printed on to the box it's like stuck on to the box so I take this off this ticket would be able to come off by took it off and they need to be I guess like baby proof so not just a baby or whoever can open it so as you can see let me open this one up this one's already open this the one that's on my car right now this one had to be cut open because it was like sealed not to cut this one open this is a Cali Eureka they make Colorado Eureka is that a little bit different but this is the Colorado one so that's my first court I have for you guys here this is the Eureka Colorado here's my fake moon rock car whatever it's not that the fake one was bad I just it wasn't real oil I know they do make real moon rock cards I just haven't gotten my hands on a real moon rock art when I do I'll be happy to try that one but until then that's have then here's another one that's not really popular anymore it was a few months ago and this one's a row of car so this one has like a button here this one has a button here and a button here to open it so you have to like push them both in and slide it and then the cartridge will beat inside if here I finish this one so there's four that one and you can see here server so it's only to see when it has information there and then you guys should see it like the date and all that and I think over here it says the batch number let me find it okay the batch number is here at the top well yeah that's there this was a really good car Rove cookies it actually had a little taste of cookies in there I like that one and that's kind of how I can sell it needs to be like I guess baby proof or kid proof so no I could just open up a cart like this one I need to do was this opening on the side car plopped out so obviously not a real cartridge now this was the cart that was inside of the Cali Eureka now there's not that much left but whatever I'm gonna go ahead and take a hit total is pretty thick it's whatever I have a smart cart with thick oil now some people say smart cards are fake some people say that they're real um I think it's a fake smart card that I have but it does have good oil so the oil is really thick so if I hold the oil like upside down it won't move like fast at all like it's not like like a Mario Kart or something like that so I'm just gonna go ahead take a couple hits of this cuz why not five clicks turn it on a lot of people like my body um most people just have the little stick batteries but this one is pretty cool this might be a cold thumbnail there we go so I guess that's a cool film yeah and I'll take it for you my fans on so I probably won't be able to do any any nice tricks or nothing like that yep the fan and my Maci wrong so it's not really gonna be working out for me I take a couple words I can do any tricks right now right now it's on three point 6 volts so one thing to know is that if your oil is thinner keep your voltage on like lower because you don't want to burn the oil so if you have really thick oil to use a higher voltage on most of my cars usually around the same thickness so I usually run usually use three point six which is the three out of the four on this battery let me know what you guys think of this camera because from what I'm saving on the display that looks pretty crispy so g7x mark - that's just how I do it I don't know how if this lighting is - like hard on my face but yeah I probably should have moved it back or something a little more I don't know maybe that's a little bit better but that's just a little video for you guys if you want tweet me videos actually just comments I'll try to think of something how you could show me your cards and I could probably tell you if they're real or not oh if you want just post the video on like Twitter and then just paste the link in the comments and let me know what you're smoking on right now so right now I'm on the dad's date I think it's called the Yuki and - babe Yuki with a Cali Eureka let me see the flip so team L Purple Haze 68 percent THC so it's nothing like nothing huge on the THC on this one but I do like this one because this one doesn't really put me to sleep since this huh it's the TV so I enjoy this one but yeah now we need to go edit this video and asking be Oh actually let me show you robots that destroy yeah does be Dukey so I mean pretty nice as colors on the back you guys can check that out now if idiot not affiliated with any of these I just wanted to show you guys and hope you guys up so that's me for the video thing guys and this is Ethan smokes signing out peace weirdo [ __ ] all button man where is it now do we do", "0CIgYyCFgco": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a quick taste test review featuring jazzasaurus butt tender from mother nature's remedy in woodland hills and the buddies brand cannabis distillate with cannabis derived terpenes vape cartridge so we'll be doing a review on this vape on the buddy's brand seesaw so today's strain is the three bears og this is an indica it's one that i personally am a fan i'm a fan of i've tried it in the live resin form i've tried it in the dab form but i have not tried it in the dissonance so i haven't tried this either um 91.98 total chem cannabinoids eighty-eight point fifty percent thc zero cbd and it has beta-mercing beta-carothylene [Music] we'll see okay i like these chirps i think i'm gonna like this one should be good three bears og pop it on open let's see what it's like buddy's distillate features the cso vape battery the seesaw hardware on the cartridge single source distillate and they do use cannabis derived terpenes which means that the terpenes comes from cannabis not some kind of all-natural or fruit or veggies or something like that three four second hit what are you tasting it was something sweet and earthy i don't know i really like it oh it does have that good like earthy og it's earthy sweet terps it's slightly sweet and it's smooth oh are you gonna get a turf sneeze no sneeze it's always good when the turkeys happen that's pretty cool that's a good idea potent flavor-wise you get a little bit of citrus on the end or kind of in the middle of hitting it on the inhale on the exhale you do get this sweet earthy oh genius i like it yeah i really enjoy this one 90 91.98 total cannabinoids this is considered hypodecy uh what are you thinking for a score out of 10 and why um 9.2 9.2 um i don't know i don't really get like a body height from this it's just i think it's a head high i think it's gonna become a creeper because og kush is always creepable creep on you a little bit if they don't hit you right away they're still going to get you higher still on their jeep um but i feel you it's really it's really earthy for me but i think someone who enjoys earthy will love this yeah there wasn't a lot of pine on it but there was definitely not like piney and sweets it's mercy so it's going to be more that sweet sour the caryophylline is going to be that slight earthy spiciness and then the osu moon is going to be again a little bit of citrus so i'm getting at least all those flavors which is nice manufactured on october 28th so it's still relatively fresh distillate the color is pretty beautiful i mean my score doesn't necessarily matter because i work with buddies but 9.2 from you 9.2 i feel is pretty solid i get it i'd give it somewhere around the same um this is the best strain i've ever had no but i feel like a lot of strains that taste the way that they're supposed to taste and they give you the high that people have said that they usually give you yeah whoever likes these turks is going to love this if you like oh geez this is going to be really solid for you it's probably going to be closer to a 10. i for one though marathon reviews my that's my favorite so i like the dream so i'm pretty basic i feel that i feel like well appreciate you guys for the love thank you jazzy for your review jpeg here coming at you guys live respect my region taste test review a whole new series dedicated to identifying whether or not this is worth trying doesn't taste good and giving you guys a score to kind of stay consistent with so appreciate you guys for the love we'll see you all in the next review love y'all peace", "JLvw59l_hZ8": "hi everybody unhealthy and I'm the director of operations at one release today I'm going to talk to you a bit about our baked article to have oil of course so our big cartridges are all glass and stainless steel they are 510 threads so they should connect to any 510 thread push-button battery now the push button is important because the way that our cartridge is designed they will not work on a pull-through battery so all of our cards come with a silicon cap here on the top I recommend twisting clockwise to remove this Jack now that is 2 times if you twist counterclockwise you can potentially loosen your mouthpiece if you do that you run the risk of leaking some of the oil out on the side if it gets warm and run to the top so just twist make sure these guys are clamped on nice and tight we connect these guys to any push-button battery again ah I just screwing them into the top here on the base plate now Arbus push button batteries take 5 click to turn off and 5 flicks to turn on then you know that the battery has a good connection with the cartridge if when you push the button you get a solid steady life on these batteries we change the voltage by clicking three times and for each different voltage you'll get a different light to indicate where you're at for our batteries we right usually recommend vaporizing around 3.3 volts to 4.0 volts depending on which matter you have and what all you have I personally prefer to vaporize about 3.3 volts no higher than 3.6 now our cartridges we do not usually recommend for refills however if you are going to refill our cartridge you unscrew the mouthpiece let that guys side and with your syringe you're going to want to fill around suppose into the area that you see between the the metal post and the glass tank do not fill directly into that post and it's because if you do you'll actually clog your mouthpiece and will be able to draw if your cartridge is leaking chances are that it's leaking from either the bottom gasket or the top gasket we've actually replicated 14,000 feet at 100 reads Fahrenheit without any leakage out of the bottom so we're pretty confident that one and if that is happening then chances are you've accidentally unscrewed your mouthpiece a little bit so all that you do screw that back down nice and snug and make sure that your cartridge remains upright as opposed to buying it on slide or upside down if the oil flows into the post and it plugs your mouthpiece all you need to do your unscrew your mouthpiece okay take something long and in like a paper clip and just run it down through the mouthpiece now you should be able to clear this guy right up if the oil is a little too thin you can actually refrigerate your mouthpiece for a few minutes taking that all up and it should push out nice and smooth but you can see now you're getting a lot of that oil out you're just going to drop that back down into your change if there is an air bubble that builds up around the hole all you need to do is you need to keep the oil in order to get it to settle again you can use your body heat just hold it in your hand for a while put it in a pocket that's close to your body or run it under warm water either I personally for your life all you do one the lighter over the black part of the tank and then hold it upright to allow the oil to settle again now this is perfectly safe because our cartridges again are made of glass and stainless steel and the gaskets inside our high temp resistant silicone so you're not going to be putting any bad chemicals into your oil", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which 510 thread stick battery works

is going on everybody this is weed them boys on the we dem boys Channel I'm here bringing a tutorial on how to unclog your vape pin this goes with like any cartridges you know of any sort for smoking like a some sort of liquid of or oil you know so basically this is showing you how to get this part in clogged because what happens is I'm just one on a little trip to the desert basically and uh it's really too hot to even take these things out there the temperature is like war about you know ranging from a hundred degrees like 110 and riding in the car they see worked okay and even then you can still feel the heat in the car so what happened was the liquid started just heating up too much and it just got filled here like it would get liquefied and I guess I got blocked so if you take a flashlight to your cartridge look in here you'll see it at the block right now mine isn't because well I I kind of just found out my way how to fix it this is um and this may not work with all cartridges as a disclaimer because this is a heavy hitters I'm not sure throw the same like that inside where it's a little bucket and then a narrow hole for where the vacant escape anyway let's just get to tutorial so what you need is a cartridge you gotta need a lighter not preferably a lighter because you don't want to use a tortured you're way too hot and are a liar would be safer so not everybody has torso lighter I recommend having these these are alcohol swabs relying on so I recommend getting a couple of these you can find those at Walmart Walgreens I can't guarantee you will find them out get the which called 99-cent store but if you don't have those you could use like a q-tip or maybe a q-tip what some alcohol higher grade would be better like ninety percent or something anyway first step you want to get your vape and get your vape you're gonna hold at one side I'll show it while recording is call me crazy I'll hold it one side and you get the other you light the lighter you basically have to hold it till this gets hot now you wanna be careful how you're holding it because the liquid will start dripping out so you want to make sure your hands will not be touching the liquid because when it falls out its gonna be like hot cuz it's melting scumbag lava high if it gets on you it's gonna burn so this is just example just to show you but be careful how you are aiming the lighter you don't have to buy it like this to use your hand like that just make sure you're getting the metal part and this will take like maybe about a cool minute you'll know it's gonna be hot enough when you start seeing the the chrome tip starts to look like blackened will start to singe the actual chrome tip doesn't actually burn our mounts because it's metal if it's plastic you know melt and that's not good so don't worry about melting we'll be fine you wanna do this for a minute and then after a while should be hot enough to where the liquid should just see I think I'm pretty good already because you could see the gunk previously that was in it there's all that and it was just uh not good and there is a little bit still there I guess you can see how it blackened around there please do not don't don't touch the chrome tape because that's just gonna be hot so just be careful guys cuz may be doing this you know when you uh that's a little bit mess and your system so just be careful with that and once you're done you're gonna want to get the alcohol wipes and I don't have another one right now I could just reuse this one real quick is still kind of moist last week check this out all right so all you gotta do is I just get that thing oh [ __ ] is still hot you just you might want to wait give it like five minutes let it cool off I not still hot but just for the sake of the video lightly touching it with just the cloth it wasn't super hot but it was still hot enough for her gotta be careful and like I said this one's not as dense but once you use the alcohol swab or this in this case I'm using an alcohol pad just make sure you wipe off any excess side from the lighter and make sure you also another thing is to outside the mouthpiece kind of clean inside just in case so you're not you know getting any of the fumes that you're using the lighter from you know and after that well check the inside make sure it's clear if it is go ahead and give it a test suck you know take a test hit basically and like I said be careful cuz this this is real metal so it's gonna conduct heat it's gonna stay warm basically and I will get another one but I'm recording on my iPhone so I can't like pause and restart the video kind of sucks but I'll give it a test suck real quick just to make sure just kind of want to cool it off because it is really still kind of warm I'm not trying to burn my lips it feels ok to get like a quick heat off of me okay making sure all this is off and it may take a little longer there's not really much of a long process just making sure that you get you empty out all that burnt hardened wax that was in the mouthpiece little hole I kind of just still trying to I'll just put in my fridge real quick you know all right I'm just over here in the freezer just not put it on there but just kind of keep it in here so my hands it's gonna be too hot to still get like a test test it over I may see only just cooling it with the ice now basically by now you will you would have been done already and giving your test to it but yeah basically at this point or just moment I'm you you're your vape should be cleared and you should be able to get a test hit half of it and I show you right now I'll do a quick test in oh one other thing to other thing if you have a second alcohol swab or tab I recommend using it on the bottom of here because sometimes there can be a leakage for some reason because the air I live I've had it where this part will get sticky and you also want to clean the inside or nothing of what you have inside and also make sure make sure you clean that content because of that contact I can't hit this part of the vape it's not going to get any it's not even like conduct any electricity to you know melt the vape and for you to take you know the vape it so make sure you clean the bottom of your cartridge as well as the inside of your vaping ping once you do that make sure there's no leakage or no blockage excuse me do this again I would say started off slow you know right now my pan I could go up to a 4.3 volts which isn't much but honestly it's the perfect amount when I'm using it for right now I'll play like a 3.3 now but I'm glad I got 3.5 so I get some juice going take the hit I'll try one more time but it was a pretty good hit it's cuz there's not much in the cartridge to begin with it's kind of like most of it got stuck up here but here we go yeah it still needs it very clean it's like I said make sure you clean inside real good because I feel like some of that suck get in there too you know yeah so make sure you give it a good clean other than that guys that's pretty much how you get your your vape unclogged this is the Alpine one you want to be careful cuz like I said this is heavy hitters you can see how these Alpine ones really it conducts electricity and then they not my bad electricity conducts heat and this rubber band that kind of like a seal for this could maybe break or get worked so you wanna be careful depending on what kind of vape in your head you queue and see here how it looks like there's a coil in there and it's more like a direct passage compared to how the heavy hitters is just like it starts off flourish and then it goes in thin and so I hope this video kind of help you guys out look a little tutorial just kind of found it out yeah so next time guys deuces", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the video welcome to the channel if you made it this far please subscribe and like and I'll catch y'all later stay warm lacet Cheers", "-DLv-IvXmsU": "okay what's up youtube so if you're here today you're probably wondering how to transfer thc oil from one cartridge to another so you probably have like one broken cartridge and you're trying to get it into a cartridge you know works so you don't waste your money so i know a lot of you found me in the first place because of this video right here so here's the thing youtube took it down because all they said was that i violated their policy they didn't even explain why i didn't save this video unfortunately but on the page that youtube shows me my deleted video it lets me play through it i'm cartridge i have dispensary the other day and i'm re-uploading it now and so the quality is a little shitty because i have my phone recording my laptop screen basically so the quality is a little shitty but you'll get the gist um and i basically just tried to cut out the reason why i think youtube deleted the video so hopefully there are no problems this time because this video helped a lot of people so i'm gonna try to re-upload it now and hopefully we don't run into any issues all right you guys so i bought this [ __ ] brand new graham cartridge at a dispensary the other day and it doesn't work like i connected it to a brand new battery that i just bought and it didn't work so i tried it on my friend's battery it didn't work and i was like cool so i've been looking up tutorials on how the [ __ ] to fix this and nothing that i'm trying is working and i guess you can transfer the oil over i didn't know that so um i didn't spend money for no reason so i'm little miss [ __ ] i'm trying to not waste 50 [ __ ] dollars is makeshifting so what we're gonna do is because i already had like two of these a few things to mention step one um untwisting the cartridge doesn't work with every single cartridge uh the ones that i had in the video were happy stick and for the most part i got a lot of questions on how you actually remove the cartridge cap you just twist it that's it like it might be a little sticky because the oil but that's it you just twist it um and then make sure that you're wearing gloves so that you're not like so you don't burn your ham with the hairdryer i honestly think that youtube took my video down for a safety violation because there was some things i mentioned in the video that i didn't clarify and i think it got flagged for safety reasons and when i said wear gloves i mean rubber gloves like the kind i'm wearing in the video not like latex plastic gloves i mean like actually protect your hands gloves the kind i was wearing in the video are actually dishwashing gloves but that protects your hands so basically i heat up the oil and this one with the [ __ ] hair dryer and then i pour it into the one that actually works i haven't tried smoking it yet so we don't know if it's gonna work or not so stay tuned okay so you take the one that doesn't work heat it up once it gets to a consistency that it'll start moving easily and you grab your cartridge that does work kind of let this stuff start to fall and i just take it and let it fall into there okay so once i get it to like that point take the hair dryer again because that [ __ ] metal thing is in the way i guess one bright side to having to redo this video is that i had some copyrighted music right here even though it was hella [ __ ] funny but it's fine um now at least i won't have a copyright strike you specify this but your hairdryer needs to be on heat not cool obviously i thought that was a given but you never know um so now you can see the oil is transferring into the empty cartridge so it'll take you a couple tries to do this because you need to keep reheating up the oil but i'll be back after i like transfer it all over um and we'll see if it works all right y'all let's put the cap back on unfortunately i couldn't transfer all of it over but see i still got a good amount there which i got like half a gram which is [ __ ] annoying because i had a full gram but since i tried this twice already i lost some of my weed but it's okay all right and then i didn't actually feel like going outside to smoke to show you guys the after result because i can't smoke in my apartment complex so i would have to like go all the way like outside outside like far away from the apartments so not doing all that but it does work i swear by it i promise um this method is 100 solid so yeah so yeah thanks for watching i'm really sorry the video got deleted and i know this quality is probably shitty but at least i was able to get it back up for you guys i really hope youtube doesn't delete it again because i think i fixed the safety violations that it got deleted for um but yeah thank you guys so much for watching like comment subscribe i love you guys so much peace out", "q7dowCeZCa8": "to follow down like what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another cartridge video and it's a it's a friend that I've tried like two three years ago when I like started getting into cartridges it is the Blum brand you know saying all that good stuff but it is their life resin yeah so like I said I'm not the first person to do this I've seen some videos online but I am gonna do my own rendition of a video you know I'm saying but as you can see it says live resin hundred percent cannabis no additives all that good good stuff and as you can see it is galactic check and I like to mention that this is the first time me blazing today so it is technically going to be a wake and bake so you know saying let's just continue on so we got Delta 9 THC I believe it's running at 71 point seven four percent and I believe there's also some THC a I think 13 percent yeah 13 percent just in case you guys can't see we're going in for a little bit any guys good [ __ ] alright and also this was tested by canna safe by us thicker so how you tell that most of the time when you get something legit they're gonna have a sticker separate from the packaging like it's another sticker that they put on that's the the testing sticker that they put on but as you can see tested by canna safe I actually could not go on I didn't go on there being I couldn't find the test results but I heard canna safe is a really really legitimate company testing company so we're just gonna take their word for it big oil also does the stuff for I believe Bear labs so that's pretty interesting but it says contains no additives PG VG or vitamin e acetate I mean it has a CBD and CBN but minuscule minuscule so let's open this get my trusty lighter bro you guys don't know what the light of bro is I'm excited whoo my breast this is only $40 I have the receipt guys so I have them see here see out the door so is 29 but then you add the tax so about 40 dollars total I would say positive s but I bought it last minute all that good stuff the bloom break it's a very raw garden esque look very light fairly light in here sorry about that guys so push this yes definitely this is library I'd be a lot darker no blue thumbnail here this is a raw garden part basically this new [ __ ] laughing jack I get freaky by the way this is the death bait retro if you guys haven't seen that video already very very dope battery cheese boys let's turn that up a bit so they recommend 3.5 voltage so let's just try that but very similar to raw cardoon Wow it's cheaper to buy like five books it's a very lemony taste as you would assume from galactic Jack right but very very raw garden esque I would say very very good I like it like if I took this hit and I looked at the cartridge I would have thought its raw garden to be honest that's crazy cheers boys damn it the taste is there it's like I'm just looking sucked on a lemon ooh not gonna lie I'm very impressed you know for something to be of quality of raw garden five dollars cheaper you really can't go wrong with it it's a different brand you know so I had to try it bloom form the other strains that they had were also sativa so I'm probably just gonna assume that they tasted very similar to each other but as far as this brand goes or this live resin cartridge both very very good it's a lot lighter than your typical live resins very reminiscent of raw garden so I mean if you like rock garden you're gonna love this but like if you're looking for that dark type of [ __ ] this isn't like if it doesn't matter to you you know the color of the the live resin or whatever and this is good you know 40 I believe I paid 40 exactly for this so it's definitely not bad you know there's buddies that cost 42 there's select that costs 45 raw garden that costs 45 this $5 cheaper in and the same quality of raw garden I believe so uh yeah pretty a pretty high in THC 280 three point six three you take one more hit for you and I will probably get an end the video I'm probably gonna blow it out there to see just to show you how much smoke we actually get so cheers boys all right there you have it yourself get out of your head out of your mind going flying don't forget what I said keeping a lot of shits are so good out of your head adding a mind-blowing I don't forget what I said I found all of you still having doubts now like how it the distance is so wait yo and the drone waiting for some booze back by my time [Music]", "M3LXZqjVxgA": "what's up everybody this is frank with dime industries today i want to talk to you about an issue that we all have in the industry and that's fake products i want to show you some of the things to look out for and how to stay healthy while enjoying your dining here i have a real dime product and a counterfeit time product i'm gonna go over some of the packaging features that you guys need to look out for so you can stay safe you can see that the colors completely off on our actual product we have a high gloss high resolution finish on the counterfeit product is a low resolution no gloss on here the authentic product has gigu stamped at the very bottom of the actual packaging which is our manufacturing partner counterfeit products do not you will also notice that counterfeit products will not come with a validation sticker every single authentic dime product has a validation sticker that has an individual validation code that you can only validate at dimeindustries.com now i'm going to compare authentic hardware with counterfeit hardware and what you need to look out for let's take these out of the packaging [Music] now let's take the hardware out of the packaging the first thing you're going to notice is that authentic dime products will always prompt you to validate your product once you open it you're going to see information that leads you to the validation program that we have on our website the first thing you're going to notice is that the mouthpiece on the counterfeit product is much longer than the mouthpiece on our authentic dime product second of all there's no california symbol etched on the actual tank another point that you'll see is that the atomizer is much smaller than our no waste atomizer you'll see that the holes the collection holes are actually fully exposed in the counterfeit product and in our authentic dime product they'll always be recessed into the actual atomizer just make sure that you're able to collect all your oil and you smoked every single last drop on the counterfeit hardware you'll notice that you can twist off the top [Music] authentic dime tanks have pressed on caps that you're unable to remove if you're able to remove them that means you probably broke your tank on the bottom of every single authentic dime tank we stamp our logo and our manufacturer's logo as you can clearly see the counterfeit hardware has no stamp at the bottom counterfeiters don't care about your health and safety all they care about is their bottom line in the unfortunate event that you do purchase a fake product the first thing you need to do is throw that product away you have no idea what it's filled with it could be full of pesticides and other harmful chemicals last step demand your money back and only smoke products that you validate on [Music]

video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "eC4XsUNW2_I": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to a TC spot Here I am bringing you a half gram cartridge Himalaya life resin sauce

facts very tasty very very tasty it has a very pleasant gelato flavor doesn't seems like candy I love that the fact that it doesn't taste all artificial instead you know [ __ ] that [Music] so yeah

for watching peace", "pyvT3_4-LmU": "what's going on everyone Nik bar here with a new video first off everyone leave a like comment and subscribe and check out my website I'll be hosting giveaways on now that good stuff okay today I'm going to discuss how to tell the difference between real and fake THC karts nowadays especially in states where it see we will have cannabis and concentrates still a huge problem a lot of times the carts are harmful to its use just because it's filled with metals chemicals and all sorts of pesticides in the past few years there has been a new wave of counterfeit vape carts being produced and sold many of them are just buying these fake cars cuz I don't know better I'm gonna go over how to tell the difference between a lot of these fake companies tactics they use and legally produce oil sold at dispensaries a lot of times you can tell just by the box design for example if you purchase a eureka cartridges and the packaging is in its old style that's a huge red flag currently this right here is the packaging eureka vapor is currently using if it's anything other than this it is not real when purchasing those fake cards they will usually come with the lab results printed on the packaging itself lab results will never be printed on the actual packaging it will come on a little label like in this picture right here with all the details and all the info you need to look it up online another huge red flag is the price the price should be a dead giveaway that is counterfeiting going to a dispenser you will be spending twice the amount of money that you will be spending if you were going on and buying a counterfeit one I've heard of people paying thirty five forty five dollars for a gram of premium oil of these counterfeit yeah I'm doing air quotation since I'm saying premium oil they're paying thirty five forty five dollars for these fake vapes when you you will be spending twice as much out of dispensary for for a full premium oil when you're looking at the density of the oils well let's just say there's a little bubble in it you flip it upside down um the little bubble should not move at all it shouldn't go to the other side it's gently without all anything it should stay at the same exact position that it was in you know I mean this this is a mature way to tell but you know if it is too thin that that's you know it's fake the last thing you're gonna want to look at to a check if your your dealers trying to rip you off let's just look at the name if you're you know the company that's san made this oil is made by supreme or like Mario Kart or Nintendo or something like that why why would a Nintendo make a weed product you know I mean you just gotta use common sense they will not you know supreme is not making any sort of cannabis product especially you know vague you know just use your common sense but other than that that's about it be careful a lot of fake vapes are going around just gotta use common sense and these few steps and you'll be able to check and tell and a lot of times to get real ones just go to a dispensary you'll get real real premium quality products alright so yeah comment like subscribe check out my website and uh yeah thanks guys peace", "TtYKXAp4NnI": "do I think you're trying to go too much in depth on it - I think you should literally just be like this is Delta THC what is this it's

this is one of the hybrids that I haven't had yet I haven't had any of the other react ones just yet and I think there's a couple I think there's one sativa and two indicas of just the regular you know coloured boxes without all the new prints for the react and all the special edition ones that they're running so this one is platinum babe's hybrid it's Mac which I'm pretty sure with miracle alien cookie effects relaxed euphoric creative flavors diesel earthy citrus so the Earth Eve as I said in a lot of other videos the earthy I think is gonna take over but I'm hoping it's moored easily and citrus with maybe like an earthy undertones at the end seventy five point two five percent total cannabinoids is the same there's zero percent in the CBD production date was nine twenty six nineteen psi labs tested ten twelve nineteen how do you open this up once again hopefully everybody's having a great relaxing Sunday watching the football and whatever else you guys did today yeah I just hung out with my son ate dinner that's pretty much it so I'm gonna take the Sunday driver out over there you see it's a pretty light moving slowly so we're gonna screw this on to the magnetic adapter with the I'm gonna say Mooney Pro that's how I'm gonna pronounce it so it's a yoke and woody Pro so there's the thing I did a video on this but I'll show you there's like aperture so as I said in the other video I'm pretty sure this one will fit the church carts I don't have one yet so I can't test it out on video once you put the adapter in and close your chapter okay let's do that properly so says it when he pro then it's got your volts up down but then I didn't show that says take care when you shut it off and was something I didn't show in the other video so I figured [ __ ] it once I realized what I said when I shut it off because I don't want the button and get pushed in my pocket but uh let's try it at this thing and see what we get I'm getting a little bit of the citrusy bit on the dry head so running this at three point two volts once again I'm not sure exactly what I should be running you that still doing some research hopefully I'll figure that all out soon definitely citrusy up front with yeah it's real heavy in the back of your throat that's the earthy diesel II not bad so miracle alien cookie hybrid not bad not bad not say out of all the ones I've tried not my favorite by far not the worst but I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've smoked this one you know as I've stated in other videos it's just the earthy part that gets me so when no sorry guys made my eyes water there um the earthy ones are the ones that I don't like as much like the fact that the said citrus I had high hopes for it but geez so definitely citrus flavoring upfront with very earthy aftertaste not bad tastes good making my nose damn breathing it out of your nose apparently will make you sneeze at least that's what happens to me quite often especially with this kind of stuff and then being cold make my nose run now which [ __ ] sucks but whatever but miracle alien cookie 75.5% hybrid platinum babes once again you know we got a winner I definitely want to get some more of those react boxes the one for animal cruelty the one for you know I already had the suicide prevention one I forget all of them they got a bunch of them so I definitely want to try them if any of you have tried any of those newer flavors that you're supposedly only supposed to be able to get hit certain disposed I'll comment below let me know how it is let me know what dispo you got it from so that maybe I can do my best to try to get my hands on that also but Unni pearl platinum babe miracle alien cookie one green card a lot of places today and probably tomorrow will be running five four one hundred six four hundred on some things I can't guarantee the Platinum babes being that probably spot yeah definitely worth it platinum babes another one in the books you went in stop like comment appreciate guys thank you for watching hopefully uh anyone that's tried this comment below let me know what you thought about it if you thought like it was a little too harsh at the end kind of like how I'm feeling but other than that the the citrus stuff tastes good I'm definitely feeling the high almost immediately I had already taken dabs earlier so it's kind of hard to gauge it at this very second but definitely uplifted yeah other than that piece to [ __ ] out guys you have a fantastic night hopefully everyone's ready for work tomorrow it's gonna start getting colder here real soon I think by the end of this next week is supposed to be in the 40s with lows and you know mid mid 30s low 30s at night so at that time of year guys stay warm peace out yeah", "qC9kjfAu2MU": "hey guys it's Nick with blue farms here just to show you a little tip to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "-d-7MVYz7Fk": "hey what's up I'm Nick today we're checking out levels float VAP cartridge level is a very innovative and trusted brand based in San Francisco and their products are always pesticide solvent and additive free this strain is sob right Hindukush its indica dominant which tends to create a more calming high for most people this strain is high in THC testing at eighty seven point three percent meaning it is psychoactive you can see five other cannabinoids and small percentage traces I suggest checking out our articles on how oMG calm about the entourage effect to understand the benefits there's five hundred milligrams of cannabis oil in each cartridge let's open the box lots of childproofing to keep it safe you need to pinch the sides in and slide the tray out to get the cartridge let's set this on to any 510 battery so we can try mmm this strain definitely has a lemon flavor with skunky undertones I can feel a body high while also feeling uplifting cerebral effects float is really the perfect way to describe this thanks for watching you can get this now at lmd calm until next time [Music]", "qPPSe6zEzEU": "let's go everybody Cuban chronic here another cannabis video / review here we got the bubbleman trinity pin by Marcus from bubbleman Richardson a big fan of his everything from his bubble bags to his dry sifting methods are definitely beyond any you can find anywhere else so you can always take bald man's word when it comes to concentrates in my opinion he came out with this fine bait pin unit see here oh this way it says bubbleman right on it nice silver always been my favorite tone was this nice metallic silver on the bait pin batteries he's got bubbleman B and bubbleman on his cart really slick little unit not gonna go through all that right now but this is mainly just to show how to fill a vape tank in this case of the bubbleman Trinity tank so in this case both man's got this really nice glass borosilicate glass or something like that outer and it's uh it's definitely it's able to take a lot of heat compared to most baked in so I go ahead and what I do take the cap off and you got this little opening here like most vape pens even the disposables look like this from brands like select other brands like that in recreational states I like to just heat the outside and you have these little glass syringes either come with select dabble bowls you get distillate and stuff from this from the dispensaries and outlets in little syringes like this also the blue river terpenes I believe come with a little syringe like this and you just mix your tips and your concentrates in the little glass syringe sometimes you gotta heat it I use my email and just kind of wipe the vial around on it just lightly heat it to get the oil to go where I need it to go and to use these that's all in my how to mix a sauce video you might want to check out but I'm gonna make this video as quick as I can here's the bubbleman Trinity tank I'm just gonna put my Enel coil around the edge and just heat this glass to a deist in temperature to where when the oil hits it's gonna run to the bottom I'm gonna show you guys how to load this without having the needle like they show in the bubble man Trinity videos this is for people that just don't have this is called a luer lock needle that would go here on the end and that's just for the dabbling hater and actually the terpenes come with the needle I have an eel but I'm gonna show you guys today how to load it with fountain one so you had this little tip here it's all glass these little dab of wool syringe containers for oil and I just heat this up on my email as well so I'm gonna heat both of them up and heat up the outside of the Trinity tank and I'm gonna heat up kind of the outside of my little syringe here full of turps and OG shatter his og chirps and Oregon Diesel OG shatter so so you can see when you have these syringes the oil starts coming out gonna suck them back so you don't lose any oil anyway I'm gonna show you the procedure around this little edge you see that hollow you just stick the dab locator end just right there against it and I just slowly press a nice bead around the edge of it and just keep it there against the seal and the edge of the container and since it's warm it's gonna just melt right into that space and I mean this is just for people that don't have the little luer lock needle that the Terps and things like that come with so you can see that oil is just dripping around there I'm just gonna heat it a little bit yeah I'll be really careful just little dabs of oil around the edge you really don't want to get ahead of yourself there we go hopefully show you guys a little view of this you can see the oils dripping down into the tank already it's looking pretty good so we're gonna go ahead add a little bit more around the edge here it's too crazy literally just wipe it off on there you know you learn to manipulate the oil a little bit doing this you'd see it's just draining down right into the right into it so let me see if I can get this a little bit closer for you see that oil is dripping down straight into the chamber see it slows down so you just kind of wipe it on the email again you can use a lighter on the outside and and just gently melt the oil down so anyway that's that's one way and some people be against it cuz you got to heat the oil a lot you can see it's just draining right down where it needs to go a little bit of oil left on the edge here and we just wipe into the pin here okay so well that's dreaming I'll show you guys one other method and that's with a luer lock needle and that's what these little dab locators have on the ends of them show you a sec this little needle off real quick so yeah you got these little luer lock tab locator your needles and so this this little lock that goes on the end of it so they just kind of slide on and off they twist on and off depending on where you get these from but that's what this locks into so these little needles come with my terpenes I ordered and usually get a little dab locator like this it really has to be heated to go through these needles and lock securely or all the oil kind of blow in between here but they work really well for Philly debate cartridges I'll show you now I'm gonna heat the oil good though and also heat the needle just a bit so that I know I'm gonna get a good run of oil through the end of it so I just heat the needle on the outside just a bit on my email lightly I don't want it too hot these are terpenes here and you can see it'll fit right in between that little space in the vial and as you've seen in probably other videos you can just just squeezes right in just see it there squeeze it all in there I fill the whole thing up use all the church sauce in there squeezed in there real nicely filled it up nice yes very nicely filled bubbleman Trinity pin and uh some little instructions in the Trinity says right here stand tank upright for 30 minutes to let after filling before use so anyway that's a little warning for you just kind of tells you what's gonna happen and if you're getting a boil around the edge like I said just heat it up a little bit make sure all your oil drains to the bottom I like to leave it open for a while with the cap off no matter what unit you're using if your units plastic definitely do not heat it it's not gonna work for you I recommend getting a glass one that's refillable admit to be refilled like bubbleman spins here I don't know if you buy those cheap ones I don't know if they're glass or not honestly people but bubble man's is definitely completely non-toxic materials all that stuff and I will say this is from a company that's called a w-9 tech or up tech and they are a great company any troubleshooting they're definitely there to help you they know a lot about their products so their customer service is on point and their shippings fast all that stuff man there's not a problem that I can understand why bubbleman chose that company and anyway there's the pin go ahead and just put the cap back on very nice I know I might as well just show you how to use the bubbleman pin click the button five times clicks on and now the greatest thing about the bubbleman pin is you can hold that button for up to 10 12 seconds but just take a rip and you hold it for 10 seconds don't even take her up and then hold it under 10 seconds and then start ripping and you'll get a huge rip but the the main process of using these from what they've told me is puff press and then pop so you let off the button afterward and clear the thing to suck more oil into the chamber to be burned for your next hit and it's a really good unit I've had it leak a little bit they sent me another cartridge and said hey man maybe it's a seal they just sent me another cartridge no questions asked they're great company so check them out a little demo for you so I'm going to puff press pump takes a minute to prime the oil but you want to let it just stand for 30 minutes so that it all that air bubbles and stuff come out but I like to heat the oil and it'll all just kind of exhaust the cap here and there and watch the bubbles come out of there and I mentally get all the air out and you can just hold that button literally watch it it's blue it'll turn off when it needs to do you get all that oil tar in it that's how you take a hotter DAP you see the size the hits you get me Trinity always cool it off afterward just by general inhale sorry about that coffin that's just how big it hits you get off this thing so anyway Cuban chronic this is the bubble man Trinity check it out at a w-9 tech or fresh head ease calm I gave it a 10 star review myself I mean I'm sure it'll be it'll be improved in the future who knows but it is definitely one of the best bait pens I've used as far as ripping first us stoners that's what we like nice good hits whatever hits we want light hits strong hits fill your own vapes there we go Cuban chronic dads ahoy everybody peace out", "pQIp6xChq0U": "I so basically how you want to start is with wires just like this just from a USB cord just like that and you just cut the charging part off and then you'll have this right here so you want to spread your wires out evenly and then I already nipped down the green and the white cuz you don't need those you just want to want to cut those off and just leave the black and the red you don't need to Greener the white just make sure that when you cut them off you just have two wires that aren't touching and you'll be completely safe because the other ones don't have anything to do with power so once you look like this you're perfect that's exactly what you want to do alright so then what you want to do from here is get these Clippers these little nail clippers and then you just want to kind of score the wire and pull it off this is if you don't have a wire stripping you could do this cuz this is what I did as you can see I suddenly cut it right there but after you just strip this little coating off you're gonna be done you're gonna be completely set it's that simple you're gonna be able to vape without a battery it's literally that simple right after you get the it stripped alright so this is exactly what you want to look like right now you wanna have your two wires your red and your black wire and that's exactly what you need for this to work just the silver tips right there it's already stripped and everything that's perfect so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your device your cartridges your vape cartridge you're gonna stake the black wire into the hole and then once you get that and you're gonna use the red wire and touch it to the side of the thing and then that'll start eating up but it won't burn don't worry it won't burn through fingers so you can see smoke inside of the thing there you go there you go so that's exactly how you do it you just need to be plugged into a source and you can just keep hitting it over and over and it's infinite all right let me know if you want to see another video like this guys I could teach you how to make your homemade bait battery an entire battery that you could take on the go portable let me know if you want me to tell you how to do that let's go for a hundred likes and I'll do that are you", "7mYNSEVHsAE": "everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we

understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "BybaHKw0-P0": "ah if you know joe you know i typically don't smoke dab

everybody welcome back to another video with your boy sebby g man ding literally before i turned on my camera i was sitting on my desk and i looked at the date and i was like yo literally the year is going to come to an end already bro and i feel like this year i i feel like i could speak for everybody but this year has been super super super crazy i feel like me personally i had a lot of ups i had a lot of downs but you guys know man this year 2020 was definitely a crazy turn for i feel like of the majority of us all right guys so without further ado guys we're hopping into today's topic which is i'm gonna be i'm going to be presenting to you what i believe to be the best cartridge battery out in 2020 okay so as a cartridge viewer you really do end up trying so many different products in terms of batteries and stuff like that and me personally in the year 2020 i feel like i've tried literally over 50 batteries and in my videos i don't choose to show every single one of those products i like to minimalize it and really show you guys the only ones that i feel are worth it so the one that i felt like was more worth it this year the one that really caught my attention the most that really saved me when it came to cartridges was this battery right here all right guys so this one right here is called the toki 510 thread cartridge battery and it's one of my favorite batteries man it has so many features from wireless charging all that good stuff but the main feature that i like the most is the fact that it saves your oil so much more than any other batteries guys just because of the fact that it has a five to six um second draw limit i believe and i don't know what they do in that drop but literally you still get those super fat milky clouds so you're really not missing out on anything right so i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit for you guys i got myself a little live resin cartridge sitting nice and pretty on here so without further ado cheers guys like i said you still get those super fat clouds that you need in order to get super super big this battery right here literally has saved me from having to buy so many cartridges guys like literally i did the math and let me show you guys for an example right so this one right here is the alpine live resin cartridge the last time that you guys saw this on a video was i believe two to three weeks ago maybe a little bit more and guys i've only been using it on this battery after that video so every single time that i take a hit it's off of this toki battery and i must say that after three to four weeks of having this cartridge look at the oil look at the oil literally one of the things that they pride themselves in is being able to conserve the consumer's oil and i think that's super amazing because they actually did it man they actually found a way to adjust the battery so it's not overheating your oil and it still gives you the perfect hit but with that being said man i think literally they probably saved me at least a couple hundred to a thousand dollars this year just off of their battery alone and the fact that i could literally just still be using these cartridges on the daily without having to waste them within a day or two using that on the blue setting now we're gonna go ahead and hit it on the purple setting me personally i feel like the purple setting on this battery is the best setting to get the perfect super nice milky clouds and it brings out the terpene profiles out the most because it's a higher voltage but for me i like the hotter hits that way i could get baked a little bit more easier alright so without a doubt cheers [Music] oh my gosh dude one of the best things this year has to be the fact that a lot of companies came out with live resin cartridges and i must say man live resin really is a game changer from going to disney to live resident is super super phenomenal man just because i feel like live resin has such a better taste than dislike does and aside from the battery itself guys they also provide you with literally just about everything that you can possibly need when having a cartridge session all right so first off i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys what the first products were when they launched the battery but they have the portable charger right here usually you could use this with your phone but i think the better way to use it is whenever your cartridge is dead on the go you can always keep this portable charger in your car and literally just use it and never have to worry about a dead battery again the next product is going to be something that literally no one no one has done and turkey was the first one in this game from what i've seen to be the first to introduce this right here this right here is a wireless portable charger all right guys so pretty much all you have to do with this is you just have to line it up with the toki symbol and then it's going to start charging for you which is phenomenal man because i don't know how many times i have i i personally hate having to plug in chargers sometimes i can't even find my charger so being able to just leave this as at your desk with the convenience of just boom plopping it on top and it instantly starts to charge that's super super super satisfying for me super minimalistic not having to carry around a charging cable with me everywhere i go and um yeah man i love this this probably has to be one of my favorite things that they've released all right guys and last up on the list guys we have the most newest addition to the toki family which is this bad boy right here this is the toki 510 wax cartridge and you're thinking like whoa they sell wax cartridges too yes they sell wax cartridges but it's not your normal wax cartridge this one right here is a super high grade material wax cartridge it doesn't have any distillate or wax already in it basically you attach it to your toki battery and then inside it has its own little coils right there i think i still have some wax in there from the last video i made on it has some coils right there on the bottom and literally you could just be taking dabs or you could be hitting your cartridge right guys so the fact that they came out with this attachment in the year 2020 was super super phenomenal man because i feel like the year 2020 was the year that a lot a lot a lot of tech for the cannabis community came out and i was super super happy to get my hands on this one right here because i feel like like i said this is the best battery of the year 2020. it saved so many cartridges for me they brought so much more diversity with these wax cartridges right here with the portable chargers definitely my favorite brand of the year 2020 all right guys so now that i told you my favorite battery of the year 2020 i want you guys to tell me what your favorite battery is right so i'm going to be replying to everybody down in the comments below guys if you enjoyed today's video do me one last favor smash the like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe button alright guys i'm going to take one more hit for you guys i hope you guys i'm not really too

like i said guys i hope you guys have an amazing new year and we'll catch you guys on the next video", "x8GRbfiZXnk": "it's so cool hey guys thanks for joining us on the\nfirst episode of the THC vape review my name is Bruce and I'm Veeks and this has been a long time coming We like thank our friends at\nElegant Aware for making this possible The reason why we made this show is we\nwanted a show where we could talk about the THC vaping industry and to dispel\nsome of the common myths and misconceptions that are out there we\nalso wanted people to know the differences between the different\ncompanies the different strains the different brands and the different\nflavors that are out there first off we would like to say this is an opinion\nshow we are not to know-it-all guys this is just our opinion so that being said\nif you try to sing strain or flavor ly comments below we would like to start a\nchannel where friends can come together learn and discuss different brands and\nflavors of the THC vein cartridges we also wanted to address some fakes now if\nyou either have them in the industry you have seen them somebody's bought them or\nyou got burned by one so what we're gonna do is we're gonna help try to spot\na fake and also to alleviate some of the different things in the industry where\nthey're talking about that why people are getting poison why there and why\npeople aren't feeling good and this is a major concern for people we see it all\nover the news so what we'd like to do is also go out on the street we're gonna\nfind these cartridges and we're gonna try them ourselves and we're gonna let\nyou guys know just why we feel about them and in addition to reviewing the\nvape arches we're also working on other videos that shows you how to make CV\noils THC oils edibles and more so hit the subscribe button below and the bell\nwill notify you on our next episode of the THC babe review comes out thanks\nguys this week on the bakery - pineapple\nExpress from the branch supreme the package as we can see is a red cardboard\nrectangle with small dots supreme is written in large white letters over the\nred background which is the supreme logo colors which they chose to be very\ndistinct and stands out very well like a red light it even has the Louis Vuitton\nlogo you can see one mil cartridge is in prison between hat classic clamshells\nthat is glued to the cardboard backing I like this approach because you can't\nopen it and mess with it and close it again points on safety and tampering\nhere let's take a look at the backside supreme is written on the backside which\nis a smart marketing technique all red with white letters it says supreme vape\noil highest potency oil from co2 extraction and our advanced distillation\nprocess there is a sticker with writing on it that shows the flavor and strength\nof the cartridge this strain is pineapple Express it says hybrid so it\nis a mix of indica and sativa solvent-free\non the back it shows that has an 89.4% d98 cd9 means delta 9 this is the part\nof the plant that gets you high there is a THC a which is not psychoactive 1.2%\nCBD under the sticker it also has instructions it is best used with a\npush-button battery set between 2 point 6 volts and 4.2 volts and it also says\nto preheat the battery if it's under 75 degrees cold fusion has a preheating\nfunction the instructions are very key am I had to move the voltage up on my\nbattery to the blue setting just to do what they were asking\nso we are gonna put it on to the 2.8 blue setting on our elegant aware cold\nfusion pen since there is a sticker we can constantly assume that these factors\nare just mass produced for all flavors and then the sticker is used to\ndifferentiate the strings thanks Bruce my question is is this the same supreme\nas the street wear clothing company supreme the fashion streetwear brand was\nstarted in 1994 by James J bhaiyya owned by the carlyle group and as a market cap\nabout 1 billion u.s. dollars I did reach out to the company and we're gonna let\nyou know how that turned out at the end of the show all right guys this was a\nweird one we took a look at the cartridge and it looks like an NX c2 but\nwith one problem they never made an NX e2 and plastics\ncheck out our YouTube videos to tell the difference between classic and glass also the center bar is a little thicker\nthan the original our closest guess is that it's a plastic knockoff of the NXT\nto oil color sealed from the factory I see\nno air bubble that's a good sign it isn't as clear as the golden real\nlight color has a slight tinge sir there's a myth out there that says that\nif the oil isn't clear and super light in color that it isn't strong or it\nisn't good and we're gonna talk more about that in episode 3 I would say that\nthe oil color is a light amber pineapple Express is a mix of train\nwreck and Hawaiians trey eric is an indica sativa hundred hawaiian is a\nsativa pineapple Express is the sativa dominant hybrid hey guys it's the fun part of the day\nwhere we're gonna do the actual testing and the actual vaping Bruce here is\ngonna show you guys exactly how we use it so that way weeks uniform to all of\nour different vaping experiences we're doing the same thing all right\nfirst off it for our criteria we're gonna use a cold fusion elegant wear pen\nreason why we do this is because it has the lowest voltage ships on the market\nnever burn it will never burn your cartridges and that has three settings\nand on this vape cartridge review we're gonna use the blue setting because on\nthe back of the box it shows to use it at least at a 2.2 or 2.6 percent voltage\n2.6 so that's one we're gonna use the blue because the greens just a little\nbit too low at on point two right so the cold fusion pen has our le gonna\nwear a cold fusion that has the locomotor one where it's not the core\nit's not the cold fusion alright so first we're gonna take the pepper\ncartridge out of the box yep and this is the minimalist packaging so we do know\nthat supreme has some other box packaging but today this is what we\nfound on the street so that's why we're going over the minimalist style\npackaging and that's what we're doing on now somebody out there says hey you know\nwhat they have better packaging they do but just we are doing this one today so\njust so that you guys realize so this is what it looks like when it comes out of\nthe package it has the rubber stopper on top on the bottle so we got to take that\nrubber stopper off which it's good to have it on if you don't have it\nconnected to your battery because it keeps all the dirt and stuff I'm into\nthe holes yeah nothing gets inside of that little area where the where the\nheating connection points get together if that thing gets clogged or if there's\noil in there it's always gonna give you a not a good connection which was not\ngonna have a good hit in Parkers for the criteria of us testing first and\nforemost there's nothing in our systems no we're gonna give this a full try and\nsee how it works I've gotta be sober yes you have to be sober I want to see if\nthis is actually does for me exactly what the box is supposed to say\nabsolutely second I take two full heads when the light blinks\nthat means you took oh cool it takes you're usually around eight seconds so\nonce I do that I'm gonna keep the smoke in and\nwhen the first inhale inhale again and then after the second one then exhale\nthat's how I'm gonna do it so here we go alright so pineapple express supreme\nvape cartridge company now pineapple Express is not an indica so it's not\ngoing to be heavy so I'm not expecting that going in so some indica strains\nthat are really heavy pineapple express even though they had a movie about it\nit's not necessarily as strong as they said in a sense of its gonna put you in\nthe couch you know pineapple Express that one is a heavy sativa and so it's\ngonna have that sativa feel it's more of an uplifting type type of buzz\nalright take your hit my turn alright what does it taste like solo arms I\nwould wait just a second because you can tell right here that's a little once\nagain you can always burn a cartridge if you keep reheating it yeah okay this\ndefinitely had a really good flavor you can definitely taste the pineapple in it\nI can already feel a little had changed on my eyes which is which is a good\nstart it's a good sign okay definitely gonna depend brings up the flavor so\ngood on that yes I definitely taste some pineapple pineapple flavor it's on the\nsweeter side like I said there was a tropical feel I don't know exactly what\nthat feels like I think that this would be this yeah\nalright guys well we're gonna take a couple minutes let a couple more hits\nand we're gonna take couple more heads let this affect us and we'll try and\ncome back and give you the review alright so watch this a little short by\nelegant aware meditation moment you alright guys for this weekend review we\ngot the summary here and we're gonna go over it and then we're going to give it\na rating this week was pineapple express supreme vape cartridge what did you\nthink about the packaging number one on the packaging was good because it was\ncompletely sealed so I know there's no tampering with there that I like so if\nyou it was tampered with you could definitely tell so I would buy the\ncartridge in most amberwood one thing I did not like though was on the back\nahead of silver sticker that shows what brand name horrible flavor the strain is\nyeah it was kind of hard for me to read because I don't have very good eyes yeah\nand it was I noticed that it was the the ink had rubbed off of the packaging and\nyou could just kind of barely read it but I did like the fact that it was\nsealed that's important guys when whenever you have a sealer cartridge if\nsomebody tries to tamper with it you know you could you can see it by its\nopen so that's probably the one of the best even though it didn't have the best\nor biggest or brightest package I liked the fact that it was sealed on down okay\nnumber two cartridge specs what did we say I thought it was an NX c2 was what\nwe decided yeah that's where it looked like it looked closest to but it did\nhave a plastic body though and the annex C 2 has a glass body so it would have to\nbe either a generic annex C 2 we're gonna look further into it but that's\nabout as close as we can get right now right now annex C 2 okay number three\noil color it's a little bit on the darker side on the darker amber gonna\nstart a change to it um so for me close like we've already said we're not to\nknow at all guys definitely not I would probably be a little turned off from it\nbut I've actually heard that darker oil is good too from other people but if I\nknow because I don't know it all I would I would be a little hesitant in that\nfirst yeah actually we're gonna cover that um the color of the oil because\nthat's another myth and misconception among industries it's if it's darker\ncolor does that mean that it's it's burnt or it's less of a flavor and so in\nepisode number three that's coming up soon we're gonna go over why the oil\ncolor if it does matter or if it doesn't matter as far as the strength or flavor\nalso okay so oil color I would say is maybe a amber light amber I would say a\ndark Yeah right so middle amber right okay\nbut it was very clean though it was very clean consistent\nokay strange specs now it was a pineapple express how do you feel about\nthat what did it did it match what it said that it tastes like like like\npineapple to you or I think it was almost dead on or what it said because\nit's just like a stronger sativa because it's or the train wreck and the\npineapple powdery so it's not very strong and knocked me out\nso which is a very good day hi like a day going on and that's what I was gonna\nget into next is high it was it was like you know uplifting if you have something\nto do in a day time I think it's like a daytime bar over everything yeah so if\nyou got stuff to do and you just want to get a slight buzz on\nI think pineapple express might be up your way yeah okay and number seven the\nthickness of the oil how thick did you think it was its comparative to other\noils that you've seen out there I would say it's on the medium side it's not\nrunning where it's where it's like even definitely tell it's running in the\ncartridge but it's also it does move away so I've seen thicker I'm saying I\nhave seen thicker so I would say that's about the medium medium probably like\nmedium and medium on the thick side okay so that covers up so if I was to ask you\nBruce on a scale of one to ten what would you be your rating on it the whole\nthing from the package to the caller to everything anyone yep I would say will\nprobably be around a six it didn't knock me off my off my bike but it was\ndefinitely sealed so I can definitely know it wasn't tampered with so I would\nhave to give it a six yeah it was great it was sealed from the factory there was\nno air bubbles inside so we're pretty sure that that whoever filled it up was\nthe one who actually so it came directly to us after that um the one thing that I\ndid like about it is it actually did everything that it said it wasn't the\nhighest potency at when I when it comes to THC but as far as flavor\nit tasted like pineapple it was it wasn't a like a heavy stone or high like\nyou would get from us from an indica but like like I said it to me I'm gonna give\nit a 6.5 just because like I said there was\nnothing wrong with the cartridge it tasted good like I said it tasted like\npineapple it did everything it says so I'll give it a 6.5 okay all right thanks\nguys for joining us on the first episode of the THC vapor view join us next week\nwhen we jump into the dank tank and it's gonna be sour apple so stay tuned for\nthat guys do not forget to hit the subscribe button in the Bell so that you\nguys get notified when that episode comes out next week\nsee you guys have a great one on my three", "ttL9Q67w7Nk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my name is Stefan from the pottery I'm here today to tell you a little bit about ascend Ravana's top-line oil the one that I like right now is tangerine dream the reason I like this one so much right now it's testing 89% active cannabinoids and it's actually testing 84% for THC which is really nice this one specifically is a really good sativa unlike most sativas though it doesn't make you feel too jittery it's very relaxing so for instance I like using this one when I play music sometimes really good for that you can be social on it it's very nice so and if you guys are looking to try it and come on down to the pottery at anytime comment below with your favorite strange chip [Music]", "mZYhjVY_v4M": "celina how do W babes cartridges and batteries work well we have two different types of batteries so I'm gonna start with the direct inhale and what you do is you take our cartridge which actually have an indica hybrid or sativa marking on them so IH RS which is great because you don't want to confuse your sativas with your and indica is correct yeah you don't want to grab your sativa when you're trying to go to sleep so you know that was a big request that we got so we just added that and it really helps people be able to differentiate so you want to be sure you know remove this little silicone cap on the end and the direct inhale batteries they come to in a package and they have a handy little USB charger and they are there goes right into your computer correct any USB charger will do or your computer yeah any USB plug so the direct inhale you just take it and it's got a 5-10 universal thread on it so you just screw it right on and then you take a drag so and it just works right from inhaling it just works right from inhaling exactly so you don't have to do anything and so when you're done with it or the battery runs out you go over and since there's two you have this you have your backup charging you just take that one off then you put the other one on the charger and you're ready to go that's great and how long does it take to charge about 30 minutes okay that's not too long yeah and then we have the push button battery which some people tend to prefer because it's a little bit of a bigger stronger battery and you get a little bit of a bigger hit from it okay and so what you do is same thing you just screw it on and you'll want to hit the button five times some people they'll just take it and screw it on and forget to hit the button and they'll think it's not working yeah so you want to make sure you hit the button five times and it'll link three times to let you know it's on and then you take a drag and the other cool thing about our cartridge our cartridges is that we have a central pole that we designed in order to help heat up the oil because the cannabis oil is much thicker than you know regular oils that you know these cartridges were originally designed for so interesting and so it doesn't heat it more thoroughly as you guys eat it more thoroughly and quickly okay so you get a nice big hit you don't have to keep warming it up and so when you're done with the push-button version do you have to turn it off you do you have to push up five times again to turn it off because you don't want it rolling around in your pocket each time you hit the button it'll make the battery you know have a little bit less of a charge yeah and to is the is the charging time exactly the same for push-button model as the direct inhale they're both about thirty minutes yeah it's pretty quick that's great well all good information thanks so much you", "v7eQ8UTo-Ug": "howdy y'all Dan Scott lean here joining you from legal grass that she sits the heartland of America so for today's episode I'm going to be reviewing this Delta 8 cartridge yes Delta 8 not not the Delta 9 that you commonly associate with THC but there's another form of THC there's Delta 8 that comes before 9 and there's also Delta 10 but I haven't heard of any vendors creating Delta 10 carts at this moment in time right now so I'm just gonna be reviewing what I do have in my hands which is a Delta 9 THC cartridge from 3qi and I've plugged them before on this podcast but I've actually given this actual vape cart the the light of day I've given it a chance and Delta 8 I got it quacks very much like the same duck of cannabis they did it's it feels if you told me that this was a different form of THC I wouldn't I would have I would I would would think it's the same wing of the of the same bird and but yeah so I bought their purple punch Delta Delta eight cartridge that the particular cartridge has about 900 milligrams of Delta 850 milligrams of CBN and CBC and 50 milligrams of terpenes alright so I got this purple punch vape cart from from the folks of 3qi and so do this all right this is what this looks like 3qi this is the cart so you're gonna vape it right now in front of you guys if you look in the video version of this excuse me all right so I vaped it it's like any other vape card if you vape a little too much and you put a little too much we're taking a little too much vapor we are gonna get the coughs and that's what happened I mess with the rooster and got and got the beak but but now with that hefty sort of vape poll that I got you could you could taste the purple purple grape II sort of sweetness to it and it's very apparent in that and in this cart so does it does for taste and flavor it tastes like purple punch concentrates I've had in the past so it does hold up I feel high I don't feel the same debilitating high that a good edible would make me feel or even just like a job two bowls of a 2 2 full cannabis bowls smoking before bed that kid it packs a punch and does the the what I find with Delta Aid is that it feels I still feel the same body it effects of a that I would feel from a good indica I sort of I still feel the same sort of Medicaid medicated that I would with with regular teeth see um what I do notice is that the Delta eight by itself I just vape it by itself like it tends to fade very quickly or in my experience it like you feel the high but then it just it fades and I feel like it fades quicker than if you had had a regular THC count cart so I I do feel that the sticking power with the high in the duration of the highs is shorter with this Delta aid cart and with this Delta eight that I'm trying but I'm what I do notice when I combine it with my THC and CBD I do notice that my sleep is a lot better because I'm getting the anuradha fact and I do feel that Delta eight with Delta nine by itself I feel like it's a lethal combo for for my sleep like it's you take it and it's like oh man it's like I'm hitting the snooze alarm again like I feel that my suppli supplementation of Delta aid with that my Delta nine in my CBD I feel like that's done a world of good and for for treating my illnesses that works actually better than just typical Delta nine I've a fried CBN concentrated like I've like I've mentioned again didn't see the big ruckus in it but I put a gram on my flour I put no I put a little bit on my own flour I put a little bit when I would vape and I again I didn't really feel that much kick from cbn I didn't really feel that oh I'm so gosh darn tired I feel like I get more of a kick from a delta eight and then Delta nine and having that together I feel like I get way more doing that than just getting cbn pills or cbn concentrate which I've gone before and didn't really didn't really live up to the hype but this Delta 8 stuff like if you want a good sort of if you want to replicate that body high and you know you move to a new city or state and don't really have your connects like this is as close as you'll get to the actual THC without having it without having to take spice or anything like that you still all the hallmarks of a traditional high are still there it's just just a bit less intense and it just fades quicker like that's what I've noticed from taking this powerful punch and what I've evaluated over the course of a few days but what I do feel that we're gonna learn and what what people a lot smarter than me are gonna find out is that Delta eight and nine and when you combine it can work very very well when when when taken without Delta eight so Delta eight and nine complement each other very well I definitely feel the hallmarks of a traditional high without you know the without the sort of oh my god this is out of control Ness about it like you you feel high but it's a very sort of controlled high you know it's not it's not like a sound like a sativa edible or whatever that oh my god I'm high I'm high and I don't want to be high anymore pleases no I don't I don't know I don't feel that with Delta eight it's a very it's a very controlled sort of high doesn't feel too much different than a one I would say a one to one sort of strain might offer you a comparable experience my opinion where you feel both he feels M you feel sort you feel impaired but you still you still don't feel like it's out of control boy so I feel like that's what I feel like these are going to be like the new one to ones or maybe you'll have one part Delta a one part Delta nine I feel like that's gonna be the way of the future I do feel that you know for sleep having supplementing with Delta Aid and my THC I feel that the sleep I get is deeper when I sleep when I wake up I'm hidden snooze a little bit more often because the claudius lead that I'm used to getting under Delta aid definitely improves when I paired with Delta nine flower but yeah we've gone into what Delta eight is in previous episodes I would I would recommend you check out these cards they're the one milliliter card was honest aid after shipping was $65 or something like that so if you live in a state where the met both medical or adult use are still very new and still very expensive you may be able to come out ahead buying Delta eight cards as they continue as more continue to go in the market there's another vendor I just ordered four cards from that that's selling their cards for ten bucks apiece which is a lot cheaper than than what I got with three tree but um but again that's it's it's that's still in the mail now so when we get those cards were gonna review we're gonna review that vendor there are new vendor to so we're gonna be what among the first people reviewing it hopefully but yeah I'm if you want something that's gonna complement the medical reasons why you use canvas I guess let's say you use it for anxiety use it for whatever I mean we're all different you know CBD affects me different than it affects UTC affects me differently Delta eight will affect me differently or affect you differently but I do notice that it amplifies the qualities that I find so medicinal about about indicas and it complements that body hi that I need and I need to treat my illnesses and my symptoms in compliments that perfectly it doesn't make the hi out of control it's it's a good enhancer you know and and I find that I don't get like I mean I don't get as paranoid anymore with with with cannabis but I do find that with this Delta eight like it's it's it's kind of like CBD but not you know you know in a sense that it it's able to neutralize it but you are still gonna feel impaired compared to not taking Delta eight or Delta nine you like you're still gonna feel something it is it is gonna so pack a punch and you should understand how your body can handle it before handling heavy machinery but yeah I would highly recommend checking out Delta eight cards if you have the ability to do so again the entourage effect you know all these cannabinoids work better in concert as opposed to just in isolation so again if you have the cash you have the funds and have the ability to get Delta eight cards and you're looking for something that might enhance or amplify your body high from cannabis that you use to treat various different illnesses like if you're sewing in which the body high is needed or the effects that are granted from a body highs needed then Delta eight is gonna be your friend in my opinion I I will say that before letting you all go but yeah I would highly recommend you check out three tree & shaki to live in a state check to see if you live in a state where Delta eight can be shipped to you first make sure you do that before anything else and yeah um if you have the funds and you have the ability to do it and I would check it out so as always everyone I'm their humble and gracious hosts dance Scotland I can be found anywhere you find podcasts tune in google play store I heard radio

recreational which we are in Illinois you know understand you're getting a half grams your new phone and you're getting text it's like 25 point one percent tax yeah on top of that it's just like and

this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all shut the crazy-ass video don't even know how blood coughing oh [ __ ] we're reviewing this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes you great to give you guys a good taste it's kind of like piney honestly little piney walk yeah this should taste good taste like like the weed cosmic sativa

"xkB4784SOOM": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test live resin vape review featuring the pineapple muffin live resin vape cart from orchid essentials so this is their gold live resin product line cartridge by pure tech project vapors are the world's first cannabis cartridges emissions tested at afner standards the highest standards in the world puretech ceramic is higher quality than competitors and offers superior flavor and user experience the pineapple muffin so we're gonna check this out i'm pretty excited because i've never had this brand before i was just introduced to it recently so it's gonna be just quite an experience so let's dive in shall we interesting enough i've been having trouble getting into some of the boxes oh there we go okay here we go so easy slide up nice big cartridge here check that out that's the oil and then just gonna twist it on to the battery that i have there they do have a custom nice powerful battery over here and then five four three two one you guys know the rules one hit wow off to the races with that one man that is delicious you've got this beautiful gold live resin inside there i can tell that it's not disliked because of the consistency and there's like this film over um you know over the glass kind of like housing for for this device um let's see taste on that first hit absolutely phenomenal i won't sit here and say that it was extremely pineapple but it was sweet it was piney it was earthy spicy citrusy and i'm definitely energized after that first hitting so second hit there it is there it is you really get that pineapple on the second one okay so 84.6 thc point two percent cbd this is a half gram uh cannabis oil cart delicious manufactured uh what is that july 23rd 2020 score out of 10 for the taste i gotta give it a really high score i'm gonna give it a 9.5 i need to know the terpenes to know what's going on somewhere here change it up make it smaller bigger whatever you got to do i got to know the terps and that kind of lets me know what exactly it is that i'm tasting otherwise it's a perfect score 9.5 add the terps to the back i know what i'm tasting it can for sure uh kind of prove what i have going on in my mouth the high that i'm probably gonna experience bam taste test through and through for that really good um there was a slight metally taste but i believe that it's just because of this battery being as powerful as it as it is so that would be 0.25 for the terps and 0.25 for the battery if there could be something different maybe there should be but i don't know at this point really solid experience very impressed score out of 100 i've got a number in my head already 95 on the taste test the packaging a little tough um one second draw cartridge contains 75 servings cannabis oil distillate and terpenes so ingredients it says cannabis oil and then in parentheses it says distillate and then it says and terpenes so is this live resin or is this a distillate in terpenes i'm not sure let's check the other one it says the same thing we could have a labeling inconsistency here um because of that i gotta give it an eight out of ten because now i'm confused and this would definitely turn me off if i were buying it because now i don't know for sure what it is if they don't know what it is i don't know what it is but aside from that 95 on the flavor the effects the potency the product appeal all those things very high but there is a major packaging and presentation issue going on causing me to drop the overall score to an 80 out of 100 so definitely be sure to tune in uh for more taste test reviews big shout out to orca you guys have a really solid item here let's figure out the packaging and get the numbers up and help the consumers understand what's going on at a higher level so they can trust what's going on here i really appreciate everybody for all the love and support be sure to

another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't

button hit that Bell [Music]", "HQc9FXLOkiM": "what is up YouTube family boy baths is here I'm gonna be doing another cartridge of you today for you guys now today I had 10 ran into some new cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big cloud guys so if you guys ever see these Church cartridges get the battery as well cuz that [ __ ] oil stick as [ __ ] you know you guys need something good about it to burn them on the [ __ ] book I really appreciate you guys watching my videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys", "tjyPHmETqvE": "hey I'm Christian from her exceeding today W walking through how to use one of my vape pens to set it up it comes in a box just like this is just a charger come on seal Stephen just broke it there and pull it out and it should be already charged and you're going to twist the top this this is one of my big carts there's a little plastic thing at the bottom there's going to move that so I can connect to the battery way and tidy and they're going to click it so the light didn't light up you're going to get five times fast it's gonna blink a couple times and then you're gonna hold this button and it should flash green at the bottom [Music] and then you're good you can change the little dial at the bottom and I'll change the voltages of your hips so that we can get the perfect fit for you [Music]", "y3Bjg6nlYyY": "what's up everyone john here from respect my region and today we have another west coast wii tour review and we are going to be doing a vape review we have a tomahawk 510 cartridge from napalm it's a live resin diamonds they're one gram cartridge so let's read a little bit about we'll see what they got on the back here it says tomahawk live resin diamonds vape cartridge 69.01 percent thc 0.78 cbd and one point seven two percent total thc um weight one grant net weight and then just tells you the total weight with the cart um twist the cartridge onto the compatible 510 thread battery and draw from the mouthpiece to start vapor flow repeat until desired effect is achieved so um pretty vague on the information on the box but the box itself looks [ __ ] stunning i mean look at this napalm it has nice raised edges you just like grab this and this really does feel like a luxury cannabis experience you know you buy this and you feel like you spent your money well i guess is the the best way to put this so napalm is partners um with exhibit exhibit is behind napalm cannabis and he fancies himself a firearm if you've ever watched excuse me if you ever watch exhibit on his instagram he's always shooting all kinds of guns and so the brandy napalm cannabis the grenade pre-roll it all kind of makes sense you know all kind of based off like military hardware um so i'm gonna go ahead and slide this open and a nice slide box boom and right there we got a nice nice the cartridge is beautiful with the green um some of these are orange too so it just kind of matches with what the strain is you've got the green branded flame look we can really see the color of the oil this is a gram cartridge i have smoke been smoking on this i was on vacation in wenatchee so um yeah but you can as you can see the color of the oil is really translucent really good definitely looks like live resin let's see if we can see it move that's the other key with live resin is you want to be able to see it move like with your eyes and yep it's definitely um moving in there you can see the the liquid is starting to go to the top of the cartridge so i'm going to go ahead and pull off these little rubber stoppers scroll this onto my battery you never want to over twist so once it's on it's just boop stop most vape pens click five times and it's on let's see what's up super turpy terps hit your back your throat you definitely i have no idea um what the tomahawk is what if that's like a into mix meaning they just took two different types of starting material and blended it during the extraction process i'm not sure if tomahawk is is a strain of theirs one of their uh you know flagship strains but i definitely get like a really florally earthy taste it's nothing spectacular but it's really smooth and yeah let's go down this uh the rating score 10 point that's a 10 categories 100 point rating system let's see what's going down presentation presentation i got to go with 10 it looks wonderful from the sliding it out with just the the little raised edges of the flames and the whole the gold trim it looks different it stands out and that's and uh you know napalm cannabis it's easy to remember it sticks in your head so yeah i'll give the presentation a ten product appeal nine um i i think it would get a little bit higher if there was a little bit more information about the oil in it about the the strain that went into the oil it says live resin diamonds but uh you know a lot of people don't even know what live resin diamonds are honestly so i would like to know a little bit more about the strain and stuff to to maybe get that perfect that perfect product appeal score color yeah you know you go with a nine it looks really really good the oil is just uh fantastic it looks really good nine color i did color smell um you can't really smell you know i don't really get like a turpy smell through the car or anything like that but when you rip it you just get like a basic vape oil smell it doesn't smell crazy terpe so i go five taste seven i said didn't blow me away by any means the taste uh i didn't really get like a potent terpy taste potency uh i would give this this is gonna get a good potency for i'd give it a nine um i started smoking this last week i ran out of dabs and i switched to my pen and this more than got me where i needed to go um when i wasn't smoking on dabs you know five or six rips of that and i was blazed for sure so high potency score experience um i'm gonna give the experience a seven i definitely didn't hate it but i definitely didn't love it you know i wish i just got more flavor when i think right live resin i just think of crazy terpy flavors and i just kind of got like a basic vape distillate taste you know didn't really give me the live resin experience more information they definitely give me all the basics about you know manufacturing packaging things like that i wish i got a strain lineage more information maybe about what live resident diamonds are somewhere on the packaging you know they have two boxes you could put some stuff right here just because uh you know then the knowledge around extracts is still very um niche in a lot of ways and so i would like brands to take that step up to educate the consumers more on their packaging would you recommend i actually would recommend this though i would give this you know not a strong mega recommendation but i definitely you know my friend hit me up was like yo what do you think about napalm cannabis i'm like bro you should probably get one of those you know live resin diamonds cards because they are nice they look cool the the cartridge itself is is awesome like the design behind this is very cool it looks cool so yeah definitely a seven on the recommendation and overall yeah stick with the seven as well like i said the flavors didn't blow me away but the quality is obviously present so i think napalm cannabis is definitely on the right track to um you know just absolutely crushing the game and that's all i have for you today make sure to like the video subscribe to the channel uh check out respectmyregion.com on youtube because we have a bunch of content coming soon video content and make sure everyone has a good day and i'll see y'all later", "Ozu8zi7EOFA": "hi today I'm going to talk about some of the absolute extracts supercritical co2 extracted oils these natural plant medicines come in these beautiful little cartridges that you can vaporize one of the first ones I'm going to talk about is Blue Jay way this is a two-to-one CBD to THC extracted oil this is for someone that needs a little less psychoactive effect and a little bit more pain relief and inflammation relief next one I'm going to talk about very briefly is the blackberry cush this is a very traditional indica you would utilize this particular cartridge for insomnia for getting into a deeper sleep in the beginning of your evening if you're suffering from pain but you would utilize this mostly at night the next three I'm going to talk about are the blue dream which is a hybrid but it leans a little sativa the Girl Scout cookie which seems to be a favorite with a lot of people and it's somewhat in the middle of the road you would have to learn how this feels yourself and the next one is the OG Kush another hybrid that we carry now I'm going to talk about one of our extreme sativas a Sour Diesel it's a very popular sativa this oil you might utilize for creativity some type of an athletic outdoor activity and maybe intimacy with your partner again thank you", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "YAvEcWB26Bs": "hey what's going on guys today we're gonna be doing a review on the vape naked cartridge the mysterious cartridge I say it's mysterious because when I first saw someone promoting this I thought the packaging and the branding looks sketchy to be honest so I decided to try it myself see how see what it was all about and I still do agree that the packaging is sketchy honestly the packaging and the branding because I mean there's nothing on the back side and there's like no THC content percentage so you don't know how much percent of THC CBD or what's in it in general honestly also another thing that I notice about this cartridge is when I looked it up I couldn't find anything about the company or the cartridge itself so that's what's also makes it really anonymous and mysterious so I can look at it it's already disarmed and I already finished it I finished in like three days but get all depends on how how much you smoke I smoke on an occasion so it all depends on your tolerance but in general overall it was alright it was decent to be on this is not the best cartridge you could find a lot better ones out there and I mean um the oil consistency was good that's the only thing I like about it the oil quality the taste was alright they taste like blackberry like blackberry cush pretty much but it just had a weird burnt aftertaste to it so that's what I didn't like about it about this cartridge and made me lose distrust was a after when I first started hitting it after a couple of hits the mouthpiece came off easily and I didn't even realize it at first but my brother pointed out that I was on a slant and then next thing you know we just pulled it off like nothing and that's something weird that I'm not asking - it's a screw on so it's not even meant to do that but that's what made me uh that's why I personally wouldn't buy this again because who knows it could be one day it could be good next day it could be something else something that's laced with a with a cartridge in it but who knows who does give light smoke and light hits it depends what kind of batter you use right I personally use the ceramics at first which provided with the light hits which is nice and all but I personally prefer a thick smoke so then I switched up to this Eve Pico and I mean it's still ended up giving like smoke I tried I tried it with three watts with nine watts like three to five is best nine watts is still decent but it'll it will taste more like brenton I already does but the end general gave light smoke and light hits so it also does take a while for you to get at least for me it took a while for me to get it took me at least 10 hits to feel a good buzz but don't get me wrong it still does get you really high I'll be I'll be puffing on that and out of nowhere I'll just stand up and I'll hit me so I'll get to you but only after a while I'm fading it depending your tolerance level but yeah what I personally would not invest in this again I mean I also smoked this and everything but just because it's a it still could be sketchy who knows what the oil quality or what's in the oil itself really is and I mean I just preferred dabs honestly I'd rather buy a different type of cartridge so it can cost you anywhere between 40 to 50 bucks depending where you from but if you ever experience these vape cartridges tell me what your opinions are right into form below and I look forward to seeing your comments thank you", "Hisk_MGEuaY": "to fam strip boy vaska's here i gotta be doing a cartridge of you today you know well big thank you to many subscribers and those who have been really watching my videos like in and

cool I had a get one they're called sublime I'm pretty sure you guys I see them around I don't know if they're popular or not or if they're fakes or whatever but you know these are pretty cool they're uh these are new boxes like if you go on their website on the Instagram I should say learn new boxes that post it on a post about them that you know they have any boxes and whatnot so how did it get this cartridge cuz it's a Sour Diesel you know all the cartridges I've tried I've never had a Sour Diesel before so I was like I've definitely got to get it and this is a hybrid sativa hybrid so I'm really really interested in it so on the back it says ingredients premium cannabis oil with terpenes in this so hopefully it's pretty good now the price on these guys they're really really cheap they're like 25 bucks a gram so I was like I'm definitely gonna get it and it's a pretty nice box you know you got your THC percentage you got all that good stuff on there you like a good cartridge to have you know and yeah guys like I said it says life-of-the-party on it cuz how it's a hybrid sativa you know sativas keep you going through the day I don't get you lazier none of that [ __ ] you know which I think indicas in hybrids up I do like them but that's more like when I'm chilling you know when I'm I got about I like to you know stay active and you know be aware of my surroundings you know I don't like to be falling asleep yawning and [ __ ] so yeah that's why I like my sativa so as you guys can see here that gots the best number and this is Oakland California wherever they're from and

up there so so yeah guys we're gonna get to it with this box that's a little that's a little button right here like a [ __ ] like any other cartridge [ __ ] so you just pulled it and it should come right out like that so the box is pretty neat as you guys can see has a little artwork on the side it says reel reel on it and so the cartridge itself guys is [ __ ] amazing as you guys can see the top it's like a round it's like a dang babe cartridge sorta way you know like the top is round it's not like a like a seashell cartridge I should say which is pretty cool because I liked those round tips you know they it makes the cartridge more appealing so we're gonna go ahead and take the cartridge out and yeah at least these things look pretty damn me the cartridge look fancy so we're gonna take this little rubber thing off and yeah this is like a ding babe you know it has like that round tip like I said I really like those kinds of cartridges that have it they just make it more appealing like I said and and this was a Sour Diesel so it's a sativa and we're gonna take it off we're gonna got to do the bow test flip it around my nose our little chalk excuse me good nervous and just like chew my nose I don't know it's just when I was kicking him so pretty thick oil and I've never had one of these before so I'm really really interested in them already got another dry hit it I'm gonna get a little sip of my iced coffee real quick then me uh I'm go ahead and dry hit this um see if I get some flavors off it I always do this should I try to hit it but the [ __ ] I've always forgot to get the rubber seal off so now we can try it now first of all you do get like a little citrusy taste to it but I'm gonna be honest it's not like a live resin tastes like a clean it's like a like a fake fake taste which I don't really care I mean it doesn't taste that bad it you do get like a little lemony taste to it so we're gonna gonna get my battery I have my yo cat with me today badi is one of the so it's pretty good battery I'm not gonna lie you know I'm not promoting nothing like that but it's just a really good battery itself you know it lasts is a [ __ ] a while so you guys like to vape along all day in [ __ ] you should get definitely get one of these your calves you know they're pretty they're pretty cool for the price of like three blokes so it comes with the little magnet you just screw it on the bottom like that and let me know what you guys smoking on a get smoking are karcher smoking some weed while watching my video really I'm curious about that and I like

right if it's from the decision we're gonna see Cheers Wow first of all guys you really really get a piney taste to it like if it would be like a jack rare well this thing really surprises me it tastes like sort of like a dizzy like honestly it tastes better than this dizzy for for being a sativa hybrid Sour Diesel I'll definitely I'm probably gonna go back and buy like two more of these [ __ ] that's how good it is I'm not over exaggerating on the flavor nothing but to be honest for twenty-five dollars a gram guys this is a bang for your buck right here these sub-sub line they had a dad like done' you have like ducting three flavors or four it only have like a sativa stiva hybrid indica indictor hybrid or just straight in dicta you know and those are only like four strains so it's not like they have a [ __ ] or sativas but they only have the specific sativa hybrid one and the how to get it's a Sour Diesel and you guys know I love my sativas you know and its really good the flavor too it's like it's not nothing fake it tastes pretty good like some natural terpenes in there I'm going to hit it again and see if I can get a good profile flavor profile for you guys wow this thing tastes really really limiting doesn't it taste like like some fake Terps you know like a fake cartridge with taste like but this thing is [ __ ] great this thing's bomb you can still like you can taste lemon in your mouth still once you blow the big old clouds out but for the high the THC was like 70 80 80 70 % let me see 84% and these cartridges were made in October so they're pretty fresh cartridges guys and the high for my first high of the day I'm loaded already this is my waking big you know how to [ __ ] you get the V there goes like a smoke man but I'm gonna hit it again for

you guys stay tuned peace", "cU3_ZwBvf7Q": "hey what's up guys welcome to dev connection and here i got the herb delta 8 thc cartridge now um all what delta 8 really is in a nutshell um is just it's simply a form of cannabinoid right and it still has a similar properties to thc and delta 9 and all that stuff and still delivers good effects you know it's not as strong as regular thc cartridge you get from your dispensary but you can still get really nice effects and it's uh we recently actually reviewed a delta three shy delta thc and those ones actually liked a lot they uh they have a seesaw cartridge hardware so they deliver really good hits and i was surprised with the high right but these are herb a and um taking a closer look i like the packaging a lot like this is pretty cool so it stands the whole time never falls down but i thought it was a c cell right and i realized once i like unscrewed it and everything it is not a c cell this is a it's ceramic coil so that's good but there's no improvements and there's no imprints on the anywhere around it and it's uh i don't know i could just tell the way until it wasn't a c still just by hitting it to be honest because the hardware is not that great it gives really light hits it's uh uh yeah like i said after hitting it i knew um you could tell right away because it just delivers really smooth really soft hits or really light soft hits but um as for the taste i mean the oil is really good it looks really good it's like doesn't move at all the taste is uh here we have two different strains we got chill indica and sweet sativa and uh sweet steve is actually lemon haze that's what i'm actually smoking right now it's uh the taste doesn't deliver that there the cartridge doesn't or this strain doesn't deliver that great flavor to be honest like it says it's lemon haze but i don't know i didn't hear i didn't really get that good of a taste it isn't really i don't know it just kind of takes a little harsh burn and just doesn't really deliver that great taste taste here i'll show you i'ma hit it right now and see show you guys all right yeah so i don't know if you saw that but this uh this cartridge delivers really soft hits and when i pull it when i pull to suck in like smoke it actually feels like i'm pulling kind of hard you know so i didn't like the hardware at all and the cartridge itself it doesn't taste good it tastes burnt to be honest it has a harsh flavor but it has a harsh taste but delta eight is a cannabinoid that is like known to be harsh itself the three-shot delta was pretty harsh but i still like the taste of it way better and they use they actually use sea salt hardware but and like i said the main thing with these cartridges is if they had you see some hardware that'd be so much better because um here's the challenger right it actually broke on me i uh pulled it out this didn't break here right i pulled it out and i already got most of the oil out and um i always hate taking out oil or replacing oil to another cartridge because you'll always lose some oil you'll always lose some oil regardless how good you are at it uh even if it's a little bit but still you know it's like who wants to lose oil you know but it didn't break from here i pulled that part out but right here is where it broke this piece came off i tried pushing it back in and just pushing it as hard as i can but it didn't work i didn't even push it that hard i just you know push it in to see if it would um fit back on and hit but no i didn't work it just i ended up replacing the oil to an actual sea salt cartridge you know and it did hit way better than this and the you know i can't really say anything about this flavor because uh it when i hit it in this thing well the heart was way better right and it still has leftover like flavors from the other cartridge that i had so it gave it tasted a lot more like that you know so but as in regards to the flavors to this strain it didn't deliver that great taste it was harsh it was uh it was just all right effects wise it still delivers good like pretty good effects right like you actually get a pretty nice again a nice uh nice eye right it's not nearly not the same as a regular thc cartridge but at the same time it's a the way i see it personally is like a high or it's like a strong cbd you know it's like strong cbd or a high quality cvd or they're like high quality bait pen that's the way i see it you know but it still delivers great effects uh similar to a regular high not nearly as strong as a cartridge but still nice you know great alternative if you don't have access to thc cartridges or you know if there's a lot of sketchy sketchy brands out there around your area this is a great alternative but this one these ones in particular i wasn't a huge fan of you know i much prefer the three shy delta a thc that one is still harsh right after if you take long hits but it's still i don't know i felt it to be more potent and it was a lot way more tasteful i uh i really hope this one tasted better but i'm not too sure like i said and the taste like just wasn't that good effects were not nearly as strong as the deltae thc but they were still there you know and like i said this is a great alternative if you uh prefer if you are if you're unsure of the cartridges that are around your area if they're pricey like here in illinois cartridges can go for half grams gold for like 60 and a full gram would go for like 80 to 120 you know and that's before taxes the these or maybe you're around an area where all you see sketchy carts are unsure cars that you're just unsure of you know in that case this is better delta a thc is federally legal and legal in most states they'll ship to you and it's just uh something pretty nice to check out if you're like maybe trying to switch up or like you know trying to want something uh reliable something something that trustworthy but more trustworthy than sketchy cards but yeah this is dave connection this is the herb delta athd cartridges and i hope you guys have a great day peace", "2oV5p_OrW8c": "this video is designed to show you the proper technique and filling the o2 vape oil cartridge first step remove the mouthpiece there is a blue rubber stopper at the top remove that in the package inside the cartridge you will receive a rubber filling tip I've already placed a rubber filling tip on the syringe that has the oil inside and what you're going to do place the rubber filling tip inside gently squeeze the oil inside another technique that you can use if you need to get all the oil out of the filling tip is if you take your fingers and pinch the end will relieve all the oil out of the filling tip for you once you've done that you're going to take your little rubber piece replace it the reason we replace that and so the oil will not leak out at the top put the mouthpiece back on and the oil is ready to vape", "_q2YChBKNZg": "so the video did get cut off like what I thought so I put my other car back on because I didn't want to hit this one yet so I'm gonna go ahead and pop it off and put on the TK old cart let's go oops and go I had to take off the little rubber piece I'm just gonna put it on my other cart just so it doesn't get like dirty and all that they're gonna I got that all put the new one on focus there we go it's not really focusing whatever I turned her off back then I'll turn back on there we go let's see first fat they're killing me I wasn't even sure if it was hitting it's hitting but it's hitting sitting very weird to be honest I don't know I don't know I don't know why to and wait though there's like zero smoke coming out of this I don't know if I got a busted cart what but this is not very good right now I mean some smokes coming out by there's nothing made this videos gonna be short because it's not I can't really hit this like I know the person like close that got me this I'm just gonna have him give me another one because I mean I don't know it's not really hitting that much and you said that like a couple of them weren't um working correctly so decided for one's busted just let him know and he'll give me um like another one so that's straight ahead that'll be in this picture right here nice boat on the TKO there we go that's a thumbnail picture right there so I mean I don't want to say we're done with this one this video I don't want to be finished with just that the form in the video 3-minute video I'm just gonna put on back on my cookies cart smooth that for a little bit just talk almost drop down so I'm just gonna put it back in the case now I know every box like it's like different there's so many different types of details um I guess I'll just depends I don't know so put the cookies cart back on and this oil on here is so I'm trying to get it's so thick because I've had this for like I don't know three weeks and I hit it every day and it does not die let so many people hit it like it's really super thick and lot of smoke comes out so it's pretty good I was pretty good most probably one of the best ghosts I've done to be honest freakin Lippert I like a little cutter something I'm newnode it from but I guess okay I don't even talk about nothing really yeah so uh let me know what you guys are smoking on let me know what type of battery guys use I always say it I just like to know because I'm more looking that cooler batteries come on that - beep um you keep I think that's the name here's the box I don't know what happened on my desk guys babe you keep pretty nice think two stories and then here's the back and then I have just well yeah it's a pretty nice battery small it's not like I've seen the key batteries I think double the size not the best that's mean in the video thing guys for watching subscribe leave a like comment do whatever if you guys haven't already I don't start giving some activity on this channel I've been gaining subs and I'm having fun so yeah and you guys watching she didn't sign me out peace", "IVfQgHNRTQ4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm just about to open my marley it's a balance cartridge because um i'm still waiting the way my prescriptions are working it's really weird um i'm still trying to get my penelope and i can't get that cartridge yet um because i'm still waiting for my um thing to be renewed because last time when i was able to order they didn't have any in at that time so it's just this huge big huffle so i've been using the balanced um or harmonized cartridge by soleil um it's also by afria i did an unboxing about that um a little while ago but um so yeah i managed to do this somehow i woke up i didn't i don't remember dropping it i didn't use it in the night i don't know how i managed to get it like that but that is what i managed to do to this poor little cartridge um so and um chum is now out of the balance cartridges of soleil so um i'm going to try this in the meantime it's we'll see how it goes i don't know i'm going to open it and find out i just opened up the marley cartridge balanced it's the marley balanced cbd um cartridge i don't know if you can kind of read that but it just says cbd on it no marley is um a product or under ownership of canika uh cannabis this is a canica based product but it's owned by it's a marley product i guess so this is what it looks like so we're going to try this balance cartridge out and hopefully it gives me similar relief um to the sole balance cartridge i'll give it a shot marley natural red 510 thread cartridge this is what it looks like in my 510 battery pack that's what it looks like and this has just kind of been a we'll see what happens because i'm struggling with getting things on my prescriptions right now so i've mostly only been using the vape cartridges um just because we're at home and are it's it's just easier for me to use them i find them really accessible i find them less messy i can i can use them when i need them and carry them with me i don't have to carry around a grinder and all sorts of other things they're just more accessible and easier for me so basically i use these out of convenience a lot of the time and um i also find that they're a little bit better on my throat i don't find them as harsh or as burning which is why i use cartridges more than i have been using dried lately now the whole struggle with this um is because of my spectrum prescription um i didn't i was not able to get the penelope on it which was what i was hoping to get because it's new and i really wanted it but because my prescription kind of ends like in the middle of the month when it renewed and then when i was actually able to get it they no longer had any in stock so i've been trying to find cbd based or like half and half's to use um in the meantime while i'm waiting to be able to get stuff off my prescription that are actually available when i have a room on my prescription to get them hence the issues with the cartridge and trying to um get something that works now i did find one that really worked it was the solei cartridge uh the balanced or harmonized i did do an unboxing of it but i didn't do an actual review of it yet um but they are awesome i really really like them um they are also an afria product now marley is a canika so this is a canika branded marley natural product um now i haven't had a lot of um canika's products before because mostly it's been the afria products that i've been using um with the good supply and the just my aphro cartridges on my prescriptions but most of the cartridges i find if they're not by tweed or um they're produced by aphria whereas this is a canika product now i was um reading and it says that it's it says it's all natural um and so our marley uh red cbd rich vape cartridge is filled with five grams of natural cannabis oil a custom blend formulated with both cbd distillate and winterized co2 thc oils i'm not sure what a co2 thc oil is but apparently it delivers approximately a one-to-one ratio cbd to thc now i've never heard that before and i've never seen that in the product descriptions before so i'm kind of interested to know how that works so if you know how winterized co2 thc um works i'd be really fascinated to know i'm gonna actually have to uh read up on that because i don't know i do like it though it's been working really great um so far so good it has um i think if i had to pick between the balance cartridge by soleil and this one i probably picked the balance just because i find it gives just a little bit more pain relief than this one does this one does give pain relief um i do help it find find that this one helps with nausea whereas the balance because it doesn't i don't find it helps with nausea or with my appetite this one i do find does increase my appetite and it does but not as much pain relief as i would like so it's an okay one would i get it again and as for a cbd yeah i'll get this one again because i think this is pretty close to a um similar effects that i get from my um aspen cartridges um as far as as feeling goes that's kind of similar on a prescription based as far as a wreck-based um similarity i can kind of go on um as far as the cbd um not as high of pain relief but it still is working it helps i am enjoying it and it's um doing what it needs to do so i would recommend it again although i think i like the balanced bisolate better but still a good product and i'm really interested to know what co2 um winterized thc is so uh i might do a video on that in the future who knows if i can find someone that can tell me something more about it that'd be really interesting and if you really like this video you find it these informational or informative and they help you or you just like watching me make a fool of myself or give recommendations as far as what i'm finding helpful now what i find helpful may not be helpful for someone else but it may be so that's why i'm sharing this information and so if you like it click subscribe follow along and i'll bring you more informational things i also want to just um say one more quick thing about this i didn't put it in and it's i know it's at the end of the video it's absolutely terrible with me but one thing i did find with this one that i'm not super happy about is it does give you fairly dry mouth i want to add that in just because i normally don't find it too big in a too big of an issue but whereas this one i find i'm like constantly drinking stuff just to keep moist just something [Music] [Applause] else", "c6VTq8bonFY": "hey what's up guys welcome to my channel or welcome back of your subscriber today we're gonna be reviewing a Eureka vape cart this train is London poundcake it's coming out of Los Angeles and it's testing at 87 point 16 percent THC I'm gonna open this up for you guys all right so I'm gonna slide this piece off and then I say cognate that keeps it closed alright so when you open up the box the cartridge is gonna be in a sealed pouch like this it says it says high potency oil so we'll find out alright today I got the Moxie battery in the raw garden battery I know my last fall garden video I forgot to use the Moxie battery so I'm gonna make sure to use them both you know what I'm gonna train you to blink around both you guys I was trying to hit that blinker on my raw garden battery the other day and they wouldn't believe and I was confused cuz I didn't know if something was wrong with the battery or if it was just the way I was hit but at the rock garden battery - because it is not-it's buttonless it's just they draw two hits oh here we go it's my first time trying London pound key but it does have kind of like a sweet taste to it I made it one more time for you guys before I jump - blinker it has a good flavor it's hitting nice and smooth enough this cartridge was gonna next match or not so I filled up a fat dive of Girl Scout cookies into puffs kheh hopefully you're smoking along let me know down in the comments below what you're smoking on and Cheers [Music] [Music] i'ma switch over to the Moxie cart now I like this Moxie cart for different reasons than I like the rock garden cart that's why I like to keep them both this Moxie cart has a pre heat setting and that's nice but I also like it because you could change the temperature on it and as nicely as a puck because you can choose what kind of hit you want you get that fat cloudy one or you could get that low really tasty hit so I'm gonna take I'm gonna take a couple rips off of this before I took the blink on the marquee I'm not gonna lie the package says high potency oil it is I'm pretty baked right now and I still got that dab blowed it up yeah me trying to tempt the beans I can't do it I just end up doing like a regular French inhale I'm gonna take a drink of water before I attempt at the next blinker make sure you always keep something on you that stay hydrated this car does have me bait disguise and I think blues the medium on the Moxie cart on the Moxie battery but I'm not too sure cuz I'm getting mixed up cuz I'm the puff Co blue is like the lowest alright here we go Cheers oh my god these Eureka cards smack but let me know if you think I should start streaming I got a webcam I had for my PC am I trying plug it into my ps4 and see if it would connect I'll be just like hitting my car taking that explain to Kay Martin warfare on the ps4 I think I am gonna end up taking that dab yeah I got a nice type of Girl Scout cookies in here yeah you know what let me get the camera I'll show you all right here we go imma hit on the green setting I mean you know what let's hit on the red which is the high setting but it's not the highest the higher setting is the white all right double click it there we go blinking is warming up just bud Cheers [Music] [Music] damn that punk and dab could go yeah like what I said I would I would recommend the Eureka cart I got the London poundcake I think that's in the cups I'm not mistaken but it does Mac and it's pretty potent cars I'm gonna do one more trick I think I did it towards the end and take that big of a movie I must open my window or something my room's ball I don't know it's weird but I will end up getting it all right if you enjoyed the video make sure you like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next one [Music]", "oovH1YDaw40": "welcome back welcome back welcome back to our [ __ ] hey [Music] hmm all right child welcome back to another video but the video is gonna be

__ ] is is going through fast i'm seeing it literally everywhere but it's called cake and it's a little disposable and right off back it looks like the cookies logo which so they they kind of stole that yeah they did and the cookies does a little print they stole they they completely stole the cookies look but how i feel is delta a and delta nine is like delta nine big brother delta a little brother or maybe a little sister ain't number one in that sense like cookies is d9 and cake his d.a like cookie's a cake nah that's how i took you yeah he didn't like it he didn't like i ain't got a lot it's it i don't really have a problem with it no more because it's kind of like damn burner you ain't got a [ __ ] delta eight out yet so yeah someone's gonna steal your [ __ ] you should have

like this is what a box like these was all like a cake line yeah and then the red box was like the other flavors and [ __ ] yeah but so far i kind of like the packaging though it's it's winning you over so we got [ __ ] this this trash now and i want to go ahead and say kate does not know we're doing a review on them no we just [ __ ] we gotta keep up with our subscribers [ __ ] is talking about it so we got to get it regardless if they [ __ ] with us i kind of like how it looks no lie it's got the clear windows on the side of it it's pretty cool i like that okay it's got a charging port so

it better other ones you see and i got three little mouth holes i like that that's cool like a harmonica at the top now the texas pound cake i've never tried texas pound cake anything but you know it's crazy hold on though they cake starts with a c but the disposables got a k on it see okay let me see the box that's a little weird maybe they got the disposables made by somebody else just didn't have their logo on it well when you look up cake we tried to find that actual like company and get in contact with them to see if they wanted to work with us it was hard to even find anything about them everybody that sell these are like third-party sellers they're not coming from a direct site so when we look down there that was a thing you can see on the metal of gas stations yeah a lot of gas stations that's mainly we're already off back okay disposables i have some other disposables you pull it out it's literally just a plastic container like a little plastic square and some wires connected to it that's it this [ __ ] is like a real cart if you look on the inside you see the same filter and [ __ ] as a cart yeah you do so this is like i don't know if y'all gonna be able to see that [ __ ] yeah you're not gonna be able to see that that's the window but the window it's got an actual [ __ ] little piece of the metal [ __ ] stem like on the carts yeah all right so see what this

here I've got the cartridge review big shout-out to my new subscribers I'm like a 175 or no that's crazy like about a month ago and had like 40 so that's awesome really what I really want to thank many subscribers the guys who always liked him liked my videos comments and [ __ ] already appreciate it and today we're gonna be doing a cartridge review like always I had picked up a heavy hitters there's a lot of fake heavy hitters and there's a lot of real like a dispensaries so you guys gotta be careful of you guys that I ever get a heavy hitter I have I got I grabbed this one at my local dispensary it was about 39 dollars these are these cartridges here are more expensive than the raw gardens raw garden is like $34 a gram at the club and these are 39 so that tells you these are really really good cartridges so yeah guys I have a Maui wowie nuts [ __ ] awesome I'll never had a heavy hitter cartridge so I'm like excited this is a Maui wowie as you guys can see the Maui wowie and here you have the littles whatever and here's all the good stuff it was recently manufactured last month and packaged last month so this cartridge is fresh fresh fresh as you guys can see it's a sativa those who know me I love sativas and get you through the day and it's a 1 gram THC is at 85% so you guys can see and you have 7.7 milligrams of CBD now like I said this is a tivo there you have it the batch number everything's on this side as you guys can see and yeah it says cold filtered so I don't know I don't really know what that means I think it was like when they packaged it was like cool I don't know guys if you guys let me know in the comment section below what is cold filter mean like I don't know but yeah it's a nice box no I grabbed it cuz it looks [ __ ] nice it looks like a premium vape cartridge you know like a damn diamond hiding in there [ __ ] but we're gonna go ahead and uh go ahead and pop it up and now let me know what you guys been up to my subscribers push to release she guys up to on a Sunday it's Sunday today no work you guys know what it is you got to get up and get the cartridges whatnot but [ __ ] how the [ __ ] do you open this Oh Dean there's a little tab right here I pull it I have a hard time guys open this thing up it says to push to release has a little thing right there so we can get him push that don't work mm-hmm I'm up to shred this box open guys so there you go you see God do it the hard way I don't want to open but it's a nice box I mean should be a good cartridge guys let me let me know that comes likes you'd love you guys ever had one of these before I Maui wowie you guys see share of the box oh and you guys you guys ever get a cartridge make sure you're attached this little sticky thing on there little sticker in my shoes on Thursday now here it is we're into a bubble test and sits in the box numb before I take it out now the oil on this guy's is really really really thick so you know that's a really really good sign right there it's a good cartridge it does not move at all that is awesome so we're gonna head and uh Aaron's like take it out the box ice on this little plastic ding like I said this cartridge was $39 a full gram a rock garden cartridge is like 35 so you know I was amazed when they when when I found out these were little prices in the raw garden so you know they must be really good there you have the cartridge let's do another bob tears it says cold filtered in the middle of the cartridge inside so yeah guys this thing does not move now this is really really awesome my friend had a he had a a heavy hitters before but the tip it wasn't curved like this so I think that's a little that's something new they're doing to their cartridges so you guys can tell whether they're fake or real so if you guys have one with just a regular round tip it must be fake is these cartridges were barely made last month guys last month so these are really really fresh and new so that's something new I've never seen before as you guys can see the tip curves like that so you guys be on the lookout for that I show you guys have a California star sticker right there now we're glad to take it out take the little rubber things off [ __ ] no this is a team guys so I'm going to try hit it I'm seeing I get some flavors off in I'll let you guys some of it what it tastes like Wow first of all you get it tastes like pineapples some fruity my while we I've never had it but it shines like pineapples but tastes like pineapples as well and I but I had a guy on my comments section you know telling me that stay away from my bug mark cartridges and it's true you know there's a lot of news that I've been coming on you know there's a like right here in California and I seen that like whatever they did like

yeah guys I'm gonna cut this video short you know thank you guys for watching stay tuned for more videos and yeah guys peace", "EMmYy7VGXZs": "hey guys his dab connection and we're going over transferring oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you

got back yesterday from Georgia a little update today's Monday I got school right now I'm on my way to school not real quick and the as you guys can see if I tell the video man we're gonna be reviewing these new 20/20 future vapes like their cartridges but they've they call them VAP so I'm not sure why they do that so first off this is the packaging right here it's very very similar to every other packaging you know it's nothing new they do not have the lab test results on this so that's that's a negative right off the bat so this one is fruit punch Hawaiian Hawaii red so once you open it up it says your favorite vape right there open this sucker up let it go something fell out alright so alright it gives you a little plastic card unbox vape car attached to 510 thread battery to cartridge inhale 2 times so adjustable airflow ring and streamline metal tip design 20 20 V so this is the packaging right here 2020 vape it's not bad it's pretty good it's new definitely and on the packaging itself it says made with pure distillate cannabis oil 1 gram net weight lab tested certified but they don't have the lab test results nor do they have a website why you can get the lab test results so I'm guessing it's not really verified lab tested so let's pop this sucker out yeah it was pretty thick because it has some little small air bubbles right here and they're definitely not moving up so upside-down still not moving anything and let me give you guys a little close-up of it so alright here's a cartridge itself 2020 I'm not sure hopefully that's focused up enough but those are the little air flows on the bottom you can move them to all the way open or halfway close or all like obviously you don't want it all the way closed because then there's no air flow so 20:20 right there hi effect here's the oil real quick flip upside down for you guys it's a very very it's I mean it's pretty gold I'm not gonna say it's clear because it's definitely not clear clear but yeah nice little gold color not moving at all so cool so let's see take this little plastic piece off throw that away and if this is actually a really heavy cartridge dude like honestly this is a pretty heavy cartridge like this is this has to be one of the most heaviest cartridges I've had today it's probably because of the tip and then the adjustable ring on the bottom so I don't have any batteries charged so I'm just gonna have to you stick with the O's because this is the most charged so we're gonna do full air flow and then we're gonna be hitting this off of a three point five volts alright so fruit punch guys 20 24 18 over 21 and over you guys know that the old man make sure you guys let me know in the comments below what you guys are smoking on and yeah man let's get this week started - cheers guys [Music] that was a big hit nine your life whoa so right off the bat damn does she hot that she got me whoo right off the bat you get like a artificial definitely an artificial fruit punch so when you when it comes to fruity flavors like this I mean I would I don't expect anything other than like artificial flavors like I'm not gonna lie I just got it cuz it was the best one I didn't want an OG cuz I don't know I just wanted something flavorful to be smoking on you know I was smoking a lot of them like in Georgia I was smoking the West Coast cured tits and that one was really oh gee so I didn't really enjoy that one that much because I'm not really an OG smoker I like more like free things cookies things like that so oh wow that was that was hit dude all right so right off the bat the airflow on this is amazing I'm pretty faded I'm pretty high I mean right off the bat my eyes are starting to get a little bit low this is a indica so yeah it definitely has me [ __ ] I'm feeling nice right now and then the flavor like I said artificial fruit punch it's not too heavy it's very very subtle but you definitely do get taste it and we're gonna move it to the halfway point halfway airflow let's see how it hits a little bit better wow that is that is amazing I like the air flow that this is something a lot of cartridge company should do because I feel like most cartridges have way too much air flow you get a lot of spit spit back because of the air flow so being able to adjust your own air flow is pretty cool I'm gonna do this um 3/4 close so yep that's actually a lot better you turn the air on ma'am starts waiting for all this coffee oh yeah yeah oh you said yeah like five times but it's because I don't even know what it how to describe this so artificial flavoring the Terps the Terps are they're there but barely like if they barely added any terpenes it's very very subtle you don't get too much you get more of the fruit punch hit more than like overpowering the Terps so it's not that great I mean I would like it more I like a more cleaner cleaner whole you know like obviously I can't compare this to libraries and other things like that because they're not in the same category but yeah this distillate definitely isn't one of the best what I put in my top up definitely not and would I recommend this I mean here's the thing these costs pretty much the same as any other [ __ ] desolate cartridge how like what West Coast care Alpine freaking and it's in the same price point so you why not get the better product instead of getting this like I understand you know it's a newer on the market you know people want to see what the hype is about but it's definitely my final thoughts on this would be that it's definitely not worth it like yeah the adjustable airflow is cool we had the metal tip is cool you know it's a it's definitely a whole new design to me I've never seen a cartridge like this I've never seen a cartridge with this tip adjustable airflow you know and then distillate isn't bad the distillate isn't bad it's definitely there but I don't know it's just not a top quality cartridge for sure like but I'm just gonna enjoy it you know already bought it so whatever we're gonna take another pull out of this and then we're just gonna continue with some little talk and before I head out so cheers guys man that is amazing you're not amazing but you know being able to enjoy high in the morning is one of the most amazing things so yeah I'm gonna write this product the good six out of ten on the quality I mean the oil is what matters the most and the quality that oil isn't just isn't there you know it has some it has its goods it has it's bad but if that I feel like the Bad's overpower the good - definitely so 2020 you got I mean you're new to the game you know you definitely have done more than a lot of other distillate companies have done so you guys you know keep your head up keep working harder make a better oil product you know it comes with time you know everything comes with time so yeah 2020 future vape I don't know man cop it if you're a beginner don't copy if you have a high tolerance because this is definitely not gonna get you super high and yeah man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video because I don't even know what else to say guys so if you guys enjoyed the video like I said go leave a like comment subscribe and we'll catch you in the next video guys", "yGTz2rXNEho": "Hey hello once again to weed stream this is mr. Matt CEO today we're doing a product review every once in a while now I'm gonna be throwing in a product review and simply because I'm really I used to know what to get that's good where to get it from and what type brands all that kind of stuff that I feel is necessarily good so like I said I've got a lot of years experience I have licensed from the government's to sell or weed all kinds of things I would use my opinion is quite highly useful as well as I'm just just don't like everybody else I like to get good products to my people once again check out all my toons here I'd be on YouTube please subscribe and like to my channel here's we're doing an awesome thing here you know Facebook is always there at weeds for your weit Facebook you all had its updates need stuff rough things that are be reposted that I speak on here with places to go and all that kind of stuff so first of all I'll just tell you this here is a rift product THC is quite high in this product indica disposable pen so once removed from the packaging you just basically you can tell exactly what it is so basically I've got ready for across the south push that's a high-end across which is awesome this Rifkin comes highly recommended I got this dispensary and I say they come from South as you can see here I can see the THC seven hundred and forty two point six three milligrams per gram now that means absent tea in subtlety 275 per second at velocity C so as you can see it's quite a high potency unfortunately as when he turned over while not quite unfortunately because of it anyways I like a little bit more in my pens this one here as you can see as a 0.25 a gram pen so it's not quite a half round pen Bob it was a heavy it said I've had it out for a day [Music] we definitely recommend this for someone who's off war on the smokes a lot of Bud side and just kind of dabbled with you extracts and concentrates and stuff like that because it's definitely gonna give you a hard headstone yeah it's smooth as can be and like I said the pen heel you can see the window there that tells you where you sit with how much oil is left of your pen this one here is disposable you can see on the bottom disposable cannabis extract and that's exactly what you asked from if you wanna get this type of product as you say I won't be disposable vaporizer and they'll give you a couple of different choices TC riffs are pre average prices I've been to was about thirty dollars [Music] it's a good pen so yeah I'm gonna take a call here [Music] so yeah it definitely is a very very good definitely let's you know it's it's got a really nice sweet cannabis flavor to it you've kind of got a little bit of a sourness to it you can taste that but it doesn't bother your lungs at all when you smoke the pen it doesn't really cut out on you at all it's smooth the end of it goes up bright purple let's see if I can show you here [Music] so as you could see quite a nice product definitely good for you know the odd you know take five or six hits throughout the day like I said it's a point two-five for a heavy smoker or someone who takes a lot of concentrate or smoke shot or stuff like that you're gonna want to get definitely maybe a higher you know maybe a point five pen or even a one ground pen if you can find those you're gonna have to go higher maybe into your capsules but anyway I would definitely recommend this it's decently priced it's very discreet it's small fits right in the palm of your hand you know it I think it looks pretty sweet the way the ona mean yeah definitely worth the money at the type of percentage that it's at always check their percentage on there and if you can't do the calculation all you simply do is move the decimal point one point to the left now and when you're doing CBD it's the same thing now as you can see total CVD there is seven point zero seven milligrams per gram but the conversion for that is zero point seven milligrams per gram and we're looking at a potency because we're doing percentage right so at zero point seven percent and you're looking at the total THC value which is seventy five point seven percent and that's how you will figure out what your percentage is on your milligram per gram just always slide it one to the left and you'll always be able to see where you sit in relation to your THC value compared to your CBD value now it won't always be the same but just remember that these days CBD is probably gonna be in everything but like I said zero point seven is absolutely sweet [ __ ] all and yeah these ones are made for your rip heads donors and I like it so I'm having trouble with my phone today it won't quite turn around but anyways this is mr. matt CEO I want you guys to [ __ ] enjoy this take a look at this review and like I said I'll be popping up with decent reviews every once in a while I've been so busy as you can tell them I throw it's killing me I've been just going going going the appearances work everything so I hope you guys appreciate it and let me know how you feeling about all this subscribe and like okay take care", "uZu9hDC022Q": "so whether you're a large manufacturer or you're just looking to get into the vapor pen game I highly advise that you do there is so much money in vapor pens it's unreal I'm in the vapor pen industry simply because I know that you can be - one of the most important parts of being in the vapor pen game is understanding what cartridge you should buy though what do you do when there's so many of them my name is Drew owner of mr. extractor calm my terpene profiles are in millions of pens all around the country I'm here today to tell you the truth about what cartridge you should use in today's episode how to pick your THC cartridge and the terpene Institute [Music] okay so look you've got your distillate and you've got your terpenes and it tastes really good and you're loving it and you're like what products should I pick look we can go on for hours about the differences in cartridges and to be honest with you later when I have a little bit more time I'm gonna bring in some vape cartridge manufacturers and they're gonna explain the exact differences but what I'm gonna do today is give you just a common-sense breakdown of some of the things you're gonna run into when picking out a cartridge for your line now without getting into all the intricacies of every different cart that is a whole nother thing I don't manufacture carts I don't want to manufacture carts I could it is a huge pain in the ass with a million competitors and no money I don't deal with it for a million different reasons but I can tell you a few things when we first started this company we were testing our terpenes with distillate and we're like dude this sucks we suck we don't know what we're doing we should probably give this up we tried a different cartridge after a couple months everything we had tasted better it tasted right I was like oh my god this whole time it's been the damn cartridge we never knew all cartridges are not created equal aside from their whole sizes and their glass and the tips and all that stuff some of them just don't taste good it can make your product taste like [ __ ] so what I always recommend when you first start out grab like five different cartridges just in general just start which one tastes best you're gonna have to look at a whole bunch of different parameters when you're operating taste is gonna be one of the most important followed by cloud size it's hard to debate on even which one is more important that if it leaks it's no good to anybody so instead of going over every single different aspect I'm gonna save that for a whole series of videos where I bring in a vapor pen a couple vapor pen manufacturers and we're gonna go over every different aspect of the cartridge and why you should or shouldn't pick one based on that the problem with that is everything's evolving all the time so let me just tell you kind of some of the pitfalls you're gonna run into keep it simple so first off your cartridge can taste different depending on the manufacturer it can make your good product taste like crap we got tricked at that one very early in the industry like I said we didn't realize it was the damn cartridge we thought we didn't know we were doing I'm sure you guys have run into that too always try a few different pens now you can find a pen that tastes great the battery it's coupled with can also make it taste like crap we do so much testing here I've honestly ran through thousands and thousands and thousands of cartridges that we've personally tried and I understand the differences between a lot of them but sometimes we ran into this well we thought our test was terrible begin later it was a stupid cartridge again even from the same manufacturer China is not the most honorable country in the world believe it or not they sell you a bunch of good stuff once they say bunch of crap the next time to offload some parts so make sure that you have a consistent quality supplier make sure that your cartridge tastes good if your cartridge does not taste good try it with a different battery it is essential that you understand that the combination between the cartridge and the battery is crucial you can have an excellent cartridge with a different type of battery it burns it too hot not hot enough tastes like [ __ ] vice versa so before you even go into business you need to pick the battery that you want to use make sure that you can get a lot of them a couple it with the cartridge you want to do use make sure that you can get a lot of those too and then start adjusting your product based on that now there's all sorts of different types there's the wicks there's a ceramic there's the C sells so many different parameters that you want to operate under exactly I don't do this but what I can tell you is that if you're running into problems our products taste good we've tasted we've tested them in a bunch of different products enough to know that we can't control the manufacturers of the battery in the car switch your battery try something different switch your cartridge try something different it's not traditionally and it's not our terpenes it's most likely your cartridge some of them burn hot some of them leak whatever make sure you get a cartridge that doesn't leak leave your pens out for a week set them out and a little bit of heat you don't want it running out into your packaging and ruin your product giving you a bad name so many things on the cartridge aspect so I'm leery to even get into it that's something that you know again for the millionth time I don't like getting into just because of the variety of things when you're buying a cheap product from China I've seen so many things from those people over there that it's just crazy you don't need to spend the most amount of money now I can tell you this for product testing I used some of the cheapest carts that I can find I use the weight carts just a simple black ones with the wick they taste great they don't blow the hugest cloud but it really pulls out the aroma it doesn't burn the oil they're inexpensive they taste great other people they want to use the really expensive ones that's cool depends on your product if you're growing really good clouds and all that what I can tell you is that the amount of terpenes that you use with the wick system is gonna differ from the amount you use with a/c so if you got something that burns really hot it's gonna flash off more terpenes at one time altering the taste versus something that does it a little bit slower make sure that you watch some of our other videos I'll probably pop a link up here as to what video should watch on how to blend your terpenes based on how they flash off and why you can't do things smell versus taste because turkeys do flash off at different amounts of different temperatures so if you got some major ass coil you're burning them all off real quick it's gonna hurt your throat versus something a little softer it is a combination of events just like these terpenes we've got 20 different things that work together in harmony mixed with your THC mixed at a certain temperature mixed with the oxygen and hit your mouth and create a pleasant flavor it's complex your pen is the same thing you've got your cartridge you've got how this kiss your distal it is how many terpenes you have what temperature you're vaping it out how the voltage of the battery is affecting it you are creating a symphony of items that everything's just as important the THC gets you high that stuff's the flavoring the battery supplies the power the cartridge does the burning you gotta orchestrate it right or you're gonna come out with the poor product the good news is all you got to do is just try some things process of elimination get your cart throw a few different batteries which one tastes better throw a few different carts on the same battery just narrow it down it's not that hard then stick with it talk to the manufacturer and say hey man can you get these all the time how long have you been in business do you switch the model all the time carts man or something else someday we'll come up with something even better than a car right so look the terpene Institute was founded just to give you a simple common-sense understanding of the terpene industry and how to make money from it I'm going to expand into cannabis and business lines but for right now just helping you understand how this works aside from all the crazy stupid [ __ ] that you find on social media I'm here only to tell you the truth because simply the more products you sell the more products I sell I'm gonna do my very best to make sure that you sell the most things that you can and make the most money you can alright as we gonna spend it here so go to mr. extractor com we've got all the different terpene profiles there watch some of the other videos you should watch them all college is expensive and you can't learn what I'm teaching you anywhere college that you go to you're gonna have some broke-ass professor teaching you something he doesn't know anything about you can take it from a person that started this industry that is a multi-millionaire and teach you how to do the same thing I ain't gonna charge you alright thank you for watching see if the terpene is to the next video take it easy [Music]", "6MO-ZGV-BUM": "i'm like yo there's some pink puffy [ __ ] i mean hello kitty posters and [Music] chocolates [Music] all right guys what is up simplistic here back with another video i am at ben's house once again and uh if you've been seeing this tronium battery around it's because it's been dope but they also gave me a box one too so i'm gonna see what this is and then i'm gonna probably give this little small one to ben and then i'm saying the small hand for the band no i'm just kidding um but yes this is the box battery it's like a box mod type [ __ ] and uh they're kind enough to send me one so let's see how this works oh yeah shout out to the mahomey van for always being dope you know saying but this is what it looks like uh the back draw activation so there's no button 380 milliamp per hour battery micro usb compatible with troy pods which is the the cartridges the empty cartridges that they provide one year warranty so there you go right off the bat very very nice um [Music] i was about to say that's it it's supposed to there's a quick start manual [Applause] micro usb adapter which they offer for the the small one and the long ones so this one you use for full grain this one for a half gram manual also a qr code if you want to scan it well let's just get into it we got that nine dollar half grand papa herbs look how much i have left because i went live again last night shout out to the people you know what i'm saying oh nice so it's auto hit so how do you turn this on and off it's weird oh it hits it's actually a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be oh wow definitely start the day with this there's no button just hit it there's no indication here that's pretty cool like you like it has these like uh where you can see the oil yeah yeah you just you just hit it it's actually really smooth compared to the other battery this one there's no voltage setting though so uh it kind of just maybe it's like a smart battery i don't [ __ ] know maybe i adjust to the the cartridge how smooth is it is it cool i like i like the way it feels too how it's like uh it's got like this little the form factor right and that's his thumb yes yeah also um like i said the drawback with these ones how'd you like it it's cool so these are basically the drawback of having a stick battery is that if you put in your pocket it could break you know what i'm saying if you sit down if you just like put in here you know sometimes you just put a pencil in your pocket and sit around with it you know some tight pants or some [ __ ] you know so it does happen um micro usb on the bottom uh i thought it would be usbc by now but you know i'm saying you can't really go wrong with micro usb it still charges pretty fast 380 milliamp per hour battery um other than that i'm taking more uh like a few more hits with this uh i'm enjoying it um maybe i should take a hit alongside with this one to see how smooth it is compared but is there any light that indicates like it's i think it's right here can you see no no light there's no manual there is many oh what the [ __ ] what it's right here see if you can see the light oh yeah okay so the light is right here so you can so like i said uh they did send me two batteries the stick battery and the pocket battery and honestly i'm i'm digging this one uh the light is i mean it's kind of visible in the in sunlight but overall really really good experience and i'm saying it's basically the height of this one still you know i'm saying so but check them out i'll post everything in the comments below you know i'm saying i'll pin a comment because i've been getting you know deleted because i've been posting links and strikes and stuff so i'd rather just post it in the comments you'll that's where you'll find it but definitely a good battery from um i'm saying other otherwise known as t-vape as well so thank you for watching the video see you guys the next one [Music] he [Music]", "yyMAnqH23C8": "another live stream and in today's live stream we are chilling in our bedroom we got cars playing on TV we just got done eating a [ __ ] ton of nachos I have not seen the cars three movie it's pretty good but we picked up some bud and some GC cartridges she's taking a bong hit with the cartridge damn that was a [ __ ] fat-ass hit y'all but I want to show you guys these know these nags are intense [Music] [Music] this [ __ ] ice most we've been smoking on that since yesterday honestly that is some girl ooh I should have dense as [ __ ] and it smells so [ __ ] good so without further ado guys we still want it to be too too right yeah move the cat we got the dog over here - she loves showing in the room basically all he did was we took a glove poked a hole in it clear rubber band around it just sounds like a tiger seal whoops I look at myself I see two screens blue I grabbed on like handless grabs onto my arm like this and wouldn't let go no we put them in this kennel make sure they can't reconceive oh that's so bright I can't see you just so well knowledge you say well but mine looks weird there we go that looks a lot better take your fat hair all right guys YouTube YouTube and honestly as long as the wax is on the bottom of it like it doesn't melt all the way to the top then you'll be good you won't burn anything else you can't just you smell I kind of like King Louie King Louie's probably my favorite the dispensary sinner is probably one of the harshest like not harshest but it hits you like Westar which one was the best one this one was it's the hardest you can see like a whole room at this angle no I refuse to see that top shelf right there the top shelf well on my phone it's right there but on her phone it's right there oh yeah it's all our pieces right yeah on your phone it's right over there the shops right there the dab tool right above the dab dab thingy that's funny and these things they look pretty cool this is what we're actually smoke another one and this clear Parton mouthpiece does milk has a battery fanny pack these little nice belt loops but honestly we keep like wait but there's some with some random stuff in there yeah random just this is our dab yeah this one is Jupiter [Applause] that's the charger for it so like it's cruising I heard it wonder about like your penis and I was like a trike this is good at each use of the battery is good for like like at least a few cartridges like not a few cartridges but a few things I don't know why someone said that I heard someone in the dispensary say that they had to charge it like two times every two days and I thought that was way too much VI yesterday when we first picked up these cartridges we started taking some hits Kyle you want to see our bud check this [ __ ] out boy we also got THC cartridge and check out this [ __ ] bud dude this is some gorilla glue this [ __ ] Kyle tunes in he's awesome he turns in every check the [ __ ] out bro [Music] it's like taking a dab the dab of wax you never had a dab dude do you smoke blunts yeah

he keeps meowing shit's dope as [ __ ] so basically what we did Kyle is we put a rubber glove over this and yes I made it super tight in the cut of [Applause] does it taste different it tastes very citrusy like I don't know if you tried a different flavor of Bud but I don't know I don't know what the butt is like in Ireland so I really don't it's very citrusy it's explain the taste moist citrusy earthy kind of taste like I wouldn't say musky I wouldn't say it's not musky not like most buds but it's kind of like wet like when you break it apart it's sticky no not the bud this oh yes yeah this dad pen it taste oh sorry the dab tastes sour it tastes like tart I'm like a thirsty I'm like yeah kind of like citrusy because it's like lemony sour like lime kind of and I know dabs overall like they get you kind of like a different high like it's higher they're probably [ __ ] you up yeah the first hit like you don't feel how strong it is until you blow it out blow it out cuz that's when you feel that no matter what you're always off over dab yeah especially if it's a fad unless you bust abs like every day but that's pretty much it like oh there's much I'm going to in mine we are still

peace", "S7fmOtHkDgY": "new vaping numbers now according to the CDC 805 confirmed and probable cases of lung damage have been reported in 46 states in the US and the Virgin Islands right now at least 12 people have died in eleven states and in Wisconsin there are now 60 confirmed cases in 26 counties health officials say a majority of the cases involve cigarettes or vaping devices to inhale THC the news comes as two brothers face charges in a large-scale counterfeit vaping operation Mary Jo Ola takes us inside the day-to-day illegal business and how customers were targeted Tyler and Jacob Huff Heinz appeared in Kenosha County court Thursday separated by an attorney investigators say it was Tyler who ran the show at a Bristol condo authorities found what appeared to be a manufacturing lab with tens of thousands of filled and unfilled THC vape cartridges Kenosha County detective Mitch Swanson testified that Tyler managed workers who filled cartridges with THC do you know how much he was paying them it started at $20 an hour and he realized it would be more cost effective according to Tyler if he started paying him 30 cents a cartridge he would save or he would make an additional two dollars and 20 cents a cartridge authorities say Jacob had a smaller role in the operation and a search warrant on a phone reveals the two had conversations about sales directing Jacob to go to places for sales and in prices of varying flavors of bait cartridges money running out of certain flavors Swanson said Tyler set up an account on snapchat and sold product using the name Wisco bad boy they even gave customers shirts and sweaters with the name on it Jacobs attorney downplayed his role in the operation there's nothing as it relates to him actually delivering anything participating in any way if they're trying to add charges I know you just have to find a felony I understand that but I think there needs to be some basis as to how or why they believe what they found in a room we belongs to him Mary Jo oppa today's TMJ for", "vM4mFkJN7kU": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're bringing you the latest addition to our honey stick 510 slim tank family which is our full ceramic honey stick tank now a lot of comments that I've gotten in the YouTube channel since we've started whenever we're launching cartridges and emails I've gotten from from you guys of viewers as well as my extraction clients and partners that we make cartridges for is they want something that is a hundred percent heavy metals safe state of California as they have cracked down on eliquids and a lot of other things because they are definitely ahead of the health curve and an innovator in the cannabis curve has outlined that certain cartridges once they've been prefilled have contained heavy metals and those may be harmful for you so they are still testing all of that and not all the research is in but a lot of companies and a lot of you guys out there like hey I want a cartridge that I make sure there's absolutely no heavy metals in it because I don't want to take the chance and rightfully so so we had cartridges made and brought in and they're now available on our website that passed the phase three heavy metals test of California before we even brought them in our manufacturers had already been working with with California we told them the designs we wanted and these came back and passed the test because they are 100% ceramic on the interior ceramic on the exterior they use a ceramic heater and do not use any heating components that will set off the heavy metals test and also they're the only ones that pass all those tests with flying colors and we can really sign off on and say it lives up to the honey stick performance now all of our other tanks we have sent over we are testing and we will get those published as the industry moves more towards that but we want to be ahead of the curve and make sure we offer something for you guys so this right here our full ceramic cartridge we have them available and are already private labeling these for a lot of our extraction partners and a half mil size so that's a half gram and also the 1 gram size which is the one milliliter capacity cartridge now these are gonna be full ceramic interior body if we can zoom in and get a nice close-up as you can see you have a full ceramic interior body center post bottom base medical grade silicone gaskets sealing the bottom pieces which the blocks are also made out of ceramic and it has a ceramic heater core power plant now you say oh you know that's all good and well it's safe but does it vape up the challenge and yes it does these things definitely do hit hard and they vape well and because of ceramic in tin internals they're gonna maintain a really nice flavor of purity for all you purists up there you're definitely gonna get more of those turf tastes out of here because it is not interacting with anything except for the pure coated thick grade ceramic now the heater actually people say okay what's the orifice hole size now this has a unique orifice hole and I'm not sure you can a hundred percent get this onto the camera from this angle but it is a dual two millimeter valack kind of a moon shaped heater absorption system so you're still get a lot of good absorption you're gonna get a nice vape cloud it's not gonna you know run into any bad situations when you're putting the thicker oils or CBD oils or distillates in there you know this cartridge is made to perform so you also have the medical grade silicone internals as I said to make sure this thing is sealed up and doesn't leak and you have the the full ceramic mouthpiece that is gonna feel nice on the lips and is also going to be sturdy as well as easy to clean now these are not one use tanks however they are disposable so you could get a handful refills out of them as long as your key easier gentle with them because they are ceramic you do have to be a little bit more gentle with them even though the glass is a high quality of Pyrex grade glass you do have to be gentle with them because the ceramic internals are not metal and they if you bend them or put a lot of pressure on them ceramic does have the tendency when you put unneeded pressure on them to break so be a little bit more delicate with these tanks however know that you are getting a good bang for your buck now how do you fill these up and what are some of the tips that that I can give you guys when you're when you're filling these tanks and using these tanks because they are relatively new and innovative so when you have these tanks there we're gonna send them to you partially opened right there to make it easy you're gonna remove the mouthpiece and as you're gonna see you have a threaded ceramic shaft along with the little silicone gaskets these are gonna help give you the seal so you're gonna have the top mouthpiece that's also gonna have a little gasket that's gonna be a glass sealer because these threads are ceramic if you put a lot of pressure on them and twist because the ceramic threads have to line up you're gonna strip the ceramic and it is then going to compromise it's not gonna you know particle eyes or anything like that but it's gonna wear down and you are not going to have a good seal and if you leave your tank on its side they're upside down once it's been filled you do run a higher chance of leaking and you're not gonna have you know the fully sealed air flow possibly that you want so it might affect your rips as well so this is just a caution point this is why we do the videos so when you're putting them together you're gonna fill around the outside edges around the center posts you're gonna fill up with your oils or concentrates your CBDs and then you're gonna take this top and you are going to gently apply pressure and it's going to kind of stop and then you're just gonna twist and give it a little bit of prep just very little pressure and it's gonna take a little bit longer and then you're gonna feel the thread catch and the rubber gasket the glass is going to compress and as soon you feel the rubber gasket compress against the glass then you're gonna know that you are all sealed up there you go boom nice and sealed I wasn't pushing it out enough buddy there you go now it's nice and sealed it's flush I felt it it came to a stop do not overtighten the tank otherwise you're gonna run the risk of stripping it that's why I twist a little bit more times because I didn't want to put too much pressure on it I gave it a little bitty push it was enough I gave a little bitty more push and the thread caught perfectly and now it is all lined up it is sealed and you are ready to vape just remove this end cap here screw this on to your favorite 510 thread battery and yes this does work with auto draws as you see the little air hole on there I don't know if you could zoom in to see the little air hole so it does work with auto draws screw it on to your favorite battery and give this thing a try so again if you're looking for a purist experience something that passes the latest legislation

of water melon strips last night so 800 ml total and I slept like a baby I do not sleep in but I mean cameraman slept in till like 1:00 p.m. yeah it was I couldn't even get ahold of them and then I got myself this TKO Casey punch for sure this is not uh not as many milligrams but these are shatter infused they're not made with Bud Light and a lot of edibles are and what's really cool about this if they have a lot they have a very high CBD also between the whole plant infuse extract super nice line here you can see they're they're organic whole plant extracts not so the entire said never saw it before oh so that what is it six grams of I wouldn't know what's that what's the company how much heavy so it's 200 milligrams of shatter shatter in that in that shadow was made with a whole plant like the doctor who we did a review on it yes so definitely very high CBD along with high THC I'm excited to eat this whole thing tonight I'm going going out downtown gonna be having a rip-roaring for my trip tonight - I also got this Green Wave cartridge these um are a little more expensive than the ones I usually get I usually get platinum vape ones because I have this really awesome buttonless platinum vape battery it works like a charm so I usually get just the Platinum vape cartridges for that because they work really well but this Green Wave it just it I mean it looks really really nice on that color super super golden amber color yeah and very liquidy - more oily than then like a lot of the other ones you see definitely it's a it moves a lot quicker and a lot of the others a lot of the other cartridges you get they have a lot of I've ever really thick oil on the inside so you get it stuck up at the top and then you got to sit and wait like half an hour - how about just stuff like that lot autumn so you can use it but yeah it looks very very it looks like it'll burn a lot quicker or easier at the most and with this the the Green Wave's they're 500 milligrams of organic co2 that this oil is made with organic co2 that is so I'm I'm feeling good chief and on this a lot I'm not feeling bad at all we're gonna be just dump in some of this bud that I picked up in salad days

this video dank has been having a really bad reputation with this and and you know people saying that it's fake and there's so much going on about it this is what I guess the older one and they put out a newer box but what I want to get into what this is you can't always judge what is inside of the cart by what the box is so everybody out there be careful with that we're going to get into this we're gonna see what's up we're gonna see if this is the real deal or not so hope everybody's ready and let's get into we got the pin and let's just pop this about it here there we go real quick and easy it's got the little cap on the bottom take that out this man will see what's this up with his dang faves so we'll talk about this package to in a second but here we go me fire this oh yeah you know what I'm not gonna lie it really does taste like the King Louie strain I don't know if anybody's had the King Louie strand before but it really okay look how it moves though it's gotta be a booth car I mean cuz look how it moves it's moving way too fast guys isn't it past two when you gonna stink this package doesn't really mean shit it doesn't mean if it's real or fake really but yeah the King Louie so all this is is this is a Google you can go on Google and you you can if you type in King Louie it'll show you the same thing I'll show you it's worked forward what this is Fame so there's the crazy thing about this so the package doesn't mean nothing but I mean I will say the term is got to have some type of terpenes in it or something so these can't be all the way fake like people be saying there has to be I mean it could be cut with something or something like that yeah I know it has a really good color to it though but it doesn't move fast but I do like the function of this this tip I've had a couple different types of DANC other than this but the homie I got this from said this is the realest tank out there actually when I don't know I don't know guys what do you think is it boo for would I say that one more time we'll get out of here telling you guys the Terps is really really good on this one more time guys okay tastes really good what guys here he is", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you

buds have I got some exciting news for you from Rove for new disposable pens from Rove all the same flavors you're used to right now they've only got Skywalker og tangi and wahwee og while we the most popular flavors by far four row but check it out this is going to make your arsenal complete it's got 0.4 grams of oil same oil they use in their other pens but they've made it disposable 0.4 grams you say that sucks well as you know the oil from Rove is a lot thicker which means the battery needs to be a lot hotter for that oil to burn so instead of getting a half a gram or even a full gram in a disposable you get halfway through it the battery dies you're pissed off you're at a concert or you're somewhere where you're using your disposable and and it doesn't work so what they found is this is the best combination for the consumer so there you go hot off the press if your dispensary doesn't have it yet get on them find out when they're getting them and load up I'm sure they're going to come out with more flavors in the in the near future and I will let you know when that's happening but right now check it out disposables everybody loves the disposable so there you go hop on it let me know how you like them I've only had it for a day and and really loving it so hope you enjoy like subscribe share the video let people know that it's out there and we'll see you soon [Music]", "pM-PNSq537Q": "what's up what's up family and friends it's your boy Frank ESCO once again I know it's been some time since I got in contact with y'all had a situation pop up once again at work this time I wasn't able to fix it at the job I actually had to come home and fix it pretty much what it was is every time I try to vape out of my little cartridge right here this just light would blink and it also happened to another one of my cartridges like this and this baby was brand new I was I was going crazy I've paid some good money for these cartridges so pretty much it was blinking it wasn't hitting I wasn't getting a pull from it nothing nothing nothing from this thing so pretty much what I figured out was all these things are just positive and negative heat coils going through that's all it is all these little vaporizers that's all they are so when it started blinking like that I was wondering if the wire from the inside was making contact with a negative or if the wire on the inside snapped let me try to show you what I mean all right so this is actually in the bottom of this one see if I could get this off with one hand and also at the bottom of this one you will have this little pin with the washer and a wire tucked in between it well if hopefully y'all guys can see that but my wire was snapped completely snapped off so what I did was I grabbed an old cartridge pulled off the rubber and ripped out as much wire as I could what I did after that was I took that wire with my tweezers wrapped it around the tweezers about twice to make kind of like a a ball of wire with a lead coming out of it I stuck the ball of wire directly down in there stuck the lead back through or straight up put the rubber piece around it because that's not supposed to make contact with anything on the inside if you understand that it's only supposed to make contact with the positive little pin or nipple whatever you guys want to call this thing so the wire goes in between the rubber and the metal once you get that going on the inside just make sure that there's a wire going across sometimes you got lucky if not the ball will hit the wrapping coils because all it is it's just a wire snapped so you're just making another connection with that wire so that it connects what you're positive you're negative everything's good you're able to hit and a vape again hopefully this helps some of you guys out I didn't really see an explanation like this out there but I'm able to hit my vape able to hit this bad boy yeah", "hm8i0oYz-Ww": "I'm tank vape welcome to the channel debate medical cannabis subscribe for weekly content today we're doing a review on Mary's distillate by Mary's medicinals it's the THC blend so there's no strain I wouldn't get the starter kit you can't get the cartridge by itself now if you're not familiar with Mary's medicinals they're based out of Colorado that are known for their effective and award-winning products this is what the cartridge looks like 500 milligram as you can see I've been medicating it is rolling with the ceramic black flat mouthpiece one thing about Mary's dis lid is on very simple as far as the ingredients they don't use any fillers or any solve in some it's the ethanol extracted cannabis oil in Turkey you can just get the cartridge by itself but I purchased a starter kit and the reason why is with the starter kit you get this nifty little battery here alright you can see the USB charge it also has the screw in for the cartridge then this right here would be the LED screen I told you how much percentage your battery is tells you what your amperage is has a ten-second lockout and even has a counter for you from when you've taken a pool you can get an aqua micro dose it looks like put together as you can see is very compact slim sleek I really love the design this is how you turn it on it's five klicks to turn it on oh this is your adjustable arrows you know up down so go ahead and get this started for you guys see here one two oh I already had it on as you can see I'm sitting at 98% 97 oh I love top you get hit with this like kind of sweet taste then it goes into like this earthy piney trying to do then it goes into of like a flower or soapy type deal of um it's not bad let me try this again yeah same thing yeah definitely hit you with the sweet in the beginning then it goes into like this piney earthy taste didn't hit you like this flower like lavender soap type deal from I'm describing that would probably be like the hell is this but actually is not bad you don't think bait reviews we have a point system see where this cartridge ranks on dang great reviews we judge out for three categories which are taste potency in value or the max amount of points for each category is five and then a lot of points to be adding rape is tuned and then maximum amount of points to be adding rape is 15 so let's see where Mary's dissolutes fits on 10 great reviews so first up is taste for taste I'm gonna give it a 5 the taste is not gonna be for everybody just because I'm a goes from a sweet to look like a piney earthy kind of taste then to finish it off with like a lavender flower so P type deal like I said what I'm describing normally would be like what the hell is this but actually I'm like impressed so for taste 5 next up is potency for pouncing I'm gonna give it a 5 this cartridge is tested between eighty eighty five percent THC it definitely grabs you addition to where you need to go quick fast in the hurry and I mean it's a THC blend so for potency 5 I last but not least value for value I'm gonna give it a four depending on where you get the cartridge from can run you fifty bucks I guess um if obviously if you get the StarTAC it's gonna run you a little bit more um but hey what you get in return I think it's a fair trade or I'm the battery like I said suggestible it helps with micro Dossey you know the percentage you could do the paradise now some add up our scores for taste we have five for posse we have five and for value we have four so that brings us courts of 14 it's a dank vape you know I'm not going to tell you to run out and you know go have it you know just having some fun I'm however if you're familiar with Mary's medicinal zone I would say go get the cartridge if you haven't tried it on the stage true just with all the

some new subscribers so uh thank you welcome to the channel to everybody who's been reaching out to me I definitely will be getting back to you I've been very very busy all of a sudden I know a little bit behind on this review I apologize for that I've actually been working on a couple other projects that aren't cannabis related aren't even YouTube related so you know there's been doing other things and um to everyone appreciate the support I'm gonna keep doing these reviews and until next time keep baking in vaping y'all", "220PsX4ZNqA": "so for this video we're gonna be talking about the

sativa with a happy face pen there's minimal smell but it is of cannabis oil not raw cannabis there's no plant matter involved so the majority of the smell is your THC THC smells like butter it is

business days thanks for tuning into this video about the happy face vape pen we have a lot of variety available on our website and have no problem shipping them across Canada thanks for tuning in", "MAS526f5doo": "YouTube would up under there's a crazy epidemic type deal going on all these cartridges and this and that madness but I don't sound on these cartridges these are all mine for me to smoke only so I know what's in them and I'm not worried about these carts but some cartridges out there that look a lot like these you have to be careful with you have to these are on me with distillate and Shore natural Terps or put in but everyone's like an ease off whites about a bunch of hits on this so we're gonna do another off-white one this is a sativa melon aid so off-white is fake they do not make cartridges at the clothing brand so this is not and 2013 is not the date it is the date that the company was made someone said that all the must be old those are from 2013 no it's the date the company was made but this one here this one here one's the real one fake you can see this one here's a thousand milligrams on the air it's 500 this one the air comes in a nice plastic jar this was the snowman strain the strain of it but that's how real cookies car comes it comes in a plastic jar cookie on their cookies on the black in black library but we're not going cookies these coming the plastic thing that they're good but they come in like a Styrofoam one open insert t care of and then these Dangs people were screwing the game up with that stupid thickener now it's like you only wanted your bangs to be too thick because it's insane anymore insane these really medicate you might go well let's get into this dizzy I got that too you can look at the cart it's clear clear oil I don't have that fuzz to it like it's a dirty oil how clicks the bubble move it moves please don't comment that it's water and it's moving super fast cuz it's definitely not but like I said again these are not real they do not make cartridges off way brand what's the bottom looking like the bottom is an icy so the rubber in it to cut the cage just like the dank quartz pretty much these are what I smell great your Moxie I like the Moxie carts but I don't like this porcelain tip I dropped this thing a couple times today a lot of times that I hit the Steeler game and it didn't break and I'm very happy nice looking stuff let me twist this camera around take a lot of likes on these cartridges figured I'd do another one for y'all this is just an empty pack probably buy on Amazon for probably get a hundred of them for $25 off white one cram 2018 zip tie it even says off-white on the ceramic tip it's pretty cool they put a lot of work in the days they put a lot of time and that Easy's ain't no bull crap too much working that he's to throw junk fake killing people oil in them so I don't believe it Wow it tastes really good bro good not too much bullcrap flavoring you get that like spicy cinnamon taste from like the distillate if that makes any sense I feel it like relaxing me already my eyes I never tried that can do cush that from the dank one so I'm gonna try real quick for you guys I don't know if you tried it if you liked it let me know if you tried any of these on off whites let me know what you thought of them too I think they're pretty

review for you guys if you guys didn't know every Friday we try to come out with the banger card tree bu dropping is what is the hottest on the market right now what am i using you know what's poppin what's not and usually we try out some of the best stuff and sometimes we get really really unlucky and end up with some crappy cartridges but for today's video men this video has been a long awaited video I've had a lot of viewers telling me go try this you need to try them they're the best in the market and you know your boy after long time in the works we finally got it coming to you guys so tell you boys without further ado we are gonna be reviewing friendly farms true full spectrum live resin cartridges true full spectrum boys you guys heard that right so for those of you that don't know or have ever heard of friendly farms they're a company based out of them it's where is it somewhere somewhere in San Francisco I believe and they started off just I think they started off from what I believe when I first started following him they were making these sauces and they were popping off man you know that was big and then they switched over to UM cartridges they have dabba related applicators you know all that good stuff and they're just killing it man they're just killing it so after you know having my viewers tell me you guys a guy that I needed to try this I obviously went out hit him up and they were super super nice and generous meant to be like yes for sure ma'am you work together we kind of want you to try it out because they even themselves believe that this is some of the best stuff on the market so I was like kind of happy you know it's good working with the company that that is so friendly you know it's just in their name so what they did though this isn't just a normal you know here's our product give us a good review this guy was like here's our product men give give the gift that make the video and give the people a real review don't sugarcoat it know that stuffin you already know your boy ain't sugarcoating [ __ ] so we're gonna get into this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of their dab stuff you know these are their DAB sauces and we also got the the applicator we can definitely do something like that if you guys want to see some crazy ass challenge videos man like hitting for friendly farms at once or something like some something crazy man let me know in the comments below what you guys have as an idea and we'll probably do it so yeah get in the video I hear if you guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "oHcEXX-MHiw": "hey guys so I got a new vape pen today from cure vape here's my old one this is a pure one I originally got this because I was smoking out of these ceramic cartridges know if you can see that but it's on all the pure one ceramic cartridges they all say they strongly suggest using the pure one battery which is this one so that's what I got but pure has a full line of strains in these regular cartridges which are not ceramic they use the I believe I want to say fiberglass string it's like the old-school style I kind of like these better I feel like they last longer although the flavor is not as good and you don't really want fiberglass things in there forever that's a super bad for your body but as long as it none of it actually goes into your lungs you'll be fine but I got this so I could try out all their different flavors and I like the idea of having two pens anyway I can have one indica one sativa or whatever so I can smoke on them at different times so yeah so that's why I got this I also really like the boxes on these they're really soft they have like a slight rubberized coating to them they feel really nice I feel like it makes the brands like stand out a little better makes it seem like it's good quality stuff so we're gonna check this out okay it is comes the charger and that is all no instructions or anything but it's pretty straightforward just plug this into you know phone base and charge it this charger is different than the one charger as you can see this is the one for the pure one kind of sticks out we'll see they both seem about the same I mean well wise this is kind of cool actually just noticed that this is a stylus at the end of the small one so there's small vape pens have a little stylus at the end I'm still kind of wondering why they call it their small pen considering it's about the same size as this it might be a little skinnier but it's longer so I feel like they're the same size it's kind of hoping this would be a little smaller but it is not bad yeah let's go ahead and see if this is a charge in it so this cartridge that I got for this new pen is Green crack which I've been wanting to try and they do not sell them in the ceramic cartridges so I'm gonna see as you can see it lights up down there instead of the bottom it's cool it's charged right out of the box I feel like it hits really good I like this a lot I feel like the airflow is even better than this one it's really easily and this green crack tastes kind of like bananas to me like actual banana flavored it's kind of cool I don't think it's yeah it's not flavored it definitely tastes like banana to me and it's really good I'm just really excited about having two pans now and get started on this check back again later for some more reviews more unboxings more weed stuff and see you next time", "ZQ-2Nah8ajw": "what's up familia as you homie Mickey the producer how Mikey no [ __ ] with that nunu the select elite premium babe

right yep a little compared to that ok well here we go rock and roll flight vape pen let's review it let's take it here comes a plane right at the same time yeah are you ready that works pretty well wait up and started you have to warm it up but that was pretty instant that's a big dope supposed to be a good way to deliver the medicine discreetly and you're not really incinerating anything I like that again it's got a minty aftertaste yeah it's not gassy yeah we're gonna try outside oh it's not two guys in Canada [Music] [Music] look at torch vape it up Youngblood that's gonna sweeten this up the enemy shell I'm impressed what to beef you get off the sink for a small unit and you can see this end here and just get other behaviors and put it on there just kind of cool that is really neat

tattoo and we had great neighbors yeah that too and vapors and those people I'm sure visited the cannabis and hemp Oxbow definitely Wow we surprised the one called the fire department all that smoke actually the whole vape place would just like beat right out it looked like it's on fire some of those vapors are pretty impressive I gotta say though I do some crazy tricks oh yeah yeah I mean you can try it's like okay it was a trick actually my trick is they use it for medicating it ever helps relieve my yeah my symptoms it's also one of my tricks so uh thank you flight for the pen that was a tray awesome mmm well Mike you know what time it is where's Eddie time to roll another joint indeed it's time to roll another huge joint but in the meantime keep watching urban rainbow for more we video [Music]", "GtcDoDmhX8M": "[Music] what is up i am trevor with green social here today to review a product that has come to our doorstep i'm excited to actually dive into this it is actually a company out of washington um they're called elevated this is one of their five different flavors of distillate cartridges we're going to get into this a little bit deeper but i want to start out by talking about the packaging elevated has done a really good job of branding their cartridges also they're gummies but today we're we're just going to focus on this the pineapple crush is the flavor that we're going to be testing out today but i want to look at this and talk about how cool kind of badass this is it reminds me of 90's grudge i love the color profile on the packaging it's really unique of course it pops whenever you see it i think this is something i would gravitate towards let's take a look at the back i love that they actually kind of briefly talk about the experience of what you're going to get out of this out of this cartridge it talks about the flavor the effects the thc it gives me a visual overall i think this is really cool packaging i'm just going to give it a five out of the gate i like it i'm gonna give it a five all right so let's break into this bad boy i love a i love a pretty pretty new cart the look of the actual distillate in here it looks really nice it's got a ambery yellow to it a really pretty look looks clean overall i think it looks really good it's pretty standard looking nothing special about the actual cartridge i think i'll give this just a four but i do like this i think it's fine so this next section is going to be about the flavor really kind of excited because it's pineapple i love pineapple i'm happy i didn't get a strawberry or like a watermelon which i'm sure are great flavors but pineapple it has a very specific taste to it so that's what's so exciting so i'm just going to kind of just just briefly you know just get a little taste just a little taste oh wow okay the pineapple the pineapple is there i like that oh pineapple baby okay okay i'm gonna rip it i'm gonna rip it real good [Laughter] pineapple's there baby oh yeah the flavor profile on it is is very prominent you can definitely taste the pineapple which is nice and on on the pineapple crush it's not burning even on that bigger rip it didn't burn it was really really smooth the flavor is good and this is all about flavor i am going to give it a 5. i think the flavor is there um the hit was really smooth even on like my normal hit it was really smooth the flavor is just superior here that's all you really can can really taste is and that's what you get you get a mouthful of pineapple crush overall i feel like it was really balanced so we'll talk about the aroma of this i think it's pretty obvious to me it has a pineapple you know scent it met my expectations and i mean it kind of exceeded it but i felt like that was more in the the actual flavor that exceeded it but the the aroma is the aroma was good i'm gonna give it i think a four i think it's fine so we're on to the effects it's it hits hard it hits quick i'm gonna give it a five i mean whenever i'm smoking flour and it's it's a sativa um usually you're smoking it's like five ten minutes you're smoking a joint it's done but the effects kind of it's like 20 minutes with this it hits hard it hits fast and whenever i feel like whenever i smoke it at home i'm just gonna go straight inside and just start doing the dishes usually i get like 20 30 minutes before i'm like peak high at home where i'm like okay now we can go do it do active things clean up the house whatever you want to do i feel a little bit more calm and a little bit more yes i feel more energetic but at the same time i feel a little bit better i feel more more balanced here i really enjoy it i'm a flower guy so i always go back to enjoying flower but i think the effects on this have been pretty delightful overall i thought it was really good cartridge all the the categories that we went down i think it did really good in all those categories the packaging i i love the packaging i go back to now i want to go skate or go play tony hawk's underground 2 american wasteland like i just you know overall i think it was a good experience 23 of 25. in my opinion i'm gonna in my opinion i really enjoyed it and i'm gonna be looking for them at a dispensary hopefully near me hopefully i can pick these up these might be my regular thing i enjoyed the flavor i enjoyed the effects overall elevated i think that they knocked it out of the park let me know if you pick up one of the five flavors of these hellevated cartridges i would love to hear your experience", "H5eK4DFDt8A": "what's up guys the grass skirt lounge I'm at the park chillin right now for taking a break with my man jackhammer I mean what a great friend to have right my home me and my homie Jackson in the park but uh but I can't spark him up because it's concentrated but we bought the coiling up I suppose so I just wanted to take time out of my day they give you guys a little update on the grass skirt lounge what we've been up to if you guys haven't watched the last the last videos and also this is an actual review on the Jack Herer high fly babe cartridge by the way so this is actually reviewing not just a an update I know there's gonna be reversed to you guys but the Jack Herer this is a sativa actually and I've been smoking on this all day I waited for today for me to start working for me to actually crack this open and start smoking and I got it last night and I bought some I bought two grams of Superman also in fact now I got four grams of Superman actually wait how many grams are they good [ __ ] yeah yeah two grams my bad my bad Superman is like $15 a gram anyway so I just got some Superman and I got the Jack Hera and man I'm I'm straight you know what I'm saying to sativas now I tell you this man sativas are really good when you got to do [ __ ] during the day you know I'm able to necessarily recommend like if you were a [ __ ] firefighter to be how sativa or indica for that matter you don't say because depending on how high you get it may actually [ __ ] up your response time you know what I'm saying I mean it is it is cannabis after all and also I did share a video on Instagram a video that I saw on Twitter I shared it on Instagram on what everybody that follows me on Instagram I'm it with a noun this video it was pretty good it would give us some history on on cannabis and everything and some stories on why cannabis was made illegal and yada yada yada I thought it was pretty good but anyway the jack harries bum man i like the jackhammer you know i've been on the concentrate tip real heavy and I'm actually going to buy some new big cartridges as well so I can do reviews on those because they are quite a few out there and I want to try out all the brands that I can so that you guys can be well-informed basically but if you got if you're not following me on instagram follow me on instagram follow me on twitter i got to put some more I gotta put some more

sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "SXMTTO5fcQs": "hey there everyone welcome to my channel and if this is your first time here welcome my name is Courtney Crosby I currently live in Portland Oregon working in the cannabis industry and I want to share my love of the cannabis with you all but before we get started got a little Bowl packed here if you want to join alone that be awesome [Music] your best resource for smoking without the smell is going to be cartridges there are a few different types and styles of cartridges I mean with a prequel Tabar battery this is going to be my favorite battery that I have and it comes with the battery itself a charger a micro USB charger which I love about this battery two different bottom pieces for your cartridges that you had attached to the bottom of your cartridge to make it a magnet connection to the battery itself a few different cartridges to this battery and show you how well it works and everything screw this little bottom on the metal bottom piece on here making it a magnet connection to the battery and see so it doesn't fall out which is really nice look at the button five times to turn the battery on and off you can also double click the button here and it will do a pre heat setting which is really nice if you've ever had your battery laying on the side and all the oil has run to one side of the cartridge or it's just really cold and your cartridge and the oil inside is really cold you can put that pre heat setting on and it'll preheat the cartridge in together ready for use which is really awesome also has a temperature gauge up here at the top which is really important three cartridges to burn at different temperatures also when you set your cartridge down on the lowest temperature you're gonna go through your cartridge a lot slower it's also gonna taste a lot better so if you have your cartridge turn all the way up on high which is good for some cartridges to work or to lay other cartridges it'll just taste really burn you'll actually burn your cartridge and sometimes it can actually pop through the top of your cartridge and burn you which what you don't want on our cartridge oh just turn it down I can help with things like that so I'm gonna hit this bad boy and show you what it can do [Music] so taking this metal piece off and transferring it to you let's try out this buddy's cartridge these specific cartridges you can tell there's a little bit different we got two different mouthpieces here also the different types of oil on the inside which is really important just depending on what kind of cartridge you want I'll specifically really like the flat tips because you can hit it from any direction where is these tips you can only get it from the front or the back you have a specific battery with a button on it you have to hit a specific direction that can be difficult if your cartridge is in at a funny angle I just transferred the metal piece on to this cartridge here so it is now a magnet connection to this battery here so it doesn't fall out and you try it with this cartridge [Music] moving on to evolve I have their living resin cartridge and their battery to go open up this battery check it out another micro USB charger which is really great just plugs in down here on the bottom which is really awesome it says evolve across the battery with a nice button [Music] a button for your battery is also really important because some cartridges actually require a button it kind of just sends the signal to the cartridge saying okay it's time to warm up and activate the cartridge so some cartridges actually require a button on them some batteries are just a pull-through battery some cartridges work with those but not all cartridges do the last battery that we got here this is going to be a disposable battery so the battery comes with the cartridge you don't have to buy them separately just really great but once you're finished with that you would actually recycle the whole bad boy together so let this one it will be one of those pull through batteries it doesn't have a button on it or anything this is the Nano here there's also this type of a battery here that also has the button but also has a screw on USB charger on the top really great if you're looking for just an easy accessible battery on the go most of time these bad boys had lifetime warranties on them but unfortunately most the time if you lose this charger please piece in is irreplaceable that is why I like the micro USB chargers it a lot of these bad boys gone here [Music] please let me know down below what you thought in today's video I'm going to have any questions tips or things to add please let me know I love to hear about it thanks for watching and I hope you all have a great day", "Eu3uyw6e-08": "Hi, welcome back.

instructional video on how to use the leak proof cartridges now this is actually a cartridge that i've used already so i apologize about that but i have placed it back in the original starting position so first thing that you want to notice in any cartridge if it's not hitting it usually means there's a space right on the bottom here that means there's a space here but the leak-proof portion has not been activated we pull the top off when we're ready to use it now avoiding touching this sorry avoiding touching this blue rubber stopper here because we don't want to pull that off unless with that tamper with it we want to grab the top classic portion here and notice this part here I'm going to press down and turn okay and I can pull it back up for you so you can see the movement there we go so again now touching the blue thing not pulling it out you're going to grab the top and a press you're going to turn as soon as you do that in about 10 seconds the product is

of Kraft concentrates and some harmony extracts and uh we got some good stuff and I can't wait to try these out these were really good prices today so I'm excited for these ok let's take a look at what I was able to pick up from the Apothic I got a couple of grams some live concentrates here I was able to get a rim of crafts lemon Jie I see live resin it's about 87% h-scenes and of course of the flower that looks really good that one's light in color it smells amazing I can't wait to try that one and then I also picked up a gram of harmony extracts and ghost OG live sugar and that one's about 75 just under 75 percent THC let's get a close look at the sugar there that one looks really good all right let's uh let's get a dab of both of these and see we like them okay let's try out these dams here the first one that we're gonna try is the craft lemon G hi-c lime present and that one was the high THC what was in the 87% let's check that one out [Music] oh that one's really good it's really smooth and it's really sweet tasting I'm gonna like a nice citrusy lemon flavor with that one oh it's good stuff okay the next one up is the harmony extracts the ghost OG live sugar and that one was just under 75 percent THC so let's give it a go here [Music] oh oh that one tastes really good [Music] okay the one with less THC tastes a bit better maybe we should mix them okay so I mixed both of them here we've got a nice fat scoop on the katana here and let's give it a try [Music] oh yeah still good when you mix them both together I just had to make sure [Music] great stuff do

crosses on the screen right here just on each side and I'm saying so you guys couldn't get a better understanding of what strains are actually crossed in here but very very good stuff these were $24 for a half grams so about 48 dollars total a full gram is 45 at my shop so I did so about buying a full gram cartridge would save you about 3 bucks but you only get one strain I get two and yeah we're just gonna get started from here just see the percentages so for the berry punch it's gonna be 82 percent or 83 let's just say 83 and then this one's going to be 80 point 74 percent okay let's just open it I'm kind of scared I've never blinked two pens at once so we're gonna be trying this so this one golden here here very very similar I did smoke some already as you can tell so try this friendly funds will go in the golden one I'm in the chill battery this one see if we can bring both of these at once do not try this at home voice no I'm saying my tolerance is a lot different than every tall everyone's person's tolerance is different so please keep that in mind my tolerance is a bit high so I do have to smoke a little bit more than a average person so I'm saying cheers boys [Music] that's Syrian think so a lot of you have probably been wondering about raw garden for a while and I've been wondering too you know their life resin is a lot lighter than other life resin cartridges and it's not like raw garden has hid anything from their extraction process maybe just a few secrets but I've read articles on Leafly where they're basically saying that it's this list so it's like raw garden has never hid the fact and then the fact that there were fine live resin is not really that much of a difference you know I'm saying it actually it's like kind of like the best of both worlds how distillate usually has higher THC percentages than let's say library but then if you reintroduce the strain-specific turts like it's it's all the same it's just a little bit lighter and it's not it's distillate mix with real turf so you know I'm saying usually distillate you're gonna mix it with like strawberry terms or grave herbs or watermelon herbs but what raw garden is doing and I'm not saying like I'm like a raw garden expert because I am far from that you know this is just what I've been reading online and please just take it with a grain of salt people are messaging me saying that they're a bad company but it's like you know they're not they're not a bad company they're certified they never like failed a test for pesticides and they never honestly never like they said refine life resins if you look up refine it means remove from all impurities in the [ __ ] and that's basically what they say on their Instagram you know I'm saying so no hate on raw garden is still my second favorite my first favorite is obviously Ursa but raw garden they're doing something right you know they really are and it kind of is like the best of both worlds if it is this late which I'm not sure it is they have the Hyatt they have the high percentages you know thing and what live resin is is it basically the flash freeze the plants and then they just extract it with BHO or closed a closed loop system and then you get the final product you know I'm saying and some some companies you know they and just put that whole product into a cartridge what raw garden does is that they distill it with some sort of method that they use which is only unique to them and then they reintroduce the Terps back into it like it's not really it's just like it's like doing math but differently you know I'm saying like two plus two equals four but then you put two plus one plus one you know I'm saying there's just a different way it just ends up kind of similar you know I'm saying I'm not saying it's the same we obviously know that live resident cartridges is usually a bit darker but like like I said raw garden has never been lying about anything you know and the cartridges are getting I'm saying so while garden fan till the end and respect to the people who has been telling me about you know whatever they think they're concerned with these thing they're telling me that there's like the housing 10,000 chemicals like come on really let's be honest you just ready you're spreading some weird rumors now so cheers boys I'm gonna do another blink you're probably gonna end the video here it's just like the video says I was just going to do a blinker with both pens at once and hopefully you guys enjoyed the video you know there will be another video of some King's garden so be on the lookout for that I didn't even open it here so yeah just I don't understand the heat for raw garden it's like raw garden never hid that fact you know they're gonna hide some facts of like their methods of extraction you know you can't really tell people what you do too much you know you gotta keep it a secret but like they never like hidden the fact that you know the alley flea article says that their distillate you know alley flea article shares boys [Music] no more we gotta put it down it's all like I said it was a wake and bake today so I'm definitely gonna feel this but yes both really really phenomenal flavors I'm not gonna lie and honestly that was all I need for this wake and bake um holy [ __ ] well yeah much love to a rock garden much love to ursa and all the other companies you know saying do your own thing you know I'm saying and uh I don't know it's kind of like the best of both worlds to me let me know in the comments what you think you know obviously we're going to have different opinions just let me know let me know your opinion on rawr and let me know what you actually think of raw garden and uh yeah we'll just get this discussion going you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music]", "JfbmwuA630I": "Khalifa's geo cannabis oil cartridges deliver full flavor vapor and premium potency our expert

don't have a gun knife or bomb in your [ __ ] they really don't care what's up everybody youtube's been really busting my balls about their community guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks one shoe one [Music] one of the most common questions i get asked whether it's in the dms or the comments or just even in person bro everyone's always wondering especially in the traveling videos eric you're always traveling with a pen or a yada yada or some concentrate or this or that how do you get on a plane with your pen and of course i'm not talking about nicotine right here we're talking about thc baby we got a flight over to la right now which we're about to catch and i'm about to bring this little bad boy with me right now man it's called the dart x it's by c cell they had a dart previously and then they just uh redid it did a whole bunch of things better it's usbc now got three temperature modes and it's a pod system i think these are actually the same pods that moxie uses and it's the same pod i've definitely seen 710 use these same pods so very compatible little device oh my god [Music] okay oh yeah man as you can see by the street tacos and the great mexican food and the good vibes going around you know a couple homeless people a little tweaker here and there we're in los angeles baby and not only are we in los angeles but this little bad boy made it through with me man so here's the first thing that you need to truly understand about tsa and getting [ __ ] through tsa in general not just carts but this is like small amounts of bud maybe a concentrate or two tsa are not the cops they don't have the power to arrest you so if they do find something that they see as like damn you really shouldn't have this it's really up to that agent by himself if he wants to call the cops if he wants to get the authorities involved so unless that guy's having a [ __ ] shitty ass day an awful day i think most of the tsa agents that i meet are pretty cool man i guess it depends on where you fly out from people have told me that flying out of the east coast is kind of trippy like tsa agents or dicks over there but from everywhere where i've traveled on the west coast i've been to seattle's airport portland's airport multiple airports in california obviously or two flight of phoenix all the time i fly out of denver all the time i'm just like self-snitching at this point like come find me bro here's where i you know but like i've flown out of texas airports a few times so it's not really just the laws it's really like the people bro you gotta put yourself in their shoes right i'm not gonna call the cops over a [ __ ] eighth of weed or one gram of concentrate or like a thc pen or something like that obviously if you're trying to bring a couple ounces you got a couple bricks of this or that you're trying to hide you know edibles in your ass like that's probably when it gets a little bit like okay we gotta get the [ __ ] cops involved who's the number one thing we can end the video off on this but i'm gonna talk a little bit more tsa is looking for bombs not drugs not wheat and if they do find weed it has to be a [ __ ] crazy copious amount for them to actually like call the feds up and be like yo this guy's trying to like bring like ounces and edibles and shrooms and cocaine through the tsa like we gotta [ __ ] apprehend his ass you know what i mean but other than that i think you're chilling man and a lot of people don't know this but lax i think this is the only airport that does it lax you can legally fly out with 28 grams of bud or seven grams of concentrate 100 legally they don't give a [ __ ] where you're going but if you go through lax tsa and they see the butt on top and they're like okay nice little ounce i don't think they really even count either so shout out to lax you obviously don't get checked on the connecting flights or anything which i didn't understand at first so like if you take a flight from lax to atlanta and you stop in dallas you're not going to get checked again in dallas like you're chilling if you as long as you make it out of la you're good i'm about to [ __ ] these tacos out about a little past thor a little asado you know what's going on man i think we have two dispensaries to hit right now after as well get hella [ __ ] free weed and then we're gonna discuss a little bit more about this uh this pen action going on stop one gotta wait for the cars as always hey what's going on how are you sorry the man everyone's dying for these boxes oh i've seen these a couple times i've definitely wow the flower the hat the whole hookup going on hell yeah you guys see the add-on screen man house last night how you little christmas card from us oh thank you so much look at that that's awesome pound bags i got you some merch too sweater t-shirt hat perfect the whole shebang god thank you so much i appreciate it i know i appreciate you it's a big ass box of weed man step one done stash house is secured now we're gonna head into this little place called sherbinski's i think we're gonna go on like a mini shopping spree damn here too so let's see what's popping with it many [Music] more [Music] all right i'm super glad i'm only here for 24 hours because it's only 7 p.m right now and it is dead as [ __ ] look at this we're on melrose right now man it's 7 p.m on a friday i wanted to hit a whole bunch of stores on this in fairfax but i literally think they all closed at seven so we're just gonna have to we're gonna have to wait this is actually so weird dude i've never seen la like this ever and finally we got the last stop we've been here a couple times before we're picking up some cali stripe baby let's go and then the goodie bags are making me weird right here so hey thank you brother i appreciate that and then i got this one right here thank you so much man i appreciate it that's insane pretty uh pretty basic little hotel room nothing too crazy but this is the real reason i got it we got a little yeah a little balcony with a yacht view come on a little dark let's get some lighting in this [ __ ] please no i know what you're thinking you're like eric what if my pod doesn't look like this or what if my cart doesn't look like this like this is pretty inconspicuous and you're right if you can get away with like a pod system anything it's it's perfect you're not even gonna get questioned and honestly if it's only one or two you're tripping out for no reason look at this [ __ ] bro i accidentally brought this and it's very clearly i think there's a big thc california sticker on it and uh it's pretty clearly weed they don't give a [ __ ] they like it's just too much of a hassle i think as long as you're not trying to hustle like a pound through tsa you'll be all right man now i will say and i'm pretty sure i have to do this legally first of all this is only my experiences right like i said i've only flown out of a few airports in the country this is the experience that i've had with those tsa agents but also this is only for continental united states based traveling if you're going anywhere overseas even to like mexico or canada i'm pretty sure the customs and the whole thing that you have to go through is completely different and trust me getting caught with a cart in the states yeah it's a felony in some place whatever bro if you get caught overseas with the cart that you brought from the states like your life is [ __ ] over type [ __ ] like just just don't do it be smarter there's probably a little bit of weed you know in the other country that you're going to so you'll be fine you don't need a cart i hit this one dispo off camera i've never uh had these cars before i've had moxie pods but moxie has full gram live resin carts for like 40 something bucks out the door which is cali prices are ridiculous man like every single time i come back here i sort of got like everything just gets more expensive the first little spree that we had they gave us a 150 bucks to spend and i was like nice i can buy some raws and then like some other stuff dude i think the cheapest grandma rosin they had was like 85 or 90 bucks out the door and i was like yeah you're tripping how the [ __ ] do i open this all right nice nice 510 thread little c cell cartridge looking good c cell is everywhere they make these they make these little bad boys they make a whole bunch of [ __ ] man i will say that i never really fly with flour even if it's a gram or an eighth and it's super sealed up and it's like back sealed yada yada like i just don't think it's worth it man especially for like a blunt's worth you know what i mean carts don't smell pods don't smell concentrates if it's like sealed up real well it's not gonna smell but like bud i feel like no matter what you do bro there's always just like a like a whose weed is that around here this is a what flavor is this right now a lemon drop can you see that is it focusing testing it 89 if you want to be super uber safe i think bringing one of these is probably the best move a cart yeah it doesn't smell or anything but like if the tsa agents being a real [ __ ] [ __ ] he could be like yo this is clearly like thc whatever but like this is like yo it's [ __ ] nicotine like how are you you want to hit it you want to prove to me that it's thc buddy at that point you're pissing them off a little bit you might be playing with fire but i don't think i'll get to that point i don't know maybe i'm just lucky man maybe just spewing [ __ ] everyone's going to take my advice and then it's gonna be like marijuana arrest through tsa skyrocket through 2021 or some [ __ ] now if you're asking how i actually like physically pack my bag to bring these things so i mean backpack's got a whole bunch of pockets right you can throw this [ __ ] wherever like this pen i think was in this one it's got a whole bunch what do we have in here q-tips we got a pencil papers filters we got the new anova oh yes sir you want to cop one of these very limited we're re-dropping the heady glass tips instead of purple we got a slime green on the tip out of the nova logo right there let's go you can pack it as a little joint you can roll a [ __ ] fatty or you can just pack a little one hitter man multi-use tool right here only available at novasmoke.com this monday 4 20 p.m pacific standard time drop you know what it is every single week baby i'll break over one of these concentrates real quick just to actually you don't even need to break it open it's almost less conspicuous if you put it in like this you can literally just toss that in right there toss that wherever but if you want to be really really safe bring out the toiletries bag and you just toss it anywhere in there bro the actual little cylindrical things looks exactly like makeup especially through a little x-ray scanner so i mean even if you bring like you know i'm not saying you should break the law all of this is breaking the law this is just for educational purposes but even if you were to bring per se you know more than eight grams or whatever is legal out of lax then they're not gonna you know they're big it's it looks like makeup you're good guess you could stick a pen in the toiletries bag too but i mean i don't know maybe that's a little sketchy probably just maybe it looks like a makeup one i don't know they're really just checking for bombs bro i really think that's what it is like if you don't have a gun knife or bomb in your [ __ ] they really don't care also i guess this is kind of along the same lines i also bring my puff coat everywhere with me you just gotta make sure that it's relatively clean like we'll see right here this [ __ ] is not clean at all oh bad boy right there is probably a little bit sticky a little resined up and um you can see at the very bottom i mean it looks clean you just got to make sure it's not gunked up you just got to make sure there's no like real concentrate in that [ __ ] and you can travel with this anyway because this is federally legal there's nothing illegal about this little device right here but once you start you know building it up with wax and resin then it's like wait you got some you got some concentrate in there buddy all right man next day we got all this weed to try out right here we're gonna see what's in the strabinski's bag and try out some stuff and then we got ourselves artistry man i was only supposed to pick up these things cali striper was like yo we'll hook me up some concentrates like last time and i was like dope and then artistry came through and then just handed me a bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ] look at this soda man for free shout out to them we got red zone going [ __ ] tom brady and [ __ ] the [ __ ] years and then wait hold on hold on this is what i was looking for right there very excited to try this i see casey neistat post about this i think he's actually like an investor in it or some [ __ ] so shout out i just put some money in that motherfucker's pocket these are cannabis infused social tonics pretty much just a drink that gets you very mildly high it's two milligrams chd for cbd i would bring this back home but liquids definitely aren't something that you can bring on a plane whether it's illegal or thc or whatever or not you just it's not possible how the [ __ ] do you open this there's like instructions on the lid so i guess they have to make these child proof as well which is something that i didn't even think about but you got to make your soda product lids childproof so it says open this oh and then you slide this what the [ __ ] that's lit oh i'm not sure how i like that actually that's like a white cloth it's like it's more like sparkling water than anything [ __ ] hate sparkling water bro i mean it's all right you can taste a little bit of blood orange yeah i don't know man it's like quite it's like not really a soda because there's not enough sugar and fizz but it really reminds me of like a white claw and i i don't like those things i never understood the hype i know like white girls like them because there's only like 50 calories a can and it gets you like relatively [ __ ] up but i never i'd rather i drink a beer bro i'd rather have a beer [ __ ] it's another little package so this is like yeah um it's called the click spray like i said i was just trying to try out a whole bunch of [ __ ] that i've never tried before that soda was alright it was cool this is interesting though it says there's approximately how much is that approximately two and a half milligrams per click so i mean that's like drinking a whole soda or one of these in just one click wow so if i click this like 10 times like 25 it tastes good dude i'm not gonna i kind of like it damn it's like um i don't even know i can't even describe it this is fire as [ __ ] though dude i never thought i would like this i thought it'd be like a really nasty flavor like i don't know anything that you gotta put in my like topicals i hate topicals those shits where you gotta like put it under your tongue those are the worst things ever so i wasn't sure how i was gonna like this but this is like this is dope man there's like four or five different ones too this has a two to one thc to cbd ratio which is the one i was looking for every single other one had more cbd than thc so this is this is the one that gets you high right there very interested to see how fast it works as well is it like an edible where it takes a long time or does it just like hold the contents under your tongue for 15 seconds i guess it's like a quick way to go into the bloodstream or something nice that is chill because we're on the top of the carts and smuggling things this is going back [ __ ] home with me 100 sure this wasn't as tax as they usually are every single time i see these things this is a half gram you heard it half gram disposable and these are minimum 60 everywhere with tax so thankfully this was only like 50 i think which is still insane like this full gram live resin thing from moxie was 45 out the door so half gram 50 not a rolling wing crunch damn they didn't like they didn't really seal that is that legal don't you always have to have like a little child proof thing damn this [ __ ] just popped right out hey i'm not complaining man less packaging the better i [ __ ] hate weed packaging it's like adult proof it's impossible this is that biscotti and gushers what the [ __ ] are y'all doing over here connected man i know they're they're cannabis their actual flowers super taxed as well i guess it's just for good reason man this video turned into like half educational video and half an unboxing i [ __ ] love free weed though hopefully you do too oh i'm lit about this i've never tried this before man not sure if we can this video because i don't have a piece to hit this out of but we will be hitting this very soon it's mike tyson's weed bro tyson's ranch it was a little bit on the pricier side but i feel like all wheat is on the pricier side nowadays man it's very rare that you're gonna find an eighth or under 35 under 40 out the door this was like closer to 60 65 and the nugs aren't looking too shabby they're not really blowing me away right now but you can get a little close-up of the little somethings shout out mike tyson man i think that's the dream get on his little podcast smoke some big kush with him that'd be sick i do like this this packaging though he's on his bird [ __ ] man let's go cannabis infused the blue razz the only thing about all these drinks is there's so little thc i don't know if they hit different but the max tac drink that i've seen in california dispensaries at least is like 10 25 milligrams you know i mean this can is is two it's [ __ ] i [ __ ] out to thc i feel like if you actually ate a piece of my [ __ ] it would get you higher than this casey neistat don't hurt me bro send me some boxes if you're down sour cream and onion crackers this is uh 20 milligrams for this entire thing so very unfortunate but we're gonna have to eat that too we got a little pre-roll right here cannabis syrup okay so this is some gang [ __ ] right here this is 125 milligrams i like that we're gonna have to pour that up into something right before the flight because see [ __ ] this why would i drink all that the sugar all that [ __ ] for 10 milligrams when i could just this is very interesting uh thc tablet 20 milligrams right there man all right i don't have scissors this is impossible because usb cable was the sharpest thing that i could find so i think we're just gonna yes there it is man it looks like a little piece of hash oh there's a little pot leaf on it bro that's lit it's probably way too small to focus hang on oh never mind you can see that little bad boy right there that's what i like to see let her go oh my god i hate putting in pills first bro people call me weird because i always put in water or whatever before i put in my pill that's chill man i just like how you can get high in so many different [ __ ] ways like what in the world we got syrup pills drinks smoke uh disposable pens we got flower dabs it's a great [ __ ] thing we have a mouth spray like what in the world bro come on man this is honestly the probably like my favorite product that we have all right here on the table man you guys are the [ __ ] you guys are the homies i think that's gonna be the video i'm gonna go enjoy my new goodies back home with you know some of the information that you learned in this video you didn't really learn anything i mean i didn't really tell you [ __ ] that you probably didn't already know it's just like just don't be an idiot about it man just don't just be low-key about it don't be too crazy and i think you'll be chill man stay cool stay safe stay smart you guys are the [ __ ] man stay high of course i will see you all later new videos coming this week it's [ __ ] christmas this week uh just makes you want to smoke a little bit more shout out see self course for sponsoring this video absolute legends if you want to get yourself one of these batteries got the link in the description or the comments or whatever beautiful man beautiful stuff honestly i don't even know if i can say i'm being smart i'm bringing like four or five pens now i'm flying out of lax though that's the thing bro if you're flying at lax you can literally get away with like whatever and they're obviously not gonna like count out every single gram if you got like a few bags here and there that look like they add up to an ounce they'll be cool in here bro listen you guys are the best i'll see you very soon have a very safe day and week and keep flying with those pants baby peace", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "HxbthKzHWNE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is another fake cartridge video I recently came across this fake cartridge if you're curious about the title about fake cartridges evolving let me get to that first of all my homie my homie comes up to me and asked me if this cartridge was legit or not not like actually physically coming up to me but like through a facebook Messenger and this brand the so-called brand that he brings up is can i clear he tells me that the oil was slightly pinkish which was like a red flag right off the bat you know you never oil that's pinkish come on like bias the the branding question is called can you clear and why ice titled this video fake cartridges are evolving I mentioned it in my lives recently so if you guys were in there you probably know what I'm talking about but basically when you think about fake cartridges you think about think face or supreme babes and a really good indicator of them being fake is that they're using copyrighted material maybe like cartoon characters from a beloved cartoon series or smartcards you know taking a brand's name and running with it with their own thing you know basically taking the brands likeness and applying it to themselves anything with Bank faves just their names already give off a red flag but this one can a clear I'll post it right here it's probably the most out of all the fake cartridges the most legit looking and I'd like to mention that you can just tell by the box shape that is very similar to the box shape of dang babes mind you that the packaging outside appearance is different it's still the same box shape everything's still the same and before I start this any further I do not have never tried a canna clear I've never heard of canna clear some people probably would assume that maybe it's a real brand then then they kind of just you know the black market kind of just took their name and went with it in the into the black market that could be the case but as far as I know my friend came up to me with candy clear said it was pinkish oil and it was like 30 bucks okay first of all you know I told him go to the club you know you can get a cartridge from the club for $30 now you know I'll be it's not gonna be we're all guarding quality but it's still gonna be good I got the free cannabis cart for 2350 at one point you know I just want to make this video you know I know a lot of this debate related deaths have actually been slowing down now that coronavirus has been here I don't know if that's uh actually like you know goes together in any way but I'm pretty late with this because I went to read it and they said kind of clear six months ago was faked so this is something new to me like I said my friend brought it to me I was unaware of a brand like this existed I know there's other brands out there but I feel like this one is probably the most dangerous one because it's it looks [ __ ] legit you know so as I'd like to just make this video and you know tell you guys let you guys know beforehand like myself you know I'm know probably some of you guys have probably heard of this brand already but like I said I only heard about it just a few weeks ago and I figured some people are like me as well and don't know about this brand so it's good to spread awareness for those of you who tried canna clear let me know your opinions in the comments down below you know did you have a good experience where'd you get it from did you get it from the club but just be aware you know that there are fakes out there and that's the thing when it comes to fakes you know it really just makes you paranoid it's kind of like this whole coronavirus thing where you don't know who has it you know and I don't know it's just just be aware guys you know I'm not saying all of them are bad but like I said there's fakes out there what raw garden is kind of different because raw garden if you go to a legit Club you don't have to worry about fakes at all you know so I know some dispensaries have had fake cartridges and I would assume that those dispensaries were either non licensed dispensaries or that they were just ignorant to the fact that maybe they just bought stuff thinking that it was real you know but like I said can I clear it's crazy it's dangerous you know I'm saying can it clear it's a very dangerous fake black-market cartridge because like I said it is it looks legit you know it really does but like I said the box shape is still the same as database very same [ __ ] all you're gonna see pink oil I mean need i say more oh yes I'm gonna take a sip of this t be aware of can of clear guys okay so if you enjoyed the video or if this helped you in any way you know please feel free to like it if you want you know I'm saying but other than that have a nice day [Music]",

cartridges this one's a girl ugly number 4 this one is Sour Diesel this one oh [ __ ] I can't remember what it was it was something else originally smoked at all pop the cap off refilled it with a blueberry old gene from - bacon so the last thing in here was blueberry OG and all I did was I went to a shop in California oh my god this thing is by THC clear this one is a Private Reserve so it's 30 dollars a gram to distillate this is true OG I got a couple other ones and all I do is pop this thing off is unscrewed and then all you do is pop this thing off without squirting it all over the place all right hopefully doesn't look down on me so all I do from here is I slowly squirt this [ __ ] in and you don't really know how hard it is to do until you film and try and do it but hopefully fill in the camera you just got a drip this [ __ ] slow in here not down this tube but down the side of it up the tube is where your vapor goes on these brass knuckles so you don't want to fill that thing up with oil because then you'll just suck a whole bunch over the lots on V plural that is alright so syringe empty true OG and then now I got a field brass knuckle and just stick this thing right back on [Music] you just got to make sure that when you're twisting it that it's everything's flushed sometimes you'll get it fresh out of the container and it's not really flush and some of the liquid will act not like it some of your you know your concentrate will leak out I've gotten a couple with this [ __ ] not really centered and some liquid has escaped not a whole bunch to [ __ ] about but enough to get the concerned about alright so I just filled this bastard up now let's see if she works I mean I know sure were three point seven two point seven max 3.7 if you're going bolts you know for the lowest and then for your highest on Watts it's e if I'm not mistaken it's on the Box use a Chico so I got this [ __ ] at this I usually take about three three four to five second hint and she weeks", "5r7-z1DRz1o": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another fake cartridge video this was actually part 2 and I give a shout out to my boy Christian who actually requested this video you know I feel like when someone requests a part two of a video I'll try and do my best to provide that for him and also I'd like to shout out my 15 members you know I haven't shouted them out in the video lately so for all 15 of you thank you I'll post them right here and all that stuff but getting on to the main topic of this video is fake cartridges obviously you know there's many fake cartridges that have basically just faked from a real company you know we got raw guard and brass knuckles all that stuff and every now and then you get other companies that just come out nowhere that may have been legit kinda cleared I mentioned in my first part video and then another one where one of you guys mentioned that there's another card called Lions breath something popped up in my reddit and for another thing when it comes to fake cartridges and you're very unsure of if you have a real one or a fake one just look it up online and ready is a very very good source for basically anyone uploading their opinion on the cartridge so it's easy to find if these cartridges are faked or being faked QR codes are fake or whatever but the other car in question is called Lions breath and these look pretty legit too QR codes holographic stickers all that [ __ ] and it's very hard for people to tell if that's legit or fake and honestly in my opinion I haven't seen that it like near me I haven't heard of Lions breath until I made that other video on the fake cartridges so I feel like it's my duty and other cannabis content creators to make videos spreading awareness on you know all the fake cartridges that are possibly out there so we can say hopefully save someone's lungs from permanent damage you know I'm not saying they're all bad but when there's so many fakes out there is it really worth the risk you know and this is not this is like he's like counterfeits and fakes aren't like you know if Louie Vuitton or fake then you buy something it doesn't affect your health you know it doesn't even affect your bank account as much as a buying a real Louie Vuitton would you know that's why people buy fakes but when you talk about fake cartridges this is something that we consume that we ingest so it's a very real possibility that maybe you might get permanent damage smoking nice you know backyard cartridges you know and I want to spread awareness on this as much as I can you know I don't really but I like making these videos but I feel like it's my duty as a cannabis content creator to make videos like this so that the public is a lot more safe when it comes to purchasing just anything cannabis you know I feel like I want my channel to be where like people will go to to find legit products just have a good time in smoke you know and hopefully I'm getting close to that goal every day you know I try and you know every now and then I try to make these videos you know and like I said Christian Torres requested a part too so I'll do my best to do it this is not going to be the only video uploaded today this is going to be the first video uploaded today and then I have another UFC video from like a week or two ago that I want to upload so yeah definitely stay tuned for that this is not gonna be the only video you know as much as these videos are important I know that not everyone watches them you know they'd much rather prefer like a smoke session or a vlog so I got you two videos today but this one's gonna be the first one because I feel like this is very important I should really get it out there and yeah shout out to Christian be aware of Lions breath carts you know I'll post it right here this [ __ ] looks pretty legit holographic sticker all that stuff but in that reddit post that came up it said that it was probably the worst tasting cartridge that he's ever had so just you you know as much as packaging influences your opinion on the product you still gotta be careful you know even though the packaging looks so [ __ ] legit you know you gotta be careful and best way to avoid you know getting fakes is to buy from a reputable dispensary if you're in a legal state I mean you didn't have to wait until you know cartridges are in your area but you know just be safe out there guys because permanent lung damage does not sound good you know saying so please if you guys have fake cartridges I'm not saying they're bad I'm just saying that there's a chance they could be bad you know there's a [ __ ] chance you know and it'll be pretty ignorant of you to say that there isn't a chance you know so just be careful other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video like I said there will be another video out today 4:15 p.m. peace out [Music] you", "Uteb-pE5OoI": "[Music]

storytime type [ __ ] I mean my life's been pretty [ __ ] hectic and I definitely haven't lived a [ __ ] normal average life my 26 years so you know I used to be hardcore drugs recovered from that [ __ ] it's working Universal and also when I was at Universal like my hair was kind of like Justin Bieber ish you know like flip it to the side type of thing and people were saying I look like Josh Peck from Disney Channel and like to the point where like little Brazilian tourists were cuz I worked at the Jurassic Park River adventure ride and whenever I would be doing the welcome back like welcome backs about her when I was doing that like the people would get on like oh my god [ __ ] your from Josh Drake Josh going what the [ __ ] I'm from no Drake Josh Johnson to get the good thing a ring wrong like nine from that [ __ ] bro like chill the [ __ ] out actually I actually did like I was like whoa see they wouldn't take no for an answer at first I was like nah man like no you're [ __ ] him [ __ ] I Universal your [ __ ] working this ride you're [ __ ] him and it was like three little Brazilian girls never like oh [ __ ] I know you know then I add a certain point they were like do you have a pen do the pen on line the [ __ ] after start applying to start going with it and my coworker was looking at me like what the [ __ ] are you doing why are you playing along with this show like shut the [ __ ] up [ __ ] so [ __ ] they go and I go to my [ __ ] thing I get a pen and then they're like sign me sign me and they were religious thinking I'm [ __ ] Josh Peck from Disney Channel I don't know if it's the double chin thing and the year I looked if you look at a picture there is similar features not him now in this day and age but when he was on Drake and Josh that [ __ ] my hair wasn't so long as [ __ ] but anyways arm like I was saying they get I get the pen and like oh my god so I add to one stomach one arm and the other like on a piece of paper and then they go to compare they go to compare the notes and they all look at it then they look back up at me and cuz like each signature is different cuz I didn't like know how to copy my [ __ ] saw was this [ __ ] they're like wow and they were like willing to let that shit's lie and they kept like oh [ __ ] and then after that they're like okay okay okay we're gonna tattoo what you just [ __ ] writ on us on our body I was like woah woah where's your mom [ __ ] like chill the [ __ ] out I'm not being liable for none of that my god so basically like they walked away very awkwardly and they took a photo with me so they probably had to find out the hard way when they go to brag get with their friends in Brazilian school wherever they go they probably are gonna figure out like their friends are gonna be like who the [ __ ] is that weird so basically that's probably gonna happen and so if that's that then [ __ ] you know what I'm saying but yeah that's just that's my story Universal if y'all want me to do like a story time type [ __ ] and making the second channel I'll do that you know I've been I haven't done the review for my exotic car I just simply like I know I have to do it bro for you

I didn't mean to make a long ass video there it is I'm done ight yeah great babe [ __ ] my showing it's 4/20 summer guys you guys take care I'll see you guys in the live stream in about five minutes peace guys", "VthK8TnAf3s": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] your was popping is your boy mr. THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "qvv7PvVPbqE": "alright guys we

gram cartridge and it is a dis oolitic co2 extracted cannabis oil very very high quality let me go ahead and show you the cartridge itself very pretty pretty pretty golden cartridge golden oil and we're going to go ahead and take it out and we're going to give this bad boy a whirl my my cart maya my batteries are all charged up cars them yesterday when I picked up this thing I got the I'm gonna put this down for a second don't worry screwing in the cartridge while the point said my closet all right here we go we have it screwed on here nice and good I have it set on a three point eight is where I like mine set voltage wise and like I said we're going to go over again key lime pie is the strain bait met is the manufacturer Joey dad's is the one you want to hit up let's try it out oh yeah oh oh man oh that hit like a DAB Oh has that definitely that distillate co2 taste words where the flavors not strong but it rests in the back of your throat and it's like a sweet taste has a

awesome I guess it does have a good flavor it's really really good flavor-wise I get I mean to dis lit so I'm a giver like a like a nine I mean with this lit because they are you know they're more reintroducing the terpenes after they extract the oil it's always going to be a fainter kind of lighter taste but like what you like like you might not have that strong earthy green taste but you get like a much more concentrated of THC level and a bigger hit you know so at least that's you know the tale of the tape as we speak and something is really really good like I said for the price it's a really great deal um I don't really know if there's much more to say like I said yeah I want to say that's uh that's the ticket honor she's uh they've got more more they've got tons more flavors like

of pounds of marijuana and thousands of vape cartridges containing thc the ingredient that causes the high only on news 5 bob jones says the case all started with one citizen's complaint the tip to police came in 2019 and centered on dream hemp store once known as bubba dubba's vape shop on east helmand avenue in akron they called the narcotics unit and said hey these people are selling drugs it looks like candy they're selling it to anybody who comes in can't do that according to a federal criminal complaint an investigation centered on demarco jones akron detective david guerrero says jones was supplying the store with illegal drugs jones and other men including tyrone keith and george may face federal charges the complaint says jones even posted video of himself on social media flashing a large stack of money a bag of marijuana and claimed to have his weed license he was also manufacturing cereal containing thc gummies containing thc he was taking raw marijuana and distilling it getting wax out of it or liquid thc the investigation grew and last week eight locations in summit and stark counties were raided garrow says the hall included a bunch of cash several guns 700 pounds of raw marijuana 400 pounds of edibles and get this more than 20 thousand cartridges containing thc all told more than a ton of marijuana products were seized garrow believes it's the largest case of its kind for akron police in fact when we did the race the biggest problem we had was finding enough police vehicles to transport all the all the seized drugs garrow says when it comes to manufactured marijuana and thc vapes there is a serious potential danger because the user doesn't know what's in it you can sell hemp and hemp product but by ohio law hemp has got to have less than .3 percent thc content this is higher than that garrow says no one from the vape shop has been charged but the investigation is ongoing in akron bob jones news 5.", "32RPrE4tD3g": "[Music] hey oh sorry Birds welcome back to another video welcome to state ladies 0 for 20 where we talk everything for 20 related and other content as well such as vlogs I'm going to talk about how we brought our Courage's pass through TSA and on the plane I know a lot of you guys go to festivals as well and you guys have to travel and you guys want to bring your cartridges with you but you can because you guys may think that you guys will get busted get arrested because there's dog at the airport and the TSA is the TSA officers will probably pull you outside because it is a federally illegal drug still I'm gonna tell you guys how we brought our encourages with us we went to three recent events that we had to travel for any of the year we just came back from decadence Arizona also empty EDC Las Vegas we just came back last week from EDC Orlando Sullivan to three recent events this past year I won like I'm pretty sure you guys all want to bring those couragous with you wherever you guys travel to all those three events that we went to brought Courage's with us all the time they DC Orlando we actually brought takes courage a total on to a sport and our check-in bags and to honor carry ons one each when we still had a battery but we disconnected it and place it somewhere else in our bags Salar you guys probably thinking is I want to bring them because the dogs they detect for bombs and you know explosives more than for 4/20 so going through TSA we put in our bags basically and we make sure you guys disconnect the cartridges the cartridge from the battery just because you know they don't really see it together and having disconnect having disconnected it's just a lot safer for you and if they ever pull a spool aside and ask you what it is you can just say it's CBD they can really test for it and how I'm pretty sure they won't waste their time calling the feds if you just have personal use of cartridges on your best bet just bring two or three cartridges on your carry-on or you guys want to put in your checking bags leaving it in the pockets I guess in your clothes so there's other ways just don't bring too much just bring up your personal amount whenever you guys travel or wherever you guys travel to they don't really care and just don't vape in the airport I guess - and in the plane anywhere in the airport I guess and in the planes so you don't get busted and wherever you are traveling - you have your cartridges with you if they are gonna pull you outside and TSA is gonna say they're gonna confiscate your encourages and the worst thing I guess is they're gonna users gonna get cited for a get a ticket from the officers there at the airport - to travel with cards all the time you never got busted bring a personal mouth you guys are planning to bring like bongs your smart bombs or if you or your bongs and you just have a DAB can you guys gonna bring that everywhere as well make sure it's clean leave it in your checking bag TSA is gonna open it might be a bomb they opened our bags were meant to EDC Las Vegas in Las Vegas this past year and we had nothing in there we just have to bring our bombs that we we clean just in case they might detect like flour or something but yeah we use that and use our dab cap as well thank you guys for watching I hope this video helps you guys for you guys next travels safe travels and then comment down below these experiences bring cottages on the plane or whenever wherever you guys are traveling to or if you guys done this after watching this video comment down below and let me know how it went and if you guys don't subscribe

that for medicinal purposes vaping at lower than normal temperatures can produce a more enjoyable therapeutic experience [Music] for generations it has been assumed that the only way to enjoy weed is to light the flower on fire and inhale the smoke while this is obviously the preferred method for some the fact is that combustion often results in an overkill high that produces thc induced stress anxiety and even paranoia did you know for example that both thc and cbd are activated at less than 360 degrees fahrenheit when considering that a lighter can combust weed at well over a thousand degrees it makes sense that combustion often results in undesirable overly intense effects you might think of it like trying to use a full-sized axe to split a toothpick doable but not exactly efficient well-made vaporizers on the other hand can easily operate at temperatures below 400 degrees fahrenheit while avoiding combustion of the flower which results in harmful smoke that's inhaled into the lungs these relatively low temperatures still allow one to experience the complete therapeutic range of medicinal cannabis therapeutic terpenes like limonene pinene and mercine for example are all activated at temperatures below 400 degrees and are all naturally occurring cannabinoids like cbn and thcv in other words using a high quality vaporizer that allows you to control the temperature can result in a much more mild high as well as a potentially enhanced medicinal experience furthermore many companies are now manufacturing portable vapes such as the pax 3 or davinci iq that can be used with both dry flour and oil concentrates these state-of-the-art devices allow you to not only get high but also to customize your overall cannabis experience in order to achieve the exact effects that you're looking for have any additional thoughts about low temperature vaping be sure to share them in the comments below you", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my

"F-a7ovTFozc": "what's up guys it's bud here from MJ geeks calm and today tonight I'm gonna be doing a review of this product bait cartridge I got from vape indigo dot-com actually they sent it to me to review the cartridge I'm showing here is not the cartridge they sent me the cartridge they sent me was CBD flour extracted from the strain called juicy fruit from CBD hemp hemp direct and unfortunately I don't have it anymore because I went out Saturday night to a a show and forgot I had it in my pocket and I took it and I just they were like why you could go walk back to your car but I just didn't do that so I figured I mean I and I really did give it a good I would have done a review sooner but I really wanted to test it out and and I feel like I'd probably used about half of it and that's enough for me to know you know enough to review it so alright so let's get into it um I guess I'll try and go through the you know the small and cool thing about this stuff is there is no smell really and this is this is the benefit to me and I'm sure to a lot of others of cartridges when you're comparing it to flour or any anything else I mean edibles are definitely gonna get this too but if you compare the smell of using a cartridge like this to the smell of using a vaporizers like this the smell of this is gonna be like a 10 and this one is gonna be like point like seriously not a one but like a point zero one very very I mean this you might get a faint faint hint of smell when you're using a cartridge like this for a minute just for a second but it wouldn't it won't linger and you cannot you could honestly be I always tell people this you could be in cubicle at work you know and like a super fancy company and you could be using one of these things every you know hour so and no one would ever know like you just have to make sure to blow the vapor so that it would not be seen like you blow it like slowly or if I don't want anyone to see my vapor I'll usually just take a big puff and just blow it out little by little inhale it a little bit again blow it out again just blow it into my shirt whatever you do that's the advantage of this and that's also you know set since there's such an advantage to it I'm gonna say the demand for these is gonna be higher therefore they're gonna cost more so you're gonna pay more for something like this if you just compare the price per milligram of CBD but you know you also have to take into consideration that you're getting this hardware which is disposable and you're getting basically convenience is what you're getting so alright so there's no smell right what about there's no bug qaulity obviously I mean yeah there was about quality I had this but it was nice quality it smells really good but yeah that doesn't really I'm not really gonna pay attention to that for this review but let's see the next would be how about vaping taste the taste was really nice really free really sweet really it really tastes resonating I mean I almost to explain it but this is the pure resin from the plant so it tastes a lot like cannabis that's the cool thing about it is it tastes a lot like cannabis but when you you you get the taste and all that but the smell doesn't stink up the room right so they thing is really nice it's just very easy on the lungs it's yeah very curious I think I mean I still know for sure what this is mixed with but if I have to guess I have to say that it's mixed with them either glycerin or PG oh no it says there are no delusion such as PG PG I did it I don't know it's co2 extracted um maybe it's got like yeah whatever props to them and then the thing I was waiting for the reason I didn't review it right away is cuz like you know I pulled this thing out first thing when I got it and tried it and of course it tastes amazing but I've been trying to make these things for several months now on my own because it's awesome to me this is like that this is this is kind of what I'm going for it's like the easiest way to consume for me so I wanted to make it myself cheaply and my problem I kept running into is I'm not able to get pure enough the product into these cartridges so you get it in there and it works for you know a day or sometimes in a few days but eventually there are so many impurities in mine that it starts to gum up the workings here so this is the the coil here and it's attached to electricity right here and basically what happens is this part gets really hot inside of here it's like a ceramic coil in most cases it's really hot and starts to boil the resin which races produces vapor and that's it so when the product is impure you get gunky stuff in here it ends up getting clogged it ends up leaking through into your battery it's gross so like I said I used this I really really worked worked it I can say like I really had some hardcore sessions with it I guess and I'm asked to say that but I got a really tried to get it to gum up basically because I suspected it might honestly I thought like how did they do this yeah like I'm some sort of expert but didn't do that very clean burning very good product only thing I wish they would do is do more strains honestly please do more strings these are really good so and I'm happy to review any more that you want to send me so thank you so much for sending this and if you guys want to check it out it's vape indigo calm yep alright guys I hope this was really helpful and I will talk to you in the next one I should hopefully I'll have some more reviews coming up soon and I'll get them out to you what I do alright so talk to you guys our next one thanks", "nqT_otOuUnM": "what's going on guys welcome to the deaf connection and today we're gonna be telling you the difference between real authentic and fake serial cards so before I even say anything about this I just want to say quickly about the company there's no like telling if this is even a legit company to begin with so there's like no information to be found on them online the only thing I did find was an Instagram account but it's private so you can't see anything at all and apart from that dang creeps show them a lot in their Instagram accounts so like if not every day every other day they'll be posting sharing cereal carts and a lot of people know cereal cars by 10 faves actually but with that being said because they're unknown if they're legit or an authentic company in the first place they could be fake overall but we're still not too sure and um we did encounter like this is a legit when a supposedly quote-unquote real one and we did get fake ones we knew we noticed right away so the first indicator to tell if they're fake was not packaging so check this out the one in the right is fake right this one's fake or this one's real this one's real the one that has oil in it or distal is fake and look maybe a little hard to see but if it's a little difficult to tell the one in the right has a lot more holograph like a holograph package to end appointing left doesn't at all so hey let me show you the back actually so you can see a little better yeah I don't know if you could tell from this video we look at that on the logo or says serial cards to see how the one in her eyes a lot more shinier than the left so that's a huge indicator right away both of these cartridges are plain looking like bland that you could say they have no shine or hologram to it whatsoever so that's the main indicator a another one is the coloring the packaging so if you take a look this one's actually a lot more lighter the cereal itself is a lot more lighter than this one like this one's a darker stronger color not darker but stronger color so just a really light faded go6 internet so scrunch one so with that with a packaging excuse me with the packaging you can tell that right away but you could also tell with the cartridge itself so the serial card stands beeps and all of those companies they use authentic cecil cartridges and this thing you can actually tell this um with this you could tell if they're fake with dankmemes c or any other cards that you see sell cartridges but okay let me show you and another thing the oil is a sometimes the oil will be really really dark or really light make a strong clear gold color it usually it it should always look like this actually like with these fake ones the oil looked exactly the same so and they're not like too dense to quality oh and i've had to tell you another thing to notice is the taste so the every single car should taste literally exactly the same as this whatever the strain is these ones didn't taste nothing like the cereal itself it just tastes like artificial chemicals and flavors and vapors pretty much it wasn't strong but it was it was a light taste too but it still don't say it's that good so another indicator to tell is if they're authentic cecil cartridges check to so it's a little hard to tell if you can see that this only says Cecil it's just say all three stems here I'll show an image right now but it's just say all three stamps the case stamp see so and a see a stem and apart from that they should all have a the same font style they shouldn't be a different different color and misplaced or different font sizes or anything like that they should look exactly like the one that shown an image right now so yeah those are the main indicators to tell there's legit or even if they are legit legit cereal carts so you know a lot of fake vendors are something a lot of Chinese manufacturers are selling these things so alright before I let you guys go I'm on let me just show you really quick how this hits well you can see anything I'm Trevor yeah not very sad anything at all but those smoke is really light another thing I realized with these fake off and not been sexy cell cartridges the atomizer is weak so I have one pointers I was actually collecting a lot of reclaim up here I switched the batteries to a stronger stronger battery and it didn't go away but yeah those are how to had identify the fake serial cards if you guys ever encountered these have any information about them at all please post them in the comments below I love hearing about this and hope to see you guys soon see you later guys", "264xzqPGupk": "[Music] Hey so I'm here again with the new cartridge lit from lid extracts it's a kool-aid flavor vaping on this for a little while now trying it out not bad don't really have anything bad to say about it except for definitely not the most potent that I've had for the best flavoring at least this one but it's a good flavor it's not too overpowering which is nice okay so I've been trying to figure out how to do a review on the litt extract pens but uh I guess it's just gonna be sweet and simple the lick cartridges are pretty good not the most potent that I've had but definitely definitely a good one yeah I like their cartridge I like to set up it's pretty good it's nice I don't know yet how well it works on my back but I'm definitely feeling lifted so that's so at least I know it's potent we'll see how it works with everything so to round it up the lit pens are nice I like them they're not the most potent that I have had but they're definitely good so definitely like these pens that support them so it does seem to be working on my back as well it's not the most potent like I said before so it's not working the best but it is working so it does get you lifted and it does seem to be working on my back for my opinion so I give this one thumbs up", "5ndyQLqo3Y4": "what's happening party people we're here and I want to beep so odd as it sounds sounds weird coming out of my mouth usually it's I want to dad I want a bong hit one babe all of our faith cartridges are like dunzo check this out they're like it looks like there's something inside but there's nothing inside these I mean I could probably get like little baby hits but they're done I've been sucking on them dry bro like all of them we are out so the revival vape actually comes with empty hive cartridges you guys can see here and you just pop it open take this little thingy off and you can just pour your concentrates in there man simple as that so we're gonna take this syringe of beta my cream and we're gonna make a little vape syringe or vape cartridge with the syringe this is from nectar stick interesting people we see them at all the events they're always there pitching their stuff they sell these full grams in this container for $40 at the events it's probably gonna run you 50 or 60 out of dispensary but this one specifically normally they have like kind of ap flavors like strawberry cough and mango passion this and whatever I asked the guy what do you have for pain and it gave me this it's a ante what does it say pain relief sedative now actually that's upside down sorry guys now I actually hit these people up on Instagram because I was at the event you know I didn't necessarily get the proper explanation of the product you know it wasn't really the kind of place that you sit and you [ __ ] talk science and chemistry about cannabis and [ __ ] but I instagrammed them when I was like hey man I bought your Batum mersin I did I call it Mike Green earlier sorry mersin I bought your beta Mersin and I was curious I mean is this made with cannabis does this contain THC or CBD you know give me some give me some info about this all I have is the package and the package isn't too descriptive either zero PPM's solvent free ultra refined nothing doesn't tell you like percentages doesn't tell you anything so I'm curious like is this a pure I guess I should have explained it if you guys don't know with what beta mercian is I check it out on wiki because that's basically how I learned what it is it beta mercian is basically a component in cannabis it's like a terpenoid it's one of the things that are a part of the we'd like THC CBD CBN THC a all of those get you high and then there are actually compounds that give you flavor like limonene citrus scene or something lemons this is the citrus one hash machine there are a couple of different flavor compounds and these compounds are found in everything I could find citrus or limonene in limes I can find that in oranges I can extract it from those you know and it's also found in cannabis that's why some weed smells like oranges some weed smells like smoke it's are like smoke because you've spoken it some weed smells like like dirt and like earth you know like it literally has the same chemicals they're in those other things so this is one of those chemicals and if you smoke this chemical by itself or not smoke it but you know consume it it's supposed to make you feel relaxed sedative it's supposed to make you sleepy it's supposed to be a good anti and Kalama tori it's it's got a bunch of qualities you can read them all on the on the wiki so I got this and I was like man this should be excellent for medicating and then I had a realization where I was like isn't this the same [ __ ] that they have in mangoes that everybody says gets you higher if you smoke it or if you consume it so if I'm smoking like a really low grade weed or even if I just want to get higher supposedly if I eat a mango it's high in the Mersin and that is what gives me like a bigger high so I was like man this would be excellent for a cush Buster's or something where I'm like [ __ ] eating mangoes I'm literally gonna go to a scientist have him extract the Mersin give it to me straight up and I'll test it for you guys and I'll be like I'm gonna smoke a gram of this shitty weed and then take a hit of the mercy and and see if it helps then I'm gonna take a hit of the top shelf with the Mersin and see if that improves the hit as well and then do like control test like this is awesome so we're just gonna stick this in here like a mad scientist and just fill it up I want to I use it up I use half of this I want to leave some for dabbing but or just see if it even works let's just use less let's see if it even works you don't want to put all of your nugs in one basket you know what I'm saying I lost a little stopper there's like a little shirt oh there it is it's so tiny put the stopper in I guess I think I went the other way whoops got it all weedy so cool we do that and we're good to go let's try it out I've been smoking it I took it home you guys and I was like let's get [ __ ] up like we went to the event and it was like a marijuana edible sesh and if you guys watched the the podcast if you guys haven't seen it it's the podcast from the weekend of like May 14th May 15th like that and we talked about how we got trapped in the elevator we almost died going to like a weed event and if I get to the weed event and I don't even get to smoke that much or like get that high so I came home and I was like man I'm gonna take a huge hit and I literally smoked like a fifth of it at once and it was a immense hit it was super clean super flavorful particularly for the size usually you take a huge dab of something and it's really rough like it just it kills your lungs it's like it leaves you wheezing but it was super clean and a him Ian waves bro it was like at first like you kind of you feel a little bit after the initial hit but it doesn't like hit you and then like a couple minutes later you start you feel like almost like a wave hit you and like you feel like more buzzing more like higher and more relaxed and then like five minutes later boom like another wave a couple minutes later like another wave and eventually like after 15-20 minutes I was like oh gone I was just like laying in the couch like dunzo really nice I mean I smoked the point point to grammar but let's try it out I'll see how if it works cross your fingers for me I hate wasting weed drum roll please nothing I have to take the thingy out these thingies have the thingy the cartridges have the little stopper so I don't necessarily have to take the stopper out and it's hot I can feel it at the base it's just not it's not doing anything I'm glad I didn't put more one more time get in there get in there I think it's just so thick that it's having a hard time vaping it we're getting there we're getting there has a really good flavor to it it tastes it tastes very similar to the pickled monkey cartridges that we received I think they're using like a similar solvent free filler pretty sure now it's ripping brah brah it's ripping oh yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I cannot tell you guys if it has THC or not in it I I can't offer the life let me tell you I would like to tell you that it doesn't and that I am smoking a pure beta Mersin and that this is simply the the effect of that because it almost feels a little different from a high when I take a big hit of this and I take a big hit of weed the high sit separately from each other if you know what I'm saying like one of them I like I know is like weed and on the other once it's like distantly in the back affectingly me very differently I don't know I wish they would get back to me on Instagram yo I hate when companies are like secretive about their process and like the products that they're giving you I'm literally [ __ ] smoking this and putting it in my lungs how about you [ __ ] tell me what's in this bro like people who make food have to literally list ingredients legally and that people who have these [ __ ] smokeable products don't even have to [ __ ] lab test it or anything it's crazy it was like a graphic the other day going around a mean and it was a I don't know the character name he's like a famous like character actor he has a curly hair he's like blonde and it's like um you have you notice you ever noticed how there's no more powdery mildew anymore ever since everybody to learn how to make concentrates and it was like like that [ __ ] like man you never know what you're putting into your lungs anymore you know like they could just take any weed they want run it and it just looks golden and good you know and unless it actually gets tested by a lab or something I'm not gonna know if it's safe or not to smoke so I hate when companies are like [ __ ] shady about [ __ ] like [ __ ] tell me bro like what the [ __ ] like I'm gonna go steal your process and whatever like as if there are like 10 other companies do right now how about you just be honest with your consumer base and let them know what they're literally smoking bro what strain is in this what am i even smoking is this even weed these are my questions I think they're fair I don't know but it's pretty far I ask these questions I semi complain but also smoke it also smoking I purposely did this one just so that I know I knew that I wouldn't necessarily waste the weed as much because I feel like big cartridges are more efficient than like dabbing like when you dab you just some of it burns away maybe it's too high temp of a dab like you're literally electronically controlling the temperature with the vaporizer so I feel like it's more efficient and what was my point with that right I wanted a lot of smoke because I'm actually doing a product shoot over there and I'm actually doing shots where like there's products all laid out and then I blow smoke and like smoke comes into the frame and like you know [ __ ] high production [ __ ] and it's actually been really hard to make like volumous smoke I literally that's why I have the illa Delft over here I was gonna pack a bomb hit for the shoot because I've tried vaping I've tried using is it here I tried using the dryer vape and I even tried taking a DAB and unless I took like a huge dab I couldn't get a significant volume of smoke so like look impressive enough on the screen so I have to pack some flowers bro into the old illy and start ripping I thought this would be it but it makes clouds but now I mean look at the size difference I mean if this made clouds this big I'd be scared like what is in this what witchcraft did they like make this with some make it do that but still pretty fire I'm gonna go get the weed pack up a bowl and I'll see you guys next time on the daily grind thank you guys for joining me and let me know what you guys are smoking on in the comments man you guys rocking a vape pen vape cartridge have you ever refilled one of these before do you make your own eliquid I think a couple of followers have mentioned in the past that they do their own like pg/vg mix or some [ __ ] like let me know in the comments I am really new to the whole vaping world so I am very curious to hear what people's personal preferences are particularly after they've had a consistent career token it up contouring on the vape level you know what I'm saying I'll see you guys next time stay regularly", "aiWVkxPev7A": "[Music] all right so I just got this thing to like hold my phone there's a [ __ ] Center people

Sid to sleep cartridge lap tested high potency pesticide free whatever the strain I have right now it's an apology the oil right now I just got it done preheating it because I was ready to record but there was just a [ __ ] so people I wrong that's why I like stopped but yeah this is the oil and awfully proud what I like about this cartridge it's that when like you do get high it's like a really clean hi I like that and as you can see the oil it's a really good quality oil um what I don't like about this cartridge though is that if I put it too tight on my battery like if I put it all the way so it doesn't move or anything it just doesn't work on my battery as you can see I press it and he just blink I'm gonna take one hit and then I'm gonna go buy food I think I'm gonna get a tropical

more sorry about that beyond chapter the winds of winter god I love me some george RR martin another thing I like is liked about that we put some light on this okay and he's heard blood that be light and there was and it was good so how you guys doing how you been what you doing huh long time no see ah that's quite been there since yesterday well as you can see we've had a change of venue that's a sore subject so I'm not really gonna get into that right now well what I am gonna get into is a review of these new pens that I've been trying to know that are freaking amazing hold on a second I'll show you what I'm talking about now I have chance to grab a hold of some [Music] Mario Kart pens these are all-natural lab tested no PG nope EEG no VG I guess it's like vegetable oil on other things that give you like popcorn long stuff like that no contaminants or pesticides detected in compliance with prop 215 section below do not drive or operate heavy equipment keep out of the reach of children unlawful to redistribute alright so as you see we have three different flavors well they're not really flavors these actually what I love about these bins is they're strange specific these are not flavors added to it it just uses a really cool picture to advertise the actual strength so for the fire oh gee you can see here there is Bowser yeah Bowser right I believe it's Bowser yeah Bowser sorry it's been a while so I played Mario and this I mean they'd say Mario karts but obviously this is Donkey Kong if you can see that is that brain you see it here my mother did is it I don't know I'm kind of curious about I know it's like gorilla glue like the actually like this like this yeah I didn't still in the garage in case you were wondering it's just a really fancy garage yeah so on the gorilla glue kind of curious on what that substance is there that he's squishing is a really gorilla glue or is it go real like a loop you know um as I am and finally we have Weaver huh weird he went on the wheat we already did this one sorry and finally we have Wario and he is the brand in case you cannot read that cookies the breed should I say cookies so we have fire og as Bowser to get [ __ ] up on that one gorilla glue as Donkey Kong a gorilla fitting and wah do his cookies which happenstance gorilla glue and cookies are hybrids and fire oh gee is it indica yeah so let's get the show on the road we are starting with the fire og takes your wondering what kind of battery I'm using is an eye stick power I've had it for like two years and this thing is freakin amazing I mean I'm in a wheelchair I dropped this thing almost on a daily basis I've ran it over with my wheelchair like twice and this [ __ ] is still [ __ ] kicking oh and you can run it way down and use these small refillable the refill pins and you'll lock you lock it right cuz I've learned to hear these up on accident then I got like figure out I'm going to use a syringe like draw the little I'll put it another one that's still working so if you do get one of these make sure you lock it on like three to five dip it in our pop pop you like your quill but that's what's three point three watts is what I got and that's to get a good flavor and what I'll do is I'll turn it up to like a 3c I got a lot I got unlucky then over it up to like 3 8 or 3 9 relock it cuz you don't wanna burn the coil up especially when you got money invested in the oil that's in there and need the medicine hmm yeah you get a lot more oh yeah that's a good stuff I'll always have loved fire oh gee though and this really does taste like the breed um this is probably good you see how much I've been swimming around it's probably gonna be one of my favorites oh yeah bookshelf I like to keep like memorabilia and stuff some knives for grandpas to supply that look at this freakin bowie knife right here I just inherited sadly lost the grandfather recently and almost had a little breakdown but we're doing good now my grandma gave me this I have a matching one from my grandfather k-bar I had a handle I don't know to match this one so it's like a matching samurai said you know like but it's an American bowie knife and k-bar right doesn't get much better than that right you want a bar lover quick story then each point is that each one of these were the possessions of each of my grandfather's that one was my grandfather the cowboy and moonshiner and general alcohol you know to the day died you mean when he was not long I took home the CB handle outlaw you know imitating him and learning from him this is an actual Vietnam issue K bar that was used by marine in the field and I took it to a knife maker recently say knife maker that did that and uh this one I need to polish it up though it's a it's been sitting out in the shelf since got brass is corroded you know and then he had possibly it again this was blackened or gluten steel you know gun blued steel so it was black so he had to polish this thing for hours to get it any kind of shine out of it at all just good my grandpa had you know God blue did so many so many times over the years to keep it from rusting um sadly I've lost both my grandparents but I have these two minutes to remember them by into your mortal lies my thoughts on them sitting on my bookshelf playa visualize them and see them remember them every day that's the way they should be if you leave this world and people don't remember you then you didn't make an impact so I feel like by not remembering my campus or memorializing them on our bookshelves we we are forgetting them and leaving them in the past yeah I'm getting a little motion let's go back to the testing ah gorilla glue this was for you grandpa the general outlaw and the moonshiner yeah I tell you a funny story yeah I was like 10 to 12 years old you know almost old enough to know better we were in the hug Club and we would go down to the woods even that come on with me grandson we're gonna go water some tomato plants I always was wondering like what the hell are these tomato plants doing way the hell out in the woods away from the damn farm you know like away from the farm the farm house and not even really on our property just property where our cows were allowed to graze just think it was a state land actually he's dead now so you know who cares I'm confessing to a crime that I committed when I was a teenager and had no idea that it was even a crime until I was thirty right okay so long story short or water in these these these tomato plants and after about six months you know I asked my grandpa why don't these tomato plants ever produce any tomatoes and what the [ __ ] are those things on top of them and then he he told me the gig but he didn't tell me the gig but I don't really remember what he told me I'm just no subverted he probably wouldn't think he probably took me his store bought me ice cream like subverted my brain waited from that right good job grandpa because it took me a long time to figure it out I love you but uh you know he he was a man beyond his years and in thoughts and ideas and the way people you know that's why it became a bootlegger because he thought that it was wrong that they took this thing away from us that we had so all of our lives it was like air or water you know you can't take alcohol away from somebody when it's so readily available we can't take a plant from the way so money but it's so readily available all over the planet you can grow it anywhere you could make alcohol anywhere you can you know it's not like they they couldn't stop alcohol during Prohibition and they're not going to stop marijuana in the modern time if if they think they can they're stupid and if you think that they can you're stupid because the clear evidence of all the thirteen seventeen states or whatever that of Divac be either decriminalized are completely legalized in three states that have made it recreational it is what we cannot have a country divided on the subject this is one thing that I think all Americans can stand together very easily and you know what it's really hard to think about war and all that when you're then a peace circle pass it around enjoy we pass around a peace pipe that's all I'm gonna say that's what I'm gonna end this on so do yourself a favor go sit down in a circle with your friends pass around a joint or a peace pipe and spread the love right because that's what we need to do to to get these laws enacted reacted changed whatever we want you know like to get the legalization of the recreational usage and the you know people who should have the right to use it with for religious purposes I'll completely empathize with the Rastafarians in every state in our country who cannot consume the like holy vessel of their church legally that is insane to me it's just a plan it's just the plan you know we need more more knowledge and forethought in this world our what is possible what we should imprison our people for and I wish a [ __ ] would tell me with my paralyzed self double amputees that I'm breaking the law this is my medication just as much as all of this all of this the doctors want you to take that crap shove it down your throat every goddamn day but then wouldn't you pop for a piss test they want to jump all over you and make you go to [ __ ] drug court or something you know it's insane what without world is coming to what a person in a wheelchair I'm just gonna right now what an individual paralyzed double an TT should not have to jump through hoops and and be treated like like a drug seeker or or a junkie would they go to doctors for help and that's the truth that's my experience", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "p85mq4hkK4A": "[Music] [Music] [Music]", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would hit this but it's it's so blatantly fake so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like comment subscribe more videos to come thank you for always being here shout out to everyone who saw my um ounce hot box in

so shout out to all you guys that were in there one more last rip and i'm out peace [Music] you", "8oCor9chuHg": "so what's up guys Katie would agressor lounge the newly formed company the grass skirt lounge and I have currently on the road so I do not recommend what I am doing for anyone to actually new but I wanted to actually do this video about this particular vape cartridge this concentrate that I got from a company call if you I don't know if you guys can make it up but it's called I know up or dining up of py in a diner puff and this is trainwreck this is a sativa I had Grandma bomb trainwreck this is 80 to 85% TAC so I haven't actually had a chance to blaze this so I can tell you guys what to expect from it so I'm actually about the low team up right now and find out what's good with him so just bear with me for a living to be a [ __ ] second for you guys so I got the Dyna puffs have grammage frame right here going it into some of the brezhnev of a pen like I say a lot of these countries are are universal or rather the brass knuckle bacon is universal so you can use this without a lot of the arm speaks with the foot of Brentwood the cartridge that are out there you know in standard so it's Universal so that's pretty cool right now let's go ahead and take off her phone [Music] when I first told pretty decent I'm trying to keep myself from gagging right now the taste tastes a lot oh okay so never fire me guys so I just discovered something new I just I just I just realized something them the taste now I'm noticing something with with the UH with the coil with the coil system versus the uh versus the week system the taste in the which system is different I'm trying to find a flavor that is comparable I don't know it's almost like candle wax a little bit if that makes sense in my mind it reminds me of candle wax I can't tell you the last time I actually tasted candle wet but it reminds me of candle wax if someone used to run it reminds me of wax not blanks that you small not the concentrate but actually candle wax I mean it was only it was a pretty decent old I may be tasting real clean though in fact it reminds me of the bridge system because the probe system is also the weak system and the flavors are very very from very similar and I'm wondering if the flavoring of these weak they're the ones with the wick hug delivery system if that is the reason why the flavors are so unlike is because the wind as opposed to the coil I don't know what are they copper coils as opposed to the coils that heat up and heat up just to concentrate it vaporize to concentrate you where is the wick is actually inserted in the concentrate you know what I'm saying and it's absorbed it concentrated its absolute Irwin and then heat it up and then think Ron's right so that process may have a lot to do with it but anyway so far so good take another talk I mean cram but I might come on from him okay now what I will say what I will say now because I had an option between this and the pure vapor this was about 20 bucks for the for the Dyna puffy the pure of fate in the dispensary I went into the feel of eight was about 25 bucks for a half a gram so I went with a twenty bucks because I actually went in there to buy flour and if you guys sold my last video where I have the way I've just grabbed the eighth and Lance print you know I got it grabbed I got a hop when I lands for it every chance I get mad because it's just [ __ ] bomb it's one of my favorites but excuse me but quick difference between the the Dyke that the what is it that the diner puffs now a little difference between the bloom the blue although they concentrates a pretty big now this this diner pub was thicker than the pure of eight one you know ended their constitute was a little bit thicker you notice a I wish wish to meet translates to it probably will last a little bit longer you know what I'm saying but what I noticed is though with the Dyna puffs versus the balloon cartridges now then now I would say that the plumes are a little bit thicker and sometimes it pays that have them like warmed up a little bit like I'm like for instance like I put I put my balloon joints on the dash of my car you know any heat from my car will I guess kind of loosen the wax up a little bit and make it easier to get a total good told me white hands with this one because the actual apparatus is different from the balloon was if you tell the the blooms have me up the removable plastic retainer whereas this is more like the high fly more than whereas another ones with the arm looked kind of the alloy tip connected to the to the reservoir to chamber when your arm concentrate is hell but um now again I'm not saying that it's better or worse than the probe system I'm just saying that the the wax is a lot easier to it's a little bit more than you sit so you first talk out of the box is probably going to be a pretty decent one and every consecutive before and every subsequent old from that point will probably be a lot you know a lot easier to get but I don't know man I like them all you know what I'm saying do I have a preference I would say I would say the coil did the core your system is preferable however this this is dying to pump man check them out man because if the prints we said they don't even know if they're gonna get any more these and I actually like their system because it was easy to take the talk about taking about the top right manages to show you how how good of a token is all the systems that I built save you see that was a that was a nice toke man it wasn't as hard to top that and can you get you know a nice amount of eights on that so this way I'm gonna end this video though I just wanted to introduce you guys to this new Dino puff dying up bacon well it may not be new to you guys but it definitely [ __ ] new to me but anyway that's all I wanted to do able to do a quick me few one then and I will see you guys in

delivery calm today I got for you guys the VVS all-in-one disposable vape pen these things are fantastic to say the least you've got the seal of approval from mr. Ben baller himself he's quality over quantity all day and you can tell by the production quality of his pens my favorite thing about these is that they use the C cell technology which is by far the

going to be smoking a half gram cartridge in one sitting I'm also gonna try and figure out how many hits are in one pod and that's pretty much the situation hard intro we're done let's get into the video right let's do it so what I'm going to be smoking today is going to be a dart pod I've been seeing these a bit more in the West Coast and they come with this awesome little C cell battery it look kind of like this it's orange my favorite color um concentrate from the brand evermore here in Maryland and I'm going to just pop this open then we're gonna get it started I got this in the strain gelato I don't really have any feelings about the strain gelato so I'm definitely gonna get closely acquainted to it in this video it's got a decent amount of mercy and limonene so it should be kind of sedating it hopefully wouldn't be too anxiety inducing despite it being sativa laning you know this is well so the box within a box that it comes with um very cute very wasteful and then I have just the triangle the weird solo triangle I'm gonna get up in your space real quick and show you what the pod looks like nice and cute this is what it looks like it's brand new still sealed and yeah this is what a dart pod looks like it's got a little evermore branding on it I love it pop this [ __ ] right in done couldn't take the plastic little seal out and then we're gonna get right into it let's do it just so you guys know if I'm looking down a bit I do have a counter up and ready cuz like I said I really want to know how many hits are in it I'm probably not gonna hold it up the whole time but I'm gonna show you guys a little bit throughout I hope you have a joint a blunt whatever it is that will tickle your fancy and get ready to wash my suffering let's do it Wow so we're coming out with the big ass hit I guess before I forget I'm gonna get close and getting a thumbnail but quick sorry I had to get my shots in real quick right now we are at eight hits so let's just keep it going let's stop dilly-dallying honestly this one definitely tastes not my favorite but like I said I'm not crazy about gelato I think it's a pretty basic pretty boring strain so I'm not crazy what taste either all right so that's 16 I saw on like the Moxie tart Instagram that I should in it kind of low and slow so let's try and do that and see what happens that was definitely less [ __ ] harsh Wow oh my god can I do this ya can do it do these clouds are like ridiculously huge for a baby I'm definitely starting to feel high god help me every time I think I forget I remember to hit the [ __ ] number down there so I'm at I think 29 if I'm wrong at the end I'm sure one of you will check me but right now I have 29 and I'm feeling pretty good should we do a pod check I'm scared that if I open it I won't be as far as I think I will but if I open it and I'm pretty far it's gonna be pretty motivating for me you know let's do a project let's do a pod check okay so I don't know if you guys can see that but I've got a hard bubble in there and from what I understand about this pod system it goes from here it being the distillate it goes from the bottom all the way to the very pretty much top right here I don't know if you can see that so I actually think I'm getting pretty far I think I might get another like 30 or 40 more hits out of this I'm kind of excited [Music] you guys I'm probably gonna crap out the coffee I just did but I'm dying but I'm gonna push do it for you I can't even look at myself right now cuz if I look they're all setting what I'm doing it myself and I can't I'm so Lake [ __ ] high right now we're at 40 in case I haven't updated you recently this is getting hard I want to take a break but I know I can't take a break is on that won't come back what I could really use right now is some water but like should that be a challenge in itself like no water like Buckham oh my god by the way I did see Mac fizzle originally trying to temp this a couple of months ago and it did inspire me to want to do it myself so this isn't very original I'm just gonna be honest but I did think it was cute so I am doing it [Music] I'm at what I think is 50 let's do a pond check and the suffering check while we're at it shall we I think I think we're gonna make it voice I really do god I hope we make it [Music] oh my nose is running [Music] [Music] that was my 69th day you can tell that she's almost kicked and we're at 73 and at this point it could be a little off so let's go 73 between 73 and 75 right now we're at [Music] I'm going through it I do a lot for you so you know be sure to thumbs that you know what I mean I'm looking for my glasses so I can really see the hell that I'm bringing upon my life by doing this okay I'm ready to do this I'm ready to finish this up for 82 let's do it [Music] made 200 it's gotta be towards the end oh my god oh my god you guys you guys it's almost empty I coffee decent amount but honestly he is pretty smooth considering that I just did a hundred hit doesn't want to feel like it boom it actually seems like I'm getting towards the gun I'm like really inhaling and nothing's coming out I think it's getting towards the end look I think we're pretty much done here I'll go like two more heads yeah I'm gonna call that a Duns oh so we are at final answer a hundred and ten give or take I'd probably say five to ten so let's to say a hundred and fifteen a hundred and fifteen hits to finish a typical dark pod system that was pretty cool shout out to Cecil for coming up with this new battery to enable this crazy awesome way better vape technology and shout out to ever more for being the first in Maryland to have it and for honestly being pretty good and that's pretty much it if you guys liked it be sure

you have experience with this company real or fake let me know let me know how it looks different from yours whether you think you think or know for a fact that yours is real it does have lab results I scanned it it brought me to the raw garden website except one thing one one little discrepancy I noticed the batch number I typed it in and it was for a different string it was not dojo cush but and then I typed in dojo Kush and I looked for the one gram one and it was like a two V two to three or something so I don't know if it was a typo that's mad weird what if it was fake why would they even put in the effort of putting a batch number that was two away from the real number why not just put the real number many questions you can pause that it and read that if you want to manufactured bang bang Best Buy bang 21 we're good ingredients you can let me try to get it you can pause that right there if you'd like to read that let's see Oh God a lot of writing composite right there if you would like to read that why they skipping spaces here I schedule 1 controlled Oh am i bugging contains cannabis like no spaces bro come on you're gonna turn the font-size down one the [ __ ] anyway eight hundred ninety six point four milligrams comes in this nice little childproof container here die here out of here I have chief Don this quite a bit as you can probably tell I'll get comments like bro your plug was hitting your [ __ ] it's like I I have to I have to hit it to review it some just some I hit a lot some I do not hit a lot but I've been decent I don't have any weird feelings about the cart itself even if it is fake I believe and normally live what's called raw Gardens usually clearer than most carts and that this is it looks more yellow on camera but this is clearer than most carts I've seen recently see if we can't get a nice like this so I think this I think this is legit it tastes very clean bro when I when I got this and I was like just named my car and like I left the room and came back and it like smell like weed so I thought that was kind of a good a good sign like it smells good and tastes good it tastes like tastes like bud has like a little bit of lemony I mean yes to it I would maybe if you if you're going to grab these I would definitely just scan it on the spot before you even grab it just scan that [ __ ] see if it brings you to a legit to the right and then you search up the batch make sure it brings up to the right batch you don't want to be smoking Bunco you need to stay safe especially now our lungs are particularly yeah at risk at the moment so make sure you're taking care of your lungs I am probably not gonna smoke any more of this just to stay safe but hope you guys enjoyed if you like this video I got a [ __ ] ton of videos just like it weed carts wax I also have a gaming channel [ __ ] forgot about that yeah peace out", "rxDSYh2bzuw": "welcome back to my channel today we're be talking about vaporizers specifically the Pat pen there's all different brands that you can get this is a pretty expensive one it was like 40 and then basically there's all different brands that you can get their range from about $6 up to I think I paid 40 for this one so this is just an instruction video I couldn't find one online of how to use a vaporizer or Pat pen with a button on it so basically you have your your battery here and there's a button and if you hold the button down that's when you should inhale when it gets to a certain point where the coils are heated it'll actually blink three times there we go so that means that the coil is ready to go that your draws basically done and you're ready to have another draw if you need one so basically that was a three buttons if this if you press this five times well maybe it's not doing it now there you go so it's two two presses and it'll blink like this and that's going to pre-heat your coil okay so after it's so now after it's pre heated you can go ahead and take a draw off of it and you get a much stronger hit when you do that of your oil all right well I hope this taught everybody something or help them out I'll see you on my next video", "tMC6AHZv5hk": "you can tell them one of these cartridges has a ton of filler in it the other one is pure just watch the bubbles as I flip them over yep so the nice clear one that's bubble is taking a long time as the pure stuff where the other one is pretty much just filler", "RdTC5g4B5Zw": "what up guys the grass skirt lounge boy fred and i am back with a new vape cartridge and vape pen review so this is a slim pen and thanks to the homeboys at the I'm sorry thanks to my homeboys at the UH at the grass ninjas for hooking me up with this now this right here is the cartridge that I'm smoking this is a half gram car cartridge this is uh let me see cuz there's a glare so I can't really see if you guys can see this or not let me see if I can put it in the focus and I cannot so um this is alaskan thunder this is a clear solvent free this is made by amber industries now I've been smoking on this all day and I gotta tell you some now I forgot to ask whether this was actually a I'm sativa or an indica but it seems to be more of a sativa than an indica I seem to be it could it could be a hybrid but I feel like I'm getting a sativa high from this because I don't feel lazy army is I'm feeling more of a mental high right now and it's real subtle to I'm not like completely like [ __ ] fried but as you guys can see the the actual cartridge the actual cartridge itself looks like looked like the Dyna puffs or the or the bloom cartridge oh wow oh no not the bloom because the bloom is different as the plastic tip with the with the wick inside but this looks like a lot like a diner puff cartridges though same type of apparatus got your arm your we tink string here and this is the slim pin now I still do have my brass knuckle even though I think I'm gonna need to replace that because I think the battery is bent has been dying a little too quickly but um this I actually like this um so far as price this is a lot cheaper than the breast brass knuckle um at least it would have been cheaper for me I don't know what the other the market value of it is but I know how much it cost to me but anyway now charging it the actual up can the actual connection for the for that for the kilt for the cable for the charge people for the USB plug cable is right at the bottom of this so you don't need an additional adapter to screw into the top like you do with the brass knuckles also this has three different settings also three different voltage settings so as is typical with which as standard with any vape pen or 12 battery you pressed it five times and it turns on I don't know if you guys can see the indicator light but it's glowing green I had it set to green green is the is the second highest voltage and you just basically press it three times I'm sorry if I'm not getting this in a shot like I said there's a glare so it's hard for me to tell now click the three times the blue it oh I turned it off actually now what's on my apologies I hope you guys sort of greenlight the indicator light so it's green now I click it three times and now it's blue the blue is the highest voltage at 3.8 so here the voltage rating readings on red is 2.8 green is 3.3 volts and blue was 3.8 volts so blue is the highest voltage and 1 2 3 and now it's so I'm red so I'm gonna take a puff from each one I've been hitting it all day from from each different setting so I can kind of gauge how big of a toke I'm taking which I actually like this is pretty dope so as you can see just a 2 3 second arm drag doesn't really unproduced a whole lot of smoke but I don't know how you guys failed with uh with uh with vaping but if it's some topknot some really good vape if it's a good strain you know I'm a gay you show me like I'm a choke off that [ __ ] but um it and I guess that's the same with uh anything I fit some good grass or whatever but you know anyway so let's go to the next setting I'm rambling cuz I'm high how bad figure out as the music for some ambiance now in the green as I hit it another two three second drag I get more of a drag I get more vape from that so that's so that's that's a slightly heavier hit then the red setting now let's go to the blue and now it's blue here's a little trick to my obvious keep water might be went out when i blaze man it cuts back on the awning on the choking off the grass whether it's bud or cut bait cartridges that you're using um because we we will excuse me we will make your throat dry I know it dehydrates the [ __ ] out of me so I keep water cuts back on me coughing and gagging and [ __ ] which is usually caused because I'm thirsty it's [ __ ] more than anything so I'm gonna go ahead and take this last pull off the blue give you guys a I guess my critique on that [Music] now I know if you guys can see the smoke but the blue setting with a much heavier hit than the green or the red setting so the blue is the highest setting and it's performing as its performing as it specifies on the battery let's see this is a 290 mAh battery a 10 millimeter by 92.7 millimeter battery I'm gonna see bottom micro USB charge adjust the voltage by quick pressing the button three times rechargeable battery for the use of vape cartridges fits all 510 thread so these are so the cartridge like that's explained before now everything is being Universal and standardized now so the batteries in the up cartridges you know you could pretty much intermix them you know you can use different cartridges with different batteries so on and so forth so that's the good thing about vaping nowadays and I'm the technology is advancing so what was for what was once you know top quality you know state-of-the-art tech so far this is concerned now it's becoming more moderately priced but so far I like the slim pin you know it seemed to keep a charge pretty well even though I went down to gardenia to meet my homeboy yesterday and we are we chopped it up for a minute did I lower exchange and stuff and I did just make some ice cream - man I posted it on my

I'm gonna go ahead and pull out some of these here so let's check out this one I think here I got some like stickers somebody gave you oh yeah so I got some test results here from somebody by the name of cash Alan no Cali cartel you know some people out there they have the whole booth set up so I actually went and called this number that's on here then I asked them like hey I got some test results yada yada yada all day legit dizzy people send them in is this bogus or not and they're actually pretty legit so shout out to Kelly carts family whatever I got cash Evelyn's coming over man this is stickers from love sandwich snap Callie cart Callie 408 nice alright so let's go ahead and check out somebody's here let's do this chronic or what is this chronic 24k oh I like this one I had a seal that's a little scary freaky - can you mask with it looks good no crazy bubble movement here okay a woman that 24 K take a quick little rip on this one and see what it tastes like [Music] oh I got that a hint of flour taste that but taste what does it taste like 24 karat well I don't know what 24 karat gold tastes like but that's what it tastes like and I know why God so [ __ ] expensive that's pretty good so shout out to white mask people wherever they are let's check out let's check out this cookie so this one doesn't actually have any labels or there's actually even open let me cook your ground let's check out that oil oil is moving kind of you know moving a little bit quickly there well I tend to watch those I look a little bit quickly okay I'll still take a poke or the best way you're going to be able to tell is do the case if it tastes like [ __ ] like chemicals throw it away [Music] yeah [ __ ] is this lemon pound cake tastes like lemon Township hmm that one [ __ ] away that was a little funky let's check out this way so this one again has a little cilantro oh hey I'd rather have it hard to open well somebody does open it it'll look like that this one here is the Scotties oil duck fire nice golden color to it notnot super clear vitamin E licking ass [ __ ] let's check out biscotti from the white mask people oh yeah mmm I could actually taste a biscotti flour oh oh shout out to you white mask biscotti I got to get another hit of that one cuz that one was good [Music] mmm that's good no chemicals the taste is right on point don't got no chemical we taste to it don't got no like awkward tasters that cop is good there's no awkward like rough harsh coughing my throat let's check out this chocolate okay order doesn't look too bad actually have two chocolates here so I'll try to compare each one rule okay not too bad but I could taste like um it doesn't hmm booth is fine they didn't even put a local or anything on it so that one had like a awkward little taste to it I didn't get one inhale this [ __ ] I just had to spit it out so this here is another Sylvan with the white mouse yeah this is a chakra low best by date huh 12:23 2019 this is the best bike date on this 100 percent THC distillate solvent-free all organic all right we'll see if this charcoal oak taste any better than that chocolate [ __ ] over there two different people they came from two different stands one hat there's mark with their logo the other one in disguise oh yeah this one Tate you could actually taste so I get the hint of Bud in there and I can taste you know the chocolate I don't know if it says like a sweet chocolate maybe that coming from the catalog but that one hmm that tastes good and I'm trying not to inhale on all these guys too much because I do have to hit to work right after this moment about trying to belittle own so let's check out this white run there's two white runs again let's do a one on one so this is white run cheese see you supposed to be in these ninety two point two six percent T 18 in the white runs now I've actually bought white runs from the dispensary and I've also bought the white runs flower so we're definitely going to be able to compare no that doesn't even taste close to white room I can taste the flower in it a bit but it has this weird like aftertaste so nothing wrong I like these ones with the white scary crazy-looking Halloween house on it so this one the oils a little bit darker than that one from my experience the darker the more natural more lighter it is that means the more diluted it is which would explain why people are cutting the stuff with vitamin E oh yeah see this one tastes on point it's just crazy because they're the same [ __ ] packaging everything is the same on here these people mark the logo on it these people did it this one tastes like [ __ ] I wouldn't put my name on there either this one these white masters will stand by their Potter and I like that darker golden edge to it it's not as the same as all these other ones and that's the more natural effect this and again I'm gonna give me a more of a natural eye as a boat as opposed to like a euphoric synthetic hi I found some that we're at this dispensary right which I didn't even take their free samples they were super clear like almost like like a yellowish and to me those are the ones that we learned out here at the pop-up shows that are frowned upon because they're they're cut with so much synthetic THC cannaboids they're vitamin E people are cutting them in there with now like [Music] okay that for these peoples tastes pretty good okay not bad this have a logo a name no name well the way this pretty pebble taste is better than whoever made those other one so I'm assuming it came from another little person oh this one the white mask [Music] remember the more darker the more natural and I'm not talking about like a coffee Browns are building a smoker oh [Music] yeah this pretty pebbles way better I like these white mask people this stuff is on point I'm already starting to get a little buzz a little high and I like about these ones these white mass wood is as soon as I push it it's already starting to burn like I don't know if you guys can see it there but there's already smoke coming out there and right there so here closer look like that tells me that oil was nice and refined like good quality oil guys more ladies because it was a lady there that were that's a booth a good job like that's good oil if that takes forever to burn not no bueno [Music] really so this one doesn't even have a label nothing on it my experience from there no label tastes like [ __ ] besides the one that did it well I'm not gonna [ __ ] with it if it doesn't have this white mask label Oh [Music] so these white mass people is actually Cali snap shall we Cali cartel D 408 high society so these are the same people that game to the test results stickers I believe my buddy got a t-shirt chick didn't give me one though and they actually marked all their stuff with their logo and hey they stand behind it like let me take it away let me get a mother's I got a rip of this gorilla this is gorilla good look at nice darkest gold and not that yellow light yellow P looking stuff like don't do it those are vitamins in there listen lacking vitamins mmm-hmm okay you have that for being a card tricks for being concentrated THC you can you can taste the gorilla glue in here I actually have some gorilla glue flour sitting around and that's those fire let's check out this story oh no oh no logo again the weight doesn't look bad but if he doesn't have a logo like I'm not working with this at least these people who put the white mask on it I feel the problem with the product you know I can actually go and talk to them confront them about it because this is not the first time I've got I've gotten some from them and I've seen them at like these little pop-up shows you know they stand behind their product which is why they put the name on it these other people don't got to take the cap off oh that tastes that's gelato that's definitely gelato I love it these guys have these people have their stuff online that's quality ladies and gentlemen let's check out these smart quarters blueberry cookie is a hybrid lab tested organic so I already know all of these are black-market cartridges and the reason I say they're black market is because they're unlicensed brand for one reason or another they're not licensed in the state of California to sell in dispensaries but maybe one day they will because everybody started off that where we all started off doing stuff on the side eventually if we had enough then we grew into a legit business where we pay taxes Oh another white mask so this is blue cookie strain testing eighty five point three three percent total THC 0.18 percent total CBD 0.01 percent total CBN for medical use only California prop 215 compliant oh yeah so unless is brand or not these people have they have a top brand they have top quality local on their cartridge there's even a magnetic connection in there now I've seen these before and a buddy of mine knows with me and his girlfriend actually I grabbed the one from I guess there's white mask people and then they went to this other booth and grab some and they were just like regular corporate boxes like this super thin flimsy the oil was already bad that was a red flag for us when we looked at the oil it was the oil like this is like a nice golden and if you notice there's a difference from these chronic cartridges the quality of the oil to the smart card these are a more darker than these ones which from my understanding these cartridges here are heavy duty so I believe I have to have it on a four point a 4.0 and above in order to hit them because something about the mechanics of it it's the lawyer has to be finer it has to be more thin in order for it to get to my screwed a rib so because these people with the might white mask Kelly car Kelly because I see if they're brands different colors of oils that tells me there was a different process of making this one to this one which is good [ __ ] the people would have all these different packs all these different boxes of different flavors but all the oils look the same red flag don't do it it's probably vitamin E in synthetic THC so let's check out this one this one the blue cookies I like that and that coffees like a clean cop it's not no harsh it's not a little harder scoff we're like my lungs hurt and forget those are my chest is any poison to come out of my chest it's good [ __ ] another cali cartel anyone what the [ __ ] is your name snap cali cartel you far away Oh snapchat cali cartel you far away got it well I'm already getting [ __ ] hungry so I'm gonna go grab me some in and out for chick-fil-a let's check out this one high potency triple x OG indica nice it has a nice little 3d print on here okay well like I said I've learned not to judge by the packaging everybody buys the same packaging from China off of Alibaba or DHgate Calm it's what's inside there so colors say a lot but it's that quick test so let's see [Music] well I like that's good [ __ ] okay that's good [ __ ] I'm actually gonna keep this one on my pen to finish so I'm gonna head on out guys I got to grab me some lunch with another 20 about 7:00 a.m. some reason I'm starving I'm gonna go they're keeping all the woods with the white mask there is no white mask just means to run away because I wouldn't give it to a friend I wouldn't smoke it myself yeah I'm not here we're here to get high high society [ __ ] I'm not killing each other walking on the lip oh those are words either way that away those away that away this is the one that came with some nasty taste booth is this some weird do so keep going those are going oh no I don't see a white mask on me throwing that away all right so I'm keeping those throwing those away um check out checking out on my next review i'll be posting up a few things when I go to these pop-up shows they ask that we don't record while we're there so I won't be doing that but I'll show you guys what I have come would I get coming back and now there was a lot of a lot of other new ones there a lot of ones that around a palm on the black arm on the black market and in these clubs and these little pop-up shows like Mario karts kikyo's brass knuckles what else is there exotic cars there's a lot of ones that I'm like that I have a bad reputation gain although I've done some good ganks and I believe that's when I got on was from these people this is about maybe two to three years ago the white Cali cartel II and their dates will fire but for some reason they're not making them anymore wouldn't well those are bad there's so many other ones that are coming out there now remember if it if that oil it's not like a golden the light of look at it this is the light of the oil is the more processed it has been visualized this is why imagine this if you put a scoop of coolant a cup a scoop of powdered kool-aid inside of a cup the more water you add the more diluted it gets right it's the same thing with oils so don't think you're getting a good deal don't risk your life over saving a few bucks on buying some stuff that have that's been filled with synthetic THC and vitamin E it's not worth the ladies and gentlemen high society about getting high it's what we just enjoy ourselves the one that's our pastime for whatever reason don't buy from them if you know anybody like I said check out these people a snap Cali cartel your way I know a few other people who have got fire product it's good but just for the examples I have here these damn people supply provided test results which I've actually called the company and asked about it they verified it they got stickers t-shirts what else did they have they had a bunch of stuff they even had a flower there they were giving out a bunch of samples a lot of these people were selling their samples for you know ten bucks these people with the white mask were giving away their samples like and of everybody there and these 50 cent at little pop and he's 50 little stands everybody was selling this stuff some type of profit these white mask people had like two females there and a guy and they were giving away their product so that tells me a lot about the character of whoever is making these so thumbs up guys and if you like continue to follow share the story on this raise awareness do not kill yourself to save a few bucks don't smoke stuff that's unlabeled you don't really know where it's coming from if people are saying they're getting it from you know a family member who owns a dispensary in a whole other state they're lying simple as that any of these that you see here you will not find in a dispensary anything you see on Instagram where people are talking about I have this I have that look it up in the dispensary if it's not there it's a black-market cartridge and don't buy from them because they weren't straight up with you from the gate and they tried to scan so stay tuned I'll get back this guy's deck next time I'm freaking hungry and I'm gonna take my I think this was rose OG with me or xxx og lay", "DsWE5vUe-Jo": "I'm gonna show you guys my film method for some oil I got this in the Bay Area super super bomb OG oil really strong came with a car actually and another little bottle fills it this one I think was a half gram and fills it about like two three times so what I'm gonna do first is just before I even fill it she's gonna attach it this is a gentleman's executive pen it's pretty much like a heat changeable type omicron like vapor pens a little stronger if you ask me so first I'm just gonna click it a little bit make sure that the cards getting hot before I put any of the good stuff in there it is so I know it's gonna be working good and then filling it's really easy if you don't have Anna funnel or anything you can just literally put a paperclip in this pitcher oil all over your paper clip and then you just put the paperclip right inside the cartridge like that just gently but you see I got the whole the whole thing in there I'm gonna just use a lighter torch something really quick and guide it all down towards the heating element which is down here and just really quick you don't want to cook it obviously that's good enough and then you can see when I take this out that's clean it's not going left on it and then you short pick your mouth capelin like that and be careful because it's hot and then you should put the silicon heat tip on like that and then I just heat it up a little bit about 4 clicks or so because it'll time out if you hold it too long and then just start vaping you can see already there's a little bit of vapor coming out of there and just start hitting it really slow pretty strong", "YTBEPByIq7c": "new tonight Michigan is the first state to ban e flavored cigarettes the governor ordered the State Health Department to issue emergency rules prohibiting the sale of these flavored nicotine vaping products this is for online and in-store these flavored ecigs are tied to the big increase among use with young people the American vaping Association says it will support lawsuits to challenge the ban tobacco flavored cigarettes are not included it might seem like a good thing that states are starting to ban these a flavored cigarette cartridges but there is a potential unforeseen consequence when they're not in the stores kids start buying them off the street and bootleg ecigs might be more dangerous than the name brands and BC just Joseph o Joe is in the studio with what the unknown chemicals might do well they will marked as a safe alternative instead of smoking cigarettes but the big concern for the CDC is that since many teens can't walk into the store and buy e cigarettes they will just get them on the street now health officials are urging that you don't buy it off the streets because it can lead to serious illness a heads-up from the center of Disease Control and Prevention it's not worth buying stuff like that on the streets stop buying each cigarettes and other cannabis products from unknown dealers this warning comes after a number of reported cases of respiratory illness appearing to be linked to vaping products the worst thing about getting a street product is it can be mixed with anything the CDC says they are looking into more than 200 cases across the country these cases leaving many hospitalized and suffering severe lung disease appearing to stem from phony vape cartridges they they don't have the tested it's either like they got it from somebody or they made it themselves locally cigarette shops tell us always buy inside a store in here for our CBD cartridges we have lab reports for everything so she's like everything that is in that cartridge but pulmonary specialist dr. Edward Salerno says if you're concerned about your health refrain from using baked products now then the data is mixed about whether it does really help but I think the first thing you need to do is talk to your doctor and explain to them why you're looking to use it and what your goals are and the CDC is investigating these cases with the Food and Drug Administration to determine a correlation

cannabis review and today I have some golden extracts vape pen cartridges I have a sativa and indica these are full grams and I definitely have to get my am and my PM meds on so check it gonna open these up here so you can see them better and so these are the golden extract made pen cartridges they come in indica sativa and hybrid so whatever your favorite is or whatever time of day it is you can vape up the really cool thing about these are they're very discreet there so there it is this is a premium co2 concentrate oil vaporization oil and this guy is tangi at 53% see myrrh no THC and no CVD a little bit disappointed on that so 53 percent THC on this one this is tangi this is a sativa and I really liked Angie so as soon as I seen it I was like definitely wanted to Angie so uh you get their battery Golden Age strikes battery which has a cool stylus on the bottom for your phone and tablet and it just screws on there just like that there is no button needed you just suck would it flash like that it means it's gonna shut off a little bit that is amazing absolutely amazing now few things with these trying to use their battery or the other batteries that are just like this try not to use these on your actual vape pens you know that the Eagle twists and all that why because they burn at a different temperature higher temperature you're going to burn out that coil and then you're gonna have to pop these open and get all that out I've had to do that a couple times and I was like oh well these cartridges are burning out what the [ __ ] and come to find out it was my battery giving it not the cartridges so that was tan G tan jeez really tasted really really great I mean it's got a nice you know it's like sweet taste to it I mean I really like it really enjoying tan G and this is the indica this is gonna be your more nighttime more your body hi hear that and screw this son the right that's where the smoke goes up another cool thing about these vape pens is golden extracts and various other oil companies they make the syringes with the little metal tips and they can go right in there just pull this little plastic thing out or this little rubber thing out and your syringe tip is going to fit right in there and you can refill it with their uh their juice so then snaps right back on you're ready to go now this product is probably gonna run you at most dispensaries anywhere between thirty to forty five dollars a full gram they do come in half grams so that's gonna run you about fifteen to twenty dollars a half gram so we highly recommend checking these out really enjoy them they're really discreet and they're perfect for on-the-go dabbing instant relief and yeah great product and by golden extracts highly recommend check them out and thank you

seen like they're not like real overwhelmingly strong you know Plus this vape and I have - you can change the voltage on it so it burns at a at a different rate depending on the setting that you have been on green red or blue the red setting is the lowest voltage then there's the green and then blue obviously being the highest in ascending order but um this is Africa by amber industries and this is um I believe that Africa is a sativa cuz it definitely [ __ ] it's like a sativa it's good - Matt it's real good I didn't I'm so what we have available now you know I'm not gonna rattle off

previously to this it was my super exciting video when i actually got these in the mail because emblem finally makes vapes yay i'm super excited because emblem is one of the providers that i rely on most frequently um it is one under one one of my prescriptions um so i do get all my mlm products from emblem directly on my prescription and um up until i want to say the beginning of october i think it is um they didn't make vape cartridges they only had the dries and the oils and i they were my go-to for all of my oils but because i haven't been using as much dried lately i use the vape cartridges i wasn't able to use a lot of my prescription because they didn't have the products that i needed or the wizzy's on my prescription so the fact that these are now available is phenomenal paradise island is a sativa dominant hybrid and i found it had a very sweet after taste when you're exhaling i find it's not too too bad on your throat i don't find it too drying or too harsh which is really nice i find a lot of well i know a lot of people have a struggle with the harshness of the cartridges i guess sometimes cartridges or the vapes are harder or some people find them harder i mean i personally prefer the vape cartridges over smoking the dried i find it's not as hot um so it doesn't burn as badly i guess for me personally that is my preference everyone has their own preference so let me make that very clear but paradise island it has a sweet aftertaste kind of tropical i guess you could say in a way if i had to put it onto something it would be a tropical sweet flavor um but mind you i'm not doing it for the flavor i'm doing it for the benefits of um the sativa which is number one for nausea control because currently i'm in a migraine cycle um the weather today is rainy and crummy and quite cold and then tomorrow it's supposed to like skyrocket and get super hot and then it's supposed to drop again um the next day so i'm just my head's just not happy it is migraine season welcome to canada um welcome to where i live coming into winter is normally my most rough time of year my body is not a fan of the cold and having it adjust especially when things are going high and low and the pressures are going high and low it's really really hard on my body so that being said with the migraines i get a lot of nausea i generally lose a lot of weight at this time of year because i have such a hard time keeping things in my body or even wanting to eat or being able to eat because a lot of the time it's ginger ale or like small things that i can kind of suck on just to get calories um sometimes but like i said it all depends on the day and how how effective my medication is i guess you could say so i do like this achieve it it does um kind of a similar effect to the um the train wreck i guess the train wreck is it gives you kind of an uplifting happy feeling but it still allows me to work and focus and get my stuff done um without just kind of making me this so that's not a i know well it's not a word but that's just how i find um a lot of some well a lot of cannabis makes you feel uh well it is a migraine day the weather is going up and down and i have a wicked migraine um i mean probably this is probably day two of my migraine um yesterday was pretty rough today is a little bit better the paradise island is helping i am able to actually get food in me it makes me actually hungry not overly hungry to the point of like i need to eat everything and cite anything i can get my hands on i'm just like eating eating eating it's not one of those kind of hungers but it does allow me to start making dinner and make it allow me to think about food and not want to just throw it up so i actually make something that i can eat too and that way i'm participating in eating and i'm actually getting food in me which is really helpful because a lot of the time it tends to be kind of hard especially with a migraine i live on ginger ale a lot so having this and actually having it work is a really good thing so this is kind of um become my new go-to for nausea control so but i would give it a six out of ten it does help settle my stomach but it doesn't make me starving it makes me a lot it it makes me hungry though it doesn't make me starving so it just allows me to i don't know be normal i guess or have a sort of um normal mentality for food that day not just constantly wanting to hurl it um that tends to happen overall the paradise island sativa hybrid from emblem has now become my new go-to for regular nausea control and hunger um or increasive appetite to help me increase my appetite this is a new go-to for me thanks emblem i'm super happy that they are up and i will do some more reviews coming up of some of the

today i have something that was requested and today it's a robe for a real ca stamped rope like a [ __ ] real last rover right this is my first time getting one of these so we're looking at everything boys look at all that i don't know if y'all can see but it says um total cannabis 88.6 percent total thc 84 percent total cbd 0.3 so there's not much cbd in here yeah it's a disposable and we're about to see what's good it's a og indica it's just og but see what this og is tasting like damn you gotta rip the sticker off to open it and everything so it's like i don't know i guess the plugs can't open it before they sell this and [ __ ] so that's cool damn there's hella safety shits on here bro this shit's like i'm sorry if i'm quiet while opening this is because i'm kind of concentrated because it's just got a bunch of safety features on these [ __ ] and these shoes are over doing it already there you go this is what it's looking like right here see a stamp that's beautiful sheesh i need to quit playing with a rogue this is so sleek and it comes with the tip covered up and it charges the bottom alright man stop playing with it boys where is it oh wow oh bro i had a fake ass ropes before never like this the taste was similar but bro the way this just hits you bro [ __ ] kicks you in the chest bro like and you just feel that [ __ ] like you want to do a bubble test on it like a little bubble test [ __ ] is thick it's [ __ ] bro oh twenty percent better but all right oh we're cool enough all right oh i don't know like with the way we treat his [ __ ] be like oh yeah this tastes like some og i don't know bro i don't mean like remembering wheat strains taste like this tastes similar to some [ __ ] i've had before right but like i don't remember like like people be [ __ ] knowing all this [ __ ] like i don't know like i know a good amount but i'm not like very like like hella hella into it like maybe more later on when i start um actually smoking robot and [ __ ] on the channel and [ __ ] and then we'll will really be on like that but yeah it's just clean as a mug i'm about to hit a blinker bro better hit blinker and really [ __ ] test this [ __ ] out like look at the top of it oh gee oh gee this is just clean bro i messed up that don't count that's some [ __ ] good [ __ ] [ __ ] right there bro just leaving a good taste in my mouth like a fire ass taste but damn bro this [ __ ] is [ __ ] like reminding me over like when i first started cheating bro and like like my lungs were [ __ ] eyes back there like not like i couldn't like take as much like i wasn't like my thomas wasn't as high basically and [ __ ] i would call vicious like the way it would hit me with this like fishes and the way this is hitting me it just reminds me of like in the back in the day the way it's just hitting me like [ __ ] giving me flashbacks and [ __ ] bro but yeah i think that's the end of this video for today bro something definitely recommend this if you see this in your area it's on fire bro", "CNC1o4cWftU": "what's up we back at it again no it's a another day we already see what I got right here got another kingpin on deck oh I try to tell you I'm trying to get better brands you know I'm trying to show better reviews you know I'm trying to you know I'm not gonna lie I know a lot of people like to see the Dame vapes and exotics for the reason being is that likely try to you know they want to stay aware of like all the like you know [ __ ] that's in these like exotics and Dinks so you know that they won't like if they ever come across that that they'll know what to look out for and like look out for like what's bad and what's good so like if y'all do want to see a dank vapor view or an exotic of you go ahead and you know you can let me know that in the comments if you want to see it but you know it's probably just gonna be you know one time Dean you know don't think it's gonna be common that I'm gonna keep on putting those videos out you know like not every video is gonna be a [ __ ] dank vape or Mario Cart or exotic you know that's just not how I'm planning to do things around here but um if you want me to do one you know I'll be I'll gladly doing you know but just it's not gonna be something that's gonna be common on here you know it's gonna be you know one and done type tank so that's that but let's just get straight into it you're already another deal kingpin train wreck and give you all the close-ups hybrid one thousand milligrams full gram seventy one point seventy two percent THC zero percent CBD the last go check out my own the the last video I posted was a gelato kingpin that one only has 0% I think I think to CB I think to THC on that one was actually seventy-seven percent so this one isn't as strong as the gelato check that out check that out pause it if you want to ingredients that's all that's all that's in there y'all cannabis oil that's it one three-second draw was a single serving manufactured a February 18 2019 best buy February 18 2020 batch ID twk 7 8 powered by loud pop say yeah that's not that's the package CA and when you open it up I've already opened this up and I've already been using you for the past few days it does have these cells on it as you can see take that off and you slide it out and it's gonna come with this tubes it's to you know open it up your car would be in there slide it out I've already taken it out so no need for me to do that and let me show you all the cars I mean check it out my battery BAM as y'all see I've been using this for a while and it's already about halfway done you know and the reason I kind of I kind of just wanted to I wanted to do this review by the way but I can't lie I got carried away man this is some good ass here bro this [ __ ] is [ __ ] good and I got carried away and I just didn't I never made the review until about halfway I told myself I was like you know what I'm gonna do the review I should have just did it when it was brand new because I know some people like to see it when it's brand new but you know honestly I think it's good that I've already used it cuz I've already gotten a feel for it you know like what if it was brand new and it was like broken or some [ __ ] and I didn't even know that yeah I don't know if y'all see what I mean but here it is short tip heard another deal kingpin logo on the glass he has the red eyes on there too just like on the bollocks yeah I'm gonna go ahead and put this on my battery now and um take a few puffs on that for y'all and you already know - do we got the th for 20 [ __ ] me it's a good as a battery I do suggest it Wow one thing I do have to say about kingpin that they're real good about that I've noticed is the flavor the flavor is just [ __ ] good um train wreck I don't know what train wreck is like that's not like that's not like a flavor base name so I can't really compare to anything like the gelato you know I can compare that to you know some actual Road gelato and the gelato that [ __ ] tastes [ __ ] good but this train wreck I really don't know how to be honest um but if I had to be honest it it tastes like a lemon it tastes like a it tastes like an artificial lemon let me take another one yeah artificial lemon that's what it tastes like artificial lemon that's the best way to describe it the flavors there but the flavor is definitely there the hi is definitely there that shit's already kicking me it's a hybrid so you're gonna get that into good mixed what they sativa filling but I feel like this is more indica dominant because I'm feeling more of a body feeling than a head feeling but yeah other than that I do recommend this this is [ __ ] good [ __ ] tips all dirty yeah but I can obviously tell I've been cheating on it you already see you can't even see the oil up there anymore it's pretty much halfway done I've just been cheating on this [ __ ] I already know the deal but um I'm gonna give my rating on this um first of all flavor eight out of ten a good eight out of ten the flavor I wish it was more of like an actual it's it's too artificial I'm not gonna lie it's it's a little bit too much artificial flavoring to it and I'm not really a big fan of that the gelato was good though man ten out of ten for the flavor on that or whatever I gave it I really should have given it a 10-minute n if I did it if I did well then yeah I was kind of expected but um for this one I give it an 8 out of 10 flavors good if you like lemon this one this is a good one afraid you the hi obviously the most important one 9 out of 10 I'm feeling really good right now I'm kind of just chill I don't know take me another one real quick Cheers I actually got a brass knuckles card on deck - you might be doing a review on that soon probably tomorrow I feel like it my back so yeah that's that just wanted to do a quick review this is already you goddamn in a video it's a little bit too long but yeah this is the review on this cheap in trainwreck hybrid I do suggest this guard and get in it's good gets you high spoke tastes good so yeah that's that like subscribe [ __ ] on my channel more check out my other videos

am going to be reviewing the fuel of a a cartridge which is produced by Thera plant and this particular cartridge has 94 milligrams of THC and 150 milligrams of CBD I don't know if you can actually see the label I find this to be really helpful especially for nausea I would not recommend using the Thera plant battery that it comes with because this battery heats up way too hot and there's not any kind of switch to change the temperature or anything but the threading is the same for just your standard 510 battery and so you get a much a much smoother draw from it and you don't it's it's not gonna have that harsh awful feeling in your throat afterwards and it doesn't have the mechanical oil taste to it with like when you use the higher heat batteries just yeah no no harsh effects or anything like I said this is what I find this really helpful for nausea um I also found it pretty helpful for anxiety and for nerve pain yeah 24 milligrams of THC and 150 milligrams of CBD and this and you get you know it's a good a good amount it it could let like you're not gonna run out of it in a day unless you're hitting it really heavy I can usually get about a week out of these and they're not super expensive they're not as cheap as the slims but the advantage this has over the slims is that you can change the battery and you can change the temperature on it where the Slim's are just everything in one compact unit and there's no changing the temperature and I actually found the slums to be the CBD Slim at least to have a really really harsh feeling in my throat afterwards which I suspect is because of the battery yeah the fuel of a a from Thera plan", "g1Wlch_vLuo": "yo what's going on guys thanks for bringing you a new youtube video if you guys could give me a huge hit bell icon subscribe share this video comment down below what you're smoking on make sure you turn on post notifications so you would never miss a video once we hit 1k supporters we are going to be

__ ] this is a hybrid indica king louie 12 og with the indica blueberry crush then we got an indica white fire og which i'm not gonna i'm not going to feel this one i have a feeling already indica grape soda is a sativa mimosa a thing number 14 that's how you think it's pronounced sativa strawberry coffee and in the comment one and of course buscotti which i'm gonna be opening it up in this video and smoking it a little bit for you guys and i'm gonna make another video on that reviewing it or i should give you one of these let me know which one i should review you know if i should review

all right you guys got the push card right here we're gonna open it up right now but i just do want to say a couple things it did open this up already i did take a hit already off this but i do want to tell you guys that when you open it up it is like the krt stickers make sure some of your stickers stay on to it like this as you can see it peeled off and some of the letters sticked onto right there but we're gonna pull this out and check it out here you go you guys it comes like this you guys it looks pretty fancy i'm not gonna lie i [ __ ] with it i like how the packaging on this card looks has the white cap at the bottom we're gonna unscrew this and this is how the cap should be looking like when you unscrew it along with the pla plastic harp tab on top you know but i do want to show you guys the cart itself look at it the clothes subscription right here you guys look at it wow and then in the center of the car it does have like a pipe kinda in a way i'm not sure how to say it but as you guys can see it has like a little tube in the center so that's where the smoke will well you inhale from and you'll have it but for offer to do let's take a couple hits you guys in this video i'm gonna be reviewing this flavor a little bit you guys i'm gonna give it from 1 to 10 high-wise and flavor-wise we're going to take a quick nice beautiful head look at it again you guys it does say push on that let's get it you guys hmm are you guys it's not too bad you guys i'm not gonna lie in fact that has a 1.1 grams in here that's pretty good too guys but i just want to show you guys this quick update and show you guys these cards you guys as you can see right here wow it looks [ __ ] nice let me know in the comment section below which one i should review i'm really excited to review these you guys but without further ado i hope you guys have a safe and amazing day still medicate stay blessed on stress and as always peace the [ __ ] out let's take this last minute you guys make sure you turn on post notifications this is the blinker guys let's get it peace y'all", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "rIFOf4R1oyA": "you know what is going on YouTube welcome back to a quick little banger by your boy semi g-men so a question that I've been getting ass lately a lot men so you guys know that I've always upload a cartridge videos pata videos anything that has to do with a portable you know dabbing device then I'm pretty much using it because I'm always on the go I can never find a convenience to just roll down I mean sit down and roll one up you know or sit down and just heat up my mic to my banger or you know all that stuff so I always feel like I carry a cartridge or a pod with me at all times just because it's that convenient so but the question that I get asked a lot right is which one do you like better semi which one do you like better man you're always chief in this chief in that do you like cartridges better or do you like pods better and I was just like when when I saw that question I was just like wait hold on man I had to think about it I was like I don't know I don't know if I like cartridges or pods better you know I don't know which one I would choose on because I have had some really really amazing cartridges and then I've had some really really amazing pods you know and I feel like each one has their own you know up side to it so I think for today's video man we're gonna get down to the bottom of what I like out of a pod system and what I like out of a cartridge system and I guess so today though we are gonna be chiefing representing the 510 thread cartridge side we got imperial extracts this one right here is a lemoncello sativa and the main reason I wanted to put this one in is because lemoncello is one of those strains that is super freakin fire right now so I wanted you to give this one a shot shout out to imperial extracts mint for it you should handing this out to me and on the pot system side we got the big boy right here that's dizzy sitting on the nice big battery all right men shout out to Steve and I thought you know these two brands right here man they they make some really really good light resin so I chose some of the best ones that I could find and I just really want to see what what what makes it stand out more than the other all right guys so to start off I feel like let's start off with imperial extracts sitting that I think we're gonna put this out a three point five right lemoncello that's going what do I like about a 5-10 thread cartridge let's find out oh dude that is so smooth oh that libraries and hits though oh okay so off of that first initial hit I'm obviously not gonna base it off of the oil itself it's gonna be more about the cartridge and what I like about it so I think as the first thing the most obvious reason that I like a 5-10 thread cartridge over a pod would probably have to be you see this thing right here the battery man the fact that I could switch up my variable wattage is on a you know when I'm smoking if I tend that cartridge is something that is very very underestimated a lot of people do not know you know I preached this a lot when I'm doing cartridges and things like that but you have to if you feel like you're not getting the right amount of turps the right amount of flavor smoke whatever the cases the chances are you had to switch up the voltage side there go a little bit higher a little bit lower you know you go you have to find the sweet spot on a cartridge just so you can get that overall well you know smoke experience man when you're sitting there you're gonna get the the right flavor profile you're gonna get the Terps up smacking you get the smoke and I feel like when using a battery like this like this battery that has variable wattage right here on the down on the bottom I feel like that's a big upside to the 510 thread cartridges because men I I want it if I feel like it's not hitting enough I can easily turn it up and boom I'm getting smack because it feels like I just took a dab all right so that would be the first thing that I like about a 5-10 thread over a pot and next up on the list we got the stage right here like I said competing for the pod side and let's go ahead and take a little rip about this see what I like about the pod see what I like it but I don't like about it right choose or what I like over the 510 thread smackers dude I don't know it's dizzy so good but the imperial extracts man I think that lemoncello that they made Veneto bro finito so what I like about a pot I feel like what the thing that stands out to me the most about ippolit system it's just about the convenience and the sleek design that they give you I feel like that is the first thing that stands out to me right then no hands you don't have to push a button to draw this like you can do whatever you want with your hands while you're hitting it so I feel like that is the most upside about the about a pod system itself is the fact that you know you don't need to use press a button to hit it you just need to pull men in the designs at that you know they'd be coming out with with the paws system it's just the fact that you have a proprietary battery so you can really match it up and make it look very very appealing so that would be the first thing that I like about the pause systems is just the convenience and the visual appeal so back onto the cartridge side man I'm getting smack Manny I need to do some water boys don't forget summer is coming up man getting hot you guys need to stay hydrated all the time right so what's going on a 3-point boo it wasn't at three point eight holy shoot damn dude I think the first hit that I did was a three point eight so let's go ahead and now hit it a three point five and tell you what else I like about cardizem whoo that is fire dude it's so freakin smooth that I forget how much smoke is actually in my longings in their eyes like choking up so whoo yeah lemoncello definitely is I feel like the next thing that I would want to speak on about the 5/10 third cartridges are itself is I don't know what it is but I feel like I get a lot more flavor from cartridges of themselves because I've had I I can't remember what company it was exactly I don't even think they're around anymore but they went from putting it in a 5-10 thread cartridge and I remember tasting it it was so freakin good and they made the switch over to a pause system because they wanted you know hop on the wave up on the Uni style that was coming out and it just did not taste the same it did not taste the same I do not know if it has anything to do with like you know the build that 510 thread cartridges have as opposed to this one I mean at the other day they feel like they're both pretty similar you know they both have wicks in there ceramic whatever blah blah blah but I always feel like whenever I'm hitting a cartridge it's just a whole different type of like hi than I'm getting a whole type of different experience and then when I hit a pod system it's just it's satisfying for a short amount of time and then I feel like it's just I just get tired of it so that's why I'd rather choose a 5-10 thread over a frickin pod system goes one thing that I think both you know both the pod system and a 5-10 thread cartridge have their you know their negatives also so I don't know if you guys know but when you get to the bottom of a cartridge I there's always a little bit of oil up and in the pods it's significantly less as opposed to 5 10 third cards you can either way you're still losing oil it gets stuck up up at the top and I feel yeah that's maybe something that both a pod system and a cartridge system you know can both fix because with the with the holes right there it's the same thing as a pod it has a small hole right there and there are times where you just get stuck in the little crevice in between the cartridge and the hole so that's kind of a downside of both of matches [Music] dude I don't know they nailed this flavor like I keep talking about this imperial extracts cartridge but it's actually so satisfying it's my first time ever trying this limoncello it's like this is gonna be my daily driver from now on for sure screech this guy's discreteness is something that a lot of people have to deal with now it is because they don't want people knowing what they're doing and I don't know I guess nowadays everybody knows because it's 2020 you know you can't really if they see it they are gonna know automatically what it is it's been all over the news you know the cartridges have been blasted literally all over the news so people know exactly what it is so there really is no keeping it discrete but if you if you somehow find a way I feel like the most one to keep discrete would probably have to be this one because you could kind of pass off if you put it on a little on the slimmer batter you can maybe pass it off as a jewel you know take the little California weed sticker on and then boom there you go it looks kind of like a jewel and there's something they actually do have paws that are actually very very clear so you know it kind of pulls you a little bit closer to the Julian type of [ __ ] so you can pass away with very very you know look at being very very discreet is what I'm saying at the end of the day it's actually really really hard to choose which one I like better you know paws versus cartridges but if I really really had to choose I think I would just have to go with a cartridge itself like I was saying because you can endlessly switch variable wattages on this one man the hits the hits on a cartridge just hit way different as opposed to a pod man my experience is you know I'm a big long time cartridge user so it speaks for itself man it speaks for itself cartridges are you know my go-to I know that's really crazy to say and people always talk [ __ ] to me about like you know I do why do you smoke so many cartridges and like I mean now now in 2020 I've actually you know slimmed it down quite a bit I've actually been smoking a lot more deaths and I'm weed but before that I was cheating on a cartridge almost I was going through cartridges literally like two to three days but that's how crazy it was so yeah I guess 5-10 thread cartridges wins for me of us over pot systems don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the good old pot system you know they do their thing they come in clutch when when they need to so with that being said guys 510 thread being the winner let me know in the comments below what do you guys think which one do you guys like a better DEA's like 510 thread or do you guys like pods and yeah let me know if you guys have ever tried imperial extracts especially this lemoncello man is super freaking fire so I'm gonna go ahead and end out the video here if you enjoy the content do me one last favor and hit that like button comment back to me and most importantly smash that subscribe button alright guys catch you guys on the next one", "I8H89hXJxL0": "if you're anything like me you'd stop smoking and started baking weed and you should probably bought a cart and it didn't work well I have a way to fix it and you won't be a syringe you need a flashlight a flathead screwdriver and a small pair of tweezers this is the small metal inner ring this is the rubber gasket step 1 removing your ring step 2 remove the rubber gasket there will be a thin metal wire inside you will have to use a flashlight to see it use the tweezers to gently pull this wire to the blue line in the diagram you want the wire to be even with the blue line be very careful and do not roll to the best or to the far step before gently align the wire in the center of the circle now replace the rubber gasket this will be very difficult to get in exactly in place step 5 once the gasket is congruent all the way around insert the small and rings this should be very easy step 6 find your battery I can't tell you how many hundreds of dollars I've wasted not just linking parts on my page we pay about 56 dollars for these things so if I do save you some money won't you see me fiber

doing a review of select elite cannabis oil extract cartridge fruit punch here is the that as you can see as it goes into focus is ninety one point nine percent THC and about 0.55 percent CBD I think I love about select is that they have like a description of what kind of what kind of a feeling this particular strain I'll give you do that you know a lot of people don't know this is it different strains of marijuana can produce you know very different effects and for you know it's it's it's different for everybody to my brains wired a little differently and you know different strains of acne fruit punches my new favorite though by far energetic and talkative is yeah how I'm definitely feeling right now you know and I got some electro-swing kick in and you know I'm gonna get some [ __ ] done today wow yeah excellent excellent cartridge my my new favorite by far cuz yeah I mean I need a little bit of CBD has for those of you don't know THC is that is the psychoactive ingredient that you know gives you that buzz that high whereas CBD is more of it brings a sense of physical well-being you know it's it's good for pain relief and and you know just just to relax so my I like having some CBD in there that's it's normally I like to have a bit more CBD in a cartridge but man I saw that number on the THC there's that's 91% point not 90 not damn near 92 it may as well be 92 1.9 am and that's that's that is that is 92 percent THC Sun as Lauren by the way that's 92 percent THC son I don't play it's a yeah it'll it'll make today a lot more fun but for example if you had if you had look at the cartridge to its you'll see that it's a very very clear fluid that is in there well I don't know how good my lighting is here but you know that's just yeah it's it's got kind of a kind of a honey color to it but like a really really translucent you can actually see through it whereas like some of the other cartridges like like this is my my old cartridge here if you look at it you'll notice that the stuff in there the the extract is darker color and that indicates that it's it's less pure you know you have a less pure product and it's it's not gonna deliver as much of a kick and then plus you got the impurities in there too you don't know what the hell your your puffs in there you know so yeah keep it clean you know don't keep it good but yeah if you live in Oregon or Colorado or any other state that is legalized and get yourself a selectively fruit punch 92% THC and a little bit CBD to chase it down and it's good for you thanks have a good on everybody", "wZBa-u0WKss": "alright guys I'm going to be doing a review of some cannabis products with this line of videos like bait cartridges waxes shatters things like that I'm a here in Las Vegas I'm a medical patient in Las Vegas my name is Gabriel and I figured I don't see a lot of videos on Vegas products or you know too many too many reviews on the dispensaries or the growers or the brands so um I wanted to get some of that information out there because I'm pretty sure there's people who are going to be here coming here or are here that would like to know something about these products before the bio from a like objective point of view because I don't make anything if you buy them so the first product I'm going to be doing today is called the Jazz cabbage it's a disposable bait cartridge and I'm a big vague connoisseur I've had a lot of apes out in in Colorado in Denver and so it's I've got a pretty wealth of experience to kind of line these things up against in Colorado like I've had Pat Penn and focus labs Indigo Pro there's a couple other ones that I'm not thinking of that are kind of the EBU Pat I know I've said Pat Penn can't remember but I've had many many many many many and so this one is called the Jazz cabbage and what struck me about this one I got it at the top-notch dispensary by seen it at other dispensaries and they've got a Facebook page that I've liked as well is that and they've got a really classy cover and that's what kind of first gravity advertisement I guess the cover because it's got like these little jazz players and it's got like jazz cabbage which I assume is some old term for marijuana since it was like so kind of linked to that type of jazz and like african-americans so which is cool I think it looks interesting and it's that like cool art but what also grabbed me about it says a hundred percent organic so that's an only a group called clean green certified are the ones who did this and tested it for it's like organic miss if that's a word but it says 100% organic premium uncut co2 extracted cannabis oil so naturally since its co2 it's a solvent list it's a so that's really good i and it's a point five milliliter vape disposable I'll kind of open it up to kind of let you guys take a look at it when you open it and it opens because this little flap on the end to pull out so you can just pull it out and when it opens it over it's kind of like a ring like an engagement ring to be honest because see comes into this little thing and you pull it out and it's really really classy now these are sixty but almost self camera these are 60 bucks out the door at a at top-notch I've seen them as high as 75 dollars at a or 80 dollars where I think that comes with the whole cartridge kit could I just needed the the Veit cartridge I didn't need like the battery or anything but I got it a top notch which is over on Stephanie buy like Whitney and they're 60 bucks out the door and this is their pink oil which they've got like two or three different flavors and this is their pink and I have to say it's uh yeah when you bring it out gets like that this little mouthpiece on top little mouth covered piece on top and you just a 5-10 thread so it's pretty Universal all you got to do is I have any 510 thread atomizer and you'll be fine and you just pull this little thing off there you go you're puffing away and it's it's a it's it's a really nice unique little cartridge it's got a great taste onto like the actual review of the product it's got a really good taste reminds me of the rx green it's a bait cartridge in in Colorado and they're also it's very very very tasty and tasty and average and I kind of like generic sense like it's not tasty in a specific strain kind of way it's tasty in like it's just the greenery it tastes like buds but like an indiscriminate taste of just like it's very but it's very very flavorful so it makes your mouth feel very green so that's a good thing and it has a very good potency it has a very very good potency it uh when you hit it a couple of times like my I mean like I said a great potency grit and for potency and the combination of that and taste I honestly believe now I might regret this later but um honestly believe it's probably one of the best I've ever had but it's not the best when it comes to potency and taste I've had tastier ones and I've had more potent ones but I haven't had one as tasty and as potent as this particular one uh together at the same time so definitely worth it I definitely think it's worth the 60 bucks kind of burns a little fast I I talked to somebody and they said it's kind of more like Gaby so I don't know like how this thing burns or if it uses like what mechanics are in here that burn the oil but it seems to burn a little fast but damn if you don't get some really good hit so like I'm not saying that that it's not worth it or like it's not like like the ends don't justify the means but I will say that it comparatively to other cartridges just seem to burn a little quicker than I normally would like another quick well interesting critique on these things that I don't haven't really experienced in other vape cartridges like as prevalent is this one is that like mmm sometimes we get stuck and from what I talked to somebody about it as a dispensary and they said that because it's like I guess this particular their particular brand of oil is very thick and that sometimes I get clogged II but I mean it is really crazy sometimes like sometimes it's it almost frustrates me like how like how much I won't be able to hit this thing not trying to discourage it like it's not it's not crazy bad like I would buy another one but it's definitely something that I will take in consideration in buying another one okay there you go I got it alright now I'm going to take a hit so you guys can take a seat of I'm using these generic it's a good it's a good it's got a got the temperature gauge on it so it's a classy one but it's probably not I don't it's good so it's not the one that it comes with a jazz cabbage that like they have their own bait kit that you can buy so I'm pretty sure if you use that one it's probably might be better for it I don't know maybe not so but here we go definitely got a really good hit Jos got to study at first but it came through really really good if I build up the love's really really good you can see that bruise pretty room FY it looks very tasty I was getting down to the end I didn't review it right out of the box because I hadn't really planned on doing that but um so it's kind of at the end but it's still very tasty even towards the end very tasty very potent like I said well worth the $60 burns a little fast but I if if that's because like and it needs to burn that way for you to get the hits you're getting I'm pretty comfortable with that it's got this cool little airflow thing that I didn't show you guys before I took the hit um these three little holes here I might not be able to see them but like there's three little holes there and you can kind of like move it around the top and Swizzle it and it kind of creates different airflow so like if you want like a massive amount of airflow or if you want like a smooth stream of air flow you can kind of like dictate that to your liking at the end of the day the jazz cabbage is a very good product I would I would definitely buy it again and I would want to try their other line of oils to see what they taste like and how potent they are definitely worth another buy like I said the only cons is that it does get stuff sometimes actually not sometimes quite frequently and uh mmm that would really that would really be Oh and it burns a little fast but like I said it might be hinging on the one you getting those big hits but then I mean maybe it's not so like if it's just I don't know but that would be the only critique other other than that great vape very good for the price very tasty very potent good on the go uh and yeah so this is Gabriel was the final take on the on the on the Jazz cabbage cartridge a co2 uncut oil that is available here in loss of I guess and if you have any comments any questions please feel free to drop them and I'm going to come out with some other some other video other videos just critiquing some of different brands of bake cartridges waxes shatters um you know anything that I feel somebody might need to get a review on to get a better understanding and I will also see about reviewing dispensaries if not on location if I'm not allowed to do that like by some legality then now we'll just do it like from my apartment and we'll just sound I'll just talk about them and highlight some points about you know the the dispensary experience in those particular ones and which ones I find like are you know I like the best or you know and why you know which is more important and so we'll see how that goes and we'll see when that comes but yeah feel free to like subscribe share whatever and we'll see you the next time around", "k00L38UcoHk": "welcome to reefer road and reviews today we're going to look at a vape cartridge from MOX Baltus at herbology King of Prussia her ology I got this koozie on the way out people real nice first time at this dispensary it's up at the most trendy spot right now King of Prussia this little area it's like soda soap from South Park it's really holy toidy there's tons of artisan shops and restaurants they have two restaurants oh how many restaurants can you have and my cell phone died on me when I was looking for herbology and it's only like 10 minutes from my house but I never been to this area before so then I look over to my left and I see I see the place there it is or in the hill and there's a Wegmans I mean this is the typical trendy spot and it's it just made me laugh when I saw the dispensary and how things have changed it's just our area is so much different and it's not even recreational but it will be soon I guarantee it because it just seems like it but back on topic the review as a vape karch cartridge from Moxie which I got the Moxie root beer float last time I didn't review that if I wanted to give you a review and I'm going to buy it again so I will do review but that was awesome really amazing it's a distillate cartridge helps you know it helps everything this is ink this is an indica and they fill it up a less forever the Moxie's lasts for three days and if you rip this a lot to add a I keep it at 3.3 volts and that's the lowest setting but it seems to work out great so the orange here's the packaging it's Moxie by pure pen vape cartridge liquid moxie it's all it says on the back to THC is eighty five point seven percent there's no CBD in here the orange and just like the root beer float Loren's tastes and smells exactly like artistries mmm it's like to get a Swedish Sunny Delight I'm getting better I'm not call for loss so this is a real obviously it's a citrus flavor citrus flavor the taste and the smell it's art it's so it's harnessed use its Sunny Delight you're gonna get hit with that every single time so if you don't like sipping on oranges don't get this or if you do if you do like orange juice but not a lot just have it for your breakfast you know it's an indica whatever it'll with a coffee they'll leave it on yourself out so just take a couple rips off that I took three rips and Evan you know pretty much heavy into smoking it and I just you know abiding for the past month so my THC levels are freaking through the roof when it comes to being tolerant so I needed these these vapors they just ripped me up and it's cool I mean it's funny cuz I play basketball go to the gym all that it digitally resets my system but whereas when I used to smoke a lot when I was in college 11 years ago it was it was just wake up go to class I feel like crap all the time so always exercise do that support for your health and it's important for working with the medical marijuana so I think both go hand in hand if you workout and smoke your you get the benefits of both it's like diet and exercise weed and exercise it goes same thing you're gonna focus intha size the weed and it's gonna turn an energy so you might not ever have to eat again no I'm kidding don't do that but low orange by Moxie is freakin awesome so far I've had a seven token owner for about four hours about five or six reps I'd give it a I'm giving a eight at ten and I wouldn't give the root beer float hey that tattoo now that a that 10 could change based off how tired I get of smoking pure Sunny Delight I don't know how that's gonna get boring or old but yeah so that's an 8/10 pick it up you're not gonna waste your money on that and I do these videos also for mainly to so you guys don't waste your money out there people we want the THC we want the healing properties but we want something that also works something's gonna you know make us feel like it's working cuz you know they talk crap on opioids and they should but you take a vicodin you know you goddamn walk to the vicodin after a half-hour if you uh you're sitting here and smoking wrandell calrissian at 13 percent THC and you got serious stomach issues and Crohn's or you got some fibromyalgia or you can't sleep and you're smoking on 13% stuff no it's not gonna work for you even if you have zero tolerance it's not gonna do anything for you give it to my damn dog he won't do anything I didn't do it but he would and I'm saying like that's one of the reasons why these videos are very important and these items that these dispensaries are so expensive you can waste 500 hours right off the top of the bat she's trying things and that's on that's on a you know a fairly cheap level so anyway check it out get the Moxie cards check back here I'll give you some reviews give you some bug to actually try so you're not wasting your money and believe me you lil factly next up Gigi number four and Cresco i thought i GA 88 you guys remember that four song wars that was a strand back in like today for kids but anyway moxie cart the orange eight out of ten eighty four point whatever th sick it's gonna get your racket it's gonna heal you and you're gonna feel like you just took a big split aside of the life all right take care", "Syoi4J3p-Hc": "shabbat shalom [ __ ] seeing what's on the inside of si cell cartridges alright welcome so in this video what I wanted to do is examine what is on the inside of what are known to be si cell cartridges part of why I wanted to do this video is I myself was curious what they have on the inside like I'm not just too know-it-all I'm not here to tell you what it is but I am here to show you we did just want to break down legally purchase cartridges to determine ultimately what is on the inside and how it functions [Music] [Music] there's the cotton wick it is a cotton wick with leaves and a ceramic coil so that's why you generally don't get a burnt flavor when it goes out the ceramic coil just doesn't burn the cup but sometimes if your lead is in contact with the cotton you will have a burnt taste with your cartridge when it goes out some do not have the cotton wick and they'll actually have a very porous ceramic wick as well as a ceramic coil usually all one piece of coil wick together but it is common to have a ceramic Clos with cotton but you don't want a cotton wick in a wire coil because the liquid is too viscous to soak into the cob bacha loan [ __ ] [Music] up there [Music] [Applause] [Music] did you guys have fun I know I did of all the things you know and all the things you do remember to be safe out there alright bye you", "FyItrwWgcnM": "[Music]", "qnJnuDTWlms": "hello everybody my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin butts if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading the manual so I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece their two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you have any questions feel free to ask again my name is jay and i know this was helpful to you have a good day", "WWjqB54ywSQ": "so this is the stuff I use to make my big cartridges true terpenes extract liqueur a terpenes from true terpenes some extract grown right here in michigan and this is what I get all's you do is you take your concentrate put it on a warm plate let it liquefy then add a little bit of extract liquefier and a little bit of your terpenes about 10 to 15 percent by weight but it varies depending on each concentrate you get but this is what", "yMTDAQVqvwc": "[Music] [Music] let me get that [Music] what's going on guys welcome back to another [ __ ] video so in this video today i'm gonna be reviewing one of my good friends uh his product you know uh he does uh cartridges and he does concentrate some wax and stuff like that but today i'm gonna review his his pen you know his disposable pen i just got it right here that's how it looks feel me this is disposable [Music] a hybrid avion little thing another thing to cover put down all right check it out right here off the back i like the way that he has the setup his colorful he has his logo of your nest tracks [Music] you feel me look at the the wax though i don't know you guys can see it though hello clear i feel means like if they want nothing but you can tell the bubble doesn't move stays in the same place or something good you know because there's a lot of there's a lot of constant trains man that whenever you go like this you put it upside down the concentrate goes how fast but this is staying in the same place that's what i want good quality stuff you know with my boy shout out to my boy avion astrix and navionetta vapes we're gonna give it a little try see how it is feel me i forgot what it was uh let me see the the strain it's lab tested pesticides free everything you feel me 93 premium tac oil half gram star fruit chew that's what it's called star fruit chew what do you guys think i like i like the the packaging the packaging is cool you know whenever you're done you know you can put it back again stuff but hold on give me a quick second real quick i'm gonna fix the camera put it down right here real quick you're gonna be good i'm good all right no god please no no no no so off the bed i like i like the colorful one you know this possible my bad so whenever you're done with it you know whenever you finish this it's an easy throw away you know no batteries or nothing that's already charged whatever it needs to you know you know like it it's a it attracts your attention when it'd be like oh that's not explain what it is you know whenever you're on public or something like that you know like you pull it out you pop it out of your pocket and stuff you'll be like oh [ __ ] what's this you know [ __ ] uh my voice [ __ ] i'm real please you feel me but let's try it out let's see how it is see if i can be able to go blinker you guys think i'm gonna be doing blinker what do you guys think blink it or no blinker i'm blinking [Applause] [Music] wow okay this is my first time trying this flavor i tried another pan another flavor before it's good it's real good whoa oh god damn give me a break yes so first thing [Music] the bubble still hasn't moved it's still sitting there it's slowly going up but it's taking time um you start blowing it out and stuff that's when you know like oh okay that's when you're actually gonna feel the the percentage you know the 93 percent you know tc oil you don't feel me that should just smack you you know [Music] it's pure it's not it doesn't burn like at all doesn't like literally don't burn because there's some pans out there you know that whenever you hit it you know it burns you because the fact that it's made it's made with like butane or whatever else that you know what i mean but this one off the bat i like it especially because it doesn't burn my throat or it doesn't bother me like i start coughing a lot and a lot you feel me like i could already feel it like i could already feel my eyes coming a little low you know when it's about it's already kicking in um [Music] i got no complaints man you know it's a flavor 10 out of 10. uh like he said it himself you know it's a quality over quantity you feel me this right here some good stuff it's clear as well too like i look clear and looks still hasn't gone to the top you know let's try another one try another blinker pretty good [Music] like what's khalifa says if you ain't coughing you ain't smoking me personally i'm the type of dude that whatever if i'm smoking weed if i'm smoking wax i'm smoking cartridges i'll cough i don't know it's just me you know i just cough a lot but to be honest they [Music] this is actually pretty pretty good and it's max i just took two hits off this right now in the second already got it on a good one okay i did a little blinker you know i don't know most of you guys don't even do blinkers so it might not you know um it doesn't really take a lot to blink it it takes like i have a time today matter of fact let's time it let's time it we're gonna we're gonna see how how many seconds it takes to blink it because i know i tried all the different products and it takes a little while to blink you know so this one i think i think like uh i think what this one is is if you blink it's like a good good proper pit for um you know um so that that's that's the reason why it probably doesn't you know it doesn't take long to blink you know and it blinks a little bit but i would say like five seconds you know because i know the products blink at nine seconds you know but this right here i think whenever you blink it that's the accurate uh the accurate take a hit out of this you know what i mean so whenever you take a hit out of a pen like the correct way to take a pen i think it's whenever you blink this pin that's the that's the one hit that it's actually like oh you know like oh that's a good ass hit you know like for this pen so let's check it out looking right here clock stop watch stopwatch and i won't blink it again well hold on let me get something to drink because i gotta get something to drink i'm already getting that client month already you know because oh and by the way it's the first hit of the day this is this is the first time the first high of the day and um i could tell you i'm pretty [ __ ] smacking now already you know i got calling mom going on a little bit you know first first day i got two blinkers um my eyes my eyes are on that stage already that they're going low i'm not pretty sure you can see but my eyes don't really get rid of much you know but i could tell you this though i'm already stoned it's i've taken two blinkers and once them whenever i'm smoking i like to have something to drink water or soda or whatever it is you know but i actually whenever i'm smoking i always have something to drink and i mean i recommend it for everybody i mean not everybody you know but i i me personally i like having every time i smoke something to drink you know but [Music] let's take another blinker you know just in case whenever i feel like ah i got a little cotton mouth you know drink out of my little water a little shape you know i don't have to drink a lot you know just a little simple little simple sip because another bling is going to be the third blinker right now i'm gonna try to do five but this time i'm gonna time it i got the time right here next to me and one more time uh how long does it take to do a blinker on the albion vapes you guys will see start [Music] it was actually seven [Music] but since i stopped it i took like a like a second to stop it because i was actually trying to press it but since i have those cover you know i'm gonna push down a little harder you know but it blinks at seven seconds so i was off by two seconds but i think it's i think i think that's a good accurate time you know so for somebody to blink it and to get a little good hit you know good a good good decent hit you know because there's a lot of people that don't even blink from you know that would just go like this you know what i mean and the act gives you that head don't get me wrong you could get a big head like that but if you want like a actual hit blink it try to blink it you know but i like i like the quality i like the the quality of the of the oil um the pen itself is nice it's small you know it's not that big you know it fits on your pocket if it's wherever you know if you have a little pocket here here fit your hair so it's small that's what's good about it you know this is a half gram though this is not a program low for gram pot like a little bigger but this is a half gram or something [Music] i don't know what i put together see i'm already stoned [Music] uh star fruit shook so it's star fruit shoot the name of it and it's a hybrid it's a 50 and 50 percent of the uso let's go for the fifth blinker for the weekend this right here it's good i recommend it for you guys it's smooth it doesn't burn as much and you can it's portable you could [ __ ] take this in your pocket without them and it's smart doesn't really take a lot of big room you know it's a small little thing like i mean it's not small you know compared to my hand you know so it's pretty small and i've been smoking pens you know different ones different branded ones you know um they're all a little longer and stuff you know but off the bat this is like a catchy one you know because the fact that it has all the colors you know it's like a rainbow color is you know it's a catchy you know i mean it's a good it's a well done um [Music] yeah portable thing [Music] shout out to my boy though for the car today he'd be doing some good some good good [ __ ] he got some wax i'm gonna do a video i'll reviewing his wax a little stronger you know to fire fire you know today's video was just about this avion vape review and i recommend it you guys might check it out though has his initials right here on the bottom and right in the bottom so it's good you know decent i like the the color the color of it rainbow color it's a little attractive you know and the packaging packaging is sick which we are going to look right here down here i don't know if you guys can see it but it has an instagram name and then it tells you right here pesticide free is lab tested and stuff like that so check it out because his uh instagram is down there too as well and his packaging is tight let's tie it i like it i like it oh and you could open it from any side you want so it has these little things right here when you open it yeah so you can open it from right here and do it a little bit that's two of these right you could open it from the inside you want i like the packaging i like the panel itself so whenever this is whenever you're done with this it's easily you could throw it away you know but it lasted you like i mean if it's just by yourself and not like this session with everybody you know well that's too easily like me it lasted me three days because it's just me myself and kind of like my brother and stuff you know and my cousin it lasted me three days and we're heavy consumers you know but three days to four days if you're by yourself message your four days and it gets smacked you're good there's some good [ __ ] it's a good product [Music] wait before i leave before this video is finished [Music] let's do it i'm gonna die i'll probably die how far you start coughing like crazier and now you guys are about to see that [ __ ] but it's all good you know i'm gonna do this i'm gonna try this i haven't tried it you know and i'm about to try it let's see it's like two blinkers in one hand all right let's try it ready oh i'm a little nervous [Music] i don't know how it sometimes whenever you guys like put a little challenge in between you guys friends and stuff like you guys don't feel like nervous whenever you're gonna take like a big hit or you're gonna take like you know yeah whenever you're gonna take a big hill or you're gonna take a big head out of the joint out of the blunt whatever you guys are smoking you know but like you guys don't get like a little like everything like your heart starts like bumping you know like adrenaline like just to [ __ ] take a hit and [ __ ] [Music] yeah cause you know you're about to die when you're already [ __ ] done taking the head you know what i mean you shouldn't start coughing your lungs out but that's what i'm gonna do right now that's what so i'm not looking forward to it but let's try it you know the lives you know because it's covered [Music] let's call it it's just me myself but here it goes this is gonna be a fifth hit and if i do two i mean it's gonna count like seven but it's actually gonna be five i mean six my back it's gonna be six if i take this one this too but see how it goes oh [ __ ] smells like what are you smoking out of two blinkers and one hit smacks yasabin follow my boy on instagram i'll leave his instagram down below if you guys want to check out what he has his product but he has some clothing he he has his wax but i'll leave his link down

it's just a 5 click on and off so I'm going to click it 5 times and then I should be good yeah we're rolling because I can hear that that sizzling something for some people you are listening for that sizzling sound nothing's wrong with that at all it's just burnin juice okay so if it's still not working and your battery is turned on and the tanks just not firing don't tighten the tank down any tighter if it's not making connection what you need to do is this is pretty simple if you can notice right here in the center there is actually a connector pin and that's what makes connection with the battery just from daily use putting tanks on and off that pin can actually become compressed down into that rubber and if that happens all you need to do to make a better connection just take a standard paperclip or whatever you have on hand something that's got a little bit of strength in it and it's nice and thin and we're just going to take it and we are going to lift that post up out of the rubber just enough to make a better connection No there you go and that's about how far you want to push it up and that will solve a lot of problems right there and now when you put the tank on you will notice it tie it in a little bit it'll give a little bit you'll have more resistance when it tightens but still don't over tighten the tank to the battery because if you do you'll just cause a lot of leakage and that's another thing if you are noticing that there's just a ton of liquid and the battery and it's just flooding all out around here you've probably over tightened your tank to the battery and compress that wick and seal on the inside and everything's just leaking out the bottom which is also how you can compress the weight or compress that out and connect your pin on the inside see I'm just barely screw so now that I've pulled the post up and put the tank back on you can hear it sizzling so we are all working now now if there's still something wrong with the battery and you just can't get it to work or you feel like it's not charging or anything like that it might be an issue with the charging cable it's when you plug in the battery to the charging cable and it does not do this bring it in so we can test it and see which component is going wrong it should when you plug in the battery it should go red and the light should stay on and then in between four hours and a full night it should go to green letting you know it's charged if it's just staying green all the time if it's showing you orange reviewing something funky bring it in and we'll actually figure out which piece is going on and it might be the wall adapter or it might be the cord and we can only really diagnose that in the store okay so now I'm going to take the battery off and if there's something else wrong with the battery the it could be these batteries do have actually a timer cutoff okay if I hold this button for longer than about five seconds generally just gonna keep on holding it because you know you're taking a big long draw off this battery at this time it's gonna flash a couple times which a lot of people know that means a battery is dead and it's gonna shut off but in just a few they'll be ready to vape again and that is just from people taking really long draws and the batteries timing out it's a safety precaution to avoid it doing that all you have to do is while you're vaping just cycle the button every second or so that way you can get those nice big long lung kits that you're looking for and if there's still something going on funky with the battery bring it and we can figure out what's going on with it and that's pretty much everything for the battery that you might be experiencing okay everything else might be with the tank if you're noticing that you're just getting a lot of gurgling and bubbling think about the last time you put a q-tip down it if you haven't put a q-tip down it in awhile you might have a lot of extra condensation that's making it act like it's flooded and all you have to do is take the q-tip run it down the post until you feel it stop turn it upside down so you can let gravity do all the work and then all of the extra condensation that might have been flooding your tank will be on that q-tip this tank I can tell it's been a little while since it's been heated but now when I hit this it's probably going to hit like a champ if you're still having some issues gurgling there's probably something going on inside of the tank if it's not broken okay so I'm going to take a fresh tank and I'm going to take it apart when you take apart a tank there are a few things that you're looking for okay most of it has to do with this wick and coil this piece right here okay I want you to notice that there are three seals okay there's one on the bottom one in the center and one on top as well as little tiny wick here if you're wet if your wick and coil is screwed in that is the first most important thing always make sure that waking coil is screwed in if you're missing any four of these pieces right here most importantly the one on top this top gasket you will have a lot of leakage you will have bubbling up into the you'll be basically vaping juice or if you're if you've lost this this little link right here you'll be vaping straight juice and if you're missing either these bottom seals you'll probably have a little bit of leakage seals are definitely there for a reason and if you have lost any of them if you've lost the wick or the gasket on top of the link you just need a new wick and we do sell the seals for the base in this store so if it's if everything's there and is looking good then you shouldn't have any problems with that something else must be going on okay if you're still having issues more specifically that you just can't get it draw off this and it's really really tight make sure you've changed your wick and coil if you've changed your weekend coil within the last week and it's still giving you a really really tight draw there might be something else going on first thing you want to do is you want to check down this center post in the center post a lot of times we put down q-tips and we forget that the cue that somebody cotton comes off and that gets left in this center tube so that might be blocking your airway or just from something else of your pocket or your purse or something that's gotten launched in there so just look through that and make sure that's straight through and you can see all the way through it if it's still tight what it might be is when I put this together there are air holes on this okay you might either be covering these air holes when you vape because it's really easy to check your finger placement if while you're holding the button you've also got another finger somehow covering one of those holes you're gonna get it much you're gonna get a much tighter vape or the holes might actually be clogged up and if they're clogged up all you have to do is actually I've got a straight pin on me all you need to do is just take a standard straight pin or whatever you have that's small enough to do it and just take it and poke it through all of the holes and there are three air holes on this because a lot of times went in debris just from being in your pocket will get stuck in those air not let you fake through it okay if you're still having issues you do have to take into consideration this is a personal vaporizing device and they go through a lot of wear and tear us ladies we put them in our personal and put everything on top of them and gentlemen you put them in your pocket and you sit down and you might have cracked a tank or you might acredited out the battery somehow if you notice around the battery that it's not working and you've noticed that it's starting to pull apart right here then that means at some point in time that batteries have been pulled apart and if you've seen any wires or anything and stuck it back together and it still works it might not last you forever it's definitely gonna be something that at any point in time it can ground out or if you've noticed or if you remember having one good drop it might actually damage some of the components on the inside he might have grounded out your battery so that could be a reason why your battery is not working and if your tank is still just leaking and you can't find the source look around some of the places where cracks get ahead and I know specifically on this tank right here they get hit right here along the chrome lines to where you can't see them and they start to pull apart and that's where the leakage is but other than that I can't really think of anything else that you might need to know about troubleshooting this if you do have any other questions or concerns definitely drop by the store and lokan will be able to figure out what's going on with that but in conclusion we are open 7 days a week if you are still having any issues with troubleshooting or I've been Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. we also have our website which is www.hyken.com into this store because we can't actually see what's going on all over the phone other than that have a great day I hope you're having a good baby experience and vape on you"}
