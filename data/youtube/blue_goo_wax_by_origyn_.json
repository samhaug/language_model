{"Pd0sxPXqGek": "every one this time we're going to have some whimsical fun and make this bench from white concrete epoxy and crayons or what I'm calling cray-cray [Music] this time I've got Sean Boyd here from Sean Boyd made this he's got a great channel where he designs all kinds of really cool furniture so definitely check them out when you're done here he's been here about a week and we've collaborated on a couple projects including this one which was really a fun design yeah this was awesome before I got here Mike came up with this design it's got this sweet concrete top and we ended up doing this kind of crazy whimsical colored crayon pour yeah and then so Sean kind of chipped in and made these leg designs that are actually trying to make this a little bit more of a respectable design and not just so much I don't know over-the-top Sean's actually about to head out to Iceland on a vacation I'm gonna actually be pouring epoxy over this so we're not quite done we're almost there it's a really fun project we had a lot of fun let's get to it [Music] as usual I'm making the concrete form from melamine I decided to try using Craig's new adaptive cutting system to break down the melamine instead of using my table saw like and normally do more on the Craig adaptive cutting system later when Sean and I were brainstorming projects he said he wanted to learn the ropes with concrete it had this idea to do something with melted crayons were inlaid into white concrete and the idea of doing a large drip shaped inlay popped into mind so I went into affinity designer and sketched out the drip pattern I then used the same process that I showed in my last video to import the SVG file generated by infinity into inventables free easel software so I could cut out a foam form on my inventables x-carve C&C the more I use the x-carve more I can tell you that having it is just a game-changer as far as opening up design possibilities link in the description below if you want to check it out or sign up for a free and Venables easel account I wanted the drip inlay to be 3/8 inches thick but all I had on hand was 1/2 inch foam so I used the x-carve to first reduce the height of the foam to 3/8 inches inside the drip pattern before going around the edges to cut out the drip shape hey now I've got about a 3/8 inch foam form cut out here and we're gonna throw that into the form put it all together and get ready to pour some concrete with Sean Boyd tomorrow oh yeah and we're also gonna throw some polycrylic on this so that it's sealed and releases from the concrete a little easier when we're done the assembly of the form is really simple for this one hot glue at the corners and drywall screws all around [Music] and then use general purpose spray adhesive to attach the foam I think general purpose adhesive is better than something with a stronger hold for this particular job it's strong enough to hold up during the poor but makes it D molding much easier than it would be with a heavier duty adhesive and now it's time for another episode of Kult talk which is the same as every episode of Kult talk I apply a layer of pay strikes to the melamine laid out in under hundreds in silico culprit and found ball - overall the Koch line to the found ball tube which - there's close to the sides leave a clean line over the seam and the layer patience makes it easy to peel the excess caulk away once cure is leaving a perfect Koch line and that's it for this episode of Koch talk and once again we're following up call talked with the concrete spray tradition of Dexter fine the shop [Music] the next day Sean arrived in Chicago and we were super amped to get to the shop part of the reason we decided to take on this fairly simple project was that so Sean an extremely skilled woodworker could expand his skill set and try his hand at spraying employing glass fiber reinforced concrete Sean sprayed a thin face coat which will result in a really clean pinhole free surface we'd cover the top edges of the form with painters tape before we sprayed so we removed it after the face coats started to firm up this will help us get a flat bottom to the bench that goes just to the top edge of the form but not over it next we mix up the GF RC back coat which is the same as the face coat but with glass fibers added we also added a bit of plasticizer to the mix which is going to make it more flowable so the concrete is self levelling in the four [Music] we filled the form about halfway packed everything in by hand and then added an AR glass scrim which is made from the same glass fibers that we added to the mix but is in a mesh form this is going to add a lot of strength to the bench I came back about 45 minutes after report and used a magnesium float to hand trowel the concrete this will give the underside of the bench a nice smooth feel and reduce the amount of post-processing we need to do after the concrete cures overnight before removing the concrete from the form we use the sides of the form as level guides so we could sand the bottom of the bench perfectly flat using diamond hand sanding pads then it was finally time to D mold and find out what the concrete surface looked like aka concrete [ __ ] so first blip in the process here apparently had something to my shoe and stepped on the form while we are working because there was a footprint transferred onto the surface of the concrete fortunately the footprint sanded off really easily and turned it out to be something we could just laugh about one small step for Mike and Shawn one giant leap for crane [ __ ] your tables but then gave the concrete a quick wet hand sanding with 400 grit paper and applied some acrylic concrete sealer we'll see him again later but I wanted to pre seal before doing the melted crayon inlay I'd done some experiments with melted crayon and white concrete and found that stray drips of melted crayon could stain unprotected concrete a shared video those experiments over on instagram if you want more melty crayon goodness after you watch this video crayons are basically colored wax so they aren't exactly a strong solid surface because of this we only want a thin layer of crayon but we also want the crammed fairly close to the top of the bench for aesthetic reasons to balance these considerations we decided to make in an epoxy crayons sandwich we decided to use total boat high-performance two-to-one epoxy with slow hardener even with the slow hardener the epoxy was set up enough for crayon melting action after about 6 hours however the slow hardener gave us enough working time with the epoxy to use a vacuum pot to remove most of the bubbles before pouring the epoxy into the kind so we've got the first layer of epoxy into the concrete and it's curing and now for the star of the show we're gonna melt some crayons over that and then the last thing we'll do is put another thin layer of epoxy on top of the crayons to protect it I'm planning to do a couple of really cool epoxy crayon projects so I picked up this huge classroom pack of crayons probably overkill but the four year old of me just couldn't help it [Music] one thing I found during my earlier melted crayon experience was that not all color combos are created equal the right color combo can be magic but the wrong colors can turn into mud so Shawn and I decided to have some fun experimenting with the colors in the pack over the 63 colours we decided to separately choose sets melt them and then pick the best of our tests ultimately we found that lighter hues work best darker greens blues and Red's were more likely to mix to a muddy unattractive color so we left those out of our final selection once we were happy with the color combo we chopped up the crayons in small pieces one surprising thing is just how far the melted crayons will stretch I really wanted a thumbnail photo proclaiming that I turned a thousand crayons into a bench small problem though this thing only took about 18 crayons next we place the crayon bits into the concrete creating a color spectrum that started with pink and orange tips and blend it into light pastel blues and greens has reached the edge of the bench we used heat guns to melt the crammed starting with a bit of distance between the heat gun and the crayons so that they wouldn't blow over and roll around out of place once the crayons had softened to the touch they stayed in place and we could move the gun closer to melt them faster [Music] since Shawn was leaving soon for his trip to Iceland we put the benchtop aside and turned our attention to the legs Shawn's woodworking skills are far greater than mine so now is my turn to learn from him one of the techniques he often uses is templating and in particular he's known for using templates to create furniture with some darn sexy legs so let's back up a minute Shawn started by sketching out a few design ideas by hand before he arrived we picked one we liked and then Shawn moved to the computer to recreate the design in fusion 360 we use the shape or plugin for fusion 360 to export the design to my shaper origin computer vision assisted router the origin is similar to a CNC but it's a handheld machine that's human operated the tape we laid down on the plywood allows the origin to see the workpiece so you can actually see the plywood on its touchscreen and can literally drop the design wherever you want on the plywood sheet to cut it out using its touchscreen you can kind of think of this like a Segway scooter for a router it keeps your cuts perfectly on line even if you veer off course by as much as 3/4 of an inch in other words this is some pretty mind-blowing space-age tech [Music] while the origin is really cool it does have limitations it's fairly slow and it takes a lot of stamina to cut out large pieces each pass around the leg takes about 5 minutes and we only cut about an eighth of an inch in each pass because of this we made two passes to cut a quarter inch deep for each leg we then use the jib saw to rough cut the rest of the way around the plywood cutting a bit wide of the origins original cut line so we could come back with a flush trim router bit to get the sides perfect I know you guys are itching to finish the legs and get to the epoxy pour but really quickly I want to show you the adaptive cutting system from Craig tools that you've been seeing throughout this video when I saw that Craig had come up with this amazing new innovative system I actually reached out to them about it because I just thought it was really really cool all the different components that come together between the tracks on the table and the accessories so really quickly I want to give you some highlights of all the different stuff this can do the system includes these versus tops which go into the precision machine holes on the project table now the tabletop holes are aligned with the track so that you can use these verse stops to make perfect parallel cuts perfect 90-degree cuts and perfect 45 degree miter just by putting them in the existing holes the system also includes these repetitive stop guides which allow you to make repetitive cross cuts and rip cuts so you can get all your pieces really easily at the same size the system also includes a miter guide which allows you to make angled cuts that are anywhere from 0 to 60 degrees so I know this was a bit longer than my normal sponsor Reed and I actually didn't have to do this as part of the deal with Craig they just gave me the system and said use it in a project but I didn't feel like I quite got to show you all the different things it could do throughout the build I did want to take a minute to just kind of show that and share it with all of you so if any of this is piqued your interest definitely go check it out I highly recommend it without further ado let's get back to the build so and then use the flush trim bit with the bits bearing aligned with the accurate portion of the edge cut by the Schaefer origin to trim the rest of the edge flush the bench needs to support the weight of a couple seated adults and for aesthetic reasons we also wanted to avoid using lower stretchers or cross bracing to achieve the look we wanted without sacrificing structural integrity we stack the plywood pieces for the legs and stretchers so they were 1.5 inches thick or two sheets of plywood after the wood glue set up on the legs we used the Domino to add loose Tennant's for connecting those pieces we did a test fit on the legs and sadly this is where Sean had to take off first trip the next day I glued up the legs while I'm doing that I've gotta ask do you subscribe to Sean's YouTube channel what's that you say you don't what is wrong with you he's an amazing designer there's a link in the search then just go check them out you'll thank me later I put the legs aside and move back to finishing off the top I cover the concrete around the epoxy inlay with painters tape however as I mentioned in my last video this turned out to be unnecessary for the epoxy top layer I'm using total boat fix that epoxy well thick-set can be poured to two inches deeper more that isn't the reason I chose it for this particular task it is also very low viscosity which basically means that the top will sit flatter than a thicker epoxy wood this lower surface tension means less excess epoxy when pouring up to the edge of the concrete and thus less sanding to get the cured epoxy level with the concrete after [Music] I think we've done the best that we can do over here getting a pretty level so we're just gonna let it set for a few hours it would still be very sort of liquidy a gummy I think after that and then we can pull the tape off after the epoxy cured I could remove the melamine pieces I've been using in conjunction with the top itself to create a epoxy form all that's left to do now is finishing I started by applying a slurry coat of the white concrete to patch up some imperfections in the surface I then dry sanded the concrete and epoxy from 120 grit up to 240 I've been wet sanded both surfaces through 400 grit and since 400 grit is as high as I want to go on the concrete I paused here to apply sealer to the concrete I let the concrete sealer cure overnight and then returned to finish the epoxy by wet sanding up to 5000 grit and then used a plastic polish for the final shine all that was left to do was apply finish to the legs I'm using a maker brand simple finish since I like the way it makes the plywood layers and the size pop out it's an oil with wax finish so it does yellow the plywood a bit I could see some folks like in a lighter look and going with the water-based finish instead but overall I'm pretty happy how this table came out I then use some construction adhesive to attach the legs to the concrete face [Music] and then it's time for the strength test everyone's gonna want to see [Music] [Music] this one was a little out there but I had a ton of fun I know Shauna and I had a good time if you dug it too then there's a whole list of concrete projects up there for you to check out I think you'll like those as well make sure to hit the subscribe and bele button if you haven't already hit the thumbs up button head over to Shawn's channel and subscribe there that's it for this time and I'll see you next time", "3dWpGk2lyeY": "hey everybody I am coming to you again on a totally random live chat here on Wednesday I thought I have a video that I have been eating to get up and it's been the video about talking about my three different kinds of wax that I use and what I use them for and I don't know why I haven't been able to record it so I figured I'll just do it live and we'll see how it goes and then I can save it for everybody so let's just jump right in I'm gonna get started and talk about the three different waxes that I use here in my space all three of them are star pill waxes I use the pink I'm just pan down here hi everybody and a pan down so you guys can see I use the pink star pill acts these are the beads this is not the blocks this is the newer polymer formula I have the blue polymer beads again beads not the blocks I also mixed this one with my star pill and then this is my third pot back here and this is just the star pill wax so you can see those all ready to go and I have those to start pull pots those are my favorites I love those ones let me get that back in place okay all right so people are constantly asking me about the three different waxes and I'm recording it this way just so that you guys know so that I can post it on YouTube later because everybody was asking me to record in the opposite direction so hopefully this isn't screwing it up for everybody hi okay so the three waxes the pink wax this pink blend or excuse me the polymer blend is a slightly tacky err formula then the blue wax so there's a difference in the way that this all looks obviously once it's on warmed up in the pot the pink wax is a much creamier wax it's not as clear it doesn't have that same kind of see-through kind of plasticky looking kind of consistency the pink wax is really great to use in areas where you have more fine hair so I like to use the pink wax on legs that have been waxed before arms that have been waxed before oh my gosh you guys I'm like so white awful handy has um so pink wax is great to pick up those baby fine hairs in areas that have been waxed before it's also really great for the face people really like to use it on the face for brows and lip and that peach fuzz right here in these areas it does a great job of picking up that hair because it is a little bit tackier it's a creamier formulation I do find that it dries faster so you have to be a little bit faster moving with this particular wax I posted a video for you guys the other day of a leg wax that I did on my poor husband who suffered through that that was the very first time so that leg wax I used that pink because I really wanted to show the versatility of it because so many people feel like the pink should you know is only usable in areas like the face or maybe the underarms but really it does a great job of picking up even those thicker coarser hairs on the leg but you absolutely have to make sure that you're getting back to that fat that stripped faster you can't just lay that one and then move on to the next one so when you're working in an area like a leg or an arm with the pink you're probably gonna go ahead and lay that strip and then remove that strip right away I primarily like to use that like I said on people who I have waxed before in larger areas who have finer hair that is growing in let's talk about the blue wax really quickly so let me just tell you the pot for my boot for my pink wax I have two you know what I need to turn this sorry guys that's just too hard for me to read or read everybody there we go hi sorry learning so my my big wax pot that has the pink in it is not a star pill pot it's by a different company and I am keeping this pot the temperature currently is about 60 degrees Celsius so this pot I find water runs quite a bit warmer so I keep it at a much lower temperature but it gives me this really great consistency that I find works really well for me so you can see when I pull that wax there's a good kind of little ribbon that happens there but it sits on top of the pot it doesn't just melt and go right in which always gives me a good idea about the you know the temperature of the wax and then so let's move on to my my blue mix here which is probably what you guys have seen me use a lot of this is my mixture of the blue star pill the beads the polymer blend and the star pill star soft so this is a star pill five and a half pound wax pot and it is currently at literally just like 77 degrees okay so I've had this pot on I've had it prepped since this morning and that's what I'm keeping it at currently and this again is that mix it's the mix of the polymer beads the blue and the star pill star soft so I love using this particular mix this blend on areas that have thicker coarser hairs that have not been waxed before like on the back on the chest even on the arms it works really really well that mixture that tackiness that's created by putting the star pill star soft into it allows me to lay multiple strips at a time so I can you can see there's still a good stretch in this strip right now a lot of people have difficulty with this particular blue racks drying too quickly on them and cracking when they remove it so I overcome that by adding the star pill star soft so this allows me to work very quickly and allows me to multitask so I can lay strips on both legs at the same time or if I'm working on the arm I can lay strips on both arms at the same time and that way I can keep moving so I'm laying one and then pulling one and laying one and pulling one versus at having to stick with one strip at a time and for me again the way that I achieve that is by adding the start pill star soft into the star pill blue polymer bead and I create that blend so backs chests arms it's really a great combination when you have that right consistency now some people may not have to add the start pill star soft and that's great for me I've needed to do that to be able to really work with the wax at that pace and that's really what keeps me kind of at that speed wax pace I guess can you add star soft to pink you know I get that question a lot actually I've not done it yet the reason I have not done it yet is because I haven't needed to because I do have the options I've not had to add it my only concern about adding the star pill star soft to the pink is just the difference in the in the kind of base formulation you know the pink wax is much creamier and it's already quite tacky so I I've not really kind of done that yet so I don't know if there's anybody out there who has you know mix the two together like let me know it'd be super curious I've just not needed to do it yet because the pink has worked for me in the areas that I use it without any problems like I mentioned before when I'm working with a pink I lay the pink and then I get right back to it I tend not to do multiple strips with the pink because it does set up a little bit faster and I'm usually working in a larger area and I just don't want the cracking so that's I've not done the pink in the star pill or the star saw so let me know if anybody has the star soft let's see here it is I'm keeping it right now just at 75 and I am I'm using it in my star pill pot I might actually go up a degree or two because I need to keep stirring it to keep that consistency the way that I want it but I used the star pill star soft for a handful of different purposes let me see if I can get this on my arm here I use the star soft on guests that I have never seen before if I have any you know concern about reaction sensitivity redness the star pill star soft is just so awesome because you don't have to worry about people having really any difficulties with it there's a bit of a learning curve I believe that it sets up a little bit differently you have to wait for it a little bit longer but for me it's kind of like my foolproof it's like a go-to that I'm gonna use this on somebody that I've not worked on before I always use it on the face this is my preference this is what I really like it stays quite tacky and pliable but it picks up both dark hairs and it also coarse hairs and it also picks up the baby fine ones so for me it's really versatile I love to use this on the underarms I find that that can be a really sensitized area so whether or not somebody ever comes in and shares with me that they have any sort of you know sensitivity I think because of all the chemicals and the deodorants that people use on their underarms the star pill star soft is an excellent direction to go I also use it for Brazilians I love it on Brazilians it does change kind of the pattern that I work with it changes the pace really that I can move at but I do find that the star pill starts off does an excellent job of picking up both kinds of hair and the soft fine hair the dark horse hair and I've made I'll a fewer strips when I am working with the star pill star soft on the Brazilian again it does take a little bit of a learning curve yeah you can't move quite as fast or at least I have found I can't move quite as quickly but I feel like I'll a fewer strips so the service doesn't really take that much longer so I've definitely used the star pill sauce star soft on the rest of the body as well if I'm having difficulty for some reason picking up some hair I find that the star pill star soft is why do I always say start pill star soft you guys know what I'm talking about sorry the star soft the star soft is a little bit less sensitive to moisture if that makes any sense so in underarms or if I'm working on someone's Brazilian and they're perspiring I don't have the same concern about the wax drying and cracking and then not being able to remove the hairs in the same way so for me I prefer to use that you know the star soft whereas if I'm working with the pink or if I'm working with the blue mix it tends to be a little bit more reactive and dry a lot faster when it comes in contact with moisture so I don't know that's just my experience I don't know if anybody else has had that experience so in any case and seeing some people are using the pink for the Brazilians in the face awesome see people mix the pink and the blue together I've not seen that I'm not really sure exactly why somebody would mix them together the properties of the pink that creamy kind of consistency the tackiness I'm not sure what the what somebody would gain by mixing it with the blue I'm not really sure so if anybody has seen that or done that please let me know tell me what you're thinking there because I'd be super curious to see where you're using it so I'll just review really quickly again I'll go back the pink the beads the polymer blend the pink I like to use on guests that I have seen a couple of times that I'm looking to for a tackier kind of creamier wax I do really pretty much lay this strip and then remove the strip right away I'm not lying multiple strips oftentimes if I'm working on somebody who has say smaller arms or smaller legs and I'm not laying a huge amount of wax sometimes I can lay more than one but I find that this one works better for me on people who don't need I don't need to be moving quite as quickly so if I can lay a strip and pull it and I'm good to go but it picks up really nice fine hairs it does a good job of picking up coursers as well but for me I use this for slightly tackier to really get those hairs that might be a little bit more difficult that have already been waxed and they are already kind of conditioned to the process the the blue I love to use this on legs and arms and backs and chests that they're just coming in coarse hair or if I've been seeing them for a while and they still have really coarse resistant hair the the blue mix is just my go-to it does a great job of really shrink wrapping the hair grabbing it it glides onto the skin so beautifully it's kind of hard to find another wax that spreads the way that the blue does in my opinion so I love to use that on you know large areas when I'm working quickly when I want to lay more than one strip at a time that's where I go I go to my blue polymer blend and the star pill star soft mix it's kind of a jam and then the star soft itself I remember this time the star soft you'll always find me using it on the face you'll always find me using it on Brazilians I do like to use it on underarms as well and find that it picks up all manner of hair and it just deals with that real sensitive area very easily so people are constantly asking about what I use the different waxes for and that's pretty much it don't feel pigeon-holed don't feel like you can't use the wax in lots of different areas like I've said I have certainly used the pink on the face and on the underarms and Brazilians I've used the blue on the entire body I think at this point I've used the star soft on the entire body so you know play with it see what works for you but in general that's kind of how I use the wax my recommendation always for people who are just starting with the waxes is to always start with the blue beads I feel like that is the best wax to start with for someone who's either a newer waxer or just getting used to the star start pill product I think it's the most user-friendly and its cost effective and then after you work with a star the blue I think then the pink is probably next this is going to give you a little bit more versatility might help you pick up hairs in areas where you were struggling before with the blue if it wasn't grabbing in the baby fine hairs and the pink has a lot more tackiness to it and then after you've worked with both of those waxes then my recommendation is to go to the star soft the star soft just has a slightly different learning curve and requires a little bit more patience and kind of an understanding of you know the wax itself but I love them I love all three of them and that's pretty much how I use them so I didn't want this to be a long one just want to make sure that I had an opportunity to kind of share with you guys you know how I'm using the products and kind of where I like to use them but like I said don't be afraid to use them where you need to use them because I you know everybody's dealing with a different circumstance if I was dealing with different hair body types room temperatures all of those kinds of things so have fun and explore with it I'd love to hear if anybody has mixed to the star soft into their um the pink polymer blend that'd be cool to hear if anybody did that and I've never mixed the blue and the pink together but if somebody has and they want to share kind of their experience with that then let me know hopefully that was helpful you guys thanks for tuning in I'm gonna go ahead and put this in my my highlights and I'll save it for everybody so they have a chance to take a peek at it and if you have any more questions let me know Thanks", "JlsmEzLg4-U": "hi Eric here without a pro at it Lake Tahoe Waterman's landing here going to show you how to clean your board and take off all the stuff marks with blue goo we also see that it will take off all these this oils and this type of stuff here ok this is this dirt and everything on the boards i'm going to show you real quick shake the bottle just apply it to the to the bore the surface use your damp sponge bring it on down and then you can see how it just just like magic fix all of that dirt all of the scuff marks off the side of your floor it'll bring the color back it takes oxidation out of your board it's amazing how this stuff works also it's environmentally friendly with people who would like that so we just clean the board like that now it's all completely gone now we're going to use a rag to wipe it off you can see voila marks are gone scuff marks the extreme kream high-performance bottom coating it's more slicker than water and we're getting over fifteen percent less drag on this product and seals up the bottom protects it and gives you the fastest surface you could possibly have on the bottom of your board shake the bottle well apply it just like it did the blue goo just little dots down the board that's all you need to do go down the board like this is all you need a little goes a long way with extreme kream this particular bottle here will probably do on this 14 foot board you probably get about five or six applications of a product out of here so it's a very very concentrated problem take your damp sponge again I use another sponge it's always better to use two sponges and now all you have to do is rub it on kind of like you would a like you're watching your car anything that this is not a wax it's a polymer completely different don't confuse it with a wax but you rub it on just like a wax the same type of principle and make sure you cope old board give it all on there really nice I get the rails get all of those any part of the board that's going through the water that's going to be in the water running through the wall you want to make sure you cut with the board rule up with extreme kream real well so you're going to wipe it on nice like this and you'll see it's kind of getting hazy and it's it will dry to a haze there we go you could also make sure you do your rails you do the fin you can do your leash anything that's dragging in the water this stuff will work and will help you and increase your speed your time will get better everything's be amazing so we rub it on your back now best to let it dry a few minutes before you let it sit overnight actually you let it sit overnight what it's going to do is bond even better on the surface and this is going to last approximately two months on the circles a lot of our racers and whatnot and the elite paddlers actually put on this maybe every race or every other race because they want to make sure they have the fastest surf as possible so anyway now it's drying like this and you could actually apply extreme kream just right before your race if you'd like to to just make sure to drive a little bit and just like it is now now we're going to wipe it on that's all we do take your nice soft cloth like the board and you feel as you wipe with your rag you'll feel the slickness and you'll feel it coming off you feel how nice is the board feels really nice give you a nice clean beautiful surface for your boy", "5Gv2VguAjbE": "the body so I just catches nml today the blue wax I want to give this a kind and I'm going to pour it in this eat it it so this probably my first time trying this out and see how this go I've used the Brazilian wax the one crop Sally and that way I really didn't like that wax the wax was like rough when you put it on one is the kind of to night you have to peel off but it gets too hard so I heard about this and I heard that it it's not really harsh to the skin that it doesn't take off the first layer of your your skin so when you wax with it it just takes off the hairs it doesn't take out your skin with it so so the fattest out and I want to pour it in there and see how we go so I had my wax warmer here and I'm going to pour the beef in this tin can and place the tin can inside here so I can warm it up [Applause] Wow that much now I'm going to place this in noon and let it warm up [Music] okay now it's melted I put it on high setting so it can melt the beads I'm not going to test it on my skin just yet I'm going to wait and put it on medium heat so I can cool down and I will test it on my skin you guys so I think it's you know cool enough now put a little thicker so I'm going to give it a try I'm going to try it on my arm [Music] let's try up a little on a pillar from this and gotta make sure you pull the skin pull some hairs you can see the hairs all the way [Music] didn't even hurt try another one I a spot right here sorry here you let that dry okay so I want to take it and kind of lift it up oh look it took the hairs playing mmm you can actually see the hairs see the hairs really like of this on my arm but you can actually see the hairs try another piece I do a big piece I want to do this right here [Music] now try not try now leave it up press that in okay guys so you really can see the hairs through it actually works really good so I recommend these these work really good it doesn't hurt painless but just don't go slow like how to like go really quick you won't feel animal but if you go really slow you'll feel the hair is to pull out but it's not as bad as the regular wax the regular wax is so painful but this one even if you go slow it doesn't even hurt I recommend this I give it a thumbs up so I want to thank you guys for watching and experience this with me so I will see you guys in the next video bye I'm the [ __ ] guys [Music]", "23Kbp1zWQfw": "hello everyone today's video is all about waxing I've been waxing my underarms and legs for about six months now I think and I've really been enjoying it it's so much better than shaving in my opinion I get a lot of razor burn and this just takes care of it and everything's really smooth so I'm gonna show you how I do it I'm warning you now that I'm going to show you on my own length and yes I'm wearing shorts so before we get into that oh my god is she naked no I'm not naked I'm wearing shorts and a tank top if you don't want to see my legs click off this video because I'm gonna showing you my legs so all you need is a hard wax which I like this one this is the serval circle blue beads and see that they're just like little beads and they melt down they also have a sensitive skin one that's like a pink one and they have a orange one too which I don't exactly know what that one's for but I will link everything below for you and then I use this wax pot which is disgusting right now but this is from Gigi and it's just a simple wax pot it just has a low to high setting and you just plug it in and it melts your wax super simple not that expensive and then I use baby oil to choose my legs after I'm done just because I do have sensitive skin and it does help to calm the redness that I get after my waxes so if you want to see how I wax my legs super easy simple just keep watching okay so here's my leg and the wax pot is right over here and I'm sitting on a towel I have a designated waxing towel because you don't want to get this on your floor just in case so so you can see the wax pot let me see I'm gonna move the wax pot right here so you can see what I'm doing so I just take my little popsicle stick grab kind of a decent amount of wax and then I okay so I could have a decent man wax I scrape the bottom and then I just push it down start at the top and push it down and this technique took me some time getting used to because it's not the easiest thing you want a thin layer but thick enough layer that it won't break so you just keep doing that and pushing it down and I like to make a big line cuz then it's just over and done with and then at the bottom you just want to kind of plop a decent amount at the bottom so that way when it hardens you flick it up and it's easier to grab onto and then you just wait so you have to wait a good I would say 30 seconds until this fully hardens and you can see it's thick enough that you can't see my skin through it a little bit there which might be too thin so I'm just gonna add a little bit more wax on to that spot because if the wax is too thin it will break so then you can just kind of touch it and if it's sticky to the touch it's not set yet so you just kind of gotta wait okay so it seems hard enough to peel off so what you do is you just start from the bottom and you make a little like knob that you can pull little flap and then you just keep your skin taut and you pull against your hair like that so let me try a different angle so you can try to see it a different way okay so I'm going to try this angle and put my next line right here and on one thing to note is that you want to go up that or with the hairs in which direction they're going in you want to push the wax down that way and pull in the opposite so I just take the glove stir it up here and push it down set up here push it and this does take a little while to be used to I'm still not perfect on my technique maybe a lot better this then I am but I am getting better it just takes practice then I'm just gonna kind of go over the light spots and make a good slap at the bottom while that's waiting I'm just going to put another line over here because well that one's drying then I can just work on another one and then that can drive while I peel off the other one so it just goes a little bit faster and now this one's dry so you just do the same thing and see how it's still sticky so it's not ready for ya here you and you'll get some lines right here light of the wax set maybe you left behind but that's okay because oil will take that off or you can just kind of pick at it and then yeah I'm just going to keep going you my hair is here are growing in a different way for growing sideways so I'm going with the hair growth sideways up my leg okay that's it and you can see that I still have some wax on my legs and I just kind of put some baby oil on my legs and it starts to rub right off so that will be fine and then it the baby oil also helps to soothe the life and maybe do it once every three weeks probably and they just look so much more smooth wax so thanks for watching guys be sure to subscribe to my channel and like this video bye", "Fl_4bQuJkqc": "guys so today I'm going to be reviewing these products that I got from a company called star pill alright they are a wax company so this is their mini tub of blue film wax beads it is a painless wax system okay and this is their star pill mini facial warmer with a temperature dial that you can change up and down okay alright so you can make the wax hotter or you know warmer or just cool it down completely so you can clean it alright so what I'm going to do today is show you guys how I'm going to try this out and since it's such a nice day at my home I'm going to do this outside okay so yeah I'm going to use this today show you guys how it works for me for the first time I have not used it all the wires are still together so you will have to plug this in for the mini facial warmer to work okay I did not get any specialist or anything like that but you can always go to the dollar store and get some of these which are only $1 and you get a whole bunch I keep a lot of them because I wax a lot I've been real curious about these wax beads I'm going to open it up and show you guys how it looks so this is how the beads look aren't a date pretty my kids thought that they were edible which they are not they're not edible don't eat them alright and this is the blue color I'm going to plug this up right here and that's how you take off the top this is the inside of the mini facial warmer it's a good amount of space for you to put in a lot of wax so I'll put the cover on the side and I'm just going to plug this up on the outside I have outlets on the outside so I'm just going to plug this up out here so we can see how this looks in some natural lighting don't you love natural lighting and I love natural lighting guys okay so I had a plug up oh no I'm gonna hey long see if it comes on no something's wrong Oh yep okay so I hope you could see that all right so I hope you can see that I couldn't see it with the sunlight but it's on I'm going to put it to the highest setting to kind of warm it up a bit faster it is getting warm on the inside I'm in there alright you guys so this is how the wax looks inside of the mini facial start the warmer all right it's going to take about 10 to 15 minutes maybe 20 minutes for this to completely melt down I have it on the highest setting alright so once it melts down you want this to be a honey-like consistency you don't want this running all over the place like water or you know something super liquidy like a thin syrup or something you want it to be a bit on the thick honey side so you can have control over it once you apply it and also when you apply it you're going to want to you know be careful on how you put it on I'll show you guys that in the next part of this video so right now we're just going to wait as you guys could see it is starting to melt okay you could see it around the edges right there I'm not going to touch it oh I'm so excited to have to super cool I'm so excited I was given opportunity to try this out because I've been seeing this all over Facebook and I'm curious you know I'm curious so I'm just going to let that melt down I just wanted you guys to see that the arm the facial warmer was working they call it a facial oh my that's just what they call it so it's been about 20 minutes we're going to open this and take a look and all our bees are now liquefied you see okay it's a little too runny so I'm going to lower the machine not take it off but just lower it because I want this to be a bit thicker all right you guys all right you guys so here we have my legs I'm about ready to try out these wax beads on these legs of mine I'm a little nervous I am but it's supposed to be less painful than traditional wax so I'll definitely let you guys know if this works actually so this is how it looks after lowering the temperature to me to get a bit thicker it's not as running as it was before okay just a bit thicker so it makes the application of the wax easier so I'm going to show you guys how this wax works on my legs so when you're quite a wax you want to kind of do it in like a day recommend a figure eight but you pretty much want to get a little grip on the area where you apply the wax so you apply the wax in the direction that it grows so some of it fell on my legs sorry about that so I'm just going to go with it and apply and create a lip so this is going to be my pull area right there all right so it's my first time so no laughing okay we're testing this out so you don't have to wait long for it to work cool that did not hurt at all ahaha that is so cool that did not hurt none of this hurt I'm super impressed okay all right okay that's the first one I missed on the first one but that's what happens when you try something out for the first time all right okay so we're going to try this again okay this one is much better okay and that's how that one looks you literally have to wait two seconds they claim one or two seconds it dries pretty much instantly you see on the edge i have thicker edges here and this is just for pulling so I want to pull upwards because my hair screws outward and it's not hot it's warm but it dries pretty much instantly see so instead it's there's no pain for this you guys this is amazing once you guys get the hang of it you're really going to have fun doing this like it's not even that hard it's just put it on wait two to three seconds and rip it off you know if I had to rate this from one to five five being the highest the most painful thing ever this will probably be a one is not painful at all you guys actually sat here edited the video and did my other leg it I was actually enjoying it so are today so I hope that this video was helpful to you to make your decision on whether or not you want to purchase this item I do have this company's information down below star-filled if you want to check them out purchase from them I'll have all the information down below in the description box so you can check them out if you like on what I've experienced with the product is close to painless not completely painless in my opinion but close to it like I didn't have to scream and grunge and squeeze and nothing like that I also use it on my upper lip I'll show you a picture right now and it worked really well on my upper lip I love the warm sensation from the warmed wax on the upper lip it was really really good and I didn't have to use any paper or anything like that so that's probably one of my favourite things from the wax that I don't have to use paper over it so yeah if you guys are interested in starkville and their mini facial warmer I'll put the information down below in the description box you can check them out if you like thank you star Phil for sending me this wax system I'm really enjoying it I love you guys and I'll see you all soon in another video okay", "T0Jabi8o85E": "hey guys just me Mikayla welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to wax at home and so I just ordered a kick um I ordered like warmer from Walmart and then the beads from Amazon and yeah so these are the beads then I got from Amazon I believe they were like $27 or something like that they were like $27 they're like a dark navy blue they almost look black that's what the beads look like so yeah that's what these look like okay so I bought this little waxing kit from Sally's it's really dirty because the wax got like all over the place and made like dirt and stuff stick to it but I got this one also I didn't use it it's a soft wax and these ones are the ones that you would like need strips to use and I didn't buy any strips so I wasn't able to use that one I was able to use this one I do need to return it but Sally's isn't accepting returns right now because like I'm patient we're not allowed to say because of the sickness going around did really enjoy using this one it's the Brazilian bikini wax by Gigi I can leave the link for this in the description box it's really good it was really easy to use a beginner friendly I really recommend hard wax for beginners because you don't need strips and it's really easy to rip off and use that whole thing talks my legs and I really enjoyed it so I thought I should buy actual warmer with beads so I did and I'm gonna be showing you guys how I do it so I'm gonna bring you guys closer down here and show you the whole process also um another thing I recommend is putting like an old beach towel down I used this one when I waxed with the green wax and so I'm just gonna use it again so I don't get wet another perfectly good towel and I'm just gonna lay on the floor to protect the carpet from the wax okay so I'm back and I'm on the floor now I have my wax warmer right here it's so cute top pink and the wax has been heating for a little minute now so it should be ready yeah it's ready so I put the beads in and this is what it looks like okay so these are the products I'm gonna be using I got this cornstarch baby powder from the dollar store and then I got this baby oil gel from the dollar store as well and I got these large popsicle sticks from Sally's Beauty and they came in like a hundred pack I believe and then I have this warmer and it's from Walmart and then this is the wax as you can see it's like super runny and this is watch that is way too hot to use on your skin so I turned it off and I'm just gonna let it cool down for a little while before I use it but you can usually tell when it's ready when it starts to kind of hold its shape a little bit more a fiddly way to then to work with but it does have settings for a different heat so it has off on medium and high so yeah um before I get started I also changed my top to this little tank top just so it'll be easier for me to wax like my armpits and my arms and stuff just so it won't get on my clothes you know so ya know I'm just waiting for the wax to cool down and I will show you guys how I do it okay so my wax is finally starting to I took it out the warmer just soak it cool down a little faster and it's finally starting to thicken up a little bit you can't really tell but it is so I'm gonna start prepping my skin and first I'm gonna put my hair up cuz I don't want to get any wax in my hair that would be tragic okay so I'm gonna start with my armpits just because I feel like that's the easiest to show you guys so it's a prep I'm just gonna put the baby powder onto my armpit just to soak up like all the oils and stuff that I have and I did just go on a run so it's probably gonna soak up the sweat - this is not opening for some reason okay there goes so I'm just gonna pour a little bit in my hand okay I probably should have worn a white shirt but okay so I just put baby powder all over my armpit this isn't before you can't really see the hairs and there's not really that many hairs because I did wax them with that Brazilian one cuz I showed you guys earlier so it did grow in a little bit thinner than it did before so there is not too much wax I mean too much hair there to be waxed which is good which is also a benefit of waxing because it makes their go back slower okay so my wax has cooled down to like usable temperature like I can hold the bottom of the container and this is what it looks like it kind of like holds this shape a little more I don't know how to describe it but it is ready to use so I'm just gonna get some [Music] it's like this and then roll it around until it stops making any string kisses string like it's what really will make a mess so just keep rolling it until you put it on your skin and get your arm ready keep rolling yeah I'm still rolling and apply the opposite direction of the hair growth so when here goes down so I'm gonna apply it boys it's leaking so just apply it all over okay so now that is all applied I'm just gonna wait a couple of seconds until it dries and you can like touch it and feel when it's ready to be ripped off and you're gonna rip with the direction of your hair growth so my hairs go down so that's why I applied it up ways and then I'm gonna rip it down ways or ripple way oh I'm supposed to apply with the green and then rip out the green so I applied it wrong quit oh well doesn't really make a difference so just wait for that to dry if I have a really low pain tolerance but for some reason it doesn't really hurt me that bad some that's a good thing I guess feels pretty cooled down so I'm just gonna rip a little tab at the corner at the bottom like that it's just like a little flap right there and then pull and don't think about too much already three two one wait I'm scared I don't know why cuz the camera I'm nervous I'm skilled three okay I can do it now once I get like the scared part over with I can do it I don't know if you guys think that it's nasty then I would skip over like ten seconds right now but you could see a little bit of the hairs it is really dark wax so you won't really be able to see it too much but they're there and now I'm pretty smooth there are a couple hairs left still so I'm gonna do it again we're gonna do my next armpit first and the cornstarch is like all gone in this one so I mean the baby powder so I'm gonna put some more keep spinning it that was a very little scoop so gonna add some more probably shaky but it's kind of harder to do with my left hand definitely my non-dominant oh underneath okay so I got this one all applied and I'm just waiting for it to cool down just touching it filling when it's cool okay so it feels cool enough to pour so I'm just gonna flip a little tab at the bottom and then pull it this is kind of painful actually I could like fill the pain already but I'm just gonna go for it okay skip this ten seconds if you don't like something like this you can't really see it I didn't really have that many hairs so mica see I can see some on there don't be fooled but I'm gonna do this armpit again I'm not gonna apply more baby powder just because it's just making a mess and I feel like it doesn't really make that big of a difference again spinning the wax so it doesn't make a string flying downward and like I said this is my first time using this wax and I do recommend actually it's working pretty good so far just like the other one pretty much just a bigger bag I'm pretty sure all hard waxes do the same thing so yeah doesn't really matter what kind you get not quite I also just got this aloe vera gel which you can also put on after with the baby oil gel it's really up to you and what you prefer I think it's ready to be pulled so I'm gonna make a little flip at the bottom and pull okay so the more the stubborn hairs came out with that one which is what I was hoping for I want to check it out in the mirror and now there are no more hairs I'm gonna do the next armpit just one more time I'm sure I thought it could and hard wax only Rip's the hairs out so you can go over your skin multiple times without doing any damage so I'm just applying downward ok so I got that all applied again just waiting for it to cool down ok and then this one feels like it's almost ready to pull ok so I'm just gonna make flick at the end and rip this one didn't have too many extra hairs so there's not too many on there and this is really the first time it's left like wax behind so not too bad one time out of four so and really the only reason wax that's left behind is if there's not enough wax in that area it's just too thin it won't really rip off with the rest but yeah all the hairs are gone so that's all I'm going to show you guys for this video if you want to see more of how I wax other things on my body just let me know and I can make a video on that and yeah that's pretty much it for this video I'll leave everything like in the description except for the thing to try the dollar store because I'm pretty sure they just don't have it they don't have like a website or anything like that but yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure to give it a like comment subscribe and I'll see you guys next time bye", "EtCVR2Xqlis": "all right so hello and welcome everyone I'm over here a bit of a different video I'm not going to have my basin at this time but we are going to be talking about waxing at a home today I'm going to be waxing my arms and I had gotten some requests on snapchat when I mentioned it if I would do a video and kind of tutorial and now I do it I have a kind of how to wax at home using hard wax post already up on my blog so I will be linking that down below just so you guys have that for your reference in case I miss mentioning anything I highly recommend checking that post out because I can go through everything and yeah just in case I miss anything here there is also that post yeah today I was wanting to wax my arms and as you guys can see I have a good bit going on I do not watch my arms regularly I basically just kind of as I have time probably every 2 or so months I will take the time to just wax it really quick just to kind of keep it um I mean not hairless obviously because I let it get this long but just not as hairy if you guys didn't know I am part Brazilian so I tend to have very dark hair and I like I like waxing it yeah I like to wax it every couple of months just to keep it under control and when I do that I also like to wax my face and just kind of get the peach fuzz off of my face because I feel like makeup application is a lot smoother with uh without all the peach fuzz on my face but yeah today I'm just gonna be showing you what I have when I wax at home and then I'll be showing you example on my arm but yeah with all that said let's just dive into it I'm sitting on the floor plugged in and hopefully all in frame for you guys let's just run through everything this is obviously a wax melter I just got off of Amazon I'll have everything that I have here listed down below I don't think it really matters what kind of wax warmer you use but I would recommend you get one that you can control the heat settings because if you just have one that's on and off I had one before and it was horrible because you don't have any control over how hot you get it and often I mean it was always just way too hot for me so I like this and that I can control it so when I turn it on I turn it kind of to medium to get the wax melted and then once it's melted and I'm getting ready to actually use it I just put it all the way down right like right before it turns off think like that I just kind of leave it right there on very very low so it keeps the wax at a perfect temperature and as I said I use hard wax I will leave as I said the brand that I use and I find the most painless down below I do not recommend Gigi's hard wax at all I tried that and thought it was very painful and difficult to use but this is a type of blue axe I believe the brand is called SIA Phil I forget I forget how to pronounce their name but I love their wax highly recommend it and it's not that expensive so yeah I just put it in there and the reason this is all a mess is because I highly recommend you do as I say not as I do and use one of these to help kind of keep things clean I mean this this is just my personal one I'm the only one who uses it so I often forget to put this on and then it just gets all messy and hard wax is hard to clean up anyway so let's just run through everything here first up I have this pre honey pre wax cleanser this is from the brand Gigi I don't have much experience but I just do recommend that you use something to cleanse your skin before going in to wax it just to make sure your skin is clean because when you wax and remove the hair you're leaving leaving those pores and your arms open where the hair follicles were and you don't want to you know cause bacteria to get in and cause more breakouts than needed depending on the area I'm waxing I like to use an oil or back here baby powder if the area I'm waxing is rather dry definitely an oil to kind of help the hard wax not stick to the skin too much and just make it easier to remove this is pre epilation oil from Gigi again not much experience I had this is the only brand I've tried I do want to venture out and try more if I'm waxing an area that tends to sweat a lot so for example if I'm waxing in my bikini area and it just as I'm working especially waxing myself tends to just make that area sweat and more damp I like to use baby powder same kind of concept as the oil and just helping the wax not adhere to your skin and make it easier to remove depending on the area you're waxing and your pain tolerance you might want to look into some kind of numbing solution and this is just what I picked up at my Sally Beauty Supply and it seems to work pretty well highly recommend you have something to use to remove wacks from off your skin because no matter how good you are had it you're gonna leave some residue behind people have told me that they use any kind of like oil coconut oil olive oil that works too but this is just what I have so I've been going through it I also like to apply some kind of lotion moisturizer after I finish waxing the area and this one is like a slow-growth type of moisturizer so kind of dual purpose and then it moisturizes the skin but also helps to slow the growth of like the when the hair grows back so I recommend having something you know and then not as specifically this brand but some type of really good moisturizer and if you want to invest in some type of moisturizer that also has something to help slow the growth of the hair since you went through how that work to remove it that's also good but yeah some kind of moisturizer for afterwards and the last step I do like to have some type of soothing gel or solution or something to help prevent ingrown hairs and bumps so this is a roll-on one that I just got looks like this but the another one I have currently in my bathroom is one that I just like pour out onto a cotton round and applied to the area and I try to do that ideally I think it's like a once a day but I tend to do it whenever I get out of the shower just to help you know tone down any breakouts or ingrown hairs something like this I highly recommend and then last step most obviously I think is you need some type of wooden sticks to apply the the wax to and if you didn't know with hard wax you don't need any kind of Muslim strip sheets it hardens on itself so that you can remove it just with the wax and without having to put anything on top of it which is why I love hard wax it's a lot less messy less sticky and a lot easier and quicker I find before we dive in I did want to give a disclaimer that I am NOT in a statistic seeing fold time I learned a little bit about it in cosmetology school probably two years ago and then I was going and getting waxed at a salon a waxing salon for a good solid year before I started doing it at home just as a way to both save money and save time because as a mom it was just hard to get away to my waxing appointments so yeah I am NOT licensed in this I am NOT a professional this is all information that all the information I'm sharing is stuff that I've learned along the way and I just you know want to help you if you're interested in waxing at home I highly recommend starting like if you want to start waxing at home start by like waxing your arms cuz I feel like that's pretty painless out of all the areas that I've waxed at home by myself or that I've gotten waxed over the years arms are pretty painless and pretty easy and straightforward and it's not like you can mess it up yeah I think that's about all that I wanted to say before diving in so let's just get started shall we alright so I'm gonna move these things back and out of the way so that I can be here and show you guys what I'm doing but first up I'm going to start with the pre honey cleanser and just get a bit on my cotton pad and then just clean nothing fancy nothing all right difficult pretty self-explanatory just cleaning the area that I'm going to X I should probably tell you guys that I'm only planning to wax probably from I do a little bit on my arm but from here to probably here because from here on up the I have very very fine very light toned hair so honestly it's just not worth it to me to take the time to wax all that I typically after the day after I wax my arms I'll just take my husband's Edgar that he uses to that we used to edge his hair won't I cut it and I just kind of shave off the peach fuzz and call it a day I'm just gonna take a bit of the oil and do the same thing and this time I'm gonna be kind of going downward on my hair just to lay it all down now the arm is a little tricky cuz I'm sure if you've been you know reading into waxing at home you've heard that you're supposed to apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth and then remove it in the opposite direction but with your arm hair at least at least my arm here it lays the let me be in frame it lays this way so unless I want to sit there and do a bunch of tiny little strips going like this and this and then I pull it off the opposite way it just is not very feasible I just tend to go one long strip down my arm and then pull it off and then sometimes because I'm not doing it in the direction of the hair growth I'll have patches where it misses but then I just kind of go over those areas and it all works out so I like these type of larger wooden sticks for doing my arms and then the smaller one which I have in my pot right now I like to use that for around my face so yeah anyway let's see I'm gonna try should probably do this arm yeah I'll do this arm so that I can use my right arm and not block you all right so changing it up a bit but I wanted to show you guys what the hard wax looks like again this is like a blue hard wax so that's why the color is what it is but whenever I scoop it I like to just grab some and then I roll it like this until it starts or until it stops being stringy and then I take it over to my arm and I tend to wait a couple seconds before applying it you see how easy this is running down off of the hard wax that's a little hot for my preference so I like to wait until it just slows down a bit at this point like see how slowly it's going down at this point I feel like it's the perfect time to apply it it's not too warm where it's going to run everywhere and make a mess and it's not too cold where it's going to be hard to apply so let's zoom back out and get going all right trying to film this and stay in frame is extremely hard anyway just getting the wax I know you can't really see it I'm back here but I'm doing the same thing just kind of twirling it round and around at this point it's ready and I just lay it here and I kind of swipe it up once to get both sides off of it and then I push it down and then kind of bring it back up so yeah that's it and you want to get a fairly thin so this is like the trickiest part of using hard wax but once you figure it out you can just like fly through this like I can do my arms in like ten less than ten minutes but you want to make it thin enough where it's easy to peel because if it's too thick it one takes a long long time to dry and two is more painful and harder and stiffer to peel up but you don't want it so thin that when you go to peel it up it just kind of breaks like right here is a little thin so it's gonna honestly be a little difficult to get a lip ideally you want to kind of bring when you swoop it around you kind of want to bring more product and leave it down here so it's easy to pick up at this point like I just kind of touch it and when I can touch it I don't know how many seconds that was I just start picking at the end to get a lip up and once I got a lip get this over here so yeah this is a tiny bit thin but up here like this area is pretty pretty perfect this is a bit thin but I don't think that'll be a big deal anyway once you got a lip you just pull like that and then this part this is the part I was telling you that's a little thin so it just it broke off so yeah the hardest part of you know figuring out hard waxing is just figuring out that ideal thickness and you want to work quickly because it's hot anyway yeah that was the first strip so I just want to get up close I really don't know if you'll be able to see but you guys saw beforehand how much hair I had right here but yeah so this is pretty much all I can't really see any patches that it missed so that's good a little bit of residue here from the outskirts just catching on to the hair but we'll grab that on another pass same story on this side and yes be prepared if you want a hard wax at home you will have wax all underneath your fingernails so don't do your nails right before waxing or you'll ruin them but yeah that's what it looks like and if you're that person who likes to see the wax or the hair on the wax I can try to show you but I really don't think it's gonna be that exciting since it is arm hair it's a it's a lot more fine but you can see all the little little hair follicles and yeah at this point I just kind of keep doing it so I will try to stay in frame but I'm probably just gonna speed past this because it's all repetitive at this point [Music] [Music] at this point I've pretty much done all of this my forearm here is all there Liz I think we're gonna do one more strip down here but that's just gonna be so hard to stay in frame I'm gonna also do my arms I guess I can show you guys that not that I have like a whole lot of arm hair but when you wax your at least for me personally when I wax up to here and then I leave my arm hair I feel like it's most obvious so [Music] also one thing I don't think I mentioned but you might have seen it when I was doing it when you go and apply and you sweep back and you're done like you want to put the orange wood stick away make sure you kind of like pick it up from your skin and then you know after you get to the end you pick it up and then twirl it like this to kind of let this because there's gonna be strings attached because it's hot the hard wax just well it like this for a couple seconds to kind of let those stringing pieces dry and Harden and then you can just kind of flick it up and it'll break the string and then you can throw away your orange wood stick and you'll be able to you know not be stringing hard wax all over the place a lot cleaner that's a tip I wanted to share so yeah at this point I would take you know once I finished my arm I would take the wax off cleanser or this wax off remover well wax remover and I just get a little bit it's like a lotion this one from Gigi and then I just kind of get it over you know any kind of spot and then yeah I followed that up with my slow growth so I'm trying to get as close as my camera will allow I hope this isn't focus but yeah here's what my skin that looks like now all hairless my arm and then just as a reminder this is my other arm that I'm gonna do off camera because this pregnant mama is having a hard time that's dating and frame and doing this so yeah but that's honestly it and then you have smooth skin this will typically lasts like since it's my arm hair and not you don't I feel like you don't notice it coming back as quickly I feel like I get a nice solid month of really smooth soft you know hairless skin and then I can start to feet I mean you start to feel it in like I think technically two weeks or so but I don't really notice it until it good solid month so it's nice on my arms on my face how long does it mmm probably like a good two weeks and then I can start feeling the peach fuzz coming back if you're waxing your bikini area you got a good solid week of smooth skin and then you'll start to see it coming back same I'm sure for legs I've never waxed my legs here we'll just zoom back out no need to sit there and look at my arm but yeah legs in the bikini area you tend to see the regrowth and noticed it and feel it I would say about a week or so afterwards just because the hair is a lot more coarser than what's on your arms or your face so at least that's kind of my guess my understanding of it but yeah that is how I hard wax at home so yeah thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions that I didn't mention in this video please feel free to ask them down below or check out my blog post to see if maybe I mentioned it there once again I am NOT a licensed you know aesthetician I don't wax as a yeah I'm not a professional waxer I don't do this for a living I am NOT a professional so and take my advice but the grain is salts actually my biggest recommendation if you're wanting to wax at home would be to go to a waxing salon or a little while and just experience it that way you can know you know the pain tolerance you know how you do but have someone else do it and then I as I said I had I went to a waxing salon and got it done for a year before I started doing at home and when I was going I would ask questions about the wax about what they used about the temperature about the different products they used on me and I would watch them and that's honestly how I learned to wax at home by watching the professionals do it on me so that would be my recommendation especially if you're a little nervous about trying to do it yourself and you're not sure about the you know the pain that if you'd be able to handle and if it would be worth investing in this because I think I mean I don't think it like all this together I don't think it was over a hundred dollars but it is a little bit of an investment so yeah I would recommend you know maybe going in and for at least a couple months or so and just experiencing a professional do it and kind of learn from them and then determine from there if it's something you want to try doing at home or just not doing it all or just stick into the professionals but I yeah with all that said I think that about wraps it up thank you so much for watching if this was informative or at all helpful to you please feel free to give it a thumbs up and I will see you very soon in my next video bye guys [Music]", "NFQ7rVvH-DQ": "are you lazier than Susan do you always stop short of finishing your projects maybe it's time that you are to go the whole nine yards the whole nine yards means everything possible or available for example the zoo had every type of primate gorillas orangutans chimpanzees the whole nine yards my car is a little dirty it just needs a wash wax vacuum the whole nine yards if you are looking for the origin I have some bad news for you let's just say that we know more about black holes than about the true origin of the phrase it has been described by Yale University Librarian fred shapiro as the most prominent etymological riddle of our time so sit back relax and listen to four of my favorite theories before I get into the theories I should mention the first known usage which will become important later on the earliest known idiomatic example of the whole nine yards in print is from an Indiana newspaper called the Mitchell commercial in 1907 and it appeared again in the same paper the following year around the same time other publications were using the whole six yards for example this excerpt is from a May seventh nineteen twelfth edition of the Mount Vernon signal because of the several instances of the whole six yards in the 1910s the number nine appears to be arbitrary thus invalidating many of the following theories the whole nine yards could relate to the length of pieces of fabric or various garments during the 1800's and early 1900s fabrics were routinely sold in standard lands of nine yards and other multiples of three yards in 1855 a New Albany daily ledger article used the phrase non idiomatically however no single source confirms that any garment was the actual origin during World War 2 aircraft machine gun belts were apparently 9 yards long he returning pilot would explain the intensity of the battle by saying I gave him the whole nine yards now there were many types of planes used in the war so you might ask which belts there are many versions of this explanation with variations regarding type of plane nationality of gunner and the geographic area one ammunition belt that fits the length requirement is for the British Vickers machine gun during the First World War ammunition containers were capable of accommodating linked belts of 350 to 400 rounds the average length being about 9 yards either way since the phrasing print predates World War one this theory is no longer viable the nine yards refers to a cubic measure of the volume of a concrete mixer which just so happens to be 9 cubic yards although many trucks hold eight or ten yards anyway toward the end of the load if it becomes obvious that the entire load is needed you would say give me the whole nine yards unfortunately this theory is inconsistent with the phrases history the phrase is actually a nautical term crosspiece from which the sail hangs is called a yard a three mast ship with three sails on each can travel at ludicrous speeds if they were all unfurled hence the whole nine yards meant that the ship is fully rigged however not all ships had exactly three yards on each mast and not all sailing vessels had three masts which is the correct theory as of now no one really knows for sure which of course means that the riddler finally one [Music]", "qaX5y7pEhTk": "[Music] [Music] you see

it's because I work on a highway you know and if I really want it to stare cars for four hours I would just look outside and there's not as many crashes as one would like to see did you know that a lot of people go to NASCAR races just for the crashes that's a fact jack now I don't know if they crash a lot in Formula but I can imagine that those tires the way that they hang out if they crash

cold break [Music] Riggin if you have Amazon Prime you could get rid of the delicious you can get rid of the ads yes thank you need more vapors on twitch I think well the problem is with twitch is they don't know how to sync up audio I had that problem of my last video and I made a complaint and they didn't do anything to fix it so I had to upload it on my other youtube channel which is why almost what life almost I don't have the rest of it are you [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] how about you buy her a case of it she works hard yes she gets paid for what she works hard for - yeah aside from that she's sitting here on twitch right now talking to you people working hard in my [ __ ] ah Bri come in real quick take your microphone yeah oh can we do the Friday is one you could do a regular happy birthday song okay god I haven't sung yet so that's fine okay ball sonic sonic don't do the song happy birthday happy birthday to you happy birthday I don't know your name happy birthday to you we

problem for me I always want the same shirt anyway so what it is what's going on Victor Kimi thanks for subscribing thanks for becoming a tazer thank you where's done for the that's a three leaf clover but thank you for the three leaf clover yeah I just I really wish that twitch didn't have a problem saving it's great for live like I don't have any delay got good audio feed but the problem is I do the gaming on it too so it's kind of like well people know because the way that I title it so I guess it's fine I know Annie Jones a reason why I don't do you now I will do you now once they launched I was actually thinking about excuse me I was thinking about doing a double double stream jammie where I stream to you now and my stream to my other youtube channel the only problem I have with that is first off I have to use you nails platform which is not going to work for me number one number two it doesn't get saved that's a big problem number three I can't use over yes number four the reason why I don't like using you now is because watching videos is not possible unless you pay for the membership which is not even accessible so as much as I love taking people's money I don't like taking people's money for them to have something that if they didn't give money if that makes sense you understand like I would rather people elect to give me money just because they want to throw it at me for is having to do it to see something if that makes sense like on twitch you could watch it by default without paying on my YouTube you can watch it with by default without paying you now you would have to pay five dollars a month to watch the video that I was live that's not gonna work for me yeah it's not cool at all and they look at it like it's a feature but it's not a feature anywhere else periscope it's the fault everyone else Ustream live it's saved as a broadcast and I like periscope but the only time I really use periscope is primarily for when I use mobile other than that I use I guess twitch is well where this is what the third live stream that we've done well have been on Twitch what is the schola what are we talking about it looks like his hand is trying to push a ring like doing a victory yeah that is possible Lacey that is but I could put people live on this I could I have no problem putting people live at this but I I would rather I would rather not do that just because it kind of clogs up the feed and it makes the chat go on for four or five hours you know I'd like to know we can't do that now yeah if I if I try to plug down a loose connection wrong it vapes thank you for is that a freaking bottle of Gatorade thank you right vague for the little bits brother um well I wouldn't go that far Kimmy don't go that far yeah girl don't go so listen Kimmy I got something for you ah June 8th okay I got something real special going on it's popping off it's gonna be hot June 8th I'm doing like I think the title will be chicks with no dicks or something that rhymes right maybe I don't know if YouTube would work that but chicks with big [ __ ] maybe mine work that doesn't rhyme so something something non-consensual we're anyway let me learn let's be serious for a second I'm doing we're gonna do a live stream right it's gonna be inside the minds but it's gonna be different we're gonna do it with Bri I'm getting you I mean if you're in if not I'll find somebody else but I figured you'd want to be in know I'm talking to Kimmy in the traffic you're already in okay so Bri will be there Sophie vapes will be there and met I'm thinking Kimmy vapes and I'll be like the only dude but III need to get like a bunch of people to come show up on my camera so there could be like four guys in my little frame and then we will have our own panel zelphia our own panel and then Kimmy if you're in you'll have your own panel so it'll be all vaginas and then just one penis almost like an orgy if you will but everybody's clothed Theresa company was Jaclyn or who was dead suzanne somers okay and then ah Janice who was played by [Music] I cannot remember named gifted a tier 1 sub 2 gone babe that's cool young down for the dress okay all right Kimmy so that's good I don't know of youtube but we're gonna do it on YouTube I'm thinking it'll be after June 4th so either June 8th let me actually message Sophie just to confirm [Music] yeah it'll be three girls one cop and all three girls don't just be a cop with like a smiley face on it and I'll do the voice-over of the car let me get a hold on a second I think June 8th it's it's gonna be the first weekend it'll be the first weekend it'll be the first weekend after the 8th after the 4th so it might be June 8th I think that is a Saturday chicks and necks yeah it's got to be like it's got to be sexy but right like I don't understand like there's a motorcycle on the sidewalk like what the [ __ ] dude no let him hold on a second I'll be right back move the Brio I'm using my phone as a reflector I didn't have a mirror it's crazy where I see you standing is not where the camera sees you standing over there oh never mind I'm just gonna say never mind please don't judge me why can I read this weird what the bank do you see him and try and hold it still some guy was walking very very very closely at Jay's bike lucky had to lift up an arm to go past it because he didn't want to get off the sidewalk didn't like six times the bike is right in front of the store so we can see when people do stupid stuff can I walk around with this Jesse later thinking let me know if he walks fast again pound your mind this friggin face have you punched a dude in his face what did he do if Sophie's gonna be on maybe she'll let me come over to her place for it since her since my internet [ __ ] that'd be cool that'd be cool yeah apparently they do no if I run out of the store with the big hammer someone's calling the cops what we've already incriminating ourselves first said to grab something that you already smashed you know and that's the problem I don't know if you guys remember this is a lot of people that it sorry um I don't know if you guys saw this but there was a live feed that I did it was alive or was it a recording it was alive wasn't it or no it was a recording and he got scared you and Ryan so this guy walks up parks his car next to my back of my bike it was the Ducati X Diavel outside that's that's my other [ __ ] who she is nasty so anyway I just parked out there and a guy pulls his car up in a handicapped spot handicap spot and gets out of the car and he goes to sit on my bike he throws his leg over whatever I was doing I stopped immediately I got up and I went outside he might appeared a little bit in his pants I don't I don't remember the exact verbage but I told him to get back in his [ __ ] car go back to his [ __ ] country and get off my bike he was like oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I thought it was display yeah cuz [ __ ] Ducatis are on sidewalks everywhere for you to sit on you piece of [ __ ] and his wife was like trying to like film it I'm like you get your car that's in the car too [ __ ] they they might have called the cops but brie ran in the back she didn't even bother recording she's like oh my god I don't know and she ran away Jason here I'm over here Ryan's over there everything's great all of a sudden Jay sees the dude gets off runs outside within a span of like two seconds the guy has both of his hands on the handlebars lifting his leg up and his J opens up that door and then James like get them curse word off my box yeah listen I I I mean any anybody that rides can get it you know you don't see a furrow and I'm not I'm not saying Ducati is a FRA but essentially is it has the stigma attached to it that it is you know a high-end bike it's not it's not the most expensive bike I've ever owned but it's not the point the point is is that you know it has that stigma attached to it so you don't walk up to a Ferrari at a traffic light and just sit on the passenger's seat you are liable to get shot in the [ __ ] face like they were doing a photo shoot with my bike disrespectful Brian yo that is a whole nother level like that is dude I don't I don't even know what to compare that to like it gives me anxiety just think it's so disrespectful I don't even know there's got to be a word that's worse than disrespectful whatever that word is that's what it is ain't man Church amen now we've had people I swear to god dude we've had people come into the store then we have let me let me try to pan this around a little bit let me show you so hold on we have a little space there you see this space right where well not where breeze out but this space so that right there is where people stand to check out right so what will happen is like if someone knows me or or watches me they'll try to walk past that oh yeah yo yo back up back up automatically I don't don't don't I don't know what she's doing I've never seen a customer do that but I'm for but you know back up to bat whoa but back up and and people will they'll just that like to have no sense of boundaries camera no sense of boundaries and it's it's so like so Jay went outside to talk to this dude about getting very close to his bike now the guy said he was gonna call the police on Jay what happened I didn't hear everything around when the cops come in you scared the poop out of him give a [ __ ] come on the [ __ ] cops bro he was so scared oh my god I'm a quarter-cup call cops 861 right one Edison New Jersey call the cops call the

want to do this bro they were all outside and they all ran inside everybody there was people outside the pool hall yeah dude see how he walks around the neighbor look at him see how the neighbor walks around we got a guy that's not right next to us right what does he do when he sees the bike he goes right around it right he's not trying to scootch and smack it with his ass I know half the damn cops

right here now this isn't just water this is clearly Canadian man a very rare drink it's like 30 bucks for two of them commonsense balsamic example exactly and then the best part the best thing is James Taylor is there's cameras everywhere you understand what I'm saying like there's cameras everywhere so him walking past the bike and hitting know what his ass it's on the camera feed you not I mean like just you know just treat people how you want to be treated that's all was it worth $30 absolutely absolutely I think the neighbor walks out and he knows there's that personal bubble call the cops I'm waiting I'm waiting when the cops come I wished it was when the cops come we're gonna swing the mic around if they come I'll swing it around once I see them I'll swing it around and then I'll swing the camera around yes sir okay yep what's a dumb thing that you purchased that you but like it was too much money but you bought it anyway or or you felt like it was a waste after I got it or while I bought it half the mobs I buy I'm not bad like it's like a thing like you bought this toilet paper holder it was for a guy what my Gucci shoes $1,800 never worn them once oh I wore them once they look nice and like a size five why do all shoes look so beautiful and gorgeous when there's smaller feet you ever notice that then you put them on it looks like you've got two yachts for you [ __ ] shoes or you look like Ronald McDonald's like what I'm gonna call the cotton give a [ __ ] call your lawyer uh dude I don't care I've got enough money to bury you in fees let's do this all I want him to do is just push me that's all just push me I won't make a first move not at all no I'll antagonize the [ __ ] how do you though so you do make that first move so you guys never seen a bear yell that's what they look like I look like a big-ass grizzly it's always the case though with uh with the uh what's going on Eric I didn't know you were so um it's gonna rain that really sucks dude I'm gonna have to wait till after the rain to bounce now I'm not gonna leave now it's 4:30 I'm waiting for the cops another way for the cops to come but don't think about as I have them in 11 the Gucci ones look funny because they they look long like the stripes on the Sun they just I have Fendi shoes I don't know what to do I was on a trip where I was just like blowing money and I was like well I don't have anything saved but I have all these nice ass shoes I'm one of those materialistic [ __ ] you know what you broke your [ __ ] but you got nice things that's me probably because I was raised with sweatpants and like Kmart boots I felt like I had to own up to something you know but the Gucci shoes are just they're just they're not I I have okay so here's the wallet right so it's even got my name oh there it is right there so um a trident on the front is a Maserati um it could be lotus to depend on what the trunk I don't know what your version of a trident looks like that's a Maserati that's a Maserati ah a wire some [ __ ] like walked around it's not hard it's not hard for people to do like you have no problem walking around and then what happens after that Sesa after the throw 15

I'm so bad you better call it girls then we all shoot looking for balls I'm so bad cops ain't coming why would you leave we can go to police station okay guys the guy yelled at me for going near my nearest motorcycle you know what the funny part is I'd say 85% of police ride motorcycles and they're gonna be like yeah he was right right then we pulled the camera feed there's a sitting my mirror and it did it in so what'd you guys think you guys like when I go live here just to shoot the [ __ ] Edwyn what the [ __ ] why would you make that comment at Oh Edwin you right I didn't know that brother yeah you know it's it's yeah the police are text messaging me Chris our did you just are you in here and you just gave me a donation of stream labs donation you didn't have to do that brother you could just hey man we just got a message about your bike you good you need to do that that's nice though you could have just become the patron he would have two months access but thank you for the know it doesn't show up whiskey there's that's the prop seat now we got to see now you're gonna bring back my love endeavors least am i making me guys download a bunch of new [ __ ] oh look I'm over at vocal I have no idea I just make some [ __ ] up it did right was that a burp okay yeah you're better off into like doing well I wouldn't say do bits because they take I think fifty percent or something it's ridiculous so thank you though thank you for Chris for the donations it doesn't I actually can enable something where it drops bombs like on the channel like around me which is really weird I like a little plane flies by I got this really [ __ ] cool mic it's designed for broadcasting only that's good yeah that's good yeah I can't use obs okay it's too taxing on my CPU now Eric um so it's a I love Newman [ __ ] right this is the Newman broadcaster 408 its you could tell by the way that it's designed it's designed for you to talk like this ah but it's got really nice sensitivity for the type of range because I don't like it in my face so like up here you could still hear me and use phantom power cuz the condenser mic but it's it's really I had the T 103 the nickel I got the T 103 MTD coming which is the 103 but this one's designed solely for broadcasting but they have the I forgot what I just said the name of it is four or five the TR BCM 104 then they have the 705 but the 705 is dynamic mic doesn't mean phantom power but I'm running yeah 705 hey this is the 104 it's like 800 bucks or something it's nice nice Mike it does it does and I got the game pretty low so it should sound pretty crystal clear I never understood guys gonna hit him okay but let me get the video I never understood with the infatuation with auto audiophile is like how people are all about hearing but I don't hear any difference between if I was to use a microphone like this or if I used a microphone like I used when I'm gaming at night yeah I did what's the difference you still hear them you don't get any noise what does it matter well I could tell you about 95% of the people right now and chat probably have me up on their phone right it sounds really good thank you Eric it sounds good where it's out right now right I don't have to adjust it what's going on Wendy blank yeah I'm on the phone so I'm saying like I hear anything it sounds good where Yeah right why it's that and it's not even visible did you guys but did you hear it on the old stream Eric it's really bad it's really bad there's a minimal hiss there should be no hiss at all you guys hear hiss I think it's probably you bro yeah I hear hiss little hiss how about now is the hiss calm now let me know if the hiss is gone now is it still there it's same okay hold on test how about his now any hiss no we could fix it hold on I could fix it just give me a second still hiss [Music] how about now and he has now that's worse now how about now hold on how about now ne has now it's better now no his still static still there that is super unique hold on test hold on a second a hiss how weird that is it's like space sound can you can you elaborate a little bit more what the histones like a little bit [Music] [ __ ] hold on a second just how about now anything now white noise still now sounds like rain what sounds like now I hear hiss I did him before oh I see what you guys are picking up Oh mom transferred out what that sound is though the white noise sound I don't know Kimmie vapes no I think it's the microphone but I don't there's no settings it's got I got a there's hold on a second now I see it it's like a weird yeah it's hard to hear me because I'm nowhere near it that's why it should be clear now but still the white noise is there I'm trying to figure out what it is there's a certain it's a certain setting that I wait you got break stop for a second that should get rid of it right there no that's not it how about now should be totally gone now totally gone that should do it right there is that better now it's gone better not gone no yes but way better yes but no better okay well a lot of people are saying it's better do you still hear free now it's one second let's try this it should be gone now she'll be totally gone right now totally gone should be gone nice nice it's gone very good okay very good very good see figure it out we'll get it together okay good good good good good okay yeah it was so what I was doing what it was doing was picking up thee so with the with the interface I use it uses it so clear I should probably turn up the gain a little bit right - hold on a second is that good right there that should be good so so what was happening was it was picking up the second channel because it's a it's a dual channel interface and it was probably picking that other sound up well I just had to adjust the game a little bit should be good though yeah it should be solid down I guess the cops aren't coming I waited it's not too low because it looks too low now hold on a second now it's okay should be good now yep now we're good good next topic um I really don't know what else to talk about yeah I see the levels right now that the white noise should be totally gone though no I don't think they ever came scrappy yeah was the second it was the second Channel it was picking up the it was picking up the second channel that didn't have a microphone in it but for some reason it was linking the two hold on a second no it's not okay that's good good very good do I plan on doing a Europe tour and hitting up the Germany Expo I don't I don't know about a German tour I could tell you that I do plan on going to the expo in UK the one in October in Birmingham I think it is not Liverpool but that's you know that's a few months out as far as touring Europe now now you in order for me to do that I would have to have manpower here I would have to be compensated for each day that I would be gone and I could promise you that no company would pay me what I would need for compensation to be on tour for Europe oh yeah I could tell you guys is a fun story about that one so here this is wow this is gonna put him on blast I don't give a [ __ ] oh well I could um so the name of the company that was setting this up is let me hold on let me make sure cuz I don't want to call it the wrong company here yes that's okay I got the name of the company you ready for this I am about to blow this [ __ ] up okay Andy um your tape of chauffeur is not my type of show for my type of chauffeur is in a black Yukon X Denali or a Mercedes g-class truck that's how I plan to be chauffeured unless you own one of those too mm-hmm I'm not trying to sit back backseat [ __ ] you know inside of an Audi that's not gonna work well anyway so here's the situation I get up I get an email about an expo that's gonna be happening in North Carolina and they're like well you know we have a lot of fans down here that would love to see you that would love to have you as a guest it'll be really it'll be really hot we want to you know fly you down I said okay if you fly me down you have to fly me down first-class number one has to be first-class and I said when you fly me down you also have to fly Bri first class so right off the jump that's gonna cost you round-trip about 3 grand right to fly me into North Carolina they're like no problem whatever okay I said then for each day that I'm there you have to pay me I want to say I offered thirty twenty-five or thirty five hundred a day like you were you were going to offer late a certain amount and then they just came at you no that's not no that's a different company that you're thinking of so so they're like okay that's a little expensive who else would you like to be there I said okay I said you'd give they said how do you get along really good way and I was like vaping Boggan I get along with really good got a lot of subscribers and then I said suck my mom Matt I get along really good with the both of them I talk to them all the time and they said okay cool so I no what happened between bogan and matt and the company and the name of the company is called own town vapor Oh hm t o WN vapor and then they're like okay well that's fine we'll fly you down we'll pay you everything will be good to go so it's coming down to about a week before the expo and I'm like what is going on am I going or am I not going we're sending the money wire transfer you'll have it in a couple hours hours go by days go by it's like a day before and I'm like well I guess I'm not coming well I texted the owner a few weeks ago or a few hours ago nothing ever happened so I don't recommend anybody to do business with this company I don't know how the expo ended up turning out but you want to talk about shady ass company and I have all the text messages back and forth yeah but I literally set it up I was gonna close for the for the couple days I said everything I'll sit on an email to all the customers and then they just fell through so I guess I was too expensive for them but they wanted me to be there so I was gonna drive down to this place for free and just [ __ ] hang out and ve out am i doing it you know Michael didn't pay me nothing and you'll never have to for envy but for you know for going down in North Carolina absolutely I'm live yeah yeah so I wouldn't recommend anybody to deal with that company as far as business is related as far as I mean I don't know I it's just a really it's a company that can't keep the word yeah now listen and and I I think a lot of our viewers go to other or ninety wonders of the reviewers I think a lot of these other companies they just do it you know for exposure or whatever but not not the way that I'm not I'm not gonna stop my I'm not gonna shut down my business to go to your if I didn't want a business and I was just kind of just hanging out then fine but if you're gonna require me to close my store and go to your thing your venue you're gonna need to pay me for that whatever I would make a day plus my hourly rate so it's just a matter of you know it's a company that couldn't keep their word for [ __ ] it's not you know I think even reviewers just don't to an expo that are asked to go to an exponent they never heard of should even be compensated and anybody where you're gonna take time out of whatever you do daily absolutely and be absolutely total I don't know if you know cuz you usually see me at night but I don't know I don't see any of my mods posting it cuz they're I don't have a whole lot of mods in here right now hold on a second I don't know if you know this I know you like to watch me play at night but let me post this in here I've been playing aloud I've been playing a lot over there total and I haven't seen you over there so I don't know if you don't see me gaming here that's why I'm to be out I'm ripping my finger apart right now it's like it you and you as well Wendy well then you should have the links I know Edwin does well there's not really many links anyway I mean it's just whatever about T's most posting well you know the fun part is if I'm getting poison ivy I got a problem cuz I'm in a business and there's no plants growing around here yeah Jennifer I play AI I've been trying to experiment a little bit with plane override YouTube cuz obviously there's a lot of people have accounts there but I I get it's weird because I think a lot of people just found me over there playing and it is what it is I don't play on the channel I'm that real J hates like the lifestyle channel so to speak versus playing here playing every night I've been playing every night it's just a matter of why stream oh you are a total okay I just cuz there's a couple times where Uranus popped up and you weren't in there to say it yeah yeah you know it's that's whatever I like here though which streaming because you can update or you can make clips of videos youtube gaming doesn't is lacking very heavily in that department yeah it's typically the same game it's just something else to do man you know cause it's like a work everyday I do refuse every day I edit every night kind of a ritual so to speak anything new happening with me not really not really Brian just doing the refuse banging them out brother yeah Edwin Polson but there's not you know there's not really many links to post here it's whatever hopefully the audio was not out of sync with this you can't watch you can't watch it full screen here James when I'm live I was sitting here wondering why I wasn't getting notified when you go on the rail JK channel I wasn't subscribed anymore fix that well thank you very much Jimmy thank you very much it'll be a good feed when we do if I don't know if you want to touch fate touch touch vapes I don't know if you touch base with Sophie and figure it out if you want to be there it might be a little weird though trying to well I guess I want to be that bad well if you did that that would allow me to put another person on another slide which could be fun my fingers so [ __ ] itchy it would allow me to put another person on the spot like in the other spot if you did do that yeah yeah make sure unsubscribe and re-subscribe and hit the bell maybe I don't know yeah don't don't don't go around touching vapes give me you so no more white noise right should be total clear where did you check to see if there's any more white noise yeah if you check I think everybody said it's good but that's good you still hear it no one else hears it no that's not static anymore that's the fan you guys here yeah what you hear now is that yeah that's not static that's the fan bad that I can't do anything with I'm not trying to sweat my ass off to make you guys to have sex with you people there was one time just look at my pot it's nice and juicy there's so much I don't want to take all of my underwear just your face and that one hands your face they don't make you hey break I just did some you have to whisper like look listen you have to put okay so when you do it you have to do it like this there was also a time when for whatever reason I ran around naked and I used to stick asparagus up my [ __ ] there's not many times where I could say that I was truly a vegan but if it wasn't for you I want to love my vegetables as much as I do now no go to the goats of the you have to put okay okay okay Bonnie's like what was that oh my god no went down to 63 we're at 85 before when I was talking you started talking my - amar was fun what's your MSR Mariner it was like about funny stuff team J was being escorted away he was the ambulance on that ambulance cuz he knew that if he went on there he would never be able to see him again freddie was now in two pieces that went into the big ambulance and they were all headed to the same hospital Jane was really high in the Fomenko wanna give back the towel to the EMS guy but they needed to identify Jay because Jay didn't have any ID on him at all and the ambulance ride and he was bursted Jay it's okay I won't be here for you and he's but already died so bad he was just I hate finish the story that's really sad just sitting there waiting wanting Berg they want to hear your version of ASMR no I mean you know what is it Joe there's no hockey he thought the enemy is tablet no okay [ __ ] my office you know okay see come on sister see ya bodies yeah I mean it was Donna I'm cutting this [Music] so meal [Laughter] all I can't use huevos do I know yeah good I come to sign in Spanish so like Marlon Brando when he was doing god [ __ ] oh my god well oh [ __ ] I was funny alright guys well I'm gonna get out of here it looks like it's gonna pour my fingers are itchy I've illegitimate Lea ripped off the skin of my I hope someone clip that ass Amara I've ripped off the skin of my my finger I don't know what to talk about total what are we talking about anymore we did a samar we did some comedy we did is that the guy that was here is it raining yeah okay so I can't leave now anyway so I guess we're just talking get some aloe um because I've ripped the skin off my finger sure any new vape mail from new VAP now no not really why is that yellow is that cocoa butter it's green a woman's it might burn soothing moisturizing when the Sun has set wash off the sand and pamper your skin with luxurious Hawaiian Tropic after some moisturizer with rich moisturizers so that's the lotion new bait male uh no I don't I don't know I'm gonna get a bunch of mail listen I got so much [ __ ] in my pocket in those boxes man I don't even know Neph horas thank you for them what is that what is that supposed to be a finger with a wrench wow that [ __ ] burns like a mother sucker don't blow on it you make it a weird no balsamic bri-bri won't make a channel anywhere because there are some sick [ __ ] people on the internet you know what I mean like there are there are people that there's been so much [ __ ] that somebody requests Sabri to make a channel but the problem Bri has is she's very innocent for lack of better words and when people say the things that they do online I get it that there's trolls but why subject yourself to that if you don't have to you know I totally agree with her assessment if you will of not doing it and believe me there's a lot of people that want to see it but a lot of people want to watch her for the wrong reasons if she was to do ASMR she would need to do the thing with the nipples every single day because that's what that's what guys are you know we're guys what it is I don't want to say exploitation but that's no one wants to watch you know a woman play a game where it just shows her forehead in a ponytail you know they want to see more because people are lonely dirty and while there's plenty of women better on Instagram and all over social media that show bikinis with their crotches Brees not one of those people that's not who bree is and that's not that's not an attack to you at all ball sonic it's just that's just the way that's the way people are and again if you don't if you she's making a perfectly comfortable living where she's at there's no need for her to have to subject herself to that and order to make any kind of funding so to speak Kimi and I could promise you that if you disguise your voice as like a dude and you show your forehead your views will be next to nothing you you might get like five use for everything I had someone criticizing my nails in a video of yours and I have like just got them done so I was like I know that my nails look nice this person's a troll but if it was like a week after I got my nails done and they said that I would have felt very sad absolutely absolutely and that's and that's the that's the realm that we're in look I start talking about exploitation and numbers go down cuz half those people that left with twenty people I just left are people that watch for breasts how much you want to bet right now if I just zoomed out or put my titties close together and I made that the full picture how many people would be in here right now come on come on come on please no and do it from the angle and then it'll make it look like you're super curvy absolutely I've been that's that's that's just the way that it's and look I'm not I'm not saying anything is wrong with that at all if a woman is willing to put herself out there like that then she's willing to accept the repercussions of that response not responsibility of that action absolutely Jennifer I mean you're a pretty girl the prime example take do your hair real nice do your makeup and just take a default picture and put one of your breasts the top part of your breasts or your titty whatever you want to call it and put it in the picture and watch how many people click your picture people don't care about content they kept well I guess that is content but it's a rarity arts and crafts stuff and nobody would watch that exactly right like if you didn't impress but if you had all boobs people like that girl like that bears this is a true story there's a woman I guys you guys are gonna think I'm making this up I promise you I'm not you can google this there's a woman on YouTube that does toy reviews never shows her face only her hands you ready for this she's an ex porn star no no she's an ex porn star so what a god google it right now matter of fact I might be able to share the screen and I don't know it's which would feel about that um yeah because I don't know what will pop up if I type that in no J's looking at pink nipples um but no it's a true story it's a true story um a lot of them but she never shows her face it's only her hands with the toy no it's kids toys yeah so it's like toy reviews of kids toys with a really low just google it man I it's not hard to find out this person I'm talking about like it's not hard at all but um never shows her face but she only shows their hands and she has like a little kid voice right Danielle that's the one I'm talking about watches those things that's that's what I'm talking about that's the channel of course if you don't Google that or do a little research you would never know that like it's not publicize well it's it's publicized if you google it that's the world were in and listen more power to you if you're trying to leave that realm and go on to Tori reviews and used to charge it's totally dead like it works he just needs to charge it for like an hour you found her vaping boring is that the person yeah I'd went that Ryan's toys are reviews what is it twenty six million he made last year yep you found it not hard it's not fun that's actually a that's crazy listen but that's cool man if that's your thing right exactly exactly Danielle exactly you're right you're right absolutely and I'm not don't misconstrue I'm saying then yeah I'm just saying that that more power to you I think that's great I think that you leaving that realm to do something else [ __ ] high five man I mean all start great job gold star oh yeah that that Bryon's toy reviews I want to say it's 26 million last year that's crazy dude 20 you can't I could promise you what is that a day let's let's let's just let's just do a little math real quick let's say you're making 26 million dollars and you divide that by 365 you're making seventy one thousand two hundred and thirty-two dollars and 87 cents every day and you divide that by 24 that means you're making three thousand dollars an hour and then you divide that by 60 you're making fifty dollars a minute I will review Barbie dolls all day every day Micro Machines got it Tonka trucks got it I will the problem is though I don't know if any parents would want their kids to watch me do a toy review I don't I feel like I'd be good at it but I'm gonna [ __ ] that toy yeah listen so I got an email okay so I got an email someone sends me $1,500 I'm not joking but to some patron if you're not a patron you should be anyway no but for real let's be serious but be a patron ah so noble for real I got an email saying you've just been I don't know if I said paid or donated $1500 okay I'm like is this for a review what is this for so when someone donates money to you or said I don't know was it sent me was it I think it was said money I can't remember um anyway and then it shows the sender information and all the information for the companies in Chinese so I try to pull and pulled in Google Trends that I got nothing so my god so I'm reading through it then I see a website and the website is a dot and L which is Netherlands so I go to a website and it's all dildos and vibrators and in the email it says for the review of and it's the website I feel like someone got my name cross-reference with someone else I wouldn't have a problem doing a review on a vibrator I just wouldn't know where to begin you know what I mean like where do you start the opening of the box or do you start with it in your mouth all the way turned up you know like I don't I don't know where you begin so I'm saying to myself in your ass so I'm say to myself what am I supposed to do this has got to be mixed up so I send the person an email back I'm like I don't know if you got the right email or the right person but I've never reviewed vibrators or dildos or Itachi's like I don't I was being serious I don't know where to start what to do I never got a response back they also never asked for the money back so I'm assuming I'm gonna get a package in the mail that's gonna have about 15 adult toys in it now I was talking about doing toy reviews but not this kind of toy you know the man like like I talked about this before but I feel like someone misconstrued the word toy right like I was going for a Tonka truck I'll review the [ __ ] out of a micro machine for fifteen hundred dollars whoa look at these wheels spin we I will do that all day long so long story short this was a week ago now I know there's a holiday so Tuesday might come around and I'm gonna get a big-ass box here's the problem I don't know where to stream the opening of this box can't do it on YouTube I don't I don't think I might be able to do it on periscope cuz they don't they don't moderate anything so I guess I'm doing adult toy reviews now yeah and I was listening I I thought about that I was like well if I could just reference everything vape related and be like when I put this up to my lips it might have a little bit of spit back if you turn this power all the way up you may get shocked you see what I'm saying like kind of sexual innuendos like boy this drip bur works really well you know what I mean like if you look at this sub on crank oops I mean tank you see what I did there no sub ohm whoa that's too much power that's not supposed to shake like this who the [ __ ] sakes the vape you remember that well [Music] put a mod in it and beep it for real oh I could just see that right now vijana up to my lips whoo you know how many flags that will get I will be bad tonight this is dude just got like a hundred forty thousand subscribe but he's got a vagina up to his map that he's vaping on a mod oh I could imagine that flag dude I'll do it I'll live literally do it fifteen on a buck so I'll review the [ __ ] out of whatever you send me don't think you're gonna get like multiple product reviews though yeah I'm gonna pick one or maybe maybe I'll use it and do a review on it based off of what they're actually labeled as you know what I mean like they're labeled as massagers right so I'll put like the hitachi on my back you guys know that dodgy ins and i'm not talking about the TV or the or the construction equipment well i guess you could use that obstruction yeah dude I'll do it I don't care I don't know where I'm gonna put the video but that's not a review that's fun time I just want yellow yeah I saw that can maybe the the one where he has got a lot of views on it too well listen Hitachi is one of those ok what's going on angry couple welcome to the perverted channel on twigs do you know fast tech sells a lot of toys now that I think about it so maybe it's fast act that sent it to me have you ever got paid from fast act to do a review what is the email from there's not a lot of reviewers in there right now so I feel like I I don't I don't know if I've I don't even think I've ever even gotten an email from fast act to do a review ah no problem k1k kw1 about the rain RTA no no no news there's some news over at patreon but as far as like public knowledge now there's nothing as of right now yeah no I don't I don't I I don't know if fast tech does send anything like products out I could I mean I not many companies email me to do reviews on their products so I think the last one that I got was Lupo the room maybe or the rimfire rimfire rimshot no boo boo it was an RDA or an RTA rimfire rim shot rim brim job that's not it that's definitely not it there was no boo boo rim job well yeah and they're not they're not you know they're looking at reviews eyes advertising you know gem they're not looking at reviews as a review you know so it's tough it's tough yeah I think rim shot is when you throw the basketball into the hoop and it hits the rim rim job is when he's thinking chun-yan you look around someone's [ __ ] that is very very true one eye there are a couple companies that go out of their way to make sure that I don't get one that's true but but the thing is with the problem the problem lies in not not so much reviewers the problem lies in a company that says ok we want we want to market our product so I I'm just spitballing here I'm going to assume that they the first person thing emails rip tripperz assuming and then it's probably I'd say either zelf Eve Apes or Mike vapes and then twisted for 20 and then Grimm green again I am severely spitballing at this point but I never see him recommend Oh twisted like if I look up a product review you've never bigger I never been recommended on the side panel everyone else has yeah I would think you would think that money as the bottom line companies would be racing to send you stuff with your reach you know chemi listen um I it's not you know you know you know the deal you know the numbers the numbers don't lie my reach is very very vast and I think a lot of companies are more scared of what I'm gonna say you know they're like I joy I joined was a company that would send me products they paid for maybe two or three reviews but we're going back you know but they would still send me products knowing what I'm gonna say or how I'm gonna react and I broke their ship before I think my last review where they did the resin the resin I think they gave me like three beans for maybe five beans and I'm like what I'd say and I don't care I don't care if you give me fifteen thousand dollars well fifteen thousand dollars I'll make it a little bit harder to find a problem III I don't care I'm not I'm not doing reviews for the money you know like right now I'm not making anything whatever what well I got a couple subscribers but I'm just here just talking to you guys but I think a lot of companies they don't care about that they care about how much subs you have and then not even looking at views because if you look at views I haven't compared myself to ripped rippers but I'm pretty high up there pretty high I mean I also upload a video every day every day there's no there's no I can't remember the actually the NVE is when I took I [ __ ] up and I uploaded at like eleven thirty five so it shows two on one date which bothers me which most people want to be able to see anyway and I don't schedule I actually physically upload at that time every night whose resin stickers that's what it was JC a1 and I see you've been playing a lot of mobile legends what's up brother ah it was resident stick there wasn't even still wasn't even resident was just stickers listen you send me $15,000 I'll eat your [ __ ] on camera again I don't know where I'm streaming it but I'll do it $15,000 in cash listen I'll eat your poop and poke it in my eyes dysentery to [ __ ] around a guy like Oregon Trail dines a night I beat that game 50,000 times plus 5 what are we talking about stop sending new stuff what are you saying I just stopped sending me stuff - yeah you don't listen I literally can't think of any other company right now well some reviewers demand the company that they work with to send me a product like a l've a pretty great example I was gonna buy the passage RDA but you know ma'am not have a great relationship and he doesn't care what I'm gonna say he doesn't give a [ __ ] he's like God did you get it no I [ __ ] get it bro I'm just waiting for it to be sell buy it and I guess I guess he pushed him hard enough and they're gonna send it the same thing with Mike vapes with motto fo they want reviewers want me to review their [ __ ] abso-fuckin'-lutely absolutely absolutely and I'll say the negative things I'm gonna do with the rebirth i i'm not listen on cool with you yes but if I don't like something I'm gonna say it just like I would say it to forego Bree I don't like this fix it yeah I'm not here to suck your balls that's did you have a lover for me yeah I'm sure it's very pissed off about the armadillo I'm sure I'm sure I don't think that they paid me for it [Music] what email what are you talking about he mentioned an email who mentioned an email one eye or the demi crazy dumpling I don't [ __ ] know Demi crazy vapor I don't know sensitive ass is what it is you don't want to hear no [ __ ] oh I'm sure whom he's not happy with it me know me I had a great relationship but if you make a shitty products I'm gonna call out I don't give a [ __ ] I don't care I don't I don't and even like the bulk are ta right I have another digit sending out to that Island guy that war not yet no okay so the bulk are ta I bought and MEA was like oh well they did they did they did they paid me for the armadillo but I didn't like it that should show you guys I don't care you know I'm I'm I don't I don't care I'm trying to think if they did pay me let me look at my paypal hold on a second let me say hold on I can't I don't want to say they paid me if they didn't pay me let me say hold on they knew that I got it yeah but I think they said let me check I want to make sure I'm on a percent here before I say that hold on I can't show it but um yes they did they're good they good sure five beans five beans Jimmy crazy damper mentioned he emailed you then called you S word blah blah and called up his followers to bash your channel hold up my his three his twenty-one [ __ ] people he wants to call people he wants to get people the best Channel I don't think he knows what a [ __ ] Heiser is listen I don't think he knows one I listen to me I don't think he knows what a Heiser is because if he did listen to me he wants to start a war I can promise you that if he hated his haters before he's going to [ __ ] hate YouTube I literally have a I'd say a meme with wicks and coils if I got grazers involved I don't know 7,000 people ready to go we can start a troll war I can promise you that you won't win and then they'll let their friends and also we could get a mean 20k and then the people I just want to be a part of it oh this is this will not this will not go well for him if he truly said that one I where's the armadillo at yeah that's true Kimmy that's true that's that's the won't the stupid [ __ ] pencil drawn armadillo on the side um if he mentioned an email we could share the email I mean if he wants to make send me a time stamp what I get me a time stamp of the video right go to the video get me the time stamps send me the link of all the time stamps in one message and either I know you're Heiser so send it over at patreon or send it on Facebook the time stamps of those links and then I'll respond with a video I won't put his [ __ ] on my YouTube because I don't think he deserves the [ __ ] credit and yeah I can approach that totally different but I don't think so armadillo that's all the [ __ ] up screw we haven't but somewhere um and Kimmy it's so true you know like listen you want to see something negative about the Jenna but the frontal - go for it man break it I that's your opinion you're entitled to that and I know it hurts to hear ma'am I know it does I know it I get it hurts but that's life that's life oh you know the problem is to is then a lot of hazers have alternate accounts look there's haters out there and there's haysoms the Haze's are people to destroy haters that's what they do that's what they do so haters go away he's my users will never go away I could promise you if I [ __ ] reviewed you tips Hayes's aren't going anywhere it's it's a family it's not a it's not just people hanging out such a stupid design absolutely the biggest [ __ ] rainbow in the middle of a deck I would love to see those time stamps till one eye you get me some of those time stamp links tell me more [ __ ] well uh you know q-tips are actually bad to use that's a fact jack well you're doing they're just pushing your wax back into your ear absolutely Edwin absolutely absolutely No now with q-tips to be honest with you when I clean my ears this is gonna this is gonna freak a lot of people out I don't know if I want to say this okay so all right the way I clean man I don't know if I want to say this because there's gonna be someone that's gonna try this and I've been a little nervous okay so okay so what I do is I take a paperclip right this is gonna go bad let me preface this if you're going to put a paperclip in here I want zero responsibility the cops never showed up um I want zero responsibility of you sticking a [ __ ] paperclip in your ear so what I do is I take a paperclip where it's bent you know like how a natural paperclip is bent the part where not okay so if you look at a paperclip you have the top part and then you have the bottom that comes around it swirls out right I use the top part that cups and then I pinch it I feel like what I'm saying here someone's gonna try this and then I pinch it so it's like like a little like a like the top of a bobby pin and then I go in and I scoop and I pull it out and chunks yeah like a scoop part my god I put it in and and I have and then I know I got the wax I know you shouldn't clean it your ears are naturally waxy but there's something when you talk to somebody and they look like they got [ __ ] orangeade in the ear or like a fossil from Jurassic Park that's you know that's 30 well you got that dirty year how much wax is in there total sometimes it's a big buildup you know um oh god I got a story oh my god okay so oh god okay I was cleaning a buddy's years you know those little baby pumpers they're like they're like the little bulbs so I fill it up with water and he yeah he's having a real hard time hearing true story so he's over my sink and I'm sticking it in and I know that when anybody that's clean out to me here and it clean out an ear you know that you got a ridge right so inside your ear if you look in someone's ear if it's clean enough you can see that there's a bump now if if you go in on an angle up you could get behind that canal so he's having a problem he can hear and I got his head tilted to the side and it's over the sink and I'm putting a bulb in and I'm getting more mortar and I'm trying to like flush it out okay this is where the story is gonna take a turn I couldn't get anything out of his ear so I order an ear cleaner from Amazon now an ear cleaner is basically the same thing that they use to clean the [ __ ] plaque off your teeth it's a pressurized nozzle is what it is okay you hook it up to sink or you put water in it you press a button and it comes out at like 40 psi it's not a joke it's not a game it's also not supposed to be used by a non-professional I'm a non-professional but I figured that I could be professional enough towards somebody wouldn't but it wouldn't bother them they couldn't hear anyway so what the [ __ ] I'm not gonna do any more worse damage than what's already done so I get this thing and I turn it all the way up on max cuz in my mind he's got so much wax I've got to turn it on maximum a turn at all maximum I put this thing in his ear I press the button once I press I press the button I press the button once the water goes behind it and it flies out of his ear and lands on the lip it was a chunk about this big of earwax and then I guess I broke everything up and then I press it again and then all this like red/orange wax is coming out of his [ __ ] here like just coming out of his ear yo yo Laci you have no idea how [ __ ] gross this was but there was something so satisfying about it cuz it's like it means like oh my god I can hear I was like yes I'm now an ear nose and throat doctor so I said let's do the other side do the other side I mean tried the bulb on the other ear which I should have probably done cuz it wasn't as tight so anyway I get all this [ __ ] oh dude it's gonna make me [ __ ] throw up okay so all his earwax is in my sink now I turn the sink on and won't go down the drain because there's so much chunks so we start grabbing it out of the sink and we turn his head and I put the thing in his ear the same way that I did the other one but I turn it down a little bit cuz it was a lot of pressure when it was maxed out maybe it was 15 psi don't know 10 psi but it squirts out water with the air you understand it's like a pressure washer but a miniature version it's about this big put it in the oppressed the button chunks were like floating from the water that I just put in his ear they didn't fly out and hit my lip like the first one but chunks were like floating and I press it again and then it's just pouring out of his ear like I don't know 10 years of buildup of wax kids still here's good to this day now if I would have blown out his eardrum that's not my responsibility you gave me rear I just figured I'd clean it out so now I have this pressure washer if anybody's interested in the pressure washer for your ear let me know I got a lot of random [ __ ] I got q-tips I have a really weird bend to them I think they're designed for people that are like or like an animal that has like weird ear canals I got those too but the metal and then you replace the cotton on it it's awkward I got a lot of weird [ __ ] but you have a case of soda okay Jennifer I don't know if you miss the wet wax story oh you missed it that story I'll make you vomit so Bri likes this energy drink I go to 7-eleven to buy a [ __ ] case of soda just spent eighty dollars on what would cost twenty Brian I'm gonna shut up honest with you brother um I'm good with it like I'm I'm good with the pressurizer I can get your ears clean like I'm good I've only done it like two or three times but I'm good I gotta get you nice oh you missed the whole story it was [ __ ] great other plug bad it's like popping pimples man I'm so good on it like people always like J your skin is so good I don't like watching the pimple popper lady that makes me like gag especially when she does the cysts and it looks like worms coming out of no colonoscopy I could tell you sir about colonoscopy so when you do a colonoscopy they give you this stuff to drink to clean out your colon Kimmy listen I got stories for days so when I give you a colonoscopy you have to drink this certain fluid and it's like a it's a very slimy water it's got a weird taste to it it's not like vomit Abul throw-up but it's a very sticky sticky you know what I'm talking about you suck dick right so uh picture jizz Danny throw I don't know what that's like but I can imagine I mean I've held my own jizz and it kind of looks like a bunch of like sugar water like the phlegm you get it back your throat from drinking too much soda you know what I'm talking about so I don't know maybe you don't suck dick but the point is is that you get this really slimy water the worst part it's not so much the colonoscopy part the worst part is the part where you have to poop out the water you will wipe your ass for about four days on one poop you ever get that where you [ __ ] and you're like how much times am I gonna wipe my ass drink the colonoscopy water it doesn't taste bad well it doesn't taste good it just tastes like slimy water yeah oh the jizz is sticky yeah there you go um there's a lot of ladies in here you know what I'm talking about I just imagine so the problem is it makes you ass so wet yeah everybody's had diarrhea now just make it clear you don't want to swamp ass don't drink this water I don't know why they couldn't just give you a pill that just makes you poop out everything this stuff literally cleans out your colon you know you could go to like like a food store shop right or something I don't know what your local Piggly Wiggly if you're down south that's a real story uh you could always get like those homemade enema jammies and I said enema not M&Ms don't go sticking M&Ms in the [ __ ] J told me this will clean me out ah no it didn't never said that don't recommend it you might get a sugar rush but you could get homemade enemas sorta yep just like that and I'm not talking about a bidet that's just the bathroom water fountain that's all that is why do you want a homemade enema you're trying to save money Edwin you know do I have to wear a panty liner are you talking about pads Jim I'm all about the maxi pads the ones with the wings all about it the colonoscopy part is not bad man that's 20 minutes 15 20 minutes it is an exit only but sometimes you got to make sure that your exit is not blocked you know what I mean no one likes a blocked up fire exit you try to get out [ __ ] there's all this soda in front of the door now you're [ __ ] you don't want any soda in yes that's basically what it is it's like a tube it's a tube with a camera yeah pink a bank this is how we roll over here talking about [ __ ] assam our beaches lotion for some reason I read that homicides are really sick I don't know why I didn't see em roids you know what's really cool is when you go watch it that's the best they put it on a big-ass 60-inch screen right in front of your [ __ ] face so like oh that's what my [ __ ] looks like dude I can't do it I watched a video where they cut oh my god I could watch death videos all day you know I could watch hanging videos all day I can't even watch people getting mutilated like in machines that's no problem the problem I have is when they take like a beating heart and they cut the ribs and then they flick the heart that does something to me inside I don't know what it does but it's not comfortable I cannot do medical videos no way like where they open up like your if it's if you take a leg or something like you saw the one with the guy that had the corkscrew in his calves and his thighs that I can watch that's what severed they you know I that's nothing when you start cutting open a lung and playing with the little I want to say silly a is what the little branches aren't lungs I'm not with that what'd you call it TRL see that that's how I feel DJ it's the organs that bother me like I can't do it do it I can't do it I can't I mean I guess I can if you put it oh it's not gonna make me pass out it just makes me feel really uncomfortable and for whatever reason it makes me embarrassed oh man that's so that's how it looks like and they said I could do about it oh you know faces the death was fake right let me got to tell you that that's fake Manny like when they ate the teddy bear like doing they they were eating the dog that was a teddy bear that they filled with big guts believe me I've done enough of research on faces of death not saying that some of the jumpers weren't real but majority of the [ __ ] whether time I eaten the monkey brains that was a stuffed animal yeah not all of it no not all of it but when they're eating a dog that's pig guts swear to God so what are gone no Joe not playing

hair beauty the princess theories you can find them on Instagram and I see hair beauty they sent me over some 613 straight hair two bundles of 24-inch two bundles of 26 inch in a 20 inch 13 by 4 lace front so right now I'm showing you everything that came inside the packaging they sent a lots of goodies [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Sawadee hating constructing his handmade frontal unit using all four bundles in the frontal and now we're gonna do some routes on this unit so what I'm doing now is separating the frontal from the bundles because I'm not going through and ruining the whole wig we just you just need to route the front so that's the part that's necessary so I separate the bundles from the front so I'm gonna part the hair down the middle and then we're gonna proceed with starting to color these roots the color I'll be using is screamin nature I think it's a light golden brown if I'm not mistaken and I want to show you the technique I do to make sure you don't get any color on your lace so after you have followed the manufacturer's instructions on how to or mix the color in the developer you want to go ahead and take that content out of the bottle and pour it into a coloring bowl and then you're gonna take a rat tail comb and you're literally gonna comb the dye onto the roots I know it may seem weird at first but you're doing it you might be scared but I promise you the more you do it the more comfortable you'll get with doing it all you do is dip the ends of the comb in the dye you literally come to die on the roots and this is like the best way that you don't get color on the lace I don't even spray my legs of it got to be free spray anymore I just go ahead and do my roots because this method is so is so mess free so perfect I think you guys will love it [Music] [Music] [Music] and you can see that color is developing you have no color on the lace and once you get down the planet so the whole front so you want to let that sit for 40 minutes and rinse it out now we're going ahead with her bowel care procedure I'm just taking my Ruby kisses level 14 and I'm placing that all over the cap I will also put the same makeup on the inside of her wig on the frontal part just so Inc your better blend with her skin once I cut the cap off I'll be cleaning her skin with sea breeze because she is allergic to alcohol and then we're gonna protect the skin with the ball host can protect [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're gonna place the wig of the class here making sure that the hairline of the frontal is in front of the cap and once we get a position on correctly we're going to cut out her ear tabs and then we're gonna proceed to set the weight down just to give the most security [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my adhesive of choice today is Volvo active I'm going to data along the edge of the cap making sure I am actually getting some glue on the skin and once we dotted along the edge of the cap we're gonna smooth airbag using our popsicle stick making sure you smooth the back as flat as possible so wants the glue dries you don't have any lumps or clumps because they won't look too pretty and we're gonna apply 4 layers today making sure that each layer dries completely clear before you add another layer once that fourth layer is dry we're going to come back and lay it right down and then we're going to tie it down using our elastic band [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now to just through the hair out we're gonna blow dry using our competence me and you stopped me spraying the silk elements olive oil heat protectant spray on it beforehand and once we get done doing that we're gonna proceed to take that band off and cut the lace off using our eyebrow razor [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and as you can see that lace notes are pretty good pretty good of course we're gonna do some more extra work to make sure it blends in even more but it's looking pretty great so far if I do say something myself so now we're gonna cut the rest of the lace off off camera then we're gonna separate her baby hairs then we're gonna take our free spray and we're gonna spray it at the edge of the lace this is gonna help it blend better into the skin and we're gonna tie it down again use the re elastic band [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now using my slave at jordan-hare waxed it just to make sure I cover it up cover up that last check in the back using a piece of the frontal you'd ever want to make sure you do this with any style you do and if you don't know how to tell but anyway you know make sure you do this with every style you do because you do not want your tracks shown when your client bends their hair down that is not cute you all make sure you cover up that last track and today we're gonna be doing a half of half down style with crimps I got inspired by Eric and say he did this look on Ari back a while ago and I was like yeah but the best on my cousin JLo because she's always down for it so yeah once we uncover that last track we're gonna start I think we're gonna take the band off and then we're gonna start pulling the hair up into the half up half down type situation so stay tuned [Music] [Music] [Music] in also caesarean flyways while I'm pulling this hair up until this half-up half-down style I also be using my sebastian shaper plus hair spray you can also use free spray um that was just the closest thing back to me that I saw even though I do see there free spray garlic and on my station but you know we we're gonna talk about that right now so yeah just continue watching after I pull up the hair into the half of a half now we're gonna start on these baby hairs [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] into cut the edges that we're gonna use the operator and then we're gonna shoot them into place using our Erica JS to fluff stuff foam I swear by this farm this is like the best foam to do baby hairs with on the front so because it doesn't lift your frontal and it just gives the best hold because I found that other mooses the whole be trash and it be lifted up the front soon and no I don't get paid to endorse their products um I love to fluff stuff um I bought with my own money like it's the truth like for real and once we get the super hair baby hair since the place we're gonna start crimping the hair [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now let me go ahead and give out a huge warning whenever you use the colored hair or blonde hair please do not use high heat and don't use a lot of hair sprays so you see I sprayed the crap out of that hair with the hairspray and it I was using my crimper on like the highest heat setting which I knew I wasn't supposed to but anyway as you can see the hair is gonna start in certain places you're gonna see that it starts turning pink and it's because when their hairspray mix with that high heat on this blonde hair it just does something it changes the color and it has happened to me plenty of times before so yeah the color changed not completely but like in certain spots you'll see you're gonna see it's pink so if you're gonna crimp your hair make sure you don't use heat over 400\u00b0 and make sure you don't spray that much hairspray just a little bit don't spray too much hairspray or you'll end up with results like me but if you want these results hey follow everything I do I mean it was pretty cool to me we we didn't kill we never take you know is that serious but you know if it's for like a photo shoot or something like that yeah this would have been like I would have been pleased with this but yeah just put that disclaimer out there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and now we're gonna take our wrap off your edges will be dry by now then I'm gonna show you guys the hair before I loosen the crimps up and before she gets her makeup done and she could see we loving it so far as you can see he's pink right that sounds crazy so now what I did as they sprayed be honest though turn up the heat spray on the hair and I ran my fingers through the hair just to loosen up the crimps and I'm gonna show you guys the finishing look once again this is icy hair beauty 6:13 straight hair - 24 inches to 26 inches and it's winning in front so I custom-made this front a week and I custom colored it I think you guys so much make sure you like share comment subscribe

the natural sunlight and um yeah so I have a picture that I upload or post on one of these sets so you can see the true color cuz I don't feel like you're actually getting the true color right now oh but for this product I really didn't like it some of the people well some of the people that I saw using this product not this color but I think some people had a hard time getting the brown honey blonde attack color I've seen some people use origin didn't come out but they wanted then I see some people with gold or something on their black natural heritage Emmitt looking a little green color greenish pebble of green tint in it so this one actually came out the brown color and I wish I could see the full color because I love it like I haven't had color of my hair in a while so for me to just try this and it actually my hair was defined because I already use my leave-in conditioner what my cream and my eco styler gel but when I know after I put color in I was shingling it as you saw in the video it's still despite of my curls and my curls are still defined right now like they are beautiful okay like they are beautiful hands down this is a great wash and go all that stuff but yeah so I really love the color probably gonna only keep it in for a few days then do another wash day and four or five days so I'm gonna see how long it lasts but yeah I give it a thumbs up umm I really

different little things that you need to prep with so\nthis is the cirepil blue lotion this is like a cleanser so you just stick a little bit\non a cotton swab and you are going to just lightly wipe it over all of the areas that\nyou'll be waxing and this does remove a little bit of makeup if people have it and I always\ndo underneath the eyebrow above the eyebrow and right between because those are all the\nspots that I shape and when that dries you go through with just a tiny bit of this cirepil\noil and this just helps protect the skin from getting ripped off even though honestly when\nI wax eyebrows most of the time I don't even do these two steps because the cirepil blue\nwax is so awesome most of the time the skin is fine without doing this but you're supposed\nto do this and i'm being honest with you that I don't always do it because I don't think\nthat it's 100% necessary but i'm listening to the directions because when I teach I don't\nwant haters so you just lightly rub the oil over the top of the skin and then I take a\ncotton ball after that and wipe off all of the excess so you're just removing as much\nof the oil as you possible can and that just preps the skin so that the oil protects the\nskin a little bit from the wax sticking to that because the cirepil blue wax is a hard\nwax you don't use strips with it you apply it onto the skin and it kind of shrink wraps\naround the hairs and it sticks only to the hairs so when you rip it off you're not ripping\noff layers of skin with it so it's really really cool technology in fact i've tested\nit several times on the back of my wrist right here and there's no hair at all on that when\nI peel it off it doesn't hurt at all so that proves that it's not really ripping of skin\nit's just pulling out the hairs so when it hurts it's only hurting because you are ripping\nthe hairs out it's not hurting because you ripped the whole top layer of skin off and\nit's like on fire and burning and red and that's why I really like this brand I think\nit's the best so now that her skin is prepped you can take the wax so I like to use the\nlittle tiny sticks for the eyebrows they have some that are a little bit longer that I actually\nthink are a little bit better to use but I have these and I'm trying to use them up so\nthey are a little bit harder to hold onto but they're fine i'm just going to keep her\nnatural eye shape and i'm just going to close your eyes for a second i'm just going to clean\nup a little bit in here and in between here and then just a tiny little line on the top\nbecause you can see right here there's a few little strays alright so anytime you apply\nwax you apply it in the direction that the hair grows so the hair grows this way so i'm\ngoing to start up here and I just do a little swipe with the stuff then follow it all the\nway down and with cirepil wax you want to make sure you have a lip and that's a little\ntiny ridge of the wax that stays thicker you see how it's kind of shallow in the middle\nbut then there's these ridges and doing that prevents the wax from ripping when you pull\nit off it keeps it all in tact and strong and it also makes it easy to flip the edge\nup when you're ready to pull the wax so and it does take some practice but here's the\nother thing don't panic if you get some of this in hair that you don't want to rip out\nbecause all you need to do is take this oil and then you put it on a cotton pad and you\ncan rub it onto like if you were to get it into the eyebrow right here you can rub it\nonto the wax and it softens it a little bit and you can kind of just scrape it out with\nyour fingernail and if that's not working you can take the blow-drier on a really low\nwarm setting and warm it up a little bit and it will melt it just enough to kind of roll\nit out and you can pull it out of the hair without ripping it off so I like that a little\nbit better than the honey waxes because it's such a different color the honey waxes are\nreally clear and if they run down in there sometimes you don't even know and sometimes\nwhen you stick the paper on and push down on it it leaks down in there to so you get\nthese really weird patterns that you waxed out so I really really like this stuff better\nand I think it's a lot easier to use it might be a little bit harder to use at first when\nyou just but then you'll end up loving it I promise so then underneath you make sure\nthey close their eyes and then you're just going to start right in here and you're going\nin the direction that the hair grows and it's ok if this gets on their eyelid a little bit\nbecause there's no hair down there and so it's just going to come right off without\nhurting them and then you just draw the line make sure that you have turn your head a little\nbit make sure that you have a good lip here to pick up and I do so i'm going to leave\nthat one there if you find that it's too thin and you don't have a lip then you can just\ngo back over it and add some more just applying it the same direction that the hair grows\nmaking that lip at the bottom and you can go back in and kind of tighten it up a little\nbit if it's I usually do one application to just kind of get it on there and then I smear\nit up with a stick and take it like a really pretty line and now that we have those two\non by time I usually get them all on there's one over here that's dry or cooled off enough\nto rip off so i'm going to come over here and check them just by touching them you can\nfeel if they're hard enough if you can touch them and they melt and squish down then they're\nnot done but these ones are done and this is very important you need to hold the skin\ntight when you're waxing if you just rip this up it's going to pull her skin up like look\nhow stretchy her skin is ooh that's not working let me grab your cheeks i'm your aunty ooh\nsee you'll just like pull her cheeks up but if you're right here and you hold the skin\ntight you can't pull the skin up so there won't be any bruising and it will feel a lot\nbetter so what I do is I take my left hand my forefinger and my thumb and I pull the\nskin as tight as i can get it and now we applied the wax in the direction hair grew you always\nrip it off in the opposite direction that you applied in the opposite direction that\nit grows so i'm going to hold this tight flip it up with my fingernail really quick to get\nthis little ledge to hold onto and then you rip it really quickly and you keep your hand\nclose to the face you're just going to roll it around wow that was a really bad example\nsorry Kass so you're just going to roll it around like that and then I always push my\nfinger down onto their skin after and that keeps the nerves from like registering the\npain as much and it really helps to help ease some of the sting that immediately happens\nwhen you pull so same thing right here again i'm going to flick the edge pull it fast and\nthen just lay my finger down not too bad are you going to cry? and you can see now we have\nthis really pretty shape so we're going to go to the other side flip it up roll it finger\ndown and you can see on this wax it's cool you can see all the little hairs that pull\nout and same thing underneath pull the skin tight and now we have this really pretty eyebrow\nso the only thing left to do is you can take tweezers and tweeze out any little one that\nyou missed or you can put the wax over it again with this stuff because like I said\nit only pulls out the hair and then just this middle section so really easy last couple\nsteps then we'll be done so right here for the middle I usually just do one stripe of\nthe center make sure you have a nice amount there then I just slowly ease my ledge over\nuntil it's right where I want it you don't want to go too far in you never want to go\npast the corner of the eye this corner of the eye right here you don't ever want to\nbring it in closer to that so hers are actually ok right now and then the hair grows up so\nI applied it up going this way and then when i pull it down I'm going to pull it this way\ntowards her nose and then there's a couple of little spots that I want to clean up underneath\nhere just right in here by the archway these are perfect times to cleanup while that's\ndrying little blob there and then this one little blob here and when those dry we will\njust pop those off they won't even be that painful because they're just a couple hairs\nshe won't even really notice it this one will be a little bit of a sting we gotta make sure\nthat we're pulling the skin tight and you can just put you're finger on the bridge of\nthe nose and pull down a little bit and then you flip it and you pull it off finger down\nbeautiful and these ones are dried up pretty good it dries pretty quick and so now the\nvery last step I always do is I take my shears make sure they're nice and clean and I take\na clean comb and I comb through the eyebrows I always do this because sometimes we have\nreally long pieces that like to stick out and I go through up at the top and I just\ntrim them down a little bit and then when they lay back in and you can even push them\ndown and do the same thing you never want to cut into the eyebrow but just be very careful\nyou see there's just a couple that it didn't get for some reason tweezing two or three\nlittle hairs is no big deal your skin is probably numb right now anyways from all the waxing\nright? and then I always dust off with a clean dry towel trying to get all of the little\nhairs off out of their face and eyes okay you're all done and that is how you use cirepil\nwax to do eyebrows and hopefully you guys liked this video and think her eyebrows are\nbeautiful because they are give my niece a thumbs up for having beautiful beautiful eyes\nand eyelashes she is so cute I love her and make sure you guys subscribe tell your friends\nand we'll keep making videos thanks guys see ya!", "UfGv9eYZyHs": "you probably think you know what a banana looks like but if you were to go back in time you would be so confused for many reasons but mostly the banana one it's great yeah so good yeah so basically recently grub Street put together a video that showed side-by-side comparisons of pre domesticated fruit which is fruit before humans started breeding them and growing them and you know modifying them I almost said the danger word which is GMO which I will get to later let's take a look at what they have to offer so a long time ago the wild banana was full of different seeds they were not soft seeds either and they were likely cultivated around according to them 7,000 years ago in Papua New Guinea and basically the banana we have today is it's been it's been groomed or bred by two different species a mono banana we have today our the one that we're most familiar with with eating is it's just been the one that was bred off a specific kind of banana there are so many I mean my mother talks about how  our bananas are in this country because she's from Vietnam and she had a very different kind of banana growing up so what are the bananas like there she said there were better tasting smaller the ones we have are I guess too sweet just giant sweet yes she doesn't like them did were they still slippery in comedic I don't dare she does tell her that lip on him oh that's fun yeah but no it's not I love the idea I love the idea that they were like oh my god these banana seeds are so terrible look there's something about it let's do something about it we'll continue they might have just I had like mush that they to pick hard seeds out of for a long time yeah but they were like oh we got to do something bout this so let's take a long time to find the ones with less seeds and we'll plant those and reinforce that behavior I wonder I wonder how they did it wild watermelon so I've seen this I think this cutout image is from a painting a famous painting originally from Africa became common in the Western market from the 1600s as you can see they had a swirly design in them people wondered when looking at the painting you know is this not ripe but the black seeds do indicate yes it is ripe and it has been bred in modern days to basically just be a large red centre it's been domesticated for our eating pleasure basically it's easier to eat now there's more fruit in there there's more of a payoff than what we would normally love it I like I like any idea watermelon really yeah so I don't know how did you find that out um Himes getting hives a lot as a kid that did it oh are you allergic to watermelon Jolly Ranchers cuz that's just I mean II just don't like them has nothing no flavor similarities no like artificial this one could be explained though like the person like saw watermelon was like when I get home I'm gonna paint that mm-hmm then he got home and was like oh crap I things like an orange no no that's not stuff it looks Gordy or looks more like the word interesting yeah to me the wild eggplant that looks very different okay we're used to seeing like a big purple waxy eggplant this is just like little blue and yellow here's the thing I'm used to looking at eggplants and going how the hell is it called an eggplant it looks nothing like any egg I've ever seen and then you see this and you're like oh that looks like an egg on a plant that makes way more sense yeah listen from the next one injury sort of it does look like ginger so it was cultivated during the 900s in Asia white or purple with thin roots and a bold taste unlike the current taste is he asked carrots we got now they did look whiter purple and I said that the modern orange carrot comes from a yellow mutated strain of the purple one and then that eventually came over to the the orange right they're like hey we're going to America can we have a carrot they're like I have this stupid yeah get out of here all right cool I guess is what carrots are the veracity of that statement now that's it next fruit it's absolutely right it's not a fruit yes corn wild corn very dry I like how that was the comment they put on here yeah not good no you think corn now is dry no first domesticated around 7,000 BC god that looks nothing like corn no and when you open it up closer it's just like very small amounts of grain in there as opposed to what we might see today on an ear of corn which is quite a lot and it's also today's kind of corn is much sweeter yes I've been how do they do that well I mean there is a process of food domestication so that actually first happened about 10,000 years ago between the Tigris and Euphrates and Mesopotamia people collected seeds from wild plants and they grew them on their own well not on their own but like in their own you know God lot and they did as much as they could and make sure to head optimal growing conditions like water and light and harvesting in them at the right time and taking care of them waiting them this happened a lot with wheat barley lentils and peas those are believed to be the first ones and I mean this happened around the world's potatoes were first cultivated in South America rice was first cultivated in Asia what a shock I imagine up so plants have also been domesticated for cotton yeah and you know Vipers and ornamental things when you say like they've given like prime conditions there are like in the winemaking world yeah certain places where like the soil is not very rich there's just one that I'm this guy has this vineyard on the side of like a volcano and the base is like the grapes have to fight for every bit of nutrient and that actually translates to like the flavor of even if not the wine like the actual grapes so you'll see if the conditions were different in any given year there will be a noticeable different in taste on the fruit which is I guess if you do that for thousands of years so today when we refer to GMOs it's it's a mostly referring to genetically engineering them which is a little bit different than the broad blanket term of GMOs which could be as much a selective breeding or all the way to you know choosing certain characteristics or breeding certain characteristics and perhaps from bacteria perhaps from other plants perhaps from other organisms and it's it's wildly different but when we're looking at the the terms of plant demenna education a lot of it is growing them and seeing which ones are you know have prime characteristics that you might want in your food and continuing to breed for that there's also mutated ones like I said for the carrot where we're going to just use this mutated point I'll go to animal this mutated plant and just keep working and to do give it the best conditions to grow and thrive and take its child plants and let have that one thrive instead and then we get to something today like the orange care that looks very different from yeah what do you weed essentially and it's it's become wildly different over I guess ten thousand years maximum so yes it's interesting to see how much they've changed over time or what characteristics we've gone for and then you can even do that with radiation though I don't do not think these are related to the the math book force mutated right I think and in many ways plants make food from radiation out of the Sun with the Sun perfect but probably not like the crazy like camera this is not what we're this was a weird thing in the 70s it's really related to how this progress works it is interesting story though and that is going to have to be for another time because we are out of time here on nerd alert audience what do you think of the differences of plants would you have wanted to eat those less than favorable plants

some wax by Sarah Phil that you can pick up on Amazon for around $20 if you have been following my channel for a while back I actually reviewed the GG Brazilian wax warmer kits and that's what I'm displaying here as the wax warmer for this particular wax I picked up this particular wax because the previous - that I had that came with the kit had run out even though the Brazilian wax by Gigi did his job I found that sometimes it was a little bit too harsh and it was really difficult to get the right consistency and it also wasn't particularly great on like larger surfaces like your legs or when you have a little bit thinner and less dense areas of hair so that really started my search looking elsewhere for maybe a better wax formula and this really fit the bill so far I've used it quite a few times at various areas and on different types of hair and I found it to be quite effective in removing hair in all of those areas so it really does live up to the expectation of being able to apply this wax pretty much anywhere on your body from your piste to the bikini area your legs your arms and maybe even your eyebrows if you're that bold and the best part about it is it's pretty much pain free as long as you apply it properly and it's actually pretty user friendly compared to the other wax I've tried before it is a type of hard wax which means you don't need to worry about having to buy wax strips unlike soft wax and the basically the way to apply it is first you have to warm it up to a good somewhat this cuz consistency it kind of feels a little bit like syrupy consistency so if it's a little too runny that means it's too hot you need to let it cool down a little bit and if it's a little bit too immobile then that means you need to heat it up a little bit more it just takes a little bit of trial and error to get the right consistency but generally if you get that syrupy viscosity you should be good to go you can always test it on say your wrist or something to feel like if it's too hot for you or not and of course if you already have a wax warmer like I do I'm using the one that came in the Brazilian kit by gg then it's much easier to get that temperature right the style I have here is of course the 10:1 you can buy in the bag salad that just means you have to provide your own container or vessel to hold it and then you probably just microwave it to get it all heated up it's definitely easier I think to just only wax warmer maybe it takes a little bit longer but you're able to maintain that consistency over a longer period of time especially since if you want to wax larger areas of your skin but anyways back to the waxing process so once you get that right consistency you want to take something like a popsicle stick and there's also these dedicated sticks that you can buy on Amazon for waxing purposes as usual I'll put the link in the description if you guys need that but you just go ahead and get a little good of a glop on one side and then you just smoothly apply it in the direction of the hair growth so if your hair generally grows downwards you want to apply it in that direction so for example I'm just applying that here on my pits so it's really easy to see so I'm applying it downwards and then I always leave a little bit extra wax at the very end so it's easier for me to peel off later so it takes maybe a 2 minutes or so to let it cool off a little bit you just need it to be cool enough so that the wax won't stick to your fingers when you try to remove it but once it's sufficiently cooled you just take the end of the wax and then pull it from the opposite direction of hair growth so in this case it's going to be from the bottom and in that way it'll pull the hair out from its root and now you can see it's very effective in moving the hair in that area hard wax is generally more suitable for areas where your skin is not as taut so your pits the bikini area your eyebrows your mustache area but that's not to say that it won't work on your arms and legs as well it's just not as effective especially if you have a little bit thinner and more spread out hair like I do the ones again I apply in the direction of hair growth and then remove it in the opposite direction and you can see by the wax strips remaining that it is able to still pick up a few loose hairs there but you can see all the little white stuff on it and that's all the dead skin cells that it also picked up but that's the extent of how much this wax picks up it's not going to rip off your skin or anything like that there is some times that can make your skin a little bit red but after a few hours that so we're really easily so if you have super sensitive skin may be waxing isn't for you but then again you probably shouldn't be watching this video if you know you have really sensitive skin but what I really like about this particular waxing formula is that it's really forgiving so if you're a little bit hesitant on getting into waxing but you are curious then I think this is a really great wax to start with just because it's very forgiving you don't have to worry about getting the exact perfect consistency or timing it perfectly to have it cool down just right so you can peel it off it's very flexible in the time frame compared to the other wax that tested before so if you're interested you can check out the product link in the description the one I'm reviewing here is the tin version in the 14 ounce size it does come in another sighs I think it's double the capacity but even at this fourteen ounce size I expect this to last me for at least three years so it's definitely a worthy investment and if you want to get the wax warmer and also the popsicle sticks I'll have the links for that also in the description", "wSe3X6XVYIg": "hey guys this is Kristen with htx Center I'm going to show you the difference between a good wax strip versus a bad black strip it's extremely important when it comes to the technique that you use because if you lay this triple the wrong way it's not going to move the hair so it's actually pretty simple and I've gone over in other videos but I figured I would just make a video solely for this topic so I'll do one on each arm so you can see the difference between the two now you want to get a majority of your wax on one side of your strip just like that so obviously want to go in the direction of the hair growth first so we're going to apply in my case this would be up come around make your lip on the end and then come back down so lip on the end is just where you add a little bit extra wax on the top you know what that one actually isn't in that good so I'm going to come back a little bit more on the end now that's something else that people don't realize if your first one you're not totally satisfied with it you can add more to it no big deal um so in this case I want to add more to the adds right there just like that super easy just make sure your ensures that I'm gonna get a good removal whenever I take it off so let this dry for a second which there and I'm using start pills blue film hard wax in this video so it actually dries really quickly so remove it just like that perfect now let me show you about one so you will be amazed their removal between these two because this is gonna be very different so now one thing the first thing that I see that people will do and they'll apply strips in two different ways so they'll either just apply like a pencil and they'll just go up I see this in videos all the time like that and then let me show you another way that I see people put them onto so they'll do it the same way I did it on the correct side look kind of do it to the side here a little bit so they'll still go up like that but they don't make their lip at the end okay so hopeful you can see the difference between these two so there's the one that's just frayed all over the place and really disgusting looking and then there's the one where they still apply it the way I did it on the side of their stick but they didn't make a lip on the end now not gonna lie I'm a little nervous this is gonna really have to take off because there's no real um huh okay you see all this because all the edges were afraid it's just a nightmare I mean your neck sit there and try to come back and get those little pieces off which if you have hair you can see my arms are clearly due for a waxed that's uh it pulls up every single little hair that is not fun for you or your client this one okay that's another thing see how that broke not fun and it just causes a lot of extra work frankly I'll show you a good strip again so you can see the difference all right so again all in one direction see how smooth it is I make my lip on the end come back down say not that lip a little bit just like that someone else was asking me how do I get rid of the strings honestly whenever have a little string I'll just take my stick the head wax on it and just kind of wave it in front yeah and that gets rid of them it just takes practice to not get strings and sometimes I still have strings and I'm laying them and I'll move my stick and a lot of you know big string across the room and I just kind of deal with it so it's just practice honestly but um yeah again you'll see when I remove this it's gonna come off in one clean swoop so I'm not sitting there you know pushing on my customer trying to pick off the little pieces that didn't want to come off the first time obviously it also depends on the quality of the wax that you're using but if you're using a high quality wax you still have to lay it properly otherwise it's just not gonna work so keep that in mind go up make it up on the end come back down if you die little extra wax - you know smooth out when your edges no big deal it's totally fine I have to do it all the time but just don't don't make your edges all frayed and there it's just oh gosh it's just gonna hurt it's not gonna be fun and I'm now gonna have to go back and fix all this because now i have wax stuck in the hair in my arm and that's not pleasant so keep that in mind any questions always always feel free to ask me I fill out the descriptions in my videos so if you are interested in the wax that I'm using I'll put a link for star pills blue film hard wax in the description any questions let me know don't forget to Like and subscribe to see more of my videos and I will see you next time bye guys", "jdED3BhugB0": "hey guys this is Kristen with Atos enter Austin Arbor one of the most frequently asked questions that I get is what type of wax are you using and where can I get it so I wanted to talk to you just to make a quick video in to show you about that one so I've got it heated up here I will show you this is what it was so going to smelt it so this is paradin blue hard wax I've tried multiple different types faired and has been my favorite I really I really like them because I can put it on a customer and it's not going to snap when I pull it off if you purchase a cheaper hard wax whenever you apply it you have to apply it thickly and it can break when it comes off which is extremely painful for your customer and we try to make this as easy as possible so luckily that this stuff I can actually apply it pretty thin most of the time you can kind of see the color you should be able to see that color on the on the person's skin you don't need to apply it heavily whenever you're using it one thing to show you on this is it comes in as beads so it comes in as ten pound bags or you can buy smaller ones but I go through so much of it with clients so it makes more sense for me to buy in the big bag so comes in as beads like this and you'll just whenever you want to apply them for a start so your pot it more put more in your pot and mix it in and it was and it will turn into this wonderful beautiful blue that you see here Merida is awesome there's a couple places I purchase it from the one that I recommend the most is the dimensions and aesthetic advancement on - dimensions a AECOM they've been great because if you purchase a certain amount I think it's I think it's over 200 I can't member but either purchase or them out then shipping is free and they give you discounts if you buy in bulk as well which is awesome another place you can buy is IVA aesthetics that's another one I don't purchase on them as often because you pay for shipping which is kind of bummer when I can get it for free somewhere else but but it's always good have options so I have purchased one before and they've been good too they're always fast see you know you don't just want to stick with one just in case that happens at least you have a backup but buried in blue like I said is awesome I love this stuff my clients really love it it's easy on the skin it applies really well and and it's been my favorite I'm always open to suggestions if y'all find something and you want to get my opinion let me know just drop a comment and all em I'll let you know what I think if I've used it before if not then maybe I'll give it a shot but I'm always here to help you guys so phone number here is five one two five oh one two seven six seven thanks for watching", "oyODRCcxh_g": "hey guys it's Kristen with ATT wax Center I'm gonna show you how to apply hard wax now if there's anything I don't answer in this video any additional questions you might have comment down below you can also like subscribe on Instagram Facebook and if you are on Facebook don't forget to check out wax Club it's for professionals only so estheticians cosmetologist if you're currently in school you're all welcome okay so for this video how to apply hard wax I'm going to direct this for two different types of groups first group are beginners if you've never used hard wax before or very very little you just really don't know what you're doing this is great for you now this is also for a second group of people those are for professionals that already use hard wax but maybe you're just trying to perfect your strip a little bit better just make sure you're really making it as perfect as possible so for the second group for those professionals wait until you see me hold up a stick and I'm twirling it here and then tune in there cuz that's where I'll actually show you how to apply it so you can skip all of the beginning things explaining the first steps before cuz you know how to do that so you can start skipping forward and now for all my beginners or n\u00famero actors welcome um there's five key points to keep in mind when trying to know how to apply hard wax so first one is using a high-quality hard wax getting the right consistency of the wax itself the second or third one I'm sorry is gonna be the actual prepping your skin making sure doing that properly applying the strip in the right way and then last but not least removing it in the right way so I got five key points first one I'm using a high-quality hard wax I can't stress tough enough I promise it's gonna make your life so much better don't get the really cheap waxes it's gonna break it's gonna cause a mess it's gonna stop the hairs so you end up using more in the long run so please if I could stress anything at all he's a high quality hard wax I promise you will thank me later now a number two getting the right consistency of the wax that's huge if it's too hot it's gonna burn your client if it's too cool it's not gonna adhere to the hair properly so let me actually show you with some of the wax that I've got heated up here and you can see the consistency of so with this one I'm using mermaid wax in this video this is the Signature Series the color itself is Serena so with this one you want to look for honey or molasses that's kind of the easiest way to describe it for the consistency of how the wax should move or feel so if I get some on my stick right here you'll see how slow it falls off the stick like I said if it falls too soon it's too hot if it doesn't fall at all it's too cool so I'm one a happy medium but BA you want it to move a slow like honey or molasses it's perfect another thing to keep in mind when it comes to getting the right consistency of the wax and I know a lot of people have contacted me asking am I you know I can't get it to the right consistency and I find out they're using a low-quality warmer um it's gonna make your life so much more difficult not using the quality warmer I only use the best of the best because this is what I do on a daily basis everyday is wax and I want to make it as easy on myself as possible so I promise if you invest in a high quality warmer it will change your life but if you're getting one of those like little cheap like 1,500 bucks ones from China stock sorry um okay so next is gonna be prepping the skin the right way so first I'll use a pre wash cleanser and that's to get off any kind of like oils lotions um deodorant makeup dirt anything like that sweat you don't want anything that's going to be in the way of the wax adhering to the hair itself so make sure you cleanse the skin first if they have dry skin and sometimes you can see a client has like dry flakes on them you can tell if it's dehydrated I'll apply a little bit of pre wax oil now if I don't see that if I can tell they're hydrated I won't use that just enough for me I'm in Texas it's hot and humid here so um it's not really necessary but if you're in a more dry climate then you might want to use oil and more regular basis but for me if I only notice it then I will otherwise I won't now if I am doing underarms or like bikini Brazilian services I'll put a little bit of corn starch powder after I either cleanse and oil or just cleanse that makes sure that any kind of moisture on the client it's all sometimes there even after you cleanse they just get sweaty they're nervous you know your nerves are going crazy and so I'll put a little bit of powder on top that gets rid of any kind of excess moisture that I'm kind of accumulator not there um and also just make sure that it's easy for the wax to directly stick to the hair so like I said bikini or underarm services I will apply a little bit of powder so now let me get someone on my stick and all of the professionals to join us again welcome guys okay so for body services I will rock it business practice goodness actual application for body services I'll make sure I get all of the wax on one side of my stick just like that um and then I will take it apply in the direction of the hair growth so I will get all the wax off my stick and then I'll apply upwards since my hair is growing up in this case go to the top make my lip and then come back down just like that perfect so you want to make sure that your edges are nice and smooth if they're not smooth the wax can crack break and that's not fine so make sure you have a nice smooth edges just just goodness so just like that make a little lip at the end that just allows it easy for you to pop the wax off like that and then make sure again nice and smooth right on the bottom that ensures that the whole ship is going to come up in one piece and not multiple pieces and then remove perfect let me do it one more time so you can see it again this time we're gonna do a cleanup strip so a cleanup strip going to be after you've done your initial strip and get the initial hair pulled off the second the cleanup Chapleau leftover hairs it didn't come out the first time this is for those guys you apply in the opposite direction so I will start up use a lot of pressure you're not gonna hurt your client don't worry about that they'll be fine it's use pressure and in this case I will be going down just like that perfect now one thing to keep in mind too if you make a strip and you're not happy with it maybe like this edge right here is a little too thin you can go back and add a little bit more wax that's totally fine it's better to add more wax to a strip and make sure it's going to stick together then don't do that and then the waxes can potentially kind of crack and break and that's just kind of suck so like I said it's like if I wanted to add more here no big deal totally fine I do it all the time don't worry about that now the last thing to keep in mind is how to remove it in the right way this is something I also see a lot of people doing wrong so they will okay so they will remove it in a perpendicular direction meaning out like this see how it's pulling my skin like that that hurts that's not comfortable don't do that instead you want to pull it like this where it's parallel to the strip I will allow it to very cleanly be pulled out of the root of the hair follicle and not snap so like I said don't pull it like this hold it like this up just like that okay so parallel not perpendicular and you'll be fine um any questions feel free to reach out to me I will also have a blog down in the lane I'm sorry a blog down in the description a link to a blog that way if you want to see more detailed information I've got that for you I have plenty of other videos and this you can do it you'll be fine any questions let me know this is Kristin HK whack Center I'll see you next time", "HpL9jfr4rcY": "hey welcome back to another episode of solidworks live design episode 19. uh today we are going to be going back and taking a look at a previous design in figuring out how to do packaging for it so i'm going to go ahead let's go ahead and take a look at the model we're going to be referencing if you've been following solidworks live design you know that andrew barnes back in episode 3 did an amazing surfacing episode where he modeled this wax iron this is for putting wax on the bottom of a snowboard so really cool products um and i was thinking what could we do for live design and every great product needs good packaging so i'm going to come back over here i was kind of like going through some packaging i had around my house so my latest mouse i bought so i'm a bit of a gamer i have this uh proteus spectrum logitech mouse and you pull it out it's just kind of a clam shell sorry this camera in this mode is really close so we basically got this blister pack and a piece of plastic that's gonna hold it right here this is simple this is you don't really get to touch or feel this until you take it out of the box uh another product i was looking at is this is a gaming uh uh speed pad i use i like that this one you can open it up in sorry about the lighting there i need better lighting in here you can open it up and you can see the product but this is sealed in the stores so like i really like how you can open this up but the issue with this one is is that uh um you can't open it in the store it's taped shut so i was like these are all right and then i kind of looked at some other ones i have an older set of beats headphones they this is kind of like a book how this one opens but then i remembered i had this mouse that i bought a while back and it had some really cool packaging in it uh one of the things i really liked i'm gonna switch my view over here so you can see what i'm referring to it was a logitech mouse uh it was a g700s so the mouse itself was kind of stored in this guy when you open the package up in the store you could flip it open and you could see the product inside of it and you could kind of get an idea of what this felt like and kind of what the contour of it looked like so i really liked this concept of packaging of presenting the product to the end the consumer while they were in the store so that's what i want to try to tackle today is something like this i don't own this mouse anymore so i can't uh i can't do that one um so this is what it looked like when you pulled it out so you had an internal structure piece and then you had a and then you had an external box that kind of went around it so today what i thought we would do let's see i got one more picture of it so this is what it looked like you had the box and then you had kind of this internal piece that held it all together inside so we're going to create something like this but we're going to do it for i need to hide this we're going to do it for andy's uh wax iron so and again welcome everybody in the chat we have lots of people from india pakistan italy uh great to have all of you here uh so yeah keep those questions coming in as we're going here so we're going to create that packaging for this product so this is going to be a little bit more of an advanced topic we're going to be doing some surfacing some mixed modeling where we're going to be modeling with solids and surfaces together as we go through here and then we're going to create some of this i'm going to refer to this as cardboard but i get it this isn't really cardboard it's like card stock it's like a thicker paper as we go through there uh keep in mind i'm not a packaging professional uh so i may make mistakes as i go through here so let's start with this the first thing we're going to do is we're going to work inside of an assembly so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to bring this component into an assembly and i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to do this the easiest way i know how i'm going to go up here to the top corner and i'm going to say make an assembly from this parter assembly and i'm going to pick one of my templates and then i'm just going to hit ok now when you insert this into the assembly one of the things that happens is that component gets fixed to the origin in its default orientation the problem is is i want to i like to design this box in the correct orientation so if i go to a front view this actually is what i would call a side view of the part so we're going to reorient this i'm going to un fix this component by right clicking and going to float so right away we're starting with some assembly stuff here and i'm going to rotate this part now if you remember from the image that i had up on here this thing kind of sits at a bit of an angle inside of this that's the wrong picture inside of this box this thing kind of sits at an angle and that's what i want i want when you open this box in the store to present the product to the user so i want to kind of ro get this into an orientation that looks like that so what i'm going to go ahead and do is i'm going to start by mating i want to fix this into location correctly so i'm going to mate this to its right plane here and then let's go over to our right view so right now this thing is kind of free to move around the next thing i want to do is i want to locate this somewhere in space so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take the origin of that component and the origin of this and of my assembly and i want to mate those together now what i'm going to do is i'm going to click the actual mate paperclip but paperclip button and you'll notice that if i've already got something defined if you've ever tried this mating an origin to an origin by default it'll try to align the axes of those two parts if you use it from the paperclip menu it won't do that so that'll save you kind of a step of having to come in here and uncheck that so now when i look at this this thing's just free to move so what i'm going to do is i'm going to kind of get it at an angle that i feel like i want to look at it in the box and then i'm going to take its top plane in the top plane here and we're going to just put an angle on here 24.6 let's make that 25 let's make it a real number so we have this part located in position um what i want to do now is we're going to start on the blister probably the hardest part of this design is going to be getting that plastic blister this piece right here so this piece of plastic granite it's going to look different it's going to have the shape and then it's going to just come out um so let's insert a new component so i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna insert a new part and you'll notice when you i do this it creates what's called the virtual part it actually didn't ask me to save this anywhere i love virtual parts for this reason when i'm concepting and just thinking of an idea virtual parts are great for quickly throwing a component into a design and if i don't like it i can delete it and there's no file on disk when i'm ready to save this file i can right click on it and save it to an external file if i want to but from a concepting standpoint i'm going to use i'm going to just use a virtual part and i'm going to rename it and we're going to call it the blister you could call this the clam shell though i'm not going to clamshell this design i am going to put it in a in a box when it's done with this i'm also going to float this component and i'm going to do some orientation now this may be a little advanced if you haven't run into this before but one of the things i always want to do when i'm mating my components into space is i want to think about their orientation and now i'm doing that with a component that has no geometry inside of it so hopefully this makes sense i'll revisit why i'm doing what i'm about to do when we get to probably a more visual actually you know what no yeah we'll we'll just make this this way right now i know that i want the top plane of that blister to be parallel with this component so i'm going to take the top plane from our blister and i'm going to expand the wax iron in its top plane and i'm going to make those coincident to one another i know that this component can move back and forth in space so i'm also going to make its right plane coincident with the right plane in our assembly and then i'm going to take our origins and just like i did before i'm going to mate those together like so to fully define it so you'll see why what i just did right there will kind of have a have a bigger impact when i do this first step so i've got these two components they're located let's get to actually designing the blister right inside of the assembly i'm going to choose to edit this component we're going to be doing a lot of in context modeling here now i know that that can be a scary concept for some people like creating relationships to other pieces of geometry but the reality is when i'm working with something like this this is really i have to create these in context relationships here so i want to basically copy all the surfaces of this part into this new blister component so i have my surfaces toolbar up here but i don't really like going up to the command manager so what i'm going to do really quickly is i'm going to take my shortcut bar or the s key and i'm going to right click and choose to customize it and what i'm going to do oops let's do that again right click customize i want to add my surfacing tools to this not one at a time one of the things a couple episodes ago i went through some customization options in the user interface i don't know if i covered this but we have what are called the fly out toolbars and i can grab my surfacing tools and we're going to be using some weldment tools a little bit later on so let's add those as well i'll resize these i actually don't want these on my assembly toolbar let's do this really quick i'm going to open this part up and we'll customize it here customize we'll do that same thing i just did i'm going to add my surfacing tools and my weldment tools to my part tool my part shortcut toolbar and let's go back here and edit that again so now though my all my weldment tools and my surfacing tools are available here notice it doesn't show any of the commands that are grayed out when i do that so what i want to do is i want to copy these surfaces now there are two ways to do this and i'm going to talk about the two ways in pros and cons of one if i just want to copy the surfaces we can use knit surface in knit most people think of it as a command that you can use to actually merge surfaces together but you can actually use knit in context you can see here that i've actually copied those surfaces over into that part but there's some challenges with this uh when we're dealing with a part like this one of the things we may want to do is we may want to offset that or change that value so i'm going to actually preference using offset surface here i am going to use an offset of zero and hold on i need to drink a minute and the reason i'm going to i'm going to leave this zero and we're going to talk about putting clearance around this product a little bit later in the design because i want to show some other really cool features other re the other reason for this is sorry my throat is very scratchy right now all of a sudden the other reason for this oh boy the other reason for this is uh i like to work with the native geometry as much as possible by offsetting it we're putting some of that offset in there this geometry was created inside of solidworks but it this could be imported geometry in which case um it can change and do things you might not know so we're gonna do an offset of zero and i'm basically going to copy all the surfaces i think i'm going to want the clamshell to touch and i say i think so i'm gonna i've i'm gonna go through this process and i'm gonna grab as much as i want we're going to deal with this grommet a little bit differently later on um so i'm going to exclude those for right now so i'm going to copy those surfaces in here and let's go take a look at what we have so i'm going to open this up first thing i want to look at is do i really need all of this right here i don't need this extra material so let's go ahead and let's start by trimming some of that away so there's all my surfacing tools remember how i added the fly-out toolbar right there i can go in here i'm going to grab the trim command and we're going to remove that extra material right there there's some geometry right here that i'm probably going to want to deal with later we'll look at that a little bit later how we may close that up so so the first thing i want to do is i i i know that this is probably going to be vacuum formed uh so i know i need to have some draft on this part and so that's why i didn't go under that handle i don't want this just to wrap around this part it has to be able to lay over top of it so you know the mouse the actual mouse i'm using here you can see it obviously needs to be able to pull out of this so in this case a wax iron so let's that's why i left this hole in the middle so let's start by trying to fill this in and i'm going to do this one of the easiest ways i know i'm going to try using the fill surface command right here i'm going to right click and i'm going to i want to select all these edges so i think andrew covered this in this section but there's a really useful command here called select open loop where it'll find all the open edges and select them all in a row when i was kind of walking through this i showed andrew a trick i'm going to share it here because he said it was super useful didn't i didn't realize you could do that sometimes you don't want to select everything maybe i want to just select this line this line this line see look at this this is why these selection tools are useful this one this one look at all these little segments right here there's a trick where you can select near the end point here and you can select near the end point here and right click and there's an option called select partial loop and notice what it'll do it didn't select all the open loops it selected from the end of that line from the end of this line over to this line so select partial loop is really useful when working with surfaces and you don't want to select all the open loop edges and you don't want to pick them individually this is a great way to go through and just grab a subset of edges i do want all the edges in this case so i'm going to right click and say select open loop fill surface and let's take a look at what we have well the zebra stripes look pretty good coming off of that part i know i have one weird twist right here so let's try let's make these all tangent to one another so i'm not as worried about the aesthetics yeah look at that kcb partial loop that's a game changer [Laughter] so when i know a solidworks employee goes wow i didn't know you could do that i figured that would be a useful one here so so i'm going to go ahead and add this and i'm going to choose to knit this geometry i'm going to merge this with the rest of the surfaces and press ok i have some concerns though that looks like it comes in quite a bit so what are we going to do we're going to go up to our evaluate tools and take a quick look at draft analysis and i'm going to select my top plane so now all of a sudden hopefully it's becoming obvious why it was important for me to orient this with the part uh at the assembly level i knew that my draft direction had to correlate to how these two components were going to pull apart that's why i wanted it no matter what orientation it was in i wanted that clam shell or that blister to always be aligned so we can see here with three degrees of draft which is about generous i think for a vacuum form right here this is going to be a problem we actually have a negative draft so we have to figure out how we're going to fix this i'm going to delete this surface fill so there's a couple reasons that's happening it's happening one because this surface down here is so extreme and it's pushing this face inward and then the top of the handle kind of wraps around a bit and it's pushing it down below the handle there so what we're going to do is we're going to trim some of this material away and we're going to take a look at a couple different ways to do this so i actually have a little bit of extra geometry here that i don't need i actually don't think i'm going to use these two faces here so i could go remove those from this surface offset but i'll take care of those a different way here in a minute let's start with this bottom how it's kind of curving in let's smooth this out a little bit i kind of want to look at this arc here going around this part so let's start a sketch on the top plane and what i'm going to go ahead and do here is i'm going to just draw some geometry to kind of trim this away so right there i'm going to because i'm more mechanically inclined i'm going to fully define this stuff just because i like to have dimensions on the screen a lot of this stuff is kind of visual and you may find yourselves uh not doing this and then i'm going to dimension to the outside of this arc i don't know if everybody knows this but if you hold the shift key while dimensioning to an arc instead of selecting the center point it will actually select the uh the tangency so see how i did that i held shift while i clicked that and now i can dimension to the outside of that arc right there and now i have a nice fully defined sketch the first thing that i look at when i do this is i go you know what i'm going to use the trim surface command with this sketch and i want to trim this and we get an error it says cannot partition surface the trim tool and target do not intersect what it's actually say telling me here is this curve does not fully intersect this model so i can't trim with it well all i'm trying to trim are these two faces well a trick we can use here is instead of trying to just trim right away we can come in here and we can use a split line and we can take a sketch and project it onto our surfaces here and right click and look at that well now that we've done that we've got a separate face we can go ahead and we can actually just right click and delete those faces and they're gone so so instead so sometimes if while you're working in surfaces the trim command doesn't work try splitting a face and then using delete delete face on that that's another way you can kind of get around that without having to create j without having to trim geometry you don't want to so this looks better let's take a look at what we have let's go to select open loop let's go to our surfaces command into a filled surface and that looks a little bit better right there let's try it with tangency i don't like the way it was coming out down there i think we're still gonna have an issue up here so when i come in here let's take a look let's go to evaluate let's go to draft analysis let's grab our top plane we still have an issue here with our draft okay so let's let's undo that let's look at how we can pull this surface back how can we bring a surface back to a specific amount of draft i'm going to take a look at that um split line command again and there is a really cool capability in here um eric welcome to the stream always great to have you here uh we're going to go into the split line command and instead of using projection we're going to use an option called silhouette silhouette split line is really useful when you have say a curved surface that crosses uh you want to capture where like that surface crosses a specific uh threshold or a plane or something like that so for example if i was looking straight down at the part and i wanted the zero degrees of draft well we can actually come in here and we can specify a pole direction and an amount of draft would we want to accommodate for and then what we do is we select the surfaces we want to cut with this so what this is going to do is it's going to say it's going to find the silhouette of these surfaces as a 10 degree draft we're cut on it so take a take a look at this this is extremely useful how this cut this surface it found a split here a split here a split it found all these but look at these ones these are the ones i'm most interested in right here these are where that curve are really coming across that threshold that's preventing us from getting that draft now i can tell you if i delete this face right here i'm going to have a problem with fill surface it's just not going to go very well so what i'm going to do is i'm going to edit that split line let's just split this here and now what i want to do is i want to create a blend from this line down to this line right here i actually wanted to go to where that surface used to be right there see that guy right there where that surf let's actually do this let's suppress this i'm going to roll this back just a little bit here i want a curve that kind of comes from here down to about here so what we're going to do is we're going to um we're going to create a sketch on our right plane and we're going to make a we're going to make a nice curve so that that blends in well with what we have left after that delete face so we're going to do this using uh splines now you could do this using a normal spline but everybody seems to be a big fan of the style spline they're really easy simple to use so i'm going to do this with a spot a style spline and basically i want to create a spline from here to here now i'm going to show you oops i hit escape before i should have let's go from here to here okay and what i'm going to do is i'm going to make this spline t i did a normal spline i am all over the place today let's go style spline here we go here to here and what i want is i want this line to come off of here tangent see we could use curvature continuity this is a clam shell i'm not as worried about the packaging and i'm going to show you a trick here one of the things i did with the style spot i only created one uh vertices with a style spline and this is going to create a challenge this line is tangent to this i actually can't make this line tangent to this while preserving this one so what happens is when i go and i grab this line in this spline and i try to make those tangent watch what happens to my style spline boom it actually added another point but unfortunately it didn't add the relationship so i'm going to do that again so kind of a tip there if you ever see something not acting the way you expect um take a look it may have been trying to do something for you there so now all i want to do is i kind of want to flesh this out make sure that that's going to look good and let's do one on the other side so now that i know style spline is going to require two points let's go ahead and just add those right away let's add our tangency um yeah let's add our tangency right here and let's add our tangency right here and that one looks pretty good i'm happy with how that one looks so i'm not dimensioning these ones i just want these to look right to kind of facilitate a blend here and we're going to use let's go into our surfacing tools we're going to use split line again and we're going to split these faces with that sketch okay i'm gonna move that up before this delete face and then now when we unsuppress this well i need to delete those faces let's just edit the one i did here let's also delete this face this face and this face boom okay so now let's see what we've got here same thing we did before right click you know what let's just edit this one right here we've got one in here let's right click uh select the open loop and so i don't like this right here see i don't want that coming straight up out of that surface so i'm thinking i like this here though let's just try doing tangency to the whole thing that looks pretty good and let's merge that with the rest of the solid so what are we going to do next we are going to check our draft analysis so pull direction is top plane look at that we because we pulled it back 10 degrees with that silhouette line looks like we've got plenty to work with right here looks like about the worst it gets down here six degrees four degrees 4.9 so we could pump bump this up looks like we have a spot here where it's just over three degrees so but three degrees is what we're looking for so looks pretty good there let's take a look at how this looks in the assembly well yeah let's go back to the assembly so looks like it's hugging the surface but we have a problem here so because i trimmed that surface back this part is kind of bulging out a little bit so i'm gonna go look at how we may fix that let's edit this feature so i'm worried that the tangency is causing this to wrap in too quickly right here so i'm gonna find that edge right there i want to change this one let's see what happens if we change this to contact kind of force that to come straight out of there a little bit more that looks a little bit better let's see how it looks on the model that looks pretty good right there looks like we may want to change this one over here to a contact as well so we'll do that really quick let's open this back up let's edit that surface and we want to just find there was looks like there was another edge right here we may want to switch to a contact as well so we'll call that good for right now all right next thing we want to do we want to basically mirror this over the other side so i wanted to talk about this cut out right here i'm getting to the point where i kind of want to seal this off there's really two ways you can handle this cutout and i want to show this command even though i'm not going to use it and i'm doing kind of a lot of things as i go through here i want to look at how do you deal with some of these cutouts that are part of a surface well the untrim command is a great tool to select a surface like this and what it'll do is it'll evaluate all the surfaces that are connected to that edge and it will try to just refill in what it thinks that surface should be so untrim is a really really good tool to use right here i'm going to show you another way we could get rid of this hole though i'm going to mirror this body so i know that the part is symmetric so i'm very confident we can take this mirror the body keep in mind there's a check box here when you're working with surfaces you want to knit these together so we have this hole in here and i could come in here and i could go a filled surface i could do a planar surface i could do an untrimmed surface or i could select the edge and just press my delete key and say delete the hole and it'll add a deleted hole here and you can actually see because i can create a sketch on that that's a perfectly planar surface that i could work with and create sketches on right there delete hole's really nice it doesn't leave any edges or anything like that on there as opposed to if i came in here with fill surface and i did a contact and i press okay well first of all we'd have to knit it together right merge the results that one gave me a nice flat surface too sometimes you'll find though like you get like a split line on there so delete holes easy press the delete key on a hole and it basically it's doing an untrim to all of that geometry right there all right so i like where we're at with this um let's add some color to this let's go into our plastic let's grab a clear plastic i'm gonna make it polycarbonate there we go kind of get it to look good i'm going to press save the next what's the next part of this oh boy we're at 130 already i need to uh capture this cord whip here so i've done all this with surfacing the cord whip i actually feel like i can get away with a little bit more i'm gonna just use some traditional solidworks features uh some solid i'm gonna do some solid modeling i'm going to grab the right plane from inside my part i always try to reference the part geometry as opposed to assembly geometry when i can i find that that gives me less opportunities for problems later like maybe i delete this blister from this assembly and then it can't find that reference anymore so it's one of the reasons i would do this what i want to do it but anyway what i want to do is i kind of want to create a some geometry that comes up around here it's going to wrap around and then we're just going to have it in the assembly comes straight down so here i am going to reference an assembly plane and this line i'm going to make those perpendicular to one another i want this to be parallel to this cylindrical feature so i want to find the center axis of this feature what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and go to my view tools and i'm going to turn on temporary axes and it will for any cylindrical feature it'll show those and i'm going to make these two parallel to one another and i'm going to go ahead and throw a dimension on here that looks way bigger than what i need it to be so i kind of want to capture this a little bit i definitely want to capture this so it looks like somewhere between 8 and 10 will work i'm gonna just make it 10 and then i want this arc to start where it would intersect the top of this grommet and now i just need to kind of find the size i want this to be let's go ahead and add a radius in here what's 25 look like that's a little tight let's make that 26. so we'll make that 26. that looks pretty good so what we're doing right now is we're trying to make everything fit tight around this geometry we're going to deal with the offsets of all that later so what i'm going to do i'm going to draw a line here i want the top plane in this to be collinear to one another and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to create a solid so i have a surface and now i'm going to go back to my traditional solidworks features and what i want to do is i want to encompass basically this geometry so let's go to a mid plane extrusion and let's just drag this out let's see something that looks pretty good 20 20 looks pretty good right there let's try 20. now 20 looks all right but we need to have draft on this so i'm going to go in here and i'm going to put some draft on this from the bottom face my direction of pull is going to be up so i'm going to click this arrow to flip that around and we need to draft this outside face in this outside face here i'm gonna do something to make this part a little bit easier to see let's go into here and let's turn off the transparency part of that material for a minute it's getting a little hard to see all right let's go back and edit this part again so once i add the draft you can see we're going to have an issue with that grommet so let's go ahead let's increase this let's i'm going to just do some instant 3d and kind of play around with a number that looks good now i like nice whole numbers so i'm going to just set that at 30. i think i can get away with a fillet around here to cover these up so i'm not going to get too worried about that i'm also going to turn those temporary axes on let's make this look nice let's throw a quick fill it on here we're going to go from we could go something like this that doesn't that looks okay let's try this let's do a full round fillet and go from this outside face to this face to this face so this is going to create i'm going to go back to my old days of using 2d cad a tangent tangent tangent arc if anybody remembers that so basically this is a fillet that'll stay tangent along this face this face and this face and because i have tangent propagation on it's going to honor that full radius all the way around so full round fill it's a great way to just create a nice smooth profile on there all right that's looking pretty good let's exit out of there let's go back into our part and we're going to need to join these together i am going to go back to there we go that looks a little better all right so what do we want to do we want to join this geometry together because i kind of want to put a fillet in there i don't want this white color i think i used let's do this why does it keep turning white i don't know usually it turns gray i don't know it's really white for some reason um i want to put a fillet in here but i have a surface and a solid so let's look at how we can join these together there's two ways i'm going to do this and the first way is the most obvious let's make the surface geometry a solid so how we gonna do this well the first thing we need to do is we need to put a surface on the bottom now i'm lucky i know that this geometry is planar if i select that open loop i can come up to my surfaces tools and i can create a planar surface using those edges i can then knit that surface to this surface and we can create a solid body out of that so now i instead of surface bodies i have two solids which i can then right mouse click on and i can do a boolean operation and combine those together so i was able to do that in three features pretty quickly i'm going to show you another way to do it in one feature now just because i can do it in one feature doesn't always mean it's the best way to do this there are pros and cons to every way you model something inside of solidworks that's a very stable method a tried and true way of doing things but i want to show you a really cool tool inside of solidworks it's called the intersect command and when i hover over what is it say it says intersects surfaces planes and solids to create volumes what the intersect command does is it allows me to select any of that type of geometry so for example i can select a solid body a surface body and because i modeled this with good design intent my top plane is right at the bottom a plane so i selected a solid a surface and a plane when then what i do is i tell solidworks to calculate can you what kind of what enclosed regions can you make from this geometry so intersect them all and you can see here it created a filled version of this using the top plane kind of as a uh as a bottom surface and what this tool allows you to do is you can remove sections out of there maybe i don't want that middle piece maybe i don't want that look at that it kind of did that boolean operation for me but in this case i actually wanted to just make all of that geometry right there so we could do it two ways there as you saw we could do it the kind of that traditional way and then we could do it with this new intersect feature here i really wanted to show intersect as i went through here uh we're going to take a look at it again with something else that we're going to do going to go ahead and we're going to throw a fillet on here let's uh pick something big enough to so we want to cover up this material we need to make sure that this will work eight seems to look pretty good i could probably go a little bigger let's go to a nine millimeter radius and let's press ok all right so right now we have a solid geometry oh by the way when i did the intersect command see how it left that surface body back there there is an option i always forget to click when i do intersect if i don't need those surfaces anymore i could say consume them now notice when i do this this surface body will go away so now i don't see it when i roll the part over all right so what do we have next we need to create the flange now i'm going to reference this again we're not going to come out and over remember the packaging we're going to kind of look at is going to be more like this guy right here so i need just a flat material that comes out of there so i'm trying to think what's going to be the best way to do this so eventually we need to look at the overall material for this as well so let's go ahead let's create that flange i'm going to go on my top plane i'm going to just simply create a rectangle right here and i'm going to create a center line down the middle and i want that center line to be coincident to my right plane or my origin doesn't matter and we're just going to give uh some space for this flange to come off from this part so 15 millimeters here i want it to be at least 50 on the side but here's the thing i don't know how wide this part is look at this i want this to be a real number and it looks like i got lucky i got 210 so i'm gonna go ahead and say leave that driven but i'm guessing if i actually look at this i'm going to make that a driving dimension so if you don't know you can throw reference dimensions on geometry and then you can right click and make it driving or driven when i look at that it's not really 210 millimeters it's 209 let's make it 210 so that when we make our square box the guy cutting out the cardboard doesn't ask why or the the the hardboard doesn't ask why we chose such a weird size on that now this piece is going to be at an angle so i'm not too concerned i want a dimension from here to this tangency but because this isn't a true circle i don't get that option to dimension to that arc so what we're going to do is we're going to put a point that intersects all this geometry right here and we're going to dimension to that so there's a little tip if you ever want a dimension to a point in space there's actually a way when you're dimensioning also to find the intersection so when you're in the dimension command if i go let's see here you can do find intersection of that line and another piece of geometry you could actually do it kind of on the fly right there all right so let's go ahead let's uh sorry i keep kind of peeking down at chat down there uh so one thing we haven't thought about is how thick is this plastic going to be i'm going to say that this is going to be about a half a mil like half a millimeter thick it's super thick super thin material so let's just call it a half a millimeter let's bring that up let's add some fillets so that merged with that geometry we're going to talk about this in just a minute and we're going to go ahead and we're going to add a fillet i want to add a big fillet and i'm zooming way in because i have to grab this little tiny edge right here and now i got to do that for four other edges but there's this thing called the selection manager selection helper that pops up and notice when i do this this first option i just know from using it it's going to go find every edge that's the same length in the same orientation on that plane so when i picked this and i zoom out i was really confident that it was going to find i knew there were only four edges on there keep in mind if you had any cutouts it would have grabbed those external sharp edges as well so very useful tool once you learn kind of how those selections work great for finding that stuff so all right here we go let's turn our transparency back on i'm trying to speed up here a little bit we need to shell this thing right so now we have this clam shell my first reaction is let's do a half a millimeter material let's shell the material out and the world should be good right we went the wrong way with a shell right so you guys see what happened there we shelled inward we actually need to shell outward on this so let's go ahead that's an option and shell you can shell outward but this is going to create a problem with this flange we made right here if we zoom in you can see that it actually took that flange and it offset that a half a millimeter outward as well so how are we going to handle this all right so what we're going to do is we're going to get rid of this shell and we got to do this as two separate options so i'm going to edit this uh flange i made here and i'm going to uncheck merge results let's not merge let's treat these as two separate solid bodies right now so what i can do is i can do this kind of one of two ways here so i'm going to tab to hide that solid body if you didn't know that you can tab to hide bodies and shift tab to bring them back if you know where they are or you can show hide them from over here we're going to shell just this piece of this outward let's grab the bottom and that'll give us our offset there and shift tab to bring that back well guess what we're going to do we're going to use that same intersect tool on these two pieces of geometry now check this out what it's going to do here it found that there were five regions what the way i actually like to use this tool is this selection says what do you want to exclude i'm going to actually click what i want to keep i want to keep that and that and i want to keep this little region where they intersect with one another oh intersect ah now it makes sense here's the problem if i press ok right now it's going to keep the inside of that material and that's actually not what i wanted it to do so we're going to go back edit that and there's a really cool option here because that to me is the easy way to do that there's an option down here to invert the selection so now i'm going to get rid of the internals and i'm going to remember this option to consume those surfaces give that a minute to think and that looks pretty good it's looking really good here's the challenge though this surface if i look right down right at the side of it and i cut a section in here it is touching that part all the way around now you can account for this a couple different ways what i want to look at is a really cool feature we don't get to see very much i'm going to delete this intersect so we could go back and we could change this offset and we could put say a half a millimeter or 0.1 millimeter whatever we wanted for an offset in there we could do that i'm going to show you kind of an all-in-one tool so we still have our solid body down here and our solid body up here i'm actually going to get rid of this shell and what i'm going to do is i'm going to take this perfectly surfaced match to our wax iron i'm going to push it up through this surface with a really cool tool called indent now you'll notice i don't have it on my toolbar one of the really neat things about this shortcut menu is every time you press it it activates command search up here and i'm going to search for a tool called indent so here's how indent works this is a really cool tool i'm going to say what is the target body what do i want to do the indent on and then what is going to be my tool body now this is the tricky part of the indent tool depending on where you pick so say the surface say this surface was in the middle we would have to tell it which way we're going to push through so we're going to pick the material on the top side that tells it the top side of that geometry is what we're going to indent with and this is literally going to push our part it's going to indent our material from the bottom now here's what's cool i'm going to set my material thickness at half a millimeter and i must be i had this saved from before you're already going to see so right now it's gonna just it's gonna be just like what we did before where it touches that surface but there's a really cool option here the ability to create clearance i want i'm gonna make it very large i'm gonna put a hole i'm going to put a half a millimeter of clearance in there so we have a half a millimeter thick material with a half a millimeter of clearance let's press ok and then uh i'm just sorry i'm looking at chat there the one thing that's hard to see is it this will leave the tool body behind right here so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna get rid of that body we don't need it anymore the last thing we want to do is add a couple fillets here because you know we got to fill it this to make this manufacturable i'm going to use a nice small fillet here of one millimeter and i could create a second one and offset that fill it right there i'm gonna just select this and kind of cheat and do a multi-radius fill it so i don't have to create two so i can create two phillips with a different radius there with multi-radius and voila there we go there is our blister and i am woefully behind on time we're going to be covering the cardboard next there we go though so let's take a look at this from the right hand side let's cut a section through this and see what this looks like look at this we have a nice half a millimeter offset all the way through there you know what we should probably look at our draft as we go in here right so we wanted to do a draft analysis on this everything looks good it looks like i have one small spot there it's 2.7 degrees i'm not gonna get nitpicky or i don't know why that didn't show up before it might have been because of how it offset out there i could go in and i could change that uh that split line we did but i want to cover some other stuff that i really want to get into here with the 10 minutes we have left i may go over a hair so the next thing we need to create is i'm going to do a box i made i may not get to this box this piece but i definitely want to get to the piece on the inside if we look back at this picture i definitely want to look at this blue cardboard piece that holds this blister in because this is uh kind of an important piece we're going to do this really easy i'm going to insert a new component and i'm going to drop it right on the origin so this part is located where i want it we're going to call this inner packaging we are done surfacing we are now going to look at sheet metal tools to make card stock or hard paper cardboard whatever you want to call this right here so next step we're going to create something called inner packaging and i'm going to just start editing this again look at this these are virtual components so this is really flexible giving me the ability to just kind of model on the fly i'm going to go ahead and what i want to do is i want to capture a couple key pieces of information oops let's start a let's start a sketch i want to basically i want this cardboard piece i'm going to use the word cardboard instead of hardboard or whatever it's called right there thanks eric um so we're going to make that what i want to do is i want to capture i can go into extra time absolutely i'm willing to do that for those who want to stay i'd like to see this finish so uh we want to capture this top surface and i'm also really interested in so the clam shell is going to keep this thing from moving uh let's see this side to side and up and down but while it's sitting in the package i need this to hold it up that makes sense right there so what i want is i want these two to be co-linear as well so these are my two most important things i'm looking at the rest of this is all support structure so what i'm going to do is i'm going to come over here i'm going to come over here let's add a couple more lines here and here and basically i want that cardboard i just want it to be nice and tight to this guy again using the word cardboard and that is probably the wrong industry term but that's okay why am i having such a hard time picking this let's just drag and drop that onto there let's give this some height off of the bottom of the box we'll say 15 millimeters uh this one uh i'm gonna grab this vertex in this edge so i'm just gonna be holding this tight reality is you probably wanna put a little bit of clearance in there and then i'm gonna drag this back and this here so what i want is i'm going to fold this i wish i had this mouse still so i could show this i'm going to be folding some cardboard over on itself so i want to create some support here kind of see what looks good so i want to make sure i don't get into having to put a hole in this thing for that cord so i want to be let's call it 65 i don't know if you've ever used this but this is a really useful tool when you're concepting stuff out this little scroll wheel on the bottom here you can use this to kind of like well what's this number look like another way you can do this is if you have instant 2d enabled you can select a sketch and just like instant 3d you can kind of drag this around and i like to use this ruler here so i'm going to drag this 30 degrees or 30 millimeters looks pretty good i told you i was gonna use sheet metal but i'm gonna create a normal extrusion here we're going to uh andrew gross likes intersect plus indent nice uh we're going to select this profile here because we have multiple closed contours we're going to use selected contours if you go back and watch mark schneider show how to do model mania you love selected contours so go back and watch some of the previous episodes on that i want to extrude this up to vertex i'm going to try to right click on screen here and we are going to go up to right up to the edge there we're going to do the same thing in direction two we're going to go up to here and we're going to create a solid body you guys thought you were going to see sheet metal didn't you i want to show you everyone a really easy way to make sheet metal components i needed a shape i didn't know what this was going to look like with a sheet metal component so what i want to do now is i now want to make a sheet metal a sheet metal shape that conforms to this and there is a very cool tool within sheet metal called convert to sheet metal where basically i can take a solid shape and i can specify some parameters here so what am i going to use for thickness this is probably a half a millimeter thick but i want to work with numbers you can see so i'm going to make it one it should probably be thinner than that i don't know what the parameters for this are in terms of bend radius i'm not going to take a micrometer to this but i'm going to say half a millimeter sounds good these are numbers you can always tweak later on the one thing i want to do and i always forget to do this is set my auto relief this will define every relief you do on this sheet metal component i want to set this to be a tear and we'll just leave that half of the material thickness so what how does convert to sheet metal work well we say what is going to be our fixed face i'm going to choose this space right here and then all i'm going to go ahead and do is i want to say i want to bend it here i want to look at look at what it's doing let me zoom in so you can see the preview it's going to put a bend right there i want to put another bend right here i want to put another bend on that back surface and another one here and another one here and another one here look at this this is way easier than creating edge flanges and drawing that shape out and then i want lastly one here and notice what it does it creates a gap well i want to control that gap a little bit better so let's go to a right view and zoom in on it so what i'm going to do is i'm going to change the overlap here so i want this to overlap this way and it's going to say do you want it to oh how far from the inside do you want it to overlap well i want it to overlap the whole material thickness so i'm going to say one so that'll go one and then this gap right here you'll notice solidworks doesn't ever let you put zero in here it doesn't want you to merge this geometry together right if everybody's heard of the term zero thickness geometry i'm going to let you in on a little secret you can get away with it with sheet metal parts you're going to see that in just a minute but let's go ahead and create this now that internal material i want it to be a nice glossy black i'm going to go ahead and add some appearance let's just throw this on here um i want to finish forming this cardboard up right here so what we're going to do is we're going to create an edge flange comes off from here and i want to go we'll just say up to that vertex now i want this material i just need to go to the right plane i actually want it to touch so what i'm going to do down here is i'm going to actually choose to do an offset i'm going to enable offset and i'm going to say i want to go up to a surface and i'm going to choose that surface right there and this sheet metal is going to touch the surface now everybody who tries this watching the recording later on is going to go why do i have warning signs in my tree because i have material right now that is there is zero thickness geometry right there i don't remember what version of solidworks they introduced this but edge flange base flange and some of the other flanged miter flange works hem works some of them allow you to get away with zero thickness geometry and normally you would get errors in your tree saying that they're a self-intersecting geometry but there is an option inside of your options i have to remember where this was i turned this off so long ago under sheet metal maybe nope it is under i just found this the other day system options drawing system options colors performance right there ignore self intersection check for some sheet metal features some not all so this does not work for all sheet metal features but notice this geometry touches solidworks will actually still let me unfold that though it does not actually care that it's touching that used to be an issue back in the day when modeling with sheet metal let's add some side supports right here i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to do an edge flange down off from here oh that doesn't look like what i want how are we going to fix that when we create edge flange you actually have this option over here where you can edit a flange profile now this isn't the full sketcher inside of solidworks so i can't like come in here and turn on my sketch relation so i'm actually going to go through here and i'm going to say i don't want this line to be horizontal or vertical need this one or this one and you're probably going well they're not horizontal or vertical but they are to that edge what i want is this line to be coincident with the bottom of this part or collinear sorry wrong word and then basically i want these to be vertical to that line so if you select a vertex between two points there's actually between two entities you can actually create some relations right here one of these is perpendicular so let's make these perpendicular sorry if that just went off screen i clicked that and then chose perpendicular let's go back to the property manager and let's just look at what we're going to do here i'm going to let this one come out from the bend i have my custom relief type it is a tear but i actually want this option right here i don't want it to tear like that i want it to kind of rip a little bit let's take a look at what that looks like that looks pretty good we need that same flange over on the other side so we're going to mirror that feature let's take a look make sure it unflattens all right next thing we need to do we need to create some clearance for that clam shell so if we go back at our picture we need to have a hole for that to pop through right and the cord underneath this is probably what i'm going to be covering today i'll walk through the outer box and we'll cover that in some detail as well all right so we need to create that work uh that we're gonna edit this part right here and i'm gonna just simply start a sketch on this face i know that it's normal to or i'm sorry parallel with that face that's under it because i used good design intent in the very beginning where i was trying to explain it somebody said i should have had origins visible and that would have been a brilliant idea sorry i didn't do that um but we want to copy we basically want to capture where those tangent edges were well the part i'm editing is literally in my way right now well you can actually we did this with bodies we clicked tab to hide them and shift tab to show them you can actually do this on a part on in assemblies as well and it can even be the part you're editing right now so i just press tab over that and basically now i'm going to select the tangency so similar to select open loop i showed before we're going to select all those lines and we're going to convert those entities and now i'm going to bring my part back over here by just holding shift and tab and hovering over it and let's go ahead and let's just create it a standard cut now when you work with sheet metal parts it captures this magical value called thickness and i know we've one of the live designs they actually talked about how you can exploit this linked value inside of solidworks its real use is right here i could do a through all or an up to next or i could just do a blind and have the thickness always linked to whatever my material thickness is going to be so that if it ever changes to two millimeters thick or five it'll always cut through so now that cuts through there we have this cord i want to deal with so let's go ahead let's do some normal sketching here i'm going to use a slot for this i like the slot command it works pretty good something like this so this cord is going to come through kind of down around here let's go ahead let's add a dimension to i'm going to dimension to our origin i know roughly where i want that to be something like that that looks pretty good let's say 75 let's give this a width that's really wide let's go 15. let's go 20. and then right here we only need that to be so long we're going to go ahead let's add some dimensions in here let's call that 40. and i have the plug-in that's got to come through here yet so this plugs into a wall you know depending on what region you're in this plug could be bigger or smaller i don't want this to be very visible underneath the part so i'm going to put the hole for the plug to pass through kind of over here and let's just we'll just pretend this is we can make this as large or small as we want i'm going to make this say 40. and then what we're going to do is we're going to use that sketch and again we're going to go ahead and do a cut and remember we just did this we used selected contours a moment ago where selected contours i could click each one of these regions one at a time and there's three you can also select full shape so i can select the slot and the circle and i can choose to cut with both of those pieces of geometry selected contours are really great way to work you'll notice i didn't trim any of that geometry up i captured the intent that this was a slot this was a circle and that looks pretty good may want to put some fillets on the inside i would i'm probably going to get asked the question why not use break corners here well brake corners don't work on non-sheet metal features very well so i'm just gonna come in here and i'll show break corners in a minute so what i'm referring to is is this flange here maybe i'm really worried about this sharp paper giving me death by a thousand paper cuts and i don't wanna cut my hand i can come in here and we can do this uh it's called a break corner and i can do chamfers or fill it this is really important with sheet metal with sharp edges people banging their heads or catching their hands on it if i select this face let's make that bigger notice it just finds all those corners it eliminates that need for me to go in there and pick those little tiny slivers of geometry on sheet metal parts so there we go let's take a look at what it looks like flattened there is our box ready to have a die cut out of it or not our box our internal box sorry let's get out of edit part mode we can see that we have our iron so we basically for the wax iron have accomplished this part now there is a box that goes on the outside and i'm already six minutes over so what i'm going to do is i'm going to walk through the creation of that box i'm not going to do go click by click i better save this huh i will make this file of these files available as well after this video to upload uh let's call this wax i so you can go through it mmm i've actually never had that option right there pop up for me let's do wax let's save that on my desktop wax iron packaging save within context references save all i've actually never seen that option pop up when i done that anyway um so there's that let's give it a nice perspective view looks pretty good so we're gonna open up an existing version of this model to take a look at how we did this box right here because i do some wizardry here so i basted this box off from this gaming box i'm going to take this gaming gamepad out of here i want to explain how it works so you can kind of see what we're doing sorry i can switch to this better view here so this is the box i kind of wanted to i based that off from right there so what's really cool is this box comes comes down around and up and then then the sides come back through here wrap around the inside that's really bad lighting and then these sides wrap around it so it's really crazy like how they got durability out of this um so i want to quickly walk through this and some of the things i did to make this happen i cheated on a couple things here for the image so let me quickly put these back to where they need to be 90 degrees so basically this is how i faked opening a box i changed the bend angle on these from 90 to 30 so i'm going to quickly put the box back so that it's closed and we're going to walk through how i did this oops and i have one more here because one of the things you're going to notice is all this material touches right here this oh i am not showing my screen so anyway we're going to open the closed box i'm going to show you how to make this and one of the things you're going to notice is this material is all stacked up on one another right here and how do we make this happen still be able to create this flat pattern without merging that geometry right there so we're going to do this by grabbing the roll back bar and kind of coming through here so uh yep i'm there's a little bit of a lag showing the screen now um so right here what i did is i started by creating this uh this u shape right here and one of the things i did when i created that is i made it you know what we should uh like edit this um let's do this unlock and then let's do edit in context here let's just do this open desktop let's go into here version one i should be showing my screen now i'm still see i'm hoping it's a delay i should be broadcasting my screen okay so what i did is i created let's get out of this perspective view i made this coincident up front and then what i did is i created an offset over here because i knew that those flanges were going to come back and wrap around this guy so they come back you can it's a black box not not very good visual but i needed enough material thickness for this cardboard so how i did this was with a dimension of one and it's i wanted to show what i was going to do this is there's this ability to link values so when i double click on this it's linked to the value of thickness so there it that sheet metal thickness that we can use that and link to that in an equation so when i did this i basically went equals global variable length to thickness and that will always be the same thickness as my sheet metal material so i did this with a normal sheet metal base flange this is not using the surface to solid then we created an edge flange that wrapped around the front i left the material thickness in here because i knew that this another flange was going to have to wrap up and come around the surface so i made this flange go all the way up to the material thickness then we came over again notice it's touching now if i turned this performance option off under performance i would be getting errors warnings in my part when i rebuild it and i'm not getting them right now i'd have to control q maybe see it does not like that that material is touching but for some sheet metal parts it understands that it's still an unfoldable part so again if you want to do material on material sheet metal keep in mind this only works for some sheet metal features edge flange um base flange hems there's a handful of features it works for so i folded the material in on itself i then broke the corners we saw that option before then i came down here and i brought our flange out leaving enough material thickness for let's go up here for these ears right so i had to create enough material thickness for these ears to fold inside of here so that it can seal up so that's that thickness so then we're gonna wrap around the top and how did i do that i did that with a hem so i wanted to do this with a swept flange but swept flange doesn't like that material on material thickness i would have had to have put a gap in there and i didn't want to do this so i used the hem and i just made a really long hem that went all the way down to the bottom of the part i then decided at this point to mirror this this wasn't a time i had to mirror this um i'll explain one of the challenges of mirroring with material on material actually so the next thing i did is i created the lid so the lid comes over again material on this one has a slight gap i don't know why i put a gap in there it should have it could have been on in fact i have another version where it's not then i came down or no i have these guys and for some reason i edited this these are those inside tabs i want that to be coincident there let's fix that so let's cut a section view of the front of this so you can kind of see what's going on here not a graphic section view either whatever um so then yeah i created that flange on the inside then i rolled down the front so we created a flange down the front then i created a flat that flange that comes into here i used that technique where i edited the sketch to create the ears and then finally i mirrored those features over now i wanted to talk about what you can and can and then last thing i did as i broke the corners on the inside and that is a flattenable box that we can make where we have material touching one another so people who used sheet metal probably have struggled with that i i mean the reality is there's a part like this there's actually significant gaps in here you know i could have put those gaps in there um i'm to look at another version of this where i mirrored it at a different point in time let's go ahead and close all this save all this i'm going to go ahead i think it was this guy right here i was playing around with nope this is not the one i want to open yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't need that obviously i i played around with different ways of doing this ahead of time this one this box is a little bit better in how i did it so you notice the mirror happens way further down the only time you can't mirror is when on the mirror so when you mirror sheet metal so you know how to mirror sheet metal i should probably cover that when you want to mirror a sheet metal body the way to do it is don't just pick a plane out here actually pick one of the edges of the sheet metal geometry and then choose the sheet metal body to mirror that way it knows that it's mirroring sheet metal and it honors all the bends and everything you do on the other side now i want to talk about why i mirrored here instead of after this front flange came down let's actually suppress this so notice when i and this is i just want to warn you about a i gotcha so now when i try to mirror and i mirror that body it's not going to work it's going to say you can't do that with this work piece and the reason is is because i have material touching material right here on the mirror plane it doesn't know how to handle that right there today it doesn't know how to handle that so that's why i had to do that mirror because right on the plane i was mirroring about there was that um there was this material touching the material right here so i just want to like let you know why i did the mirror when i did and then i created the wings that go out there and then i had to mirror that over the other side this is a feature mirror not a body mirror i like the emoji over there the packaging emoji and it works the same way so this one i did a little bit tighter i wrapped now that when i didn't do as good so i was kind of playing around with how to do these so play around with sheet metal parts i hopefully i was able to convey the bulk of this presentation um in doing the blister pack and this internal cardboard piece right there wish i had a little bit more time to go in more detail into that box but uh at the end of the day it would have been me creating a lot of edge flanges reinforcing the fact that there is a way for the material to touch uh but be careful with it because it only works with some sheet metal features so all right i am 18 after the hour i went a little bit long hopefully this was enjoyable for everybody i will make these models available uh uh to access or to download i will uh provide i'll just you know what i'm gonna just make this virtual in here and then i can save it that way so this will be really nice this is a great way to share assemblies as well by the way virtual components you can actually um i can just send an assembly and i don't have to send you any of the components that go with it so virtual components are great for that you'll be able to open this up with all the parts and then you can right click and say save the parts externally so hopefully this was useful yeah great i love the feedback thank you i i hope the combination of surfacing and solids and sheet metal uh was helpful for people uh so with that i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna stop the stream uh come back to this video at a later time and they'll put a link in the bottom uh with access to the files themselves until next time we'll see you later i think we have um we have a couple more of these sessions planned coming up i think next week we have uh j sean jackson who uh is going to be modeling like a plastic part and talking about some of the challenges of that and i know we have omar zoni on the schedule he's going to be doing some cool stuff with simulation coming up i think in two weeks so stay tuned and uh keep tuning in", "aUx_u0z3FwA": "welcome to wonder slate subscribe to our telegram channel given in the description to updates and study materials topic for today's quizzes

goddess of fortune,\nbe careful, because here are 10 Greek gods you\u2019ve never heard of, but might just explain\neverything! 10. Hephaestus Hephaestus, the son of Zeus and Hera, was\nthe god of fire, metalworking, stone masonry, forges, and the art of sculpture. He was responsible for making all of the weapons\nfor the gods of Olympus and had his own palace on the mountain where he forged all of his\ncreations. Also known as the god of fire, Hephaestus\nwas the only ugly god among the otherwise perfectly beautiful immortals. Initially, having been born with deformities,\nhe was cast out of heaven for his imperfections\u2026 only later being readmitted to work for the\nothers (Probably because he was so talented). He was mainly worshipped by the people of\nAthens, and is often depicted bending over an anvil, or walking with a cane. It was he that made Athena's shield, Eros'\narrows, and even the armor worn by Achilles during the Trojan war. Despite his treatment by the other gods, things\nworked out well for Hephaestus in the end. In order to prevent a war breaking out between\nthe gods, Zeus married him to Aphrodite so the others would stop arguing over her! 9. At\u00eb At\u00eb was, according to differing accounts,\neither the daughter of Eris or, perhaps, one of the daughters of Zeus himself. She was known as the goddess of mischief and\nruin in Greek mythology and was closely linked with the other gods and goddesses of negative\nsituations. Legend says that she was asked by Hera to\nhelp trick Zeus. She got him to swear an oath that the mortal\nthat was born on that day, whose father was Zeus, would go on to become a great leader. Hera ensured that Heracles was the one born,\ninstead of Eurystheus, which infuriated the king of the gods. This sort of Godly prank backfired. As punishment for her treachery, At\u00eb was\nbanished from Mount Olympus, never able to return. She spent the rest of her time walking the\nearth amongst the mortals, causing mischief and ruin wherever she went. Her name became used to describe the action\nperformed by a hero in Greek legend, often as a demonstration of hubris, which would\nlead to their death or shame. 8. Aristaeus Aristaeus was seen as a minor god in Greek\nmythology and was the protector and creator of a number of arts such as beekeeping and\ncheesemaking. Nice and peaceful, right? His parents were Apollo and nymph Cyrene,\nand he was born in Libya; later traveling and living in Thebes, and is said to have\nmarried the city\u2019s founder. Aristaeus is often depicted as a young shepherd,\nsometimes holding a sheep. He was a revered god in past times, but he\ndoesn\u2019t feature very much in mythology. His name is derived from the Greek word, aristos,\nwhich means \u2018best\u2019, and he was known for passing on the knowledge he had learned from\nthe nymphs to humanity. One story that does mention Aristaeus comes\nfrom one of Virgil\u2019s books. The problem with Aristaeus is that he always\ngot what he wanted, and he became infatuated with the wife of Orpheus, Eurydice. As he lustfully chased after her, she ran\nfrom him and accidentally stepped on a venomous snake that bit her and she died. Orpheus was so sad that he journeyed to the\nunderworld to bring back his wife from the dead. As a punishment for his involvement in this,\nall of his bees died, and he was only able to practice apiculture after he had made a\nworthy sacrifice in her honor. 7. Antheia Antheia, often linked with Aphrodite, was\none of the Graces of Greek mythology, and was the goddess of flowers and flowery wreaths,\nas well as vegetation, blossoms, gardens, and individual love. Symbols related to her are usually gold in\ncolor, and the center of worship for her was on the island of Crete. In early Greece, Antheia was an essential\npart of a yearly ritual. At some point between June and July, two chosen\nmaidens were put on a diet of only honey, clothed in golden robes, and entrusted with\nthe responsibility of delivering an untouched bundle into a secret place in the local temple. They would remain there, in public service,\nfor a year- never able to look at the bundle\u2019s contents, and during this time Antheia was\nsaid to energize the contents and bless those who visited the temple. 6. Pheme If any of the Greek gods or goddesses were\naround today, then Pheme would undoubtedly have been the busiest and most revered- because\nshe was the personification of fame and renown. Those who she favored rose to prominence in\nsociety, while those who angered her would be scorned and plagued by rumors wherever\nthey went. Seems very applicable today, right?? Pheme, who was also known as \u2018Ossa\u2019 was\nusually depicted with wings, and holding a trumpet through which she spoke. It was said that she would make it her business\nto learn about the affairs of both mortals and immortals, and then whisper these secrets\nto people. Like a gossip magazine!! As she told more and more, her voice would\ngradually become louder until everyone had heard what she was saying. She was the daughter of either Gaia or Elpis,\ndepending on which source text you listen to, and she had a glorious altar in the heart\nof Athens. In the city that was such a place of power\nin Greek civilization, it's perhaps no surprise she was so important there- being worshipped\nby those who rose to positions of importance and blamed by those who were caught out for\ntheir secrets. 5. Hypnos Hypnos was one of the primordial gods of Greek\nmythology and was known as the personification of sleep. He lived in a cave in the underworld with\nhis brother, Thanatos, where there was no light being cast by the sun or the moon. In front of their cave were a number of sleep-inducing\nplants, such as poppies, and the river of forgetfulness flowed through. Hypnos\u2019 parents were Nyx and Erebus, and\nhe married one of the graces, called Pasithea. According to legend, Hypnos was able to put\nthe mighty Zeus to sleep two times. The first was as a part of a plan by Hera,\nwho wanted revenge for the ransacking of Troy by Heracles. Hypnos put Zeus to sleep, and this gave Hera\nthe chance to unleash angry winds on Heracles\u2019 ship as he returned from Troy. When he awoke, Zeus was angry, but Hypnos\nsought refuge and was able to hide with his mother. The second time was also at the behest of\nHera, despite Hypnos\u2019 reluctance. She offered Pasithea to him as a wife if he\nhelped her, though, so he agreed. Hera pretended to ask Zeus for permission\nto prevent her parents from quarreling and, in that moment of vulnerability, Hypnos put\nhim to sleep. This allowed a message to be sent to Poseidon\nthat he could help the Greeks with the Trojan war and is, according to legend, how they\nwere able to win- with Zeus never finding out that he had been tricked once more. 4. Tyche Tyche was, unlike many other goddesses, one\nthat represented both the good and bad aspects of her important characteristics- those of\nchance, fate, and fortune. Those who lived in ancient Greece believed\nher to be the reason behind all unexpected events in their lives. If, for example, someone did very well, despite\nhaving put in no effort, then they were said to be blessed by Tyche at birth\u2026 while someone\nwho had bad luck throughout their life, despite working incredibly hard, was said to have\nbeen cursed by her. Tyche was particularly popular in Athens and\nwas believed to be the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys. She was often depicted with wings, a staff,\nand a crown, but would also be seen with other objects relating to various traits. When holding rudders or a wheel, for example,\nit was a reference to her directing world events, while occasionally she was shown balancing\non a ball, which symbolized the way that fortune can come and go in any direction. Later depictions of Tyche showed her wearing\na blindfold, which showed her taking on unknown risks and uncertainty. 3. Ploutus Ploutus was a god that every ancient Greek\nwanted on their side- because he was the god of wealth. He was said to have been born on the island\nof Crete to a local hero called Iasion, and Demeter, the goddess of the harvest and fertility. He was usually depicted as a young boy carrying\na horn-shaped container of wheat, which was known as a cornucopia. At first, and the reason why he was shown\ncarrying wheat, Ploutus was the god of agricultural wealth. As time went by, though, and as agriculture\nbecame so integral to the Greek economy, his role expanded to all wealth. In an effort to prevent Ploutus from only\nblessing deserving people with wealth, Zeus blinded him when he was very young, which\nwas the explanation why seemingly undesirable people are able to become rich while others\nremain poor. He wasn\u2019t just blind, either. He had other disabilities which explained\nwhy wealth can, so often, take a long time to arrive\u2026 and he had wings to depict how\nwealth can leave a lot faster than it appeared. You have been warned!!! Often, images and sculptures showed a young\nPloutus in the arms of Tyche, the goddess of fortune, or Eirene, the goddess of peace\u2026\nin order to show that wealth rarely comes on its own, and requires an element of good\nluck. Not to be confused with Pluto, the god of\nthe underworld, Ploutus\u2019 name has become a part of words that we use today- such as\nplutocracy, which is a system of government run by the wealthiest in society, and plutolatry,\nwhich is the act of idolizing wealth. 2. Zelus One of the minor gods from Greek mythology,\nZelus was, as his name might suggest, the god of dedication, envy, rivalry, jealousy,\nand zeal. His parents were Pallas and Styx, and he had\nthree siblings- Nike, Kratos, and Bia. He, along with his brothers, was a winged\nenforcer who stood by Zeus\u2019 throne and was one of his loyal followers. It\u2019s possible that Zelus was either the\nsame as Agon or at least very associated with the god of contests\u2026 and had an altar at\nthe site of the original Olympic games. He was also strongly linked with Pnthonos,\nthe spirit of romantic jealousy, and Eris, the goddess of discord and strife. 1. Dionysus Dionysus was, arguably, the most important\nGreek god that not many people have heard of, but m you should know, -because he was\nthe god of wine, winemaking, fertility, madness, and theatre. It\u2019s believed that he was worshipped by\nthe Mycenaean Greeks as early as 1500 BC and, as a result of wine being such an important\npart of culture at the time, Dionysus was highly revered. He was the son of Zeus and a mortal called\nSemele, which technically made him a hero and not a full-fledged god. Older images and depictions of him show an\nold, bearded man, wearing robes and holding a fennel staff with a pine cone, while more\nrecent images showed him as a beardless, sensuous, semi-naked androgynous figure. He's often described in literature as womanly\nin appearance and was an outsider on Mount Olympus. This was mainly because he was the only one\nwith a mortal mother, but also because he had been raised elsewhere, and spent a lot\nof time in Asia. This exclusion was a major part of his story,\nthough, and he was referred to as \u2018Eleutherios', which means \u2018 the liberator' because his\nwine and music helped his followers to free themselves from self-consciousness and societal\nconstraints.

star pill if you'll aren't familiar with my channel then I used to use Baron I love them and then I actually found a star pill and I love done even more so I've been using the blue film hard wax but they have a couple other ones they have the pink film as well and they also have a clear hard wax which is they call it star soft so I've been telling you guys I would do a review on the pink I just haven't gotten around to it especially on any kind of holiday this week is Valentine's the life of a waxer it gets a little nuts so I finally have a chance now with bearden for them they just have the one wax so I was always used to the one well depending like they did have a second one called Jet Set which I guess but that one it sets even faster than the regular wax which I never tried it because honestly the other one the regular blue set quickly to begin with and I always apply multiple strips anyway at least two sometimes three or four just depending on the service before I remove them so I just never really saw a need through that one so I was always used to just the one wax from them now like I said star pill has three different kinds so the blue I've loved I've been obsessed with it the pink which is what this video is for that one it's supposed to be really good at a for smaller areas and fine here as well like facial waxing and then underarms and brazilian too so I've been playing with it some more and I started using it and I loved it so I'm going to show you the wax first and then I'll do a little demo so you can see how its applied so I'm gonna grab the camera okay so this is the pink film hard wax and as you can see yeah like I said has a really creamy texture it is a little thicker you see it right there and this one's opaque so it's you can't see through it as well like you can with the blue which I have they're blue right here I'll show you so if this so much this is a little too warm for my liking right now but um if I hold it up here see how transparent that is never uh whenever it falls so the pink like I said just a little thicker which is which is cold now the pink one is their newest formula so the blue I think the blue was first and then I'm assuming the clears next not totally sure so don't quote me on that but anyway so sorry really like the pink now with the blue like it's you know technically blues made for everywhere um I haven't had any issues with it removing fine hair um so but like I said the pink is supposed to be even better at that so but I love both I haven't had any issues you know I I just think maybe we're different for some people so maybe if you have the blue and it's on Under Armour so like that it's not working how you wanted to you can give the pink a shot cuz like I said that's what they're saying it's formulated for so I'll do a little demo for you let me show you my arm first see if I get the camera to focus and I apologize with my extreme paleness I am I kind of have to I've had it except that I'm just not really ever gonna be a tan person but you can see my fuzzies there I've been watching my arms for forever so I don't really come in thick but so I will do a little demo for you here we go okay let's see if I can get this in the camera so hopefully you can see the difference between the wax in my skin because I know it kind of blends in a lot more than the blue the blue obviously really pops on someone like me but as you can see it's really creamy it goes on smooth easy to apply it's applied that at least in my experience the same as the blue you might even be able to do slightly a lower temperature but um but I really liked it so again it's kind of weird angle it's removed just like that and look at that beauty no more fuzzies let me actually show you just written what kind of Christian okay let me see if you can see the hair oh I can get my camera to focus properly kinda here I'll show you the front cuz you can see it easily that way see all those guys that's awesome I really really really like it especially because for fine hair I always had an issue with Bearden doing that especially facial facial features it just or nothing features oh my gosh facial waxing I'm sorry guys I I just always had an issue so I really really liked the pink for face for whatever I'm like since I'm a face brows lip sideburns the suckers off like I said I've liked it for Brazilians as well like the for underarms which I like the blue too so it's hard for me to pick because I just had such a good experience of both of them but everyone's got their own preference um so I like this one I will come up with a video for the clear that's the next one I'm going to give it a shot and we'll see how that one is but that one I think that one's like a premium wax for sensitive skin which we all have sensitive skin so that should be good too but many questions let me know I'm always here to answer them for you at phone number is five one two five oh one two seven six seven

and it is a product of the hard work of bees it offers various amazing health benefits and helps in the treatment of numerous illnesses and conditions unfortunately there are numerous fake honey types on the market under misleading labels of raw organic honey and low price which may trick you into buying fake honey a recent public research done by Food Safety News over 76% of all honey sold in markets has been subjected to a process known as ultra filtration yet this process removes impurities such as wax traces along with the pollen manufacturers claim that this process is important as it extends the shelf life of the product and prevents crystallization but it also removes pollen which provides numerous health benefits also researchers found that the aim of this process is in fact to hide the geographical origin of the honey in China manufacturers contaminated honey with illegal antibiotics and metals within the filtration process in order to import it and its origin became difficult to determine therefore you should avoid fake honey at any cost as in the case of pollen contamination it is of high importance to trace and analyze the origin of the product this is how to spot fake honey pure honey crystallizes over time if your honey does not crystallize after some time it is adulterated read the labels before purchasing honey and if it contains high-fructose corn syrup or commercial glucose you should not buy it add a few drops of iodine to a glass of water and add some honey if the honey turns blue it has been mixed with corn starch add a few drops of vinegar to a glass of water add some honey and if it foams it has been adulterated with plaster burn your honey with a match your phosphorous in case it ignites it is pure honey add a spoon of honey to a glass of water and if it dissolves it is adulterated or low-quality we also provide some additional tips when buying honey there are also honey products which have been mixed with glucose as well as others which rich and low-quality meat honey sold at KFC and McDonald's contain pollen even 77% of the honey which can be bought at Costco Target and Sam's Club does not have pollen do not buy honey sold at Walgreens and CVS pharmacy as these products do not contain pollen honey winnie-the-pooh sold at walmart also lacks pollen . these tips can be of great help when it comes to choosing the right honey type always try to buy pure organic honey as it is the only one that contains pollen and provides multiple health benefits [Music] you [Music]", "rD5b4FITgXE": "hey guys this is Kristen with HK wax better in Austin Arbor now if you've been following me you know that I just recently switched over from using a burden to now I am using star pill I figured it might be a little easier for you guys if I did a side-by-side comparison so you can really see the difference between the two besides looking at one video for bereted on one in video four star pill and so that's the purpose of this video now if you um just want to see let me apply the two and see the difference there then skip forward a couple of minutes because I'm gonna do a little bit of talking before I actually get to that I've got some points I kind of want to make and really just be able to explain the reason for why I switched over so first is the packaging now I've got these two here behind me as you can see two very different packages show here so with Feridun they come in 10-pound bags and now this ten that I have I had to purchase this from Burdon separately so it cost extra to get the ten which is fine you know no big deal um and then start pill they come in five pound bags or five contents I don't know if they come in ten or not I just switched over so I still have to do a little bit of research but every time you order a five pound tub you get this tub for free too which is nice because I have made the mistake with burden of not opening the bag correctly and having beads so all over the place so when it comes in a seal the tub it completely and eliminates that factor they also have what I thought was cool home you see a little poster and they have their sticker on there as well which just adds a little extra touch so mind you what you use compare to the varied in which has marketing on it whatsoever now if they don't it's surf will only has five about ten pound um and if you are listening star pill if you happen to watch this then I would like to be a 10 pound tub as well I mean you might not be fell in ten pounds but at least just a bigger option like this I don't know what y'all used it scoop out your beads I am just have a little middle scoop here and I do have it can be a little trickier in a smaller tub because I'm so used to my big one um so for that reason that might be a cool little addition other than that I love that it comes in these tubs already which is pretty cool now um I found Barrett in I used to work at European market Center um and so they have a great wax I do really like their wax so when I branched off and opened up my own business I know I wanted to find something as close to that as possible because European doesn't allow you to purchase their wax so I had found paradin from a foreign with other estheticians that we're talking about the wax that they use and they talked highly of it so I ordered some and Monday the rest of history and I got turned on to start pill I actually had one of you guys one of my followers commented on my Bearden page or my Barrett end video I'm sorry and I have on YouTube and they asked if I had heard about Starkville and honestly I hadn't but I'm always open to trying something new I always want to use the best product possible so I actually went to start pills website and they have a place where you can submit a form to get a sample which was cold so I did that and they were very responsive and they sent me out to different kinds of wax so one of them was the blue film hard wax which is primarily what I use and then they also sent it's a pink film hard wax which I'll have another video on that one my review and like the differences between the two but this one's just gonna be about the the blue film hard wax but I tested it out and I was honestly surprised by how well I liked it because I wasn't really looking to find a new wax I was just responding to one of my viewers when I asked my opinion but I was pleasantly surprised um I tested it out um on malaria side of my face I did a client's legs just so I kind of seated the rural difference um and I was shocked by how well it picked up not only the coarse hairs but also the thin hairs too so I'll explain the main differences between you two so if you just look at them side by side color wise almost completely identical um if I'm not focused on which one I'm using when I was kind of testing them out separately it's easy to get them mixed up because they look so similar with the color so when I do that gun side-by-side comparison I apply those you'll notice that so I'll keep pointing it out so you know which ones which and so there was that um now they both apply really smooth and I wax quickly so I needed a wax that can allow me to put on multiple strips and not break when it comes off that is the number one quality that I need for Oh X so when I was testing it out on my clients leg and it checked that box I was like I'm good to go um what else okay star pill wax they it does heat up faster so just pay closer attention whenever you put it in the pot you turn the pot all the way on it heats up quicker and once it gets hot it gets really hot so I have to UM just not heat it up quite as long when I'll have another video on how to properly heat up the wax - um so look out for that one as well um buried in it it just heats up so er it just takes longer which is fine you know I'm not trying to despair it in at all cuz I love there and I've been using them for years I just better um but yeah I just it just takes longer um which which is fine so what else let's see um Oh so with star pill like I was saying just don't just don't leave it on quite quite as much but it is good if you're in a rush as well just because time is money so I don't have to worry about being here so early before clients that's awesome um what else oh and then it is more cost effective - now I am NOT a person at all that is looking for the cheapest product or supplies I absolutely believe that you get what you pay for and I have tried other waxes that are super cheap but they suck so although star pill is more cost effective that wasn't my you know number one thing that I was trying to fix it was just an added bonus just cool now what else I'm going to bring my client in I'm gonna do a side by side of his leg so that you can see that so I'll pause this video gear in a second and then I'll be back so you can see my comparison alright guys I am back and I have my client on my table I'm gonna show you his hair before I take it off so I'm gonna put Barrett in on the left leg start pill on the right leg and I'll keep telling you that throughout the video because most likely you'll forget cuz they look so similar okay so in my big pot I have my star pill cuz I've switched it over so that pot is now my go-to and I've got my small pot here this is just a little pot normally I keep in my house really just a test out waxes do the tiny bit of beard and I have left um luckily I saved some so I could make this video it's gonna be in my spot a small pot as you can see if you just look at them they look completely identical so I will apply my start pill wax first so again it's going on my right leg or his right leg technically I have another video that's gonna be coming out here soon explaining how to properly apply a wax strip so that look beyond look out for that as well but I manic panic curve it this way because you can see his lair his hair oh my gosh is turning so I'm going to pull it here diagonally again color just a really pretty blue come up fix my edges there you go okay get my Bearden bear Dan's going on the left leg again I'm gonna be curving it the other way there you go alright so if you look at these two color wise almost exactly the same I honestly I really can't tell any difference between the two colors which is kind of cool it's pretty color alright now I can leave these on longer but just so you're not sitting here watching me talk all day I'm gonna take it off normally I would pull the skin by doing this one-handed so bear with me alright that one broke normally doesn't do that I always apply pressure afterwards just to help with the client let's see this one mom that one broke too so this one I'll do another one here for you so you can see what properly it might apply those little too thin I'll do it a slightly different part of the skin see ya as you can see though hair wise that's almost all gone I mean it's pretty amazing what this wax can do I've really liked it okay let's see here I will how do I do this with this hand I'll do it this way hopefully y'all can see this again take all my wax off go down I'm gonna get one more cuz I'm applying these a little bit too thin so I'm just going over the start pull one with a little bit extra wax so that it doesn't break on me here we go okay I'm gonna I'll do the same with the bare it in perfect awesome like I said this stuff with both of them I can apply multiple strips and it's gonna be fine which is my number one quality there we go I came off nice I think I owe them all to thin but that's my number one number one quality that I need with a wax okay here's a perfect example between the two you can see this light do you see the hair that's left over on this leg this is the beard and leg again now look at this one can you see the difference this is the shirt that I just did there's maybe three hairs right there compared to this one that has about 15 to 20 that are still on there now I was talking about earlier about how star pillow put this backgrounds you can see me star pill is um more cost-effective I also have to use less of it for that exact situation and it takes out more of the hair on the first wax which especially with legs as you all know you use a lot of wax for legs and I was actually able to go back in and lower my prices because I wasn't using as much wax all my cleanup strips which I just never really considered yeah never thought about it but that was just really neat so you're also saving money on the wax itself and then saving money on the amount of wax that you're using per client now um the one big I have to call it my aha moment um where I discovered I was really 100 percent confident with my decision to switch over was the first time I did underarm with star pill now I kind of I had grown to dislike underarm appointments because I could never get the wax to perform how I wanted it to I just I would have to constantly go over it multiple times to take all the wax out I just got used to it I just thought that's just what underarms do um but the first time I used start pill for an underarm I remember I applied it again didn't think anything different would happen um and I removed it and I just was shocked with how much hair had come out I'm not kidding you 95% as that hair was gone which was barren I was used to about 50% um so that moment alone was a game-changer um and I honestly didn't know if it was just I got lucky that one time so I had another underemployment the next day and his exact same thing happened um I was aesthetic so just just that situation really made me confident and that I in for life gonna be a user of stark oh I really really think the quality is it's just top notch I have no complaints whatsoever so if you don't have any questions anything I didn't know if I've missed something in this video I'm again not at all trying to bash Derrida and I've loved Bearden for years but I have been to find something better and again that was in regards to you guys y'all were the ones who asked me to check out star pills so thank you any questions let me know I am always happy to answer anything that that you might think of so one over here is a 5-1 to a five oh one two seven six seven and thank you for watching bye guys", "xcyivhJPN0s": "today I've made myself a budget bike wash kit that did not break the bank in fact I've saved myself a lot of money going this route and here's what it's all about [Music] [Music] [Music] and there's nothing specific about these that are bicycle related the griten the grime and the dust and the dirt that we get out on the road is very generic that's why we can get away with using generic products like this to clean our bikes Radio now into the details of every product that I have here I'll put links below to every one of these but let's start off straightaway with the wash you know I've selected the heavy duty truck and car wash just the wash not the wax either we don't want any wax gumming building up on the frame as we wash it so just to wash 2 liters that should last a very long time depending on the ratio of mixture that should be good to go that's the wash component I've selected that comes in at eight dollars twenty two Australian now to get the wash and a few other things on the bike we will need spray bottles so I've got myself a three pack of spray bottles one litre spray bottles they come in two $5 you probably only need one but N + 1 or n + 2 with cycling we all know what that's about so that's what the concentrate and a few of the big greases will go into once we get to those next up we'll need something to put these in to take them out to our washing area and also to hold water that's a bucket 96 cents Australian easy done and it's blue my favourite colour okay they're good to go every bike wash kit needs a jumbo sponge so I picked up a jumbo sponge coming in at a dollar and five Australian that goes there next up we have a wash cloth kit now this is a four pack which was quite convenient of different textures from smooth down to very fluffy on this one multi-use I guess but I do I'm after is this one here really fluffy that would be the finished polishing rag once we're done cleaning the bike and everything's nice and getting a little dryer with that so there are rag kit three dollars fifty for all four of those next up is the degreaser and I've gone with the diggers wax and grease remover ten dollars 38 quarter of the price of some other bikes specific degrees that are out there with exactly the same contents now for this I'll be using it to clean the jockey wheels chain rings and rear cassette cleaning a chain your mileage may vary if you're going to clean the chain on the bike or off the bike for me I take the chain off most of the time put it in an ultrasonic cleaner I will link below to my video on that which this degrees it can be used for as well but for today is going to be jockey wheels rear cassette and chain rings for this using the diggers wax and grease remover again links below to this specific product oh that's also biodegradable to according to the spec sheet so happy days and I can't forget the brushes and I've gone all out for the brushes having four different types which are all here first up we need a soft bristle scrubbing brush dustpan brush coming in at two dollars we don't need that at all so just a soft bristle brush that will get into most areas and it's not too harsh on your frame so two dollars for that one dollar if you split it we don't need that part so quite cheap for that soft bristled brush onto this little gem here it's a little scrubber with a dispenser compartment in here you can put degrees in here or just standard wash and a little bit stiffer bristles so good for chain rings jockey wheels chains I guess and cassettes that goes in the pack for a dollar fifty next up we've seen these brushes in all the commercial black wash kits stiff bristle brush this is a grout brush dollar fifty good for cassettes and finally if you are cleaning your chain on your bike you probably wanna brush on the degreaser with a lighter brush just to get it into all little areas that you can sew a paintbrush coming in at seventy nine cents so what we have here is under $35 Australian which converts over to just under twenty four dollars us we are under budget for the twenty five dollar budget bike wash kit happy days with that with the money we've saved means we've got more money to spend so let's overextend ourselves into this bonus round and the first thing is the isopropyl rubbing alcohol for disc brakes if you're going to be cleaning your disc brakes to remove that squeaking this is what you're after but if you don't want to contaminate your brakes during cleaning there are cheap shower caps we saw this hack on GC and the other day people have been using this hack for years put these around your disc brakes and they're unlikely to get contaminated when you're washing your bike with all this stuff here so shower caps or for yourself if you get a bit messy out there cleaning your bike and finally for those who like to keep clean we have the gloves these ones are disposable blue nitrile gloves not latex so if you get any of these chemicals on it they shouldn't split apart they come in at two dollars eighty six quite cheap on that okay so here we are there's our extended kit our standard kit all up we come in at under $30 u.s. super impressive so there we are commercial grade stuff you've got to go do the legwork yourself to get these products they don't come in all in one kit but if you do the legwork you're going to save yourself a lot of money Lynx blow to all these products for me for now it's time to go and wash some bikes [Music] you [Music]", "CVLMBwVFmOc": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "AwMWDKtzqdg": "hello and welcome to lumber cryptocurrency analysis news and education my name is James cool this video is for the 4th of July 2018 going to be jumping on to market update today then Tentacles the big three and coins you voted on in the last video into the comments you know after you right after we tackle some of the news so versus first totem are kept in the space is 266 billion USD lost four billion dollars worth of valuation loss 24 hours 10 P speaking of no big deal more massive mouth 24 our volume is 13 billion US dollars with bitcoins lemons had 41.9% and today we can see we're having the pullback we can be expected to see since the last video with most Queen seeing a loss or valuation in single digit read them but some point is seeing some gain sis Quinn is up 18 one three nine percent I think that's actually artificial because we're going to be covering some Cisco news with cause finance but states is up 14% and because what's in the market here the wax up down 14% so it's a pretty even variances to Queens gaining a losing valuation so quickly returning the charts we're talking about what is what what happened yesterday and today we were expecting some consolidation and we're expecting to reach a low of six thousand three hundred fifty US dollars we reached a low of six thousand four hundred eleven so you know we were you know not sixty sixty one dollars off which is pretty decent pretty decent and we were saying that you know we need to establish a lower high before we can kind of rally on to some new levels which is essentially its top the target is seven thousand euros which is probably gonna stop a bit short to be fair stop you know stopped short at you know to six thousand nine hundred plus risk we speaking because you know a lot of people going to look at those levels and of course we look at 50-day moving average you can see it's currently at seven thousand sixty nine euros DS it probably like continue to tape it down if you're playing if you're reading charts from pure visual level but we can see today we found support on the 12 moving abject financial with you know relatively decent volume today it's not as good as you know it could be but what we're seeing is a weak dragonfly doji and thankfully today I can continue to click on to the charts with my mouse we have a trend continuation candle in this in this uptrend and a trend reversal candle up since the period consolidation so we just want to quickly check out how BTC consolidated last night and last two days to see if it's healthy consolidation or not and what would be looking forward some sideways trading and for the coin not to completely fall out the sky so we can see here dragonfly doji spinning top signals indecision broke bearish and then we had the continuation downtrend broke below the 12 moving average and then found form that on the just above the 26 closing from 26 had an inside bar broke bullish noticing a bit of profit taking ideally on the four-hour time frame we're looking to see it's a close above the 12 of the abject potential retest and bounce of bounce off and on to some higher highs or you can see here the first resistance level can't pay attention to it these 6700 USD mark every quickly if I turn off auto 4 to get off we can see there are no moving averages on for our time for incoming 2-players resistance check out the Audi timeframe as well to get more information constant volume turn auto on and we can see here that we are seeing a bit of bit more details that's what's actually actually happened with the price so we'll guys to volume we can see that on these moves down the sell side action is actually pretty high and we had a strong trend reversal candle so this is this is a really clear sign to make an entry right here for a trade if we quickly take a look at how you know how it's kind of close per house you'll see so 1% gain nothing too crazy but this is a nice trend risk from cow but that's the kind of dragonfly doji you'd hope to see or worse or hammer depending on how thick the body is and it would you know and we're going to continue to trend up some high light levels so again we're facing some resistance levels here in our hourly roughly around the same levels in the per hour time frame but you know momentum is going to start picking up again with this coin and we quickly take a look at the volume we can see we have decreasing bed volume on these small moves up and there's a nice spike in but again volume is starting to pick up again slowly but surely our site raining upwards had a current confirmation Canada bullish on the histogram on the hourly time frame check out histogram on a four hour time frame we can see the histogram is actually trading just started to get flat again a bit of profit taking here and we look at the daily timeframe we can see that we have a histogram it's training to the bullish so not too much price volatility on the day but we need to establish that lower high to kind of rally on to some new levels so things looking pretty decent and playing out as expected before we go up to 7000 and get rejected from at all what's likely to happen so moving on to the theorem it's s the USD bracing the story a bit of a stronger reversal kind of right here longer lower wick more for the body already trading above the table moving average exponential right here we have histogram on the MACD training bullish RSI turned up seen was looking pretty decent it's not looking terrible serum has been a bit a bit choppy there's a last couple of weeks but just getting a bit more detail on the four hour time frame this consolidation isn't as strong as bitcoins consolidation bitcoin was more of a sideways trade than two candles sending off in part of me sorry in more of a sideways trade and I'm ratting on to new levels decent trend reversal candle here not the strongest but again better compared to previous days and it looks like again we're looking for a close up the table with the abject tens we're going to quickly zoom into the Audi time frame to see how the volume is and we can see a very strong trend reversal camera here get confirmation for trend reversal right here spinning top facing resistance and I'm just riding on to high levels the key thing here again is close above the 26 moving average to neutral that would be reflected on that for our time frames are close above the 12 moving average and the daily it will be reflected as a close above the 12 of the average so what we'll be looking for again is a closed while they're talking and exponential for this coin and then tomorrow it would provide this coin closes like so looking for a trend confirmation candle can basically be a green candle breaking bullish and then that would kind of be the first sign that things going to continue on to the upside so again things are playing out how we're expecting them to play out so best-case scenario seems to be playing out how we expect of course all that could happen tomorrow everything could break for both these coins and you know for litecoin dick when cash as well they could break bearish and we could just be forming a low low a lower low and again it wouldn't really break the pattern so to speak unless we start breaking below the absolute low from the bottom of this bounce looking at litecoin LCC USC we have a very strong trend reversal candle yesterday we can see very long upper wick for the body but what's very interesting about this is today's candle do not break bearish it did it did break bearish actually but didn't have this cuddly trading above the table moving objects man sure it's also forming a just to check the low of the estate's candle today's candle so it's one dollar lower so so it's not that far off it's not technically modern inside barbets writ is demonstrating some price compression what I couldn't quite coin maybe looking nice for an entry today to be fair not most amazing volume but if we take a look at the wrist this resistance levels right now compared to the other coins it's actually started to break above that resistance though which is the hundred day moving average and the 2600 giving an average exponential on the four-hour time frame so if you like playing the four-hour time for it might be it might be quite nice for you are a size strong strong uptick and we look at this consolidation as well to be fair like ones consolidation is much although it although on the day timeframe we do have a strong trend reversal candle likewise consolidation is actually much more reasonable compared to some other coins we've seen in the space we look at the Alba time for a bit more detail we can see there's actually much more side sideways trading so it's actually being it's actually holding the support levels much more significantly than it than some other coins and they're probably reason why the wire stretch a strong reversal candle or Daly is just because the way this coin broke out because unlike other coins on you know on this on this initial move we had the first breakout sideways trading riding moving averages and no support levels in the second break out white coin actually had a third breakout here which was you know continuing ones that was highs and that's where we're seeing the the doji on the you know the bearish reversal reversal doji on the daily so it's very interesting that a slightly different perspective or situation of light coin and again argument and the case we're making entry for light coin right now we're seeing a trend continuation candle in this uptrend if it breaks above this the 50-day moving average which is at eighty five point five dollars on coinbase then that's what's going to be smashing above 100 moving average on the four-hour time frames were multiple time frames are breaking apart resistance levels it looks likely on a daily timeframe going to see light coin kind of should it should it should it should mean that we get the volume we need today like coin would actually show up and have a nice move today but again it was all very dependent on the volume first resistance level to kind of pay attention to would be the 9 to 1 USD mark from LTC looking at Bitcoin cash BCH BCH again very strong sell side action yesterday's candle we established that lower high you know in this pattern so we've got the lowest balance but high got a sorry got a higher low rather high low and this coins broken above the table we have the exponential already unlike Bitcoin and etherium similarly to light point over and we're seeing a trend continuation candle right here to see some bullish upside momentum and the only issue I'm seeing right now is that you know across the board would always going to mention the volume just isn't pushing isn't read there isn't really look at the per hour time frame this canvas candles closing in 15 minutes again it's not it's not this volume on this camera isn't really eclipsing the volume we're seeing on this deep planning there but I mean I'll get the car grid for you know that sign that bears kind of exhaust themselves that we are seeing declining volume on these moves down in general which is a good thing but we're not really seeing bull's show up and and you know pick up the ball so to speak with you know today's today's candle so right now very strong dragonfly doji to candles the other four hour time frame we're seeing on the last candle a bearish reversal candle gravestone doji but so combining them it would be a week spinning top and we're seeing a bit of a break to the upside right now again another count a coin that's facing resistance if it breaks above the resistance current resistance is that 772 US dollars if we take a look at Audi timeframe were likely to face resistance moving forward as well currently at 700 cents for so $2.00 different so Bitcoin cash could be interesting for an entry above 7 7 5 because then it's likely to provide it has momentum it's likely to be more free-flowing and we push and try the price up but again if you look at the volume on the hourly timeframe is pretty weak volume on these moves right now and if you look right here we're seeing a sell side and a bit of a bit of a spinning top action with this on howdy timeframes so a bit of mixed signals here with Bitcoin cash I wouldn't say is it's as interesting as some other coins looking at ontology because that's the coins you guys wanted me going you guys want me to take a look at if I've missed any we shall return and just quickly checking out ontology on the daily timeframe then the wall says projector and ontology is doing what we've kind of expected to as well last time we covered it which was price compression between 112 moving average exponential and well the one thing I said last time we checked in on ontology is to kind of watch to see if it's going to close above these levels because it could be setting up for a nice entry point however it closed below the hundred-day and now the keys the key thing today is to kind of see whether or not we're going to be able to close above 100 day today and go on some higher highs what we're going to continue to call it and so they down further now this is a her a massage in sidebar California today which signals price compression the volume across the last week or so is pretty even to be fair and relatively volatile as well so on some candles so we can see that some people are really loving this coin of some people are just trying to exit and close their position again spinning top on today's camel for our timeframe signals indecision it's kind of saying to us that like basically what I just said a bit a bit of choppy information right here decreasing decreasing their volume on on the four-hour time frame it looks like we may be moving into oversold territory pretty soon on the 4 hour time frame checking out the hourly time frame does look like momentum is starting to shift to the upside for ontology across the various time frames just zooming in to 30 minutes as well looks like a mentum shifting if we just keep zooming on look at the histogram look at the RSI look at the candles I'm seeing some some consolidation out of 50 minute time frame when a 50 moving average but again if we look just quickly zooming and we can see a mentum starting to shift to the upside again and we could be inflexible five minutes so it looks like or between the five minute and hourly time for omentum is starting to go to the upside but was yet to be reflected on the four-hour and daily so again until it happens it may it's not really time to make of entry but this coin looks like it's about to pick up Wiley can close above 100 day okay so that's it for the TA section we would jump over to news right now so bye Nance some very odd training so sis cone a coin that hasn't really hasn't really been able to have a you know a massive amount of them upside lately has seen one sis queen or actually not just one but sis coin being sold for 96 BTC on by now so they suspended trading on this coin there apparently was a lot of box trading but pushing the price up on this coin so you suspended training and they basically are going to release a statement later on today but they've already announced something which is the secure asset fund for users in the system instant after that so leading crypto exchange - has recently announced the creation of a user safety fund called secure asset bond safe food or satoru in or in the aftermath of sis sis coin trading rat irit irregularities that saw at least one user purchased one Cisco and worth about $26 Switek cents for the equivalent of six hundred and twenty five thousand dollars in Bitcoin the question is why using market orders before for this coin I don't understand why you would be using a market order plus why aren't you looking at the chart but anyway in an upgrade going over the irregular irregular trades the exchange detected by Nance announced that they came from a number of AP of its API users they suspended ap is why recently as well and that these triggered it in its internal risk management system so essentially what happened is someone's been likely a group of people have likely been using finances API to kind of use a bot to drive up the price of Cisco in one system was triggered companies decide to halt trading withdrawals and other functions to figure out what's going on since the problem came from users API key is these were removed and among them whilst recreate their keys notably the incident affected the trading pairs of Cisco and kryptonite's as well over ninety percent of his training podium concentrated on Finance while the token is in the press at time trading at 26 cents per token in regular traits or users pay 96 BTC for one sis absolutely crazy podium was absolutely ridiculous as well compared to no previous day's next up by Oats announcement details it was brought back all the regular trades and compensate those negatively affected by offering them zero fee trading between July 5th and July 14th I don't think that's too exciting all other by Nance users will receive 70% repaid in the finance coin on trading fees paid during sell set periods so everyone else is benefiting from this witness that if Sanj added that to protect the future assets of what its uses it's set to create a secure security digital asset fund starting on the 14th of this month and will allocate 10 percent of all trading fees recede into sadly to offer protection to its all of its users and their funds in extreme cases this fund will be stored in a separate code where it's basically by announced is just a really good exchange so it's very regular that's happening but again there's another case of Brian ants demonstrating what we'd like to see an exchange do to protect its customers and then the day continuing on with the binary news bias is leading a twelve million dollar fundraising token funding rounds rather in tokenization startup Republic so a retail investment platform corporate public recently completely twelve million dollars in plantings totalized its platform and introduced its own security token led by Bennett's labs and NGC eco fund the financing round was also supported by ZK capital Austin ventures FBG capital hazel Capital East chain Xen fund and others Republic which last year secured seed funding from angel this nextgen venture partners oyster ventures rangin and grand central tech points to its core tenants of partnership compliance and fair access to relevant to the increasing global crypto ecosystem so let's quickly go over and Republic so Republic or so - you're a republic share the company's goals become the main market place for private investing and its mission to enhance diverse participation in all types of intrapreneurship so the global crypto fever has jump starts at the company's mission global collaboration is needed to address existing complexities and allow Kryptos current cryptic industry to expand fast and responsibly Republic start started to offer token sales late last year to accredited and non-accredited investors dozens of crypto products have been supported by tens of thousands of this is globally the platform they are looking to tokenize all by natural products and plans to use it - it's token to provide economic rights in addition to functional uses so this is a crypto products that's looking to be a security off the bat so obviously they're going to be complying with the SEC - with us - you know being classified it being security but I think this project is likely to hold somewhere in the future so it's one it's one worth keeping an eye on especially considering finances has invested in it so next up to news pieces from the UK that'd be what potentially so you could comment should have a chief watching officer will make it says UK lawmaker suggesting the government should push for further blockchain use in a public sector to rebuild social trust and increase government efficiency achieve that Eddie Hughes appalling member from the UK's Conservative Party argued in a report related on Reese on Wednesday the government should appoint a public facing chief for trained officer so just to take away some something interesting from this because obviously not everyone's based on UK and if you start seeing members of your government be appointed to official distributed ledger technology of so disabled or cryptocurrency absorb blockchain officer it's one of the signs that this market is about to explode it really is that there's it's a sign that that we're getting you know the old guard so to speak on board with the way this space is going they obviously see some merit you're obviously here because you see some merit in in the cryptocurrency space but you start seeing this popping up more and more it's really worth paying attention to so especially in countries that are likely to have our financial our financial hubs in that their continent or at least their know will have strong economies and relationships with other countries that's probably where it's most likely the most importance because then we could have more open access to funds flowing into this space next up so remaining with the UK forty percent of companies in regulatory stamp sandbox are deploying distributed ledger technology so the UK's financial conduct authority has unveiled 29 sequential companies to apply to the fourth cohort or the regulatory river towards sandbox we're of forty percent are using DLT according to announcement published July third the regular through sandbox an initiative designed to help organisations test various products and services in a live market environment with appropriate consumer protection but without restrictive regulation the sandbox is part of the innovates initiative launched in 2014 intended to promote competition to date innovative innovates has reported see for than 1,200 applications and supported over 500 firms so what's really interesting is that part of me in the UK at least we have a sandbox with companies where the end consumer is protected like they said what chain Tech is being implemented and where people can actually actually active actually actively participate and work with with cryptocurrency tech companies and this is this is this is a good thing because bullets demonstrating is that we don't in a broader sense need hot a hardcore regulatory framework kind of crushing and crippling this space and here's the kind of things we want to see in the fact that more companies are being approved in this room in this in the code cohort 4 which is the name of the sandbox is a really good thing really really good for the space as a whole hopefully it would be really nice to see other countries doing the same thing or just not having a sandbox and just laying now I would argue there in the case of regulation in this space I would say that you know overbearing regulation when their space is so young can really its growth them kind of don't want to see that so this is a good thing next up we're clearly talking about a Bitcoin debate that went on recently and on so performed July 2nd so this is Peter shift who is the proponent of shift gold I believe he strongly believe in gold bearish or Bitcoin I think he's debated a few people in the space I want a key debated with regards to you know the actual merit of BTC versus something that's more physically tangible but it argue it's kind of a mental hurdle people would me to understand get already bars to bitcoins tangibility because yes bitcoin is you know a digital crypto assets cryptocurrency and but it is it is something that's physical there is a physical element to it and we can talk about in a separate video and I did do a video to my Bitcoin but American stockbroker Pete should technically lost to shape-shift CEO and commentator Eric walkies in a Bitcoin debate and so one second like to financial thought leaders debated about the top clip of currency BTC and it's a plug me unlined watching tech questioning potential format adoption and comparing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with other asset types such as fiat money and gold war he's the Bitcoin bull of the debate claim Bitcoin will eventually become a substitute for state backed money while government structures would be reorganized using blockchain technology I can completely see this being the future this is a completely reasonable expectation not that fiat money is going to completely disappear because I can't see that ever happening not that bitcoins going to be the main currency that everyone uses because government's just will won't allow that but you know organizations will adapt but just having an alternative better model for money it makes sense that bitcoins going to play a significant role so for his obvious that bitcoin is supremely good money praising its provable provable scarcity divisibility durability fungibility Portability and decentralized nature stating bitcoin will win because there is no competition in money and bitcoin is the best money available because it's decentralized and kind of it stops he's noted that mass adoption will not happen right away or at once arguing bitcoin will simply gradually come to be used as an occasional terms it's for yeah defending bitcoin their position gold investor and financial commentator shift argue that bitcoin is not being succeed the future and work associated for fiat money since it's not backed by anything except confidence of buyers which mostly is driven by speculation so you know one could argue that once currencies moved off a gold standard and not backed by anything other than the fact that the government is enforcing their populace to use this currency and the fact that bitcoin now exists now is a better alternative to state backed national currency what's really backing currencies what's wet where's that element there is I appreciate his point but you know argue that that's kind of the missing point especially with me arguing for the arguing for the position of gold but saying very interesting is he also said that bitcoin is replicating all the properties of gold accepts the most important one the metal itself shifts argument for why gold is valuable as as element is based on the fact that is rare and has been found as a commodity for thousands of years so I don't want to misquote the guy because maybe this article is biased and missing out a few of his comments but his argument is arguing is without realizing it maybe he's arguing for the case of Bitcoin by talking about the merits of gold because bitcoin is scarce bitcoin is considered a commodity in some places just because it's just because it's neatest Bitcoin can't be considered of quality for thousands of years because it hasn't been around for thousands of years doesn't mean that it's not considered a commodity so you're saying it has no real value into itself as a quality there's no way rate twice the price of Bitcoin it's the price of anything else where you could argue the same with gold technically speaking continuing as the investor claimed that the existence of multiple different cryptocurrencies was a weakness stating there is only one gold they'll never be another gold shift noted there I'll have it all turns his Bitcoin which according to him have the exactly same properties of Bitcoin one could argue the same for silver one could argue the same for other precious metals for example the pressure on the metals in phones I think it's old tan or cold waltz I can't remember but one could argue they're more precious I mean I looked at recently because I'm considering precious metals investing in some precious metals based mining companies the same points he's arguing could be said about gold that's that's very interesting things shift also said no now 50 not hundred or so people connected that can be everything Bitcoin can do something do it better faster cheaper there's no limits a number of other digital currencies that can be created if you want to go to the future you have to go to the past the future of money is gold I think you have to learn from the lessons of the past but I wouldn't expect to go to the past next up so I'm gonna leave this video on here but the espresso CEO talked about be chained in a 20 minute interview and why he's using be chained it to and actually interesting wide espresso project is so interesting so it's worth watching it's a 20 minute video he talks about his project on this interview I'm gonna leave in the description box below but it's very interesting especially if you're interested in beating next up the last piece of news just probably smash through the comment section is Western Union will cancel international wire transfer bit mean it's time to leave legacy institutions to go the way of dances so we're seeing Western Union in a second second wave start to come up down on cryptocurrency base transactions we can see that today it's one way bit mainly a bit minutes and mining operation they sell mining hardware and also provide some hashing power for cryptocurrency network and it works around the world but Western Union is canceling remittances that's anything to do with mining and they've actually started doing this I think they did this but about three months ago started doing this who I was to sending money to inform exchanges certain exchanges so it's not looking good for Western Union the only reason the company would do this because is because they're trying to kind of crush the competition and they see as a threat so Oh Western Union okay so cool so moving on the comments section thank you so much for comments guys comments like subscriptions and valued inputs is how the channel grows I really appreciate it and it creates a conversation around specifically to talk about so sorry Bell says guys don't hesitate to buy the TA course James covers every aspect that you may have missed them puts foundations firmly in place for your own personal development regarding tea skills I have a hundred percent benefited from at a course and now all pieces fit into place thank you no problems thank you so much sorry I'm glad it helped and I'm gonna actually update the course in end of July there's gonna be a few extra nuggets or awesomeness that Adam and the course is for life guys so I'm gonna keep adding things I think I'll value to you hey James if you think the weather in London is bad you should try living in Yorkshire you're not the

experiencing cold weather provided I see the blue sky sometimes Cheers James have a good one hope you get get one thank you good sir appreciate that Brad Blackmon nice smiley face appreciate the comment good sir I'm guessing you hold a lot of neurosis Mike don't see how don't see how this you'd use beach hands far better project with real partners and huge companies key light shows in the works so I hold a lot of each chain as well I've been holding mirror for quite some time I've been holding B chain since you know always since they dot and I hold a bit of ontology as well I think all these can't all these queens have merit and this isn't probably in response to a comment in the last video I was talking about which one would you invest in new channel ontology and actually I wouldn't I would have missed in on three I don't see see why these products don't have merit mark cream says thanks James don't think that to mention the O going 6k I just as previously I live in CA centric o is always sunny and mild year-round haven't closed the porch door for eight years or use heating and cooling living costs are high but still likely less in London everything's relative considering your course good ta here on the channel has an indicator thank you sir thank you sir interesting hearing about California Central Coast always sunny and mild year-round Steve Knight says great work what's happening in the near ecosystem with ontology bridge protocol in Trinity I know it's great throwing updated roadmap pen should maintain steady rise maybe watch out for attention why the rumor sell news trap yeah I agree with that last statement James are still using revolute to move funds from coinbase also roderick looks looks any good in looks good in any opinion thanks your work like the fact that you ask these comments your beards cheers no problem why Rex is Wyrick so crypto I haven't seen or is that just a alternative 2 revolutes let's quickly take a look Warrick SAP our customers are fully protective or active customers that counts the highest level security PCRA ESS of one wire acts as a provider of crypto wallets linked to physical and virtual Beauty their cars as well as scripted currency in traditional currency exchange and payment solutions ok that's interesting based in London I haven't actually checked this out so I'll have to take a look but like the fact they have a maybe I forgotten about this project maybe they I like the fact they have cards connected to directly to crypto and to exchange it what's interesting is 10x and Monaco have basically got their visa cards back so they're getting music cards which i think is pretty interesting but I'm still using revolutes I actually just got my revenue card for the first time for free but I'm not using it for crypto too much I I'm uh I'm response to show my Revit card which is ridiculous shouldn't do that because but yeah I just got my blue card the I have issues I actually still have issues with revolutes I know some of my friends have issues sending crypto so some exchanges with revolutes so you know it's a bit it's a bit of a tricky one but last time I tested it it's it works for me so gujiya says your amazing person in school thank you that's really sweet thing to say it's very kind shariq latest as hi James took your course I learned a lot what you would really be able to knows if you did a video where you do some paper trading help bring everything together and they helped with some issues I have using trading view when it comes to placing at XD orders thank you for you do yeah so what I'm looking to add to do in July is is exchanges placing orders in exchanges and are add paper trading as well and more thorough paper trading section rather than the one that's currently on the course like a ritual step by step what to click and through it and examples on the course that you're really good thank you for the feedback course will be ever improving I promise you guys it's going to be fantastic great today the rebound is treats happen but just now buy notes fighters arrived people would which be soon enough to fall into it along the centralized exchanges ruled we had to face this problem near will always be a gem probably the only non privacy coin I'm accumulating I still believe privacy coins which were by competing on this equal would the next ball around best to make my narrow deep onions e cash now than later so Manero I'm a big fan of deep onion you're probably not going to like my review I know a lot of onion fans on the channel but I've done a deep onion review and posted it to patreon which will be released sometime in the future but I'm not a fan of the deep onion tech with regards to tour because it's not an absolute privacy coin if I was going to rank privacy coins it becomes like second to my narrow but doesn't mean you can't make money with it it's just that depending on your time frame depending on your time frame to stay in and hold the onion I think you can hold deep onion and make money quite a significant Bunch I'm just depending on time frame I think my narrow is more appealing to me personally Kurt says very warming hooray indeed sir sadly I'm hoping for a bit of a pullback I had money waiting for it to hit five thousand five hundred but it never happened yet two hundred dollars off roughly which is it's kind of normal to miss not not normal but sometimes you do miss targets I've had an order hanging around on coin bit at 5500 since February or March roughly if you're considering moving to America I'd strongly reconsider moving to another european nation or kendricks instead I'd argue UK is probably the best country to live in in Europe at the moment so it doesn't make sense to leave fascism or Fort arianism and right-wing populism on the rise in United States for the election of Donald Trump and will make things more precarious for anyone seeking to emigrate to the United States Isis treatment of families at the border is evidence of this be careful if you move yeah I agree it's not exactly the greatest time I do think that generally speaking things get better in a long term things are generally trending upwards in terms of quality of life but those things are also on the rise in Europe as well this isn't a political channel but you know it's kind of no escaping at the moment oh it just says hahaha all right so noted for showing a Mayan Prophecy made no my business if you're if it's just a main base in relation I'm happy to buy a habitable mate yeah it's just it's

Oh, we're rolling. Hey, uh, here I am,\nunnecessarily dressed up. Now, you can tell I'm\ndoing some serious stuff cause I'm not just\nwearing this sweet blazer, I'm wearing a tie. Generally speaking, these\nthings are decorative. I mean, a tie won't keep\nyou warm they way, say, a scarf would and depending\non the material it's not going to be a very good\nnapkin or a mop or a towel. Nope, we just tie these\nthings around our necks and walk around as if to\nsay, that's right world, I'm doin' important stuff today. So once upon a time in the early 1600's, both Louis the thirteenth\nand his successor Louis the fourteenth\nused Croatian mercenaries during various battles. And these mercenaries wore\nscarves or knotted neckerchiefs as part of of their uniforms. These scarves did have a\nfunction in that they likely helped tie jackets together\nand keep them closed. But the French king was more\nimpressed by the mercenaries fashion sense and he wasn't the only one. Over the next few years, the\nscarves, which were called cravates or cravats swept across France. They were more comfortable\nthan the starched linen ruffs that had been the norm because\nthese cravats were loose, less restricting, and as\nthey became more popular with the wealthy, they\nalso became more intricate with newer materials like lace,\nincreasingly sophisticated knots and so on. The cravat soon spread to other countries, earning fans like England's\nCharles the second. Of course, at this point\nthere were numerous variations on the original cravat but\nthese didn't look like the relatively slim modern ties we see today. We didn't even call them\nties, we were all just like different words that\nbasically mean cravat. During the reign of Louis the fourteenth, the original cravat gave\nway to a variation called the Steinkirk. It had a single knot and a narrow shape. And as the years turned into\ndecades and those decades turned into centuries, the\ntie continued to evolve and we created variations\nlike the bow tie. You've seen that, Josh\nwears one on Don't Be Dumb. And here's a weird tangent. Do you remember that\nsong Yankee Doodle Dandy? Right, probably. There's a part in the\nsong where this verse goes he stuck a feather in his\nhat and called it macaroni. But it turns out that\nmacaroni described a specific type of fashion sense and\nthe men who subscribed to it. In the late 1700's, a group\nof controversial fashion aficionados, known as macaronis\nbegan tying their neckware in certain knots and styles\nto indicate their taste. Which reportedly led to their\ncravat simply being called ties. Now, while their\npopularity may wax and wane over the decades, which\nis the case with most fashion accessories, it seems that ties, or something like them, are here to stay. So, I've gotta be honest\nhere, the idea of a tie seems pretty bizarre\nwhen you think about it. I mean, do ties have a\npurpose other than decoration?

financial issues and feeling don't and that's all okay so I'm gonna put my little heart crystal aside and then we're gonna get on to your little reading here so I'm gonna be going through each card here I feel like this is the bottom one that is the one that you guys need to hear and now I keep flipping through I know some of you like to see the whole card set but I only have a limited space room so about that I'm sorry if I camera and stuff like that so it really seems like at this time of real life is very stressed out and you don't know what to do I feel like this might have to do with YouTube in general I feel like this was YouTube for some of you this is a test this is work or school and just let you guys know everything's gonna be okay they want you to know that he regards that everything on your angels whatever whoever is guiding you they want you to know that this stress is not healthy and what you're doing isn't healthy for yourself and you need to let go of all the straws that can actually cause you to have more problems than usual I feel so it for some of you in the heart chakra I thought some energy is trapped if you guys want to I can release it for you so if you guys are agreeing for me to release it from you I'm going to do access consciousness and say POC all nine shorts boys and beyonds and your heart chakra is now clear now also to see the light within this situation to see how just amazing your situation is even though you don't know the full purpose over got you just gotta learn from it right now your guys are really telling you to believe in yourself maybe you've been stressed out I'm seeing to the point where it's made some of you like sick like throwing up and stuff so just take some time to really put in some self-care those army cots are feeling the flow of energy so they're kind of like wondering what's going on I gots my TV in this video now and also don't worry because you're gonna actually have a happy surprise coming to you so a happy surprise as in you something unexpected is gonna happen and you don't know what it is first time maybe you might be within this week and for I think most of you it's gonna be month like I don't know like a couple of surprises monthly like a lot of surprises in the future including traveling and maybe writing in also a year I feel like you guys are really going through it in this you know time this may resonate to some of you this may not but I feel like some of you are starting to come to your own path and what you really want to do for those who want to do a youtube channel just go ahead and do it because there's no reason to be in fear I just feel like you guys need to move forward and actually show yourselves that you can actually do something and that it's okay to be different I did want to share a little bit of a story with you guys so I was actually afraid to be myself a couple of months ago and I just decided that I wasn't gonna be scared anymore actually my story is like on Twitch I actually opened up myself and stated Who I am I really wanted people to know who I am and I actually wanted to actually do something that was best for me just because when I did what was best for me all new opportunities opened up and so did my career financially stuff started opening up and me manifesting and all that that really helped me to if you're afraid of showing yourself about who you really are then start really slowly that's the best advice I can give to you and then some of you have been ignoring your intuition this is really important actually I feel here that you should really listen to your feelings this card is confirming anything even thinking about dreaming about you should listen to your actual feelings and not what people tell you because people in the world will tell you what to do out of their own experience or out of their own fears from what happened in their past you don't need someone to actually tell you if something's okay you do not need like an OK from someone let's let's get real here why do you need it okay just to be yourself like why do you need someone to tell you what you should be doing or if it's okay to do something if you really want to do what you love then that's fine sometimes people don't generally understand and some people just don't really want to listen or really be supportive and I feel like you may have to cut some people out of your life because you don't need to be justified for actually doing something that you want to do and the other thing is that like see this is though the only approval that you need is your own right who is somebody to tell you that your hair looks bad right if you love your hair you don't care what what somebody thinks you don't care whether like someone doesn't think that your hair looks good or whatever like that doesn't even matter right it's like when you're feeling good in your own skin when you're feeling good about yourself right that's all that really matters isn't it and just know that you do deserve better people in your life and you do need to cut people out of your life this is a confirmation actually um the first person that you actually do think of that's how you're supposed to cut out of your life also note that you can change things around you can change every situation around you can live through your heart you can live through everything you can live through big changes and events in your life you can flow into these things that are coming in into your life and you can flow easily right stay afloat don't drown because like this stuff that you feel a sphere and stuff that's an illusion that's only stopping you and there is no fear and when you do feel fear remember to actually ask the universe to take that energy away from you and replace it with light and love and also believe who you'll be coloring believe who you are believe in what you're doing believe in yourself because I think I'm in of the day that's all that matters right is your own approval you don't need some else's approval to do what you want to do and actually you live a pretty badass abundant life you know that right because we all have treasure inside of us we actually are treasure we are money you know it's not a bad thing you can have charm with money and everything and we can be abundant and free and that's what I feel like needs to be sad right now so I hope you guys enjoyed this reading let me know if there was a cure for you or if it wasn't you can thumbs up or thumbs down the video but yeah I hope you guys had an amazing magical time here listening to me so onto the next pile which is number two okay mister piggy peg I love mr. pig so what does mr. pig have to say okay so mr. pig is actually saying move through obstacles run sprint jump play a balance of energy is basically balance out your energies how about getting and yang to yourself know that you're all abundant and flowing I feel like some of you guys pick number one are coming in to number two which is also welcome back if you are but essentially I'm just checking to see how much time we have but I can't see that okay be good enough time I'm recording on my phone so yeah Minister piggy Pig is actually saying to live in the air now do not be in a rush to actually slow down but move quickly and swiftly through these obstacles that you see in your life it's actually time to slow down and relax and smile mr. pig okay that's it soon bye bye okay so first thing learn more about yourself I feel like this is more about yourself right because of this card I see that with yourself right I feel you need to be more accepting of yourself more gentle or more soft cheer with yourself you need to really realize that this part of your life you really need to take it easy and slow and uh when you take it slow and you meditate you are calling car hermit right now I sense it's okay it's okay to be a hermit you know it's okay it's completely fine right now because what you need to do is you need to honor yourself right you need to honor who you are and this is about honoring who you are inside rather than listening to the outside so I feel like some of you are losing weight and some of you are discouraged they're saying that your progress is not lost if you mess up on one little thing then it's okay you can always get back up right it's not about if you lost today or if you didn't do it for a week or so it's okay right it's okay because you know what you can get back up and you can say okay I gotta keep moving take your time through this journey take your time doing what you need to do it don't feel bad and actually intuition only listen to your body that's why I'm feeling to say I recognize the major changes I feel like there's gonna be a glow up there's nothing in your way there's nothing blocking you actually listening to your heart you intuitive you're actually moving through swiftly you're about to fly you're about to take flight here I'm you're listening and you're really taking on to this big gigantic castle you're living in luxury basically energetically spiritually coming soon as money - and your heart is really just opening you up to this also some people around you may act weirdly but that's because you're in your own traditional spiritual healing right now I feel like you've already gone through the hurdles over hurt and the pain and right now all you need is just someone to listen to you I feel like you guys are very caring people I think somebody's at in indigo here or maybe like a star seed but basically if you don't feel like you do belong here you do belong here you belong and you know it's funny you'll find people that actually really makes really well with you and you do actually belong here don't feel bad about it don't feel bad about who you are stand up to people and don't live in fear and you just need to open your heart up to love and wondrous and grateful adventures that's what your heart is really seeking right now also if you feel like you're making the wrong decision in your life you're actually not your grind family own experiences anything that you feel like was a mistake is not a mistake and you are doing really great in your life right now I'm proud of you your guys are proud of you everyone is so proud of you don't be so hard on yourself please and also sometimes expectations can get in the way of what the universe actually has for us and it's best to let those expectations go what I want you to do is to take a shower or something that relaxes you maybe a bath or something like that and pretend like imagine in your head that all of like all this built-up like expectation and stuff you know we've been grinding towards just let it go let it flow with the water and you can act as like something that can actually cleanse you and move you towards where you need to go and then ask your guides and your angels whoever you believe in to actually help you through this change so there's something that has been testing you basically from your beliefs maybe there's something that you don't know you don't really know about you don't know why you feel you're towards a person right now this person you're actually led to them because you feel like what's the word you feel like they can really help you grow up into this process stick to this person because they're actually helping you from this transition to the next transition so something didn't work out and that's okay whatever it was whatever happened happened for a reason and something didn't work out maybe there was a heartbreak or breakup or something but I feel like there's Colin gravitation to get back together with someone I don't know but my message for you is that like you need to realize that does this person respect you does this person actually care about you does this person actually really want the best for you I think that's something that you really need to think about and knowing can figure that out except for you so listen to your intuition on this one um right now I just feel like you're cleansing your life and we some of you are still in the process some of you are out of that process it's really a transition of letting go what doesn't serve you anymore actually I feel like ten ten is the number that you guys should go look up I don't know you can see what that means for yourself hello yeah I don't have to say anything about this one y'all know what you need to do you guys need to get this on with you guys already need to do it I don't need to say anything okay all right and yeah basically some of you guys are writing a journal not in a journal something about gratitude that's great that's awesome they're just saying to keep up that's just all this is really okay so I hope you guys enjoyed that message I hope it resonated with you guys let me know if it's accurate for you guys or not and let me know if I was you know like hurt or whatever or if I wasn't feel great to dislike or whatever it's fine let's move on to pile number three which is the last reading what does Clara you're apt to say to you guys someone's been having bad dreams and they're coming to an end Claire would like to actually clear you from any of these bad dreams if you would like to okay somebody's already clear at the bad I hope she's cleared though bad dreams don't mean that yes so there we go any of our dreams and like anything any bad energy she's taking it away now so she said are you become whoever thanked her anything else Claire she that's it that's it okay good if he's a bad trouble sleeping G cleared it for you so you know she wanted to help you guys with that chase through your rinsed off actually ooh this is a very like dream themed actually um some of you guys have been having like dreams about stuff happening and I can be pretty spooky they can be on like on track like you know on point basically you guys know what this dream is though and some of you are actually wishing for something better to actually happen in your life there's something that you guys need to decide whether it's to actually leave someplace something that you were doing doing but you loved but now you're feeling like it's time to go a different direction but I can't really decide that for you I cannot confirm yes or no it's kind of like oh okay maybe you can go for it maybe not but it's really just up to you about this decision also there's people at work and different people around you I feel like people have judged you a lot and it's time to actually just see the best within other people although they haven't been the nicest to you I feel like there needs to be more forgiveness and hope to with different types of people and to cut out people who are just gossiping about your life about you you know I see em I see you guys actually moving on from whatever it is that is causing you great pain you need to finish what you've started and then move on to the next chapter of your life right now I feel like it's the best thing just to work on ourselves and just to do what makes you happy and to also exercise when you exercise it actually brings much new energy to you and it actually burns in our fun into your life it's a change and if you guys have been exercising even Bloor change up your routine a little bit something different I know that your dreams can actually come true anything that you think is impossible is actually possible you just need to get through and break through with these limiting thoughts and then there's grandparents and people watching over you oops sorry guys some may be physical and some may be spiritual looking after you they are encouraging you to keep on you guys know what you need to do I don't need to explain I really gotta live even progressing you get your boat on to what you need to need to tell you oh my gosh I'm long I'm like yo guys mothers just like you guys already know what you need to do okay oh my gosh and you guys look look you've been through all the readings haven't you you but I know someone out there has been through all these rings and like mmm is this is this really what I need to do yes yes it is go do it don't do it now you don't what are you doing live to your fullest look look live to your values okay just do it right it's just like just to it that meme just do it go live your dreams go do whatever you want to do go do it okay I ain't playing go do it again mm-hmm gosh I love my butt off guys I'm just like what the heck go do it go do he need to do right right [Music] it was really this energy of like laughter like people laughing at me but seriously like really really just look it look it okay this is your confirmation all right you guys are funny honestly I really love you guys seriously okay so I feel like there's a part of your life where I don't know like there's something that you do need to embrace and whether that is yourself or where you came from and stuff like that it's okay to get into those type of energy for who you are but don't let your past six don't leer past overrule you and who you are because their past doesn't define you it's your experiences and what you've actually learned from them and the new energies you need to let that flow through take it one day at a time because this is not something that you can rash actually really study on something whether it's chakras or Reiki energy someone's been wanting to get into that so really take your time to actually learn remember that how you feel is more important than you look right now especially with how you present yourself like don't worry about that just worry about we need to do in the here and now and also remember that even if you do mess up one day at a time you remember that like I just I don't know why I said that so automatically but I feel like I'm saying just like one day at a time right because if you like don't be so harsh on yourself you know like it's okay it's okay it truly truly is it's okay right everything is okay you don't need to be scary you don't need to be worried it everything's fine right I'm just like reassuring you right now because I feel like some of you are in a really fragile place right now and I really want to encourage you guys to really just start researching and learning and that's very important right so I don't have any setbacks they do not define you actually how you are as a person does right we live in this 3d world we live in these expectations right you need to learn to love yourself and give yourself unconditional love because essentially what you're doing right now isn't working for you it just is not working stop doing it write what you feel stop doing it don't do this what are you doing don't do this because of other people do it for yourself do it because you want to every like every every level of yourself is coming out right now different levels of yourself different versions of yourself different emotions different things this is how you're gonna heal okay somebody's been looking for clarity you need to go you need to be whatever you need to be and whatever you want to be just be whatever you want to be I'm gonna do song be a br so I don't know who I don't know who thought of that but just be who you wanna be right like Barbie says you know just she's been a doctor she's been uh soccer players she's been everything like literally so don't even worry about it right and Barbie can do it you can do it right you can do anything you could do anything that you want go ahead and do it okay I feel like that's all I needed to say to you for you guys all right that was the end of the reading my little pig wants to come here and say boy you know he's seeing hello and bye at the same time you know you lay a finger bang okay we're inside now me a little piggy [Music]", "kv212p-67t4": "hi this is Marty from Blue Lightning TV I'm going to

Bible study in the series the written word so tonight basically is going to be just the different types of Bibles and references they are there that I'll be talking about and then hopefully it can help you in deciding if you don't have already of Bible or what type or virgin and so on and so you could go ahead and move on with your studying your time with the Bible and what God so couple of father cleany or let me put my time on the video usual 45 minutes hope I'll take care that the second thing I want to tell you last last week I was if you saw I seemed very hot in here and thought it was the room but it's not the room it's just me I get hot is so today I brought my handy dandy tile and hopefully it won't be as bad so let's start with a prayer and then we'll go ahead and continue father God we thank you lord we take your father God that we live in a time father God where we are able to study your word father God that your word is easily accessible my lord father God and that father God there are no restrictions and what I mean is they even though they are countries that are not allowed to read the Bible they there's still no restrictions that gets nothing and me it might not be writing according to their government but we still have that accessibility and we thank you my lord I thank you Father God for this opportunity that I am able to bring forward father God and hoping that I touched someone father God to spend more time with you in your word in Jesus name Amen and amen alright so let us let us begin the last three classes we talked about first was revelation the the the Bible of the word was revealed to us the revelation then it gives us either once we read it what it revelations to us and the second one was the inspiration what the whole Bible says that the hope the the Word of God was inspired by God was this buyer as a breath for God we came to a setup of God breathed his word and then the third one was the the foundation of the Bible and then of course the different books and who wrote those and Eglin that was last week and then this week we're going to go ahead and stop I couldn't finish their series with types of the Bible and also the the reference of all the books that they help with reading of the Bible so the the first thing I want to talk to you is first of all that I do not sponsor any version or type of Bible that things like that and that I do not favor one or the other things like that I just is I use one for certain reasons because I like it and things like that I will we'll talk about later some words missing in Bible some verses and and some of the theories or the reasons why that's that that's there but I just want to give you an overview of the different types of Bible and hoping that you finally wanted to fall in love with one and that you get more into the word so the first thing that we want to talk about is the version version of the Bible just means to what they were translated to so you hear King James that it was it was translated to to a version that was talked at the time and then you hit verse another NIV versus New International Version which was translated or written in in that time period understand so they are hundreds of virgins out there and as we going to see right here in this illustrated book that I have better shows a some of the planning of versions that that we have so first this side here these on top and then what I want you to take particular intention into the lies they go up and down are for these manuscripts and other scrolls that were found after the that date 1611 1611 is important because 1611 is when the King James Version was published and it was it was written but it was written with these two agent scroll it says ancient version and ancient copies and because it was written from authorization copies was the Textus Receptus and that was written right before 1611 after 1611 some other versions was done but they they were combined with the old verses they were found and then also you will see that blue line that connects to these one which are earlier copiers and what they need my earlier copy was that they found these after 1611 but they came to find out they were older than those ones that all these other versions were copied off or were translated so you see the line going towards those new and you also see the Dead Sea Scrolls they were founded just a century ago lesson central in the Middle East and you see those they're both platforms of versions that we have now we would show here that a lot of these versions are pleasing to me are easier to regard what we want to say use of friendlies like the NIV the New King James Version the NLT neolite version the English standard version those are all different types of universal and they a lot more you also see here the the Holman Christian standard version which is now they took away the 8 is just a Christian standard version the message the different types of versions that you could pick from or you could stay with one of the older version which includes the revised version and the American Standard which we would think that the American Standard is a newer version but it's not the 1901 that it was written so and then of course you have the old faithful King James Version but it's kind of hard to read and most people but traditionally does the prefer one most of the theologians teachers and things like that to my experience so you kind of put different types of version and why delight do I say that let me bring this back here because they say this is the mother virgin the King James Version it is their original version and people stick to it and then what happens is that when these were great in there was some texts left down and there are some some fight over that why would these newer versions take out these texts well one of the reasons it's one of the current was that when they found these older scrolls and these older manuscripts they found out that actually the things that were taken out with never intended to be in there for some reason they were added in these other Scrolls they were found earlier but when the later ones were found the new versions were written and they left out those those verses and I'll give you a little of what those verses are they are actually four verses but there are plenty of words that were left out so the verses that are missing in the newer versions like the NIV the CBS the CBS CS and the NLT those those he had had those long and those these verses which is John 5:4 acts 8:37 first John 5:7 mark 16:9 to 20 no even though they don't have these these these verses in them you will see in the footnotes that they'll say a minute that it was taken out so in other words they they they do recognize that somewhere along the line it was placing it that they decided to omit them not by himself and by going by the original transcripts of the additional scrolls they were they were found so they did that let me give you an example of one day that was it was John 5:4 and it says don't find foreign parallel phrasing here that it went down to the to the pulpit Esther was a link of the tester all the lane they all gathered there because at a certain time they would he'll okay so then we'll jump to verse seven and it said that one named man asked to be taken down there before the water is birth okay so why was believed is described read the first seven and said wait a minute that's not in verse four or in verse five of this chapter so they added it on there and then in the King James Version you will see there it would say in the lake of over the pool but that's there the ages will come down or something will come down and start of the water which was never in the original text but described muster got that reference from two verses later on and said well as the named person mentions stirring on the water that must have been started on the water but the actual author though that does not mention it at all so that's one of the controversy but here's the thing the in the big scheme of thing they had the verses at the bottom if you're gonna go with a newer version they have the process at the bottom that says this was a minute and they'll give you a highlight and things like that and to me to me personally it doesn't take away of what the Bible is trying to say so go ahead and read the verse that you the version that you like there is many people come and ask me what version should I read which one is the best version to read and my reply to them is okay I'm gonna give you the secret but don't tell everybody okay my reply to to them and to you if you had that question is the version that will get you to read so whatever version that you will read that's the best version there is because it doesn't matter how good the version is to me if you not it is useless it is useless that that it's not the best for you so whatever that version might be it's up to you to pick pick one so that's why I say at the end of this class I'll mention that again that I recommend for you to uh to you know other believers all the Christians that have a Bible that's ma let me read your Bible for a second I just want to be a couple of passages to see what version they have and how it reads go to a bookstore it would be awesome no boo or a life weight bookstore which life where he has a nice seat and some of those bombs are no well you could read each purchase and try them and try each one of them to you see which one you would like one version that suits you or what person would you read more I remember when I first started I was down in San Antonio Texas and it San Antonio Texas on Broadway I was a street name Broadway they had to use bookstore about two blocks away from each other and I will go there and they did have Barnes & Noble back there on these how they know about it and I will go to these used bookstores and I will buy different versions on pine boughs because I'm getting for one dollar two dollars or the most eyespace pay for one was five dollars so I will get those and try to mouth and then I finally stuck to a couple of versions and the other ones I just donated it to brothers in and church better that's the way I did I kept trying out different versions to to go with to go to them now I will show you that each version you will see when you're buying them always you will see them on thee on the spine of the of the actual of the actual Bible like this is a CBS Bible this woman history or BC which stands for cleanup compare atonia so it means a recent thing about it on Levi manera is the equivalent to the King James in a man and then let me see if this only one has it which yes it does that you barely could see it and this one has you King James so that's where you could see what type of virgin or what virtue in this and also you could see it in the first three pages when you open up the Bible so I recommend that you go ahead in and every different types of words now I agree all this Intex here but I need to let you know that they are all online all these Bibles online actually they're free they have plenty of apps one of the Bible apps that I have is so you Virgin your person has an app that goes on your phone and it has all the persons that you want and that is a perfect way to test out each version that you that you would like to see and then also they have other helps on that application that worked wonderful all right so let's wait to be the different versions of the Bible now let's go real quickly if we can to the different types of Bible okay so the first type of viable is just a regular Bible a garrote no thrills no no no shell Bible in other words is a Bible they has the book it has diverse I mean the chapter and then the verse and that's it and you see has nothing else on there just the book the the chapter and E and the verse and this one I use for my nature if you want to say leisure reading I use this that one but I want to read everyday and the reason it is because it's just simple I just want to read the body we'll try every couple of years to read the Bible all the way through and then I just read it and that's number one on second reason it's in Spanish and I want to at least try to keep up with my Spanish so I read that as leisure that's my Spanish as my leisure reading one so I read that every day there's not my devotional Bible and it's not my study Bible is just for my Nietzsche reading don't know why I'm still here I haven't left the next one that I want to talk to you is it's called reference Bible it's called breakfast because it has references but not the reference that you might be thinking I just want to show you this this is a nice book cover than my sister shout-out to my sister and Buffalo New York she made me this cover this this Bible has references in other words it has the book this one is at the bottom of the page it has the book it has the chapter and then it has the verses but in the center references and what happens is that on the left side of page there will be some words of importance and they'll have a letter and in that letter you just look across from the top of the page view what that letter corresponds to and it will give you other verses that has that word or has that meaning or has that theme in it and it will give you sometimes they give you one or sometimes they give you two or three these are what they call reference and you will usually find them in the center of the page but sometimes you will find them in the bottom of the page this which you will see here in other words you see all the reference are here but over here they might have some little nose it's not a Study Bible yet but in this they have little notes but if you do find like I was telling you verse 5 for of man you it will be you will see a little star some kind of mark on here and at the bottom you will see the word of myth and the first it was admitted okay so this is reference it just reference you to a word either forward of the of the bottom behind it in where you else can find that word or that mean and this call a reference Bible the next one I want to talk to you it's a Study Bible now a Study Bible is great you want to do some study on your own prepare message or you want paper studies or if you just want to be more familiar with the Bible again it has the Bible the book name okay it has a chapter it has the the book name it has the chapter and then it has two verses it also has references like we saw in the reference Bible most of the study Bible have references the key word there that will have some place where else you could find find the word all the verses of that word but then also see here it will show a verse this one says 14 9 and then it'll give you a little commentary on that verse so it usually goes by verses not by word it goes by verses and sometimes it doesn't cover all the verses that they did you need so that is what unique about a study Bible that it has these to clean it has to a regular Bible has a reference and it has commentaries at the bottom this one crossing you that these commentaries are referenced to this here sometimes we get too involved in these commentaries and we love to read it because they're beautiful commentaries but remember that the focus and the meat of this bukas as the word of God is this was worried here this was inspired by God this here is man written these are just commentary to help us understand the Bible and different scholars and different people wrote these comments on him some Bibles at the end this one doesn't have it but some Bibles maps they have maps they have all the kinds of things on there they have a little bit of dictionary or in things like that and this one it has it at the beginning inside each chapter has man but if you go at the beginning of a book this is the book of a CEO it has an introduction to it it talks about the author and the time this was made and then it breaks down the book the chapter what is the main theme about that chapter so if I recommend that you get a a Study Bible so that way you could get more information buck to for like all the bad word okay the other one that I want to talk to you love and I'm sorry I don't have it confining one it's calling Thompson the same reference and what this gentleman did Thompson Chaney he decided to number every word in the Bible and then connect one to the other that word so in other words there if you get a word in the Bible you say this word here he had number two that word which was for 15 22 so he put 15 22 and then underneath that 15 22 what he did he wrote down when that word will appear again the next time moving forward and when it was a peer laughs moving backwards so that's why they call it the chain reference so in other words the word as you move forward it'll continue connecting all the way to the end of the Bible they see me and he might have done this while he was in prison but don't quote me on that because I might be thinking about somebody else the next one I want to talk to you about is the life application Bible and then I just had this one is called a life application Bible and of course it has the book the chapter and the verses and it also has commentary just like the other one but it has this unique feature that it talks about how that apply to you today how does that apply to you today and this particular one we are looking at first Corinthians chapter 1 chapter 10 is talking about making decision on sensitive issues so it talks about that Paul is reference on making decision about sensitive issues and back then it must have been about how the Jews are treating the Gentiles and things like that that they both for Christians but it talks about how does that apply to us today so that's what a like application does it is very good it has almost everything that a regular Study Bible had but it has an additional how is that applied to today and and it's very important because the Word of God that it was useful that is useful now and it'll be useful in the in the future and then it doesn't expire I hope everybody still with me the next one I have is called bilingual Bible and then of course I was born the interstate majority race in the States so I had a hard time with was Spanish so I got me a a bilingual what that does it has the verses in this case the verses are in Spanish first and then the identical verses on English so if they're they're just together in different language now when you find these here the the difficult thing to find on there is a reference you will not find where there's a bilingual one but it has a Study Bible that is bilingual or oh you you might find one that has reference for all of them if you do the reference are going to be very minimal and that's because sometimes the words in Spanish and English are not identical it's not translated for safe but this is one they're very helpful for me once I said in Spanish and they just do unique thing is then these here but it came in two versions on there which was the Canadian banana 60 which was a Spanish one and then the New King James but you will find them in different verses both in Spanish and in English different versions I hope that this is being helpful for you that then I could at least hope that you will buy now I bring back this is the bilingual one but I bring bad curses is basically format in the same way they have one Bible is called well Bible and what that is is a Bible that has different versions of in it so in other words you will see that it is similar to the the bilingual one where this one is in Spanish in English the parallel one is usually has four different or two different versions the one that I have that I can't find it has something like team James NIV and lt and then of course CBS it has four different versions of the Bible and it works great because you could see what each one is saying now I caution you when you are doing that that two reasons are cautioning number one is that they both relate to the same one even though some of the new versions are easier read some of the theologians and older pastors and things like that say they to water down and what they mean by that is that this the two water down there they might take something out of the original contents or the original intent of it and let me tell you it's not that there's something bad but you got to be understanding what the original text said let me give you an example I was once in the first Sun in San Antonio and the pastor asked me to read a passage I remember what the passage was but it read like something like this this says the spirit flow through him like a river of water okay so that's what the pastor wanted to convey and that's what his version read my person was in universe in his says the spirit of the law thrown through him like a stream of water so it's a lighter we're a stream but in that content a better a lot and the pastor was telling me what a stream I want to stream I wanna nice to Mississippi free only to you so that's way it can make a different that's not one number two is that something we got to make sure that they were portraying that it makes it easier to what God is trying to say not what I am trying to say so in other words I might find a person there oh yeah this is a second one and what I am is trying to sing with it it's not really what God is trying to say so that's what we got to be careful what version - - to use once we get to that point there so that was the parallel version it has different types I mean the parallel Bible that has different types of version and things like that and then the last one I want to talk to you is they call a minister by move only note Bible and what this does is if you find him and nobody will minister by would you would you you you probably won't find too many references or notes at the bottom and all this does is it has a plethora of space both on each side of the verses and also on top and for that reason is so you could make your notes on there so if you see here this is the book of romance and I must have had a class or preaching on a book of Romans in our notes I might not some notes in and I encourage you the right note mark it all up whatever it takes to bring a nitin into your life go ahead and Mark it or up I used to also not go by notes I will memorize a sermon and I were right here on the side when is my next point and what verses to use so that's why probably why they courted mince the Bible but this is great for writing notes on there that way you don't have to have this journal or something else to to write on there okay I'm almost done all I want to do now is to talk to you about Oh different references that you could use with the Bible or with just studies and things like that the first one I want to talk to you about the commentaries this is a man field and I mean Matthew Henry commentary he goes to uh every uh every chapter and this is just one book that it had some here and this one here he's talking about Psalms 34 he just writes first after worst commentary for each set of verses on there and his own book he's a real good in handy now they also have a spa Satori commentary which meals that they expose more they expand on certain items look how thick this book is and it has commentaries on the holy covers Romans and Galatians that's the only ones that cover and why is that because they provide more commentary than men who did on that whole Bible it's about the same size but this one just dedicates itself to just the two books so you had different types of commentaries on the on that you go 500 for your Bibles the next one that I want to talk to you about just a glow Bible dictionary if you can get your hand on a good Bible dictionary that is great it's very very important to find out the definition of a word and it what it means in the biblical term in the Christian term not only in the and it's good to have both this universe that you could compare to offer them this particular dictionary that only has definitions and where in the Bible you can find it has different verses on there but it also has pictures on here that you could and some dictionaries good Christian a good Bible dictionary is very important to to have the next reference I want to talk to you about it's called a components and the audience is that strong component was written King James Commission French strong to God and put all the verses together in other words not to combine at least to put them all together and what this gentleman did is he he made this this this component and this component from A to Z and then if you pick a word when you find a word and in particular verse you look for that word and then you look at where you found that for that that that word because it might need something different in a different verse so you do that and then for there you look at the number that he assigned to it and from there whether it's in the Old Testament New Testament you go in the back here and he has he has the definition you are in Greek and what that word means in there so joy concordance is it's good to have this one says concise and what concise is it's just half of it he just did half other of the words in there oh he just didn't put the definitions of it he just put the groupie to the word and where you can find them I want to go through the different other this three other books that I want to talk to you about it's the first one is it's called Hades Bible handbook Hades Bible handbook but it's just a summary of each chapter of the Bible so then you check the one of lemon taste it will have a subject and then it will explain it and then they'll go to chapter 2 and it says God's anger and it will explain and this one is lemon taste in chapter 2 and you explained that was happening in that chapter so we continue on this was my first firsthand book that I use when I started studying the Bible it's very inexpensive very simple to read and very good I recommend this to anyone this is a new beginner and starting to to read the Bible or to study the Bible also there are also other brands on there other names that you can find on there just when you go to search go goo goo you go ahead goo goo Bible handbook and then there's almost the last one I'll talk to you about this is called a ministers handbook and then what handbook has it has preaching or ceremony for different types of vacation and what it does it just gives you different if you need to preach on a certain topic it will give you a small a preaching on guideline preaching and you could use that as your base I got this because it helped me before when I was preparing a funeral or a wedding or some kind of a child other kinds of services that you don't particularly get in any school anything like that and it shows you this one is in Spanish but they have it in English and it's usually just to two small books and they also have one you want to talk about on special occasions and then like the toughest ones is like a funeral and then you know you say well funeral was a funeral now you have a funeral for a for a non-believer you know you still have to speak but your job there is to bring souls to Christ not to harp on he wasn't unbeliever or something hard if you have a funeral of a of a baby or a young child that's tough that is something that you need help that you just can't come up with so the minister handbook was very handy for me and father and some of these things that I had to perform to mark that I want to talk to you as the other one says Bible studies and you find a clever of Bible studies either are copies or online and things like that and I think Bible stories are great but be careful before you buy it open it up and read it because most of the lot of the Bible stories I see you they talk about a topic or they talk about a chapter in the Bible and they just read about a couple of sentence and then they ask you what are you thinking you have a whole bunch of blank space to write down what you think about this horse about this verse and then that is just you reading and writing down instead of then giving you information so be careful what - right there if you gotta get a Bible study and actually get something where they talk they lab rate on that subject or on that verse and then they give you the opportunity to write down as to speak about that and then the next thing I want to talk to you about is on the Christians use on the Christian Science as reference as I told you before whether it be let them ask them about let me see your Bible what do you think of this version and things like that or if you have a particular question you know just ask them ask him where does it say in the Bible what does it mean and things like that don't be scared to use are the Christians or ministers to ask them questions and then a good minister or good Christian would will tell you the answer and if he doesn't know she doesn't know the answer they'll let you know for sure hey I don't know the answer and I definitely don't want to tell you a make up story things like that that being said I just want to tell you that here and I'm signing that all the ministers are available for any questions that you have if you need help picking a body buthow help we will all hope you pick a Bible just comment access and then we'll be here if you have any questions on this chat down below go ahead and put your question there I look at the video again during the week and I'll go ahead and answer your question if not someone from church would say there was some question asked can you please answer that and that being said done that's all I have for today I do ask you for your prayer because we'll start a new series but it'll be in in two two weeks so next week and the week after that I don't have a topic yet but I'll come prepare for for one or if you have any suggestion please write in the intersect for the next two weeks if you want any particular subjects spoken about Christian something biblical subject I'll be happy to to entertain that and then after that we'll go ahead and start both in Spanish and in English the book of Acts so until then until next week god bless you thank you for being with us and just know that there's an old saying in Spanish they said hey I'm an agape that means we love you for free god bless you", "vXKsydcpEoA": "sono itami monotone EMU more data so now hey is Rizal here welcome back to my Channel today I have a huge Korean makeup

before we age them because yeah we need to go ahead and get that done and over with and I'll bite over him as well so moist I've never seen this I don't think I don't I've never really played with the painting scale in this game like i always do cooking logic I actually have been getting more into photography and gardening gardening is one of my favorites but I really want to use gardening with cooking because I never do that I never do that but I really want to I might record another part and just like hello this let's play just because I feel bad about this Park has kind of been not a very good part but because of how bad and laggy it is so I think I'll don't go ahead and do that because I know a lot of you guys you really love this Let's Plays and I think that's so funny cuz this is a let's player I I mean I take a serious but like to an extent because it's a busy baby times like you know Todd this office is so cute like I probably should have put on like black pants that been

come over clean that up yes he'll come over so we'll go ahead and woohoo with him before we actually do anything else because we just really really need to get that done our Yellow Sun girl you are all righty so it sounds like he's here so let's go ahead and it's arrived for baby with Eduardo Helena hers is worth thirty three samolians so that's awesome good job girl and I've never seen this painting before it's like a dog drinking from the water that's cute then saw that I'll probably keep her around for a little bit after she ages up into a young adult because I do want like a painter around actually because I really encompass want to see those you know that I'll get Avery under way I don't know why don't just get her into it does she have the paintings girl she doesn't all right

especially make sure that there's no more over here there is there's some more go go catch him girl what are you sure you can be a zoologist he's actually loved before the paintings go so maybe I'll leave him or keep him around because he's leveling up I feel like a lot faster and Plus this is something I can see him like actually wanting to do because he is like a little loner so okay there anymore I don't think there's any more right now so she is gonna take her little booty to the science facility and donate both of those and then she'll go home eat do her homework or maybe she'll probably do our homework tomorrow actually in his maybe it's worth 115 small lines it's awesome good job bud we'll sell that and what do you want to do paint something worth 150 some lines we'll have

breaking and they're not applying this trip properly so if you're not applying this trip properly it's not gonna come out it's gonna suck so I'm tired of seeing that and I'm gonna show you how to do it the correct way now for this one I have four major key points the quality of the wax that's you're using you want to make sure that the wax is heated to the proper temperature and you need to prep the area correctly and then the last one is how to actually apply it which I'll show you all of that now first one quality of wax so I as you know if you've been following me if not welcome but I use starkville I just switched over from Meriden to Starkville I've been extremely happy with the way that the wax works and the effectiveness of it so if anyone has not tried out before check that out too there's also a link down there that you can go direct to their website and look it up but they're awesome and so if you used even Bearden and Sarah pill is another one that it's very similar to you'll black star pill as well so for this video demonstration you'll see me use star pills blue film hard wax which has been my favorite so quantum axis extremely important I have tried all kinds of waxes I've ordered from random websites online even Amazon and it really does make a difference if you get a low quality wax it's gonna break on you no matter what it it's it's a nightmare to work with and doesn't pull out the hair and it's gonna hurt your client and they're not gonna go back to you which is the whole point we're trying to make money here so quality waxed is the number one key thing you have to get a good quality wax now you will need to make sure that that wax is heated correctly that's not heated correctly it's not gonna perform how you want it to so if the wax is too hot you're gonna burn somebody and potentially take their skin off with it when you pull it off and that's not good if it's too cold it's not gonna be able to adhere to the hair um which means it's not gonna come out which is also bad so for hard wax you want to get the consistency close to either like honey or molasses I'll kind of show you a little demonstration for how to know when it's the right temperature before I wax a client after I heat it up I always test it out on myself first I'll do a little you know strip on the back of my hand or something like that on my arm just to make sure that it's at the perfect consistency so that I know I'm gonna get the results that I need so for the right the right consistency I'll show you what it should look like now I'll test it this way I'll get all the wax on one side of my wax stick and I'll hold it upside down like that so you'll see it you'll see um it does move but it moves slowly so it's not all just gonna it's not dripping off automatically which is exactly what you want that's the perfect consistency and if it's too hot gonna burn you're fine if it's too cold it's not gonna come out how you want it to the next thing prepping the area so that it is clean and sanitary for you to work with for all of us you know dirt makeup sweat all of that stuff it's gonna affect your wax as well so you need to prep your clients that you know their skin is ready to accept the wax you're gonna put on it um so you got a clean cleanse the skin first some kind of cleanser after that I always put on some type of oil I use sesame oil but I forgot their own preference but that just add an extra barrier between your clients skin and the wax and then depending on what it is if it's some Brazilian real really only if it's a person or underarms - then I'll just put a little bit of baby powder that helps add any you know sweat or anything like that your clients nervous it's gonna get rid of it if it's brows face arms legs I don't use baby powder because it just doesn't make sense but especially a Brazilian bikini underarms I always just a little bit and that's again one more little barrier between your clients skin in the wax so the actual waxing process let's see how to apply it pressure you need to make sure you're using the right amount of pressure if you're not pushing hard enough it's again you're not gonna be able to get to as close to the skin as possible so it's gonna snow bears and it's not gonna come out so pressure is key I promise you unless you're like digging in their skin you're not gonna hurt them they'll be fine so pressure and making a smooth edge which I'll show you a irrational suit right now having a smooth edge is going to allow the wax to be pulled off in one smooth strip so that it's not breaking and cracking all over you so let's show you an example all right see if I can get this in the camera here so first chip always goes with the hair growth cycle so my arm hair goes this way so I'm going to apply it upwards so can you see this with pressure we're gonna go up and curve the top and make a lip at the end and then come back and make sure that that edge is smooth so as I got waxed what I'm reading in here um okay so you look at this strip you'll see the edges here are nice and smooth there's not um you know what do you call it uh they're not really thin that's one of the biggest things that if the edges are too thin when you pull it at the top it's gonna just go all over the place it's not going to come off in one strip also making a lip at the end so for a lip you just add a little bit extra wax at the end right there so that when you pull it off just like that it's gonna come in one smooth piece that's really important for making sure that your wax chips come off perfectly and then making sure that you're also not making the wax too thin if it's too thin then it's gonna break it's just inevitable so when you pull it off just like that it comes off at one pretty strict um anyway so I'll show you again so this was the first chips and then we would do a clean up technically that would be next now clean up same thing kit I'll relax on one end of the strip we're gonna go in the opposite direction so get all the wax off start at the top come down apply pressure do it again make my lip at the end and then come back up just like that it's perfect so again one more time applying pressure making sure that your edges are nice and smooth and then making your lip at the bottom now the biggest thing I see for these ugly strips that people do online actually show you an example of what it looks like just so that you can understand what I'm talking about okay let's see if I couldn't do this here we'll go upwards so people will they'll literally just go up no real or to what they're doing they just try to all pull it up in one way so that it's all frayed like that you see how thin that is and how ugly that looks since I'm even compared to this one don't do this you're not gonna be happy with the result do it like this it's gonna look much better yeah it's gonna come off in one pretty strip now this one we'll see how this turns out this is probably gonna hurt yep because there we go okay and this is gonna happen too so you have all these little wax bits left over which thing is to go back and attempt to get off which is going to be really difficult so don't do it it's a perfect example of using a high quality wax but applying it incorrectly it's not going to come out the way you want it to so before you do any kind of tutorial or really have like an honest opinion about a certain type of wax or anything like that make sure that you're applying it the right as I promised it will change your let's so that's that's pretty much it they'll view the questions or anything let me know but apply pressure have smooth edges make your lip at the end and then apply in the direction of the hair growth and you will be golden so any other questions let me know guys I'm always happy to answer for you to drop a comment and I'll them I try to answer them within 24 to 48 hours I'll do my best if not just doesn't busy but I'll try these so phone number here is five one two five zero one two seven six seven thanks for watching bye", "QjtZePHKKDI": "welcome to the detailing show thanks for joining us for this episode if it's your first time with us be sure to subscribe and tick that belt notification icon so you can stay up to date with what we're doing here at tranquility base detailing in this episode we're going to take a look at immaculate reflections wax we are going to check out what not to do with fallout remover let's put it that way we're going to take a look at my top tips for cleaning door shuts and your engine bay but first we're going to take a look at car tech check it out so car tech what can I tell you and they're a Dutch firm as sort of origin goes there is a new UK arm of that firm their website is car tech retail code at UK if you do want to check them out they are as a firm as a company they are a worldwide brand at this point they deal in a lot of countries too a lot of manufacturers BMW UK for example Ferrari in China so they're with some big players so they must be doing something right to try and spread the name however in the UK they were selling some sample sets and basically as long as you covered postage so it made it like five-pound all in for what you saw in this video and I'll go through them one at a time and then I'll give my summary my thoughts at the end we start with a shampoo the shampoo is called splash and you'll see as you've just seen there I used a lot the dilution ratio on it was suggested was a hundred to one and now we're you bear in mind that the last shampoo I reviewed was bright Max's pure max which was a dilution of two thousand to one you can see that obviously that is a very very low dilution ratio and I spent a car take on this sent a quick message and said you know what's the deal is this norm and it's possible to you this is a snow foam and it's actually listed as a snow foam on their website but it's aimed really it because it's a high wax content as a quick maintenance wash type of product and not really so much of the detailing market side of things so they said yeah this is what it is but maybe they're going to think about looking at the labeling and dealing with that because we're kind of expecting more at this point for what we do the next product to use after that was the wheel cleaner now this one took me by surprise in the when you receive a 200 mils sample size of a product kind of expected to be ready to use I didn't expect it to be the full strength as yet to be diluted nostril hair burner that it was this thing was very potent it's very pungent as I started to spray it apply it to this wheel here the cloud of gas it was it was the sort of thing that you could smell in it kind of you know took your breath a little bit so as a note to you guys if you're gonna be buying this stuff in and it should be diluted down and in fact once I diluted it down and still did a great job but it was far less aggressive on the nostrils as well and but yet the full-strength did a great job of shifting everything was on there naturally diluted down did a good job as well but it gives you that option of using it at different ratios which a lot of modern wheel cleaners tend to give you nowadays as I think that's the right thing for them to do once I've done that with this being a darker color you guys will know with darker paints if you apply an iron fallout remover which you should and it doesn't really show you much of a significant change or that it's working and even if it is so I applied it on the wheels the wheels are you there sprinkling let's call it they're not being done since the other side of winter they do need to be brought up to speed I can tell you what the iron remover adds slight more of a gel viscosity than a water type of viscosity so it clinged for a good amount of time it cleaned well and I would say two hits and this way would be where I want it to be I'm going to show you the close-ups in a second which is from one hit that will clean a one hit of the eye remover you see the odd black Fleck on there so like I said I think second it would have taken care of that no problem but again another product that works for them it does smell like an iron foil remover so they're not trying to add anything in terms of scent or or that type of additional thing which is becoming more common with these iron fallout removers nowadays after that went onto the wash procedure this is what battery failure looks like just there and so that's a lesson for me the shampoo in terms of actually in a wash process you can tell it's laying a little bit of protection down so it changes the water characteristics again I've covered off the dilution part that's really my only concern with that as a product after that went to the wheel clicks re the glass cleaner the glass cleaner it didn't flash off massively quickly which when you're outside in heavy heavy sunshine is a positive and you get certain cleaners that will and you know have an immediate flash time or a high quick flash time this isn't one of those and it's to its benefit when you are working outside of working in heavy temperatures and I paired it with the clean glass shine and it did a fantastic job of cleaning up all the glass so again another one does a solid job it's ticking the box therefore it once I've done that went on to and I frankly were to finishing products in the Box in the kit so they have the gold wax which I'm using here and they had a quick detailer so recover the wax first it's a very very fluid product nice shaking so you can see does separate but as I was applying it and a polished car tech I run out of clean applicators on the day so I tend to microfiber cloth and you basically smear it on it's like a water it's very similar to Auto glooms extra gloss protection so it's just a very thin water like fluid which makes for application very very quick and it claims you won't leave any white marks on any of the trim tested that I can vouch for that and but very very speedy to apply it you can see here and it flashes off very very quickly as well what you can see just on the quarter panel there and as far as effort involved with this type of product it is minimal and I really do mean minimal and far easier to apply than paste wax or anything like that in terms of once it's flashed off which as you can see as quick as it is when you actually come to buff it very very effortless no dusting no powder or anything like that but it doesn't really doesn't give you any resistance there's no drag to removing it so when you do come to that removal process speed is the main sort of selling point for this product the finish it's not the sharpest it is clean is you know sort of a glossy type of product but I'm kind of again used to I may have considered the last wax that I'd used was an out show wax it didn't provide that type of finish but again it's not a detailing products of a lighting product really that they're aiming for after I've tried this particular product the next one for me time ago of was their quick detailer now this is something that's kind of in translation a little bit the the quick detailer is called a glaze and it's not a glaze in this sense that it's going to fill or add anything to it in that respect it is a quick detailer out and out but it claims that it will offer no wax Holograms so I thought I'd test that in terms of applying it to a hot panel direct sunlight direct sunshine and it worked it worked well in terms of what it was claiming what it said it would do the beading this is for gold wax here you can see it's left some protections not the strongest beading we've seen but pretty much that's that's all I can tell you about the range in terms of the individual products I used in summary what can I tell you and I think when you try these you need to bear in mind that they're aimed at a trade at about a market so the finishing product they lack the finesse they lack that sort of polish detail that we come to expect some detailing products so they're not you know they don't have a perfume scent that they're not about sort of that all of those elements of that enjoyable spectrum of detailing what they are all geared towards doing is speed effective efficient job and they all nail it in that respect so in terms of the bits I can and can't recommend can I recommend the wax and the quick detailer yes if what you need is volumes speed and ease of use can I recommend the other products where I would like to refer to the utility products yes they are potent pungent diluted bull and they all did a great job so if you're a valid err your you know in the trade you're looking for a new angle and no Avenue that's maybe not an auto smart or Auto glim trade range give car take a look in I think a lot of the products will work well for you if you're after an out-and-out Detailers experience then maybe the finishing products won't be for you links are below check them out so hope you enjoyed that look at car tech the links below if you want to check them out just have a look in the description below on to the next part before we go to the next part once to touch base with you guys on a topic I lift topic a point which is when I see reviews written nowadays not in all of them but it comes up quite a lot this wax which is way above its price point or this wax which is way above this way kind of get what people are saying by disagree wholeheartedly with really the execution of a sentence saying as a method of measuring wax really at a point when waxing was a cheaper rudimentary thing I'm going back a few decades you know really before my time I understand that you know when these big booty waxes came along and these guys that were able to produce a wax that is nice to you they left a crisp finish you had to pay a premium for that but now with the modern explosion of the homebrew left and these people are willing to go to the lengths of testing and such dedication to refine the product though right now and once it's put to market I think no longer is this is same as applicable I think there are a lot of things that can go into a wax that define the cost ensure experience is one of them and ease of use and a good finish should come as standard if you've got your wax to a point of really putting it to market so all that's really left is paying for the experience of that person the actual presentation of the wax so you know naturally a glass jar is going to cost more than a plastic pot so there's things really you know ingredients another one that will always affect the cost but if it works is 20 pounds and does a great job I wouldn't describe it as punching above its weight or punching above its price point I'd merely say that it's in Nice wax at a bargain price without in mind take a look at this this is from immaculate reflection they produce a fantastic smelling range of waxes and if you ever look in the link below you see exactly what I mean on this occasion I just happen to try the one that was scented as Palmer violet check it out woohoo another wax review you guys know I love waxing you know love review waxes and this one is something which I'm quite enjoy in terms of when I announced or put the picture of that how to wax immaculate reflection that a few of you guys came back and said to me I've not heard of them and that's a good thing and we can change it and we should change it and the links will be below for them immaculate reflection is mark he produces a range of waxes which they're all the same wax that there are soft wax but they're all different scent based on classic sweetie shop flavors and so when I spoke to him about purchasing one of his waxes he said what sense for you and for me I went to the Parma violets one because I love me some Parma violets and I have to say the smell did not disappoint it ticked that box massively and I think if you're going to pin your range on a theme that is that type you need to nail the sense and if you have a look through the other sense that he produces they all sound like they would smell fantastic and based on what that experience with this one I would say they're probably well the product itself comes in a hundred mil plastic pot the labeling on it is really eye-catching is really nice the wax itself is very soft and very oily so loading applicators very straightforward and applying it to the paint is a breeze it's a sort of application if you've tried it a Victoria wax concours so it's oily it doesn't really seem to cure so when it came to buffing you see I'm using a tattoo towel method hiss that's a shorter pile in this case a whoa-whoa towel to to break the back of the wax to kind of take off the the weight of what's there and then I'm using the car probe over here to buff to finish and I really really like this one it did a couple of things for the paint for me it darkened it to a point um and it really brought the flake out a massively so in terms of when I was applying it were on a very hot down this about 23 degrees on the day and we're in the direct sunlight so the curing bit took me a little bit by surprising that it didn't really cure but I left it I think I mean I've kept checking out I think we're at about 18 minutes before I thought I'm just can buff this and see how it goes and see if it plays me you know any silly games maybe I could have left it longer and but you know it's sort of that 18 20 minute mark I thought I'd giving it enough and then I ran just the quick water test which is what you're seeing here and this was after the first coat and naturally you guys know I like to put a second coat on where I can so I went for the second coat got it all applied buffed and then this was really sort of it's going to cycle through the finished shots and sort of the the flake that had brought out the paint or not I really really liked it I really loved it the experience the smell on it was tremendous and the ease-of-use was there and the ease of removal you know the fact you have to use to cross not the end of the world it doesn't make it the easiest to remove and but it's by no stretch and difficult wax to buff off but if you do not use the double cloth setup I think you might chase a few wax Holograms if you're not careful but it's like so it's not difficulty to really do that and the Finnish folks slick I'd say slight darkening effect this carbon black paint Basij technically a dark blue and but the main thing the flitter brought out of the paint I thought was tremendous went on to testing the water behavior and actually beaded really really well so again this is after the second coat and this is just a run around the beading so the beads around they're relatively uniform quite tall not the strongest beads but it again was another thing that it did really really well and you know I was I was pleasantly surprised with I was really really happy with that as a finish as well all in all the links below I'm going to tell you that this is a bargain wax for 20 pound I want to echo what I said in the car this is the sort of thing that I enjoy about waxing it was a pleasurable experience and it left a really nice finish and it only cost me 20 quid and I got the joy of kind of picking through a laundry list of sweets from my childhood and you know if you're 30-plus years old I think you get a kick out of going through their shop and seeing what they actually do have and what is available and pick the one that appeals to you you'll not be disappointed and be confident of that if you do have any questions before you buy reach out to marques reachable on Instagram of the social medias and he seems a very approachable guy that's all I can tell you about that one if you guys have any questions about Immaculate reflection shoot them below I'll be happy to answer them if not buy one yourself thanks very much hopefully enjoyed that look at immaculate reflections wax the links below as I've said in case you want to look into older and I got links say this is Luke Luke has dirty wheels Luke's decided that spraying them down with pressurized water to remove the vast majority of surface dirt is just too efficient for his liking haven't you made he's also decided that wheel cleaners are just too boring we have a product for Luke that product is fallout remover that's right something that's not actually wheel cleaner that can be used as such if you want your in a four year old to stand back as you clean your wheels and go ooh bright and purple you should spray a lot of this on your wheel but make sure that the wheel is really really dirty and in no way been pre rinse with water if you want the purple east reaction you can get then be sure to film this purple reaction and post it online so all of your friends mates and possible brand loyal fans can see just how fantastically pointless but colorful this is as a wheel cleaner after you've done that be sure to rinse off all of the perfectly goodness and stand back and admire on a wheel cleaner costing ten or even twenty times less than fallout remover could have done but without the purple shenanigans but whatever you do do not grab your camera and zoom in and assess if it is flawlessly clean just hope that people take for granted that it looks shiny from a distance do not after you've zoomed in rub your finger across patches just to see if there's any remaining debt because what you will find is that you have a copious amount of surface dirt that it hasn't removed for example once you've decided that this is the product for you however though you should find other uses that it is equally as pointless and expensive to do don't worry I've gone to the trouble of doing that for you did you know for example it is really crap at cleaning your sink just spray liberally stand back as nothing happens and then rinse it away with a lot of that really cheap it's boring water stuff that we mentioned earlier check this out who needs gifts done you can also use it as a really really pointless plant feed now I know what you're thinking point this just kill your old man's tree yes yes it will but he's going to be on holiday for at least a fortnight so he won't find out I was going to suggest using it to toast a birth or a wedding but do not do that use the proper product instead I hope you enjoyed that look at what not to do with fallout remover if you guys enjoyed that you want to see more of the same let me know let me know what topics you want me to cover and I'll put those into production for future videos Before we jump onto the last part which is my top tips cleaning your door shuts and your engine bays I just wanted to share the team TBD part for this episode which is I'm going to divide the car tech kit into a couple of portions and I'm going to send those out to you guys if you answer the question correctly at the top of the comments section below I do need to stipulate I need you guys to be uk-based just for what I am posting that is a necessity for me one upcoming participant or at least an upcoming channel is SC detailer and I put a link there for them check them out it's Sean we've already spoke gone and I and Sean's going to send me some stuff in my direction for me to try and I'm going to send some bits to him so this is my way of putting team TBD in action it's not just with you guys for this other youtubers and UK Detailers well so check Sean out he's doing great work if channel is new it could do with a few more subscribers on to the final part I want to thank you very much for watching the detailing show check back again for future videos take care bye bye so on to the final part of the show this is how I tackle my door shuts and engine bay mine are pretty well kept so you know I'll approach these and do these often enough but I think the tips within really will work for you guys if you get them up to this standard but equally speaking if you need to get them there they will work just the same if necessary start with rinsing them so you know get your pressure washing get all the loose marker off and out of the way once you've done that a good liberal spray with an all-purpose cleaner I'm using the auto glanders infinite and then basically I take that with a brush you're trying to get into all the type work the smaller nooks and crannies first a step I then followed that up with is always with a mitt says clean coria's twist admit that I'm showing you here and does a great job for these purposes because it holds enough water without sort of drenching insides of the doors but the mitt is going to deal with the bigger flatter surfaces you wouldn't clean all of the outside of your car with a brush so I don't see why the door shirt should be any different and then just rinse that all away that's going to take care of the weight of what's going on be sure then to dry it thoroughly if you do have a blower or a dryer of that sort use it in this particular case it would be an absolute godsend I don't have one of those but if you do use it then it's on to dressing so dressing for me the one I'm showing in this videos car propel I've been a big fan of big advocate of it for a long time it does a fantastic job on plastics and rubber so it will basically deal with what you're going to find in your own door shuts so I'd recommend that as a product for you guys because it leaves a really nice dressed look but it's not shiny not greasy it's not in-your-face once you've been around with a pearl you then need to protect the paintwork so I've used Auto Glenda's smooth velvet for this purpose because it is fantastic for that spray onto the cloth again don't want to be spraying it onto the paintwork direct because we're trying to just manage to not over spray onto bits we've done already apply it to the cloth you'll be more controlled in your application then wipe everything off and this is what you should be left with you should be left with a nice glossy finish on your paint no dirt no splashes or anything like that and nice black and dark and trim pieces that aren't greasy that aren't in your face personally for me this is the way I want mine to look if you want the same sort of finish follow those steps and you get there it takes very little effort and really very difficult time to get this this bit up to speed then on to engine Bay's is you can see from a distance doesn't look too bad up close I've got leaves in the gutter so take care of the big debris first and now a lot of video show pressure washing of the engine bays I've never been overly comfortable with mine in terms of like blasting a lot of water in there and I won't do it that you know a terrible disservice if me I've always just felt more comfortable this so tools of choice those are called spouts brushes by some of their pennies on eBay a wheel brush that's car Kem's wheel brush have used that for my engine boat for a while that's auto glooms wheel brush which you can also buy some coordinate blaster and they're the same thing and just a detailing brush just the same you may need one or all of those brushes but I would recommend certainly the spout brushes I think they're a fantastic little tool for very little out like and then it's much in the same so apply the all-purpose cleaner agitate it for me I've got you know general crust of dust and dirt and whatnot but then what I do with my engine bay and I've always felt better than doing it this way than drenching it is I'll have a bucket of water and and then just dip my microfiber in come back to each section I'm working on and then just run around get it wiped down and then just let it dry naturally that way and it's going to take all that all-purpose cleaner away but I'm not putting copious amounts of water into the bay just in case you don't have anything delicate that's exposed or anything like that and then just be methodical work round pick your sections I always start top airbox and then it's sort of down to and you know sort of that section the right-hand side for me down to sort of the air intake and so on and then once you've done that surface part look a bit deeper into the engine bay should be amazed the difference it makes and that's where you use your brushes so good wheel brush like the car cam one I've shown you earlier it would do a great job of getting down into all the little nooks and crannies and you'll see here it makes a big difference in terms of just getting that bit as far as you can reach clean as you know people will look down there and if there's sort of that tide line of oil up to a point it's going to draw the eye more so than just a completely dirty engine bay the next tip is this get your metal polish out I don't understand why people don't write don't really see this I don't see people touching up these small parts of the engine bay you're going to have some exposed metal elements why not have them shine why not have them pop is they are going to be just small little details and it's amazing that when you don't do it you don't really notice it of not being done or anything like that but when you do them they then draw the eye and they just give it that bit of extra pop in your engine bay that just the small bit of that 1% the thing that they were looking for in detailing so get around with your metal polish get ended everything and anything that can be cleaned up done so you know if it's tube a pipe a Jubilee clip or just you know a nut on the head of the engine do it it will make a big difference a small investment of time it really is a marginal outlay and it will just give that finishing touch that last little piece to the puzzle is for me the biggest tip I could I could give us is get the metal work than just the same side don't see a lot of videos when in fact I've not seen a video where people do the engine bays where they even mention it and after you've done that you should be in a position where things are clean and they're ready to be dressed so again for me I'm out with a car propel it is a dilute bull dressing I've always just used it neat on the engine bay and I just apply direct to the cloth and wipe it into the areas that do need to be dressed and it gives me a gain is a darkened dressed look but it's not greasy and wet and you know so that wet looks shine that you can get with some dressings but you again for me at least it gives me the finish that I want you may want to make your own judgements as far as your own dressings of choice I mean have a look at this you can see you can tell it's being dressed but it's not not loud it's not in-your-face it's you know there's close to factory / dressed as I really want it to look and I think it just finishes it all off nicely again be methodical work there's no point missing parts of this so you know it's going to draw the eye if you've missed a part but I'll always do the same just work round methodically make sure you get up onto the scuttle as much at the top that you can get as well because it gained that's part of the engine bay don't miss it and kind of take care of it in other parts of your car cleaning regime because again it will draw the eye when that bonnet is open if you've not got to sort of all this top part here once all the dressing has been done you then need to take care of the paint so underneath my engine bay BMW were good enough not to lacquer a bloody thing under there which is really nice it means I can't really get any shine to it doesn't mean it shouldn't be protected go so game outcomes smooth velvet if you've got a painted engine bay again small details like this you may want to go the whole hog I don't with my cos no point but use you know a pre wax get a good finish on there then get some something of a wax element on there or spray wax or a quick detailer and is worth doing and then this is basically what you're left with a nice crisp clean finish and as close to factory as you know really I think you can get it is if you really stick your head into the bay it's dirty and oily where you can't reach and that's really my approach to clean an engine bay is it is as clean as it can be as far as I can reach into that base so use the tools that are appropriate that are applicable and you get this finish here and for me it is well well worth it and it doesn't take you too long you know all told stick a few hours into doing your engine bay and it would look good I've been as I was kind of filming this and I'll be as honest as I can you're going to see here in a second there is some rust so just there in that mount and you know it just showing you this car is 15 years old at this point so it's not perfect but I've kind of wanted to dwell on that just to show you guys that the small bits they can get hidden in if you do the rest of it so get 99% of it right and you're almost kind of forgiving that small small detail at the end that's everything thanks very much for watching if you've got any questions on my tips and tricks for cleaning the engine bay shooting below that's the end of the detailing show episode two take care bye bye

"nSqGc8Vc6vc": "[Music] Thomas year and welcome back to another video so today I'm back here for another mansion built and today we're going to go ahead and create my dream mansion so if you like to go ahead and download this for yourself it is up on the gallery now my origin ID is real Thomas TV one so I'm lying again by seams up on the gallery because I haven't even finished the house and I'm kind of recording this like two weeks in advance as well which I'm going to explain about in just a second and but this is actually a viewer suggestion and by and I'm gonna definitely mispronounce this name because I have no idea how pronounce it but it's like cha chubb H I think and they actually submitted well suggested this idea in the comments a little while ago actually on the Maxum mansion build and which is I think the last mansion build or the second last one from when this goes up and he asked could you build your dream house next and I thought that'd be really nice idea and I know it's just house not specifically a mansion and but what I was thinking of ass up the mansions I've been doing recently and you know I'm really happy with him and everything but I've noticed that some of them are starting to have very you know similarities and stuff and so I thought this would be a good idea to do for mansion build so I can kind of just do something a little bit different this week and so if you don't know every Sunday here on my channel would do a 64 by 64 lot munch and build and this is the one we're doing today so I haven't built anything like this before and a half ton mansion builds in the likeness I'm sorry modern mansion builds in the past and but I thought this speaks to me you know really great to do something different I am and this is a place that I would really love to live and I don't know what it is but I really love modern up-to-date stuff and you can see what well you can't really see at the minute here but well you sort of can ahem but there's a big big swimming pool and that kind of goes all the way around the house I do know what it is but I have some sort of thing that I've really liked about water and in terms of how it looks in houses and stuff like swimming pools and also houses are kind of surrounded by water as well and and yes so um the color scheme for this is a little bit different I didn't want to kind of use site and selectively other mansion builds because you know it's a little bit different and suicune with this site in here which is from fitness stuff um and would you use two different color swatches we'll have this darker one and then I also use a like Doc Holliday will just a slightly lighter color of the same texture and just to have in a little bit of a difference and then we'll go around and pull kind of like black trim and well columns around the rest of the house they kind of finish it all off and and yes so we've just jumped ahead a little bit here I was just going around kind of puttin in the terrain paint and stuff for the landscaping and now we'll go ahead and do in this it's pretty much similar to open up doing for landscape and in the past as you can see we're just going ahead and putting down this as a base and then we'll go ahead and put flowers on top of it um and just about now I've run out of footage because I haven't actually finished this build and so for the rest of the video I've got to talk about something else I mean I have done some of the bathrooms as well off screen and which I do normally for house builds because a little bit boring so I just decided to do those off-screen and but you'll people say probably the interior at this point I believe and but as I said I haven't recorded it yet so I'm just looking at a black screen while some talking anyway so today is the 30th and like I mentioned at the start I think it's gonna be like two weeks time so I'll just try to think yeah cuz we've got another mansion build already recorded and then this is going up after that so this should be going up on hang on let me check and the 10th of June I think I am and I'll be in color tech in the middle of my exams as well and because my exams are from the 4th till the 18th and that's the reason why I'm like doing this so advanced is just try to get as many videos pre-recorded for that time frame that I can because I'm gonna be really stressed with those once the 4th comes so I don't want to kind of have to be recording videos between the 4th and 18 so I can just focus on them and and yeah I think I'd be a good way around it I have pre-recorded videos before and last year for the whole month of June are pre-recorded and just cuz I had exams again then so or just again for ISM 20 of us for the same reason just to kind of van you know get a little bit ahead of myself so I don't have to kind of worry about videos in addition to you know all the exams are hard and I commonly think how an earther managed to do a full month of videos for June because well I don't upload every day in June it's just my upload days but I did have an extra day last year because I think was January this year move down to four videos a week and but last year's five videos a week so how do you Mort pre-record and I've been struggling to just record two weeks worth of video so and this is like two less per week as well well over last over the two weeks will be two or less for you know what I mean so I'm trying to think what else I wanted to mention and well your 18th after that and seasons will be coming out which is great I'm so I can't we for that I have so many builds and it's ridiculous I have this huge big list do know how Nathan would get around him more but I'm really excited with some of the ideas and I also have planned a group collabos well with oh my god my voice is going I've planned a group club as well with the pack and that'll be coming up soon and once seasons is released I'm not going to kind of say what the idea is and I haven't the people I'm doing it with I haven't really said all we're gonna mention about this or not but I suppose I can see who's involved and it's gonna be me dr. Ashley Amy Simms and Chloe Sims so I'm really excited for that those are some really good friends here in the community and were all kind of friends with each other so I thought would be good to kind of do something together and how this idea will actually simply sell it to me and I thought would be a really fun idea to do as a club ever season so I'm not going to see what the idea is and if they accidentally said that's fine but and I just want to kind of leave as a surprise for now and what you'll be saying that soon and if you have any more suggestions of seasons even talking too fast even if it's not a build or just a video in January you want to see the seasons or any you know anything for that matter the police just let me know I'm always open to suggestions I love it when people send me stuff and I'm always open to kind of given those ago so feel free to do that and always say the best place to do it is on my email address and send me an email with it which is just contact Thomas TV at gmail.com that's also in the description as well along with all my social links if you want to send it as like a Twitter direct message you're supposed to go to do that way as well and the only reason is safe for doing it that way is because I get lots more Twitter mentions and YouTube comments then I do emails so it's easier to keep track of them and if it's like it you know if you just tweet it to me and that's just like it you know public we apply whatever and then you know I get lost in you know messages per day I might miss it by a chance normally do go through and check all of just to make sure you have fun you know there's always that kind of possibility so it's probably the best idea to do it on the email or Twitter direct message and my Twitter to games are open for everyone as well I don't have it you know and kind of what's the word I'm trying to look for here I can't thing but you know how you can like have it for just your followers or whatever I've got it open publicly so you can send me them whenever you want and yeah so I don't know how long I'm gonna do this one sue before always have this problem when I'm doing the voiceover like this where I'm kind of just talking without a video because I don't know how long it's going to be but I had footage there for three minutes so much to get like all of the xu8 or mostly so I'm probably go from maybe about the house gonna see the 10 minute mile that's probably another to show I don't know what it is but when I'm doing modern houses to take me so much longer I don't know what it is I am but I've probably spent and I'm trying to think he may be about an hour so far I'm haven't even start of the interior which is truly unlike me because for my normal mansion builds I can get the whole thing done within like an hour and a half so I am but it's always the case for modern builds even it's sort of modern mansion it's just any modern build it takes me forever to do I don't know what it is but it just always does and and you know I'm always happy with the end result and stuff and modern houses are you know the probably not my favorite to make in the Sims but I do enjoy the making them you know nevertheless um and yes so today's the 30th it is a pretty normal day in the UK first it's very dark and rainy and well it actually hasn't started raining yet it was actually as a literally just set that it's literally just begun to ring I kind of just drinks it that but yeah so it's it's been just you know not the normal day and there's all it's been like really foggy here for last couple days if you follow me Instagram I mean it would have been a little while by the time you see this video um but I did post something Carmen sister stood in Sasori wow I've never said instead before on my Instagram story and I went out this morning for a coffee and I kind just pulled up in this car park by the seafront um and it was just so far couldn't even see a thing so I took a boomerang of it and and I haven't really used a boomerang hmm a lot and I dunno I think it was actually because I'm a friend and Ashley had mentioned earlier dr. Ashley on here some story she's always pull some boomerangs and I think that's the reason that I started using them um I don't normally post just pictures on my story in it also I didn't mention but you can't follow me that it is just my public one and which is real Thomas TV 1 which is the same as my origin idea same as my Twitter and stuff like that and so feel free to go ahead and follow me there and I do post you know Sims photos of normally my newest builds and stuff like that and but I also post in real life fools too so you can kind of see little bit more about what I'm doing outside of Sims and YouTube and stuff and then I'm a story as well I post a few times a day normally you can just show you what I'm doing during the day and also my take a picture of like the monitor when I'm like working on build and kind of shoot like a work-in-progress and so you can kind of get you know a sneak peek to upcoming content that way as well and another way to see what kind of videos and stuff are coming up is to head over to my gallery and like I mentioned the same username real Thomas TV one and always well not always but most of the time like 90% the time I post all my bills early there and that's because when I like a mention I kind of pre record a little bit it's sometimes not as much as in pre record now two weeks it's normally just a few days in advance so I'm not kind of totally stressed on the day of open road and but I just upload them once I've finished the build instead of you know gone back and uploading it once a video goes up because if I do it that way there's a pretty good chance I'm going to figure out to go back and do it so I just uploaded wants to finish so I don't have to you know worry about Goomba or whatever and and yes so feel free to go ahead and check out my gallery page and I think well over 800 files at this point which is pretty crazy I'm a kind of near and 400 uploads as well I am and yes so I always I probably Nelly every day I'm uploading on the gallery to be honest because and I just build all the time I might not upload every day but you know and always working on videos and another thing as well that is the occasion where I will kind of am saw like just post other builds that you might not see in the channel so say I've done a few were not recently actually I can't think if I've done one recently I don't think so but example it's one I did of this simple bedroom I was cuz what happened was is that and I have my macbook pro as well I am an adult I just use that one on my at my desk and but I also have the Sims on there I don't play it on there I just have it installed and and I don't have all the parks sold on that one either and but I was just one night I was really bored there wasn't at my PC bat was in the mood to build so just opened it up to kind of just like do just mess around a little bit and just you know just try some new build stuff and so I did like this know move objects it's really really simple bedroom I think actually we created it though once I got a PC so yeah sort of not really an exclusive thing but sort of though and I kind of just did like this really simple bedroom you can probably find it if you've got my page and then just type in simple bedroom it's literally just those two words and so you should easily find it and it was just a very simple room build oh my god I think a few hundred downloads which is pretty good so I wasn't really expecting that I just wanted to kind of just you know do random build colors board and burn off for a speed build and yeah so

these well most of them now what I want to see is someone making a team of dark dark keke turtle turtle sound owls make sound Devils make sound with metal clashing sound of metal clashing and seal that would actually be a potentially good team thank you so much for watching and if name origins are something you enjoy then you should probably go check out this video - where we talk about the name origins of some of the biggest video game characters it's a blessed so stay awesome and never stop using that nugget", "h1pMe_fXdoM": "when you open up Sketchup for the first time you will be presented with a dialog box asking you which template you want to choose in that option or in that list is a woodworking template with either inches or millimeters set as your default measuring tools I have mine set to woodworking inches and I have it set to it'd be my default template now once you get up and going you probably won't have the same tool bar setup as I do and that's perfectly okay these are very easily customizable I have it to the settings in which I like myself so let me run through a quick and show you how you can change things first off each tool bar tool set has a little bar as you can see right here and right here that you can click and drag and modify the position of each individual tool bar well you can also specify which area of the screen you want so I can go from the top to the right or to the bottom or back over here to the left and you can do this with all of your tool bars this right here is the large tool set tool bar and pretty much that's all you need I haven't found any use for adding anything else to it but you can also add if you want by using this toolbars option up up here under the View button and as you can see large tool set that's the one I have on the left hand side so if I uncheck it it is gone and you can go through here and add into any individual toolbars you want and then just put them wherever you want as well so customize it to the way you like but typically speaking the large tool set is pretty much all you need it is kind of handy to have these standard views as well you'll also notice that there are multiple ways to accomplish the same task for instance to draw a line you can either go over here to the line button and click it you can press L on your keyboard for line or you can go up here to draw and press the line and as you can see there's the shortcut right there the keyboard shortcut I always recommend using a keyboard shortcut first if you're not familiar with using keyboard shortcuts I suggest taking the time to incorporate them into your workflow or into your learning process here because it is a lot faster once you get used to it because as you can see from the left hand side I can scroll through a lot of tools without even moving my mouse if not you'll go back and forth and back and forth and believe it or not that little movement adds a lot of time for larger projects so I always use keyboard shortcuts when possible most all 3d modeling programs are based on an X Y Z coordinate system how you define your object in two dimensions as X Y and then Z is your third dimension or vice versa whichever direction you're actually looking and what Sketchup did here is instead of confusing you with with numbers or letters they just changed it to colors which is absolutely awesome I like doing this with my layouts as well your blue axis is from the origin which is where all your X is combined from your origin vertically straight up your green axis is from the origin straight back and your red axis by default is from the origin and left to right now as you can see these don't go in one specific direction like I just said like Green doesn't go specifically back it also goes forward as well as just an axis and they represent this by a solid line going back a solid line going right and a solid line going up dotted line down dotted line left and dot dotted line forward everything is based off of these axes so no matter what tool you're using you can also snap to those axes so if you're drawing a line out here in space and this is a line but you don't know if it's actually horizontal or which direction it's going you can use the snapping system which basically says when it shows it up as red then that is parallel to the red axis parallel to the green axis and parallel to the blue axis so keep that in mind everything is based off of these three and it comes in handy big-time when you're trying to navigate larger objects", "nT1JJZD9bdg": "in india only six men out of a hundred use a condom in today's episode of whack i'm about to tell you some statistics about india that are as crazy diverse and mind-boggling as merijan hindustan before i tell you about india let me tell you a little bit about you wax audience if y'all were 100 people then 45 of you are under 24 32 of you are under 35 75 of you are watching from india four from america two from dubai and one from the uk only 10 of you have pressed the bell icon so can you please press that bell icon and get notifications when a new video comes out my name is frisia this is whack and together we are going to squeeze down 138 crores 4 385 people counting into hundred we have 17 percent of the world's population all living on two and a half percent of the world's land clocking in at this many people i'm going to take this number and squeeze it down to 100 so that we can get a better understanding of who we are and where we stand let's keep in mind that all these numbers were taken before covid19 also i have tried to look for the best possible numbers in government as well as private surveys and some surveys like the india census it's from 2011 as it happens only once every 10 years so if india was 100 people then despite being the second largest consumers of the internet in the world after china only 34 people have access to it while 37 out of 100 have smartphones so 34 have internet 37 have smartphones that means that there are three people out there who have smartphones where they've not activated the internet because we are a population of 138 crore people we top a lot of lists like we have the second most smartphone users in the world and 97 of our internet usage is all on the phone so what are all these people doing on their phones mostly social media so out of 100 indians 24 are active on facebook and once again we are at number one most facebook users in the world are indians 24 watch youtube every month six are on insta and two have twitter accounts when it comes to online dating in india out of 100 indians who have subscribed 17 are women so to say that the competition is tough that's an understatement perhaps that is why 74 percent of young indians said that they would prefer an arranged marriage over finding someone for themselves avi sanskari yes kinda 66 percent said that they were against pre-marital sex but the fact that we are dangerously lacks when it comes to sex education is proven by the fact that out of a hundred young men only six use condoms there are other numbers on people using contraceptives to avoid pregnancy but we are dangerously lacks when it comes to sexually transmitted diseases a lack of a healthy discussion about sex means that it becomes even more difficult to collect data on certain subjects officially out of a hundred women two have abortions every year but studies have shown that 75 of abortions take place at home so not only is this dangerous but it's hypocrisy at work assam has the best and safest abortion services in government hospitals that is why assam is said to have the highest number of abortions in india and experts say that it has this high number only because 90 percent of the abortions are surgical and therefore data collection becomes easier another area where data collection could do with a lot of improvement is mental health out of 156 countries in the world india ranks at 144 when it comes to the happiness index in my own personal experience i know how difficult it was to convince people to go and get professional help when it comes to these mental issues now bear in mind that i live in this relatively small bubble of well-to-do urban india so i can't even imagine how difficult it must be for those people who are less fortunate and don't have access to proper professional services so out of 100 adult indians 15 may need intervention 14 may suffer from depression and one commits suicide every year but subjects like sex and mental illness they've always been brushed under the carpet by our society and until we decide to have a mature conversation about it things won't change unfortunately one of the places where young indians get their relationship advice from is movies so if a hundred indians went to a theater to watch a film 44 of them would watch a hindi movie 15 an english movie tamil and telegu come in at 13 and the rest are all the other languages while some movies have action drama and romance some are shitty and speaking of shitty here's a shitty segue out of a hundred indians 36 have to in the open now this number it's very controversial because our government says that out of a hundred four don't use the toilet everywhere that i went on the internet i found different numbers so i have taken 36 because it was the most common number that i could find i live in bombay city and every time that i travel in the train or i go to the beach in the morning i see people defecating out in the open and bear in mind this is bombay city so i can't even imagine four being close to an accurate number and when it comes to bihar 36 that just doesn't make sense which brings me to urban and rural india 17 live in rural india 30 live in the cities 7 out of these 30 live in slums this next fact it really surprised me joint families are declining faster in rural india than in the cities more people are moving out of their parents homes in the villages than in the cities i think there are a number of reasons for this the high cost of housing in the city as well as the fact that both parents nowadays are working so grandparents are taking care of the grandkids ironically 64 indian men and women think that the duty of a woman is to be a good wife and a mother and yet 81 think that men and women both are now sharing home duties and speaking of duties it brings us to work out of a hundred indians three work for the government this includes all state and central employees as well as defense personnel out of a hundred indians four pay income tax now who are these four people the three people who work for the government they have their tax deducted at source so from all the non-government work that does take place here in india only 1 out of 100 pays tax a moment of silence for all tax payers oh and by the way the number of people who did disclose their income at five crores and above was eight thousand six hundred this number when put against the fact that in india last year thirty five thousand luxury vehicles were sold means that either each of these 8 600 people bought three luxury cars or people are not disclosing their income which one of these makes more sense is for you to decide according to me when i sit and i think about all the politicians ceos business owners sportsmen bollywood tv personalities and restauranters 8600 it feels like remember the panama papers they had only 500 indians named in it and on the other end of the spectrum 68 out of 100 indians live on 150 rupees a day this 150 rupees it covers their food housing and every other expense imaginable and in rural india 75 out of 100 live on 33 rupees a day but pes like 82 have bank accounts 66 have a tv after a fan the tv is the next most bought electronic item as one of my favorite indian stand-up comedians did point out that if you have ever sat in an aeroplane then you cannot be middle class because out of a hundred indians only five have sat in a plane six have passports two take a train every day thirteen have cars and seventy own two wheelers another moment of silence for that one guy who pays taxes that things are being done on a ram bharasi basis is pretty obvious perhaps that's why 75 out of 100 indians said that they pray every day and 80 said that they believe in god now interestingly this number it's seen a six percent decline in the last seven years here's the religious breakup of our country if we do want to bring about a change then education and exercising our democratic right is the way forward today 65 out of 100 indians are eligible to vote and out of these 65 67 showed up in the 2019 elections now this is something that gives me hope 74 out of 100 indians can read and write and 52 passed their 10th standard and went on to enroll in the 11th grade the more educated we become the better our life and our country will be but at the end of the day this is india and when we compare kerala to bihar the numbers will fluctuate if india was 100 people then 16 would be living in uttar pradesh nine in maharashtra eight in bihar six in telangana and kerala and one in delhi in fact if uttar pradesh was a country then it would be the fifth most populous in the world while researching for this topic another thing that really surprised me was our food habits 70 out of 100 are non-vegetarian if we look at our male population then 23 are anemic 20 are thin and 19 are obese and if we look at our female population then 54 are anemic 23 are thin and 21 are obese as far as gender goes this is the breakup and with regards to age these are our numbers as you can see half of our population is under the age of 35 making us one of the youngest working populations in the world and how many indians saw the last back video this number so if india was 100 people then this would be the eyelash on one person if you like this video then please make sure that you share it with everyone share it on all your social media on whatsapp and let everybody know about the diversity that we have in our country i'd love to hear from each and every one of you in that comment section below as well so make sure that

"ready oh that smells really good you have to get that paper on here's your paper delightful you have to warm it up so it's warm enough to take the wax paper on wait what is this blue stuff the postman but gummy just have it all day kind of chewy chewy re to either stretch it's amazing get saltwater taffy [Music] so weirder taffy is a Jersey Shore original maybe they make it let's all I have no idea maybe I don't know we'll see you poured salt water in the mix there's got to be some sort of water involved right there's no actual salt water in the taffy it's a kind of legend from Atlantic City let me just give you a little bit of history on saltwater taffy but what are taffy was named by a guy named Bradley from Atlantic City he had a store on the beach and he had a product called taffy well one day this tide came up from Bruin dis candy and a little girl came up along and said you have saltwater taffy so that's how the name stuck to the taffy saltwater taffy I never taught water Chevy it's just good it's good treiber's has been here since 1898 and we've only tweaked the ingredients slightly everything that we make here saltwater taffy is made right here everyday and we run about 2,000 pounds a day when we make saltwater taffy it starts out with corn syrup that's your main ingredient once Happy's been cooked you have a hundred pounds of saltwater taffy that is non flavored once the candy has come into the cold room it's gonna be dropped onto a cold table once the candy has kind of spread out you're gonna decide what flavor it's gonna be it's gonna be a fruit flavor you're gonna add citrus acid you're gonna dig a little hole and then you're gonna figure out what color it's gonna be and then you're gonna put some color in there cover that back up once it sits and cools to the correct temperature then you're gonna move it over to the pulling machine the pulling machine is the cool machine that stretches the candy and it also is where you add your liquid flavor you pull the taffy so that you can actually chew it if you didn't pull the taffy it will go right to the roof of your mouth so you're always trying to stretch it to get air into it so you can actually chew it once it's done the pulling machine you're gonna put it back on the cold tables roll it up and then move it on to the machine where it's gonna be cut wrapped and sealed in the summer we have we've run around sixty flavors most popular flavors are saltwater taffy our chocolate vanilla and strawberry but right behind them are creamsicle watermelon blue raspberry they're all very popular my earliest memories of saltwater taffy are coming into this store as a child and watching the machines run and my grandmother mailing a box of saltwater taffy to some of her friends back home I can remember sitting and waiting and watching the taffy run and thinking this place is pretty cool as a kid so now I work here I love the smooth taste and how it kind of gently releases of you hopefully recharge now it's like you're just chewing it's not quite there that sneaks up on you you're like oh wait what is that Oh watermelon Oh peppermint you know like whatever the flavor is and you get that it's it's it's it's fun it's fun and delicious [Music] my name is John Gado I'm the owner of van Holten sweet shop along with a partner Bob Meyer we have two stores one here in Seaside Heights and one in Brick Township we make chocolate and candy and all kinds of good stuff we have over 60 flavors of saltwater taffy and you think what flavors we possibly have I mean we have just anything you could possibly want we have traditionals like licorice peppermint chocolate vanilla then we have some high quality flavors chicken and waffles maple bacon pumpkin pie chocolate chip red velvet I can go on forever I mean there's a ton of flavors if you like what you do you don't work a day in your life well for the last 7 and 1/2 years that I've been doing this I feel like I haven't worked I'm just having fun and look better than to be standing in a store on the boardwalk looking over the ocean every day it's beautiful [Music] my favorite flavor chocolate my personal favorite flavor is the white cranberry full second would be sour cherry half banana strawberry and molasses that's what my grandfather used to get us I love their pumpkin for the fall and root beer probably as a kid was my favorite I kind of like the root beer strawberry banana people have a memory you go to the shore you grab a box of saltwater taffy anything coming to the sources I was even younger than her and it's just like a tradition to come each time like a question towards the end they get saltwater taffy to bring home I've been coming here since I was a kid 50 years ago every time I'm in the air and I get that my grandfather would rush to give us the salt water taffy before my grandmother would yell at him Thank You Rocky when I was a kid so I grew up with it and I do love it [Music] bring back a lot of nostalgia and also reminds me I have a dentist that really loves that I enjoy [Music]", "MkvfXXjjcWI": "um so just let me know once you can see me live and we will start our today's session for important image based question so it will be just like talking and knowing the important questions from your need pg for your future coming need pg examinations right so myself dr shivam i'm a resident in ent and head neck surgery so currently i'm doing my kobe duty but what i thought is my duty should not hamper your preparation so i thought to arrange a rapid revision for images for your neat pg and coming mid-aims coming games exam examinations so the problem risky i don't have pen with me so i'll be just illustrating you and you won't find any difficulty just let us see this first figure if means this is a figure from your recent examination what you can see here is a bulged out tonsils you will have been deviated to other side and there is congestions in the tonsil so they had asked you what treatment you will give so before treatment you have to find what is the diagnosis now different types of questions can be framed in and around deep neck spaces abscess so what they had asked in that year it was peritonsillar abscess why peritonsillar abscess there are some important signs that you need to fetch from your question so one important sign is the inflamed nature of the picture so here you can see tonsils are inflamed the tonsillar fosa and the tonsils anterior pillar these are inflamed patients will be presenting to you with toxic signs of fever pain odynophagia and all so this is your infection in the space peritonsillar space means between the tonsillar capsule and the tonsillar bed or the superior constrictor muscle so there is a space where the infection and collection of pass occur now how you are going to differentiate it from parapharyngeal abscess why this is not a paraphrase elapses if i ask you this straightforward question will you be able to tell me giveaway it is not a parapharyngeal abscess but peritonsillar abscess in both the scenarios you will get the tonsils pushed up to medially that is towards the midline uvula will be deviated to other site but in paraphernalia abscess these inflame inflammation this redness congestion the toxic signs the odynophagia that is there so basically the clinically you will find that the your tonsils your uh the anterior pillar will be appearing as normal in parapharyngeal abscess why it is so because the parapharyngeal the infection is in parapharyngeal space so if you see this image which is just a schematic diagram to show you different spaces this is your tonsil so can you see my pointer so i think you can see my pointer yes so this is your tonsil this is your peritonsillar space and behind this is your parapharyngeal space this so if there is infection inflammation in this parapharyngeal space what it will do is it will again push the tonsil medially but now as the infection is not related with tonsils it will not be congested it will not be red angry looking here also the tonsils would be pushed but not due to infection in peritonsillar space but due to infection in parapharyngeal space so you need to see the clinical picture you need to examine the oral cavity to differentiate between both of them now what about peri-vertebral means pre-vertebral abscess and retro pharyngeal absence how you are going to differentiate so both these pre-vertebral axes and pharyngeal apses will present to you in the posterior wall of pharynx pharynx that means posteriorly what difference you will get is this pre-vertebral space or the pre-vertebral abscess will be a mid-line swelling while the retropharyngeal abscess space will be either right or left the basis is the anatomy if you see this pre-vertebral space it is a space that is bounded by the vertebra posteriorly and pre-vertebral fascia anteriorly so this is your pre-vertebral space so it is a continuous space any infection any past collection will present to you with midline swelling and all other features of abscess but in retropharyngeal apses here the it fuses the lr far shaft fuses with the buccopharyngeal fossa and result in division of the two space right and left and that is why retropharyngeal space abscess will be either either side of the midline either right or left another thing is there is one space called dangerous space and why it is called dangerous space because this is space which lies between the pre-vertebral fascia and lr fascia the any infection in this space may spread to your plural means in in may is spread into your thorax it communicates with the lungs lung plural cavity so that is why it is called dangerous space right and here you can see your remus of mandible medial to which is medial terygoid lateral to it which is your masseter this is your palated gland here the nerves are 9 10 11 and the carotid sheet so if this figure is asked in future you can tell it if any question clinical based question is asked in future you can again explain the diagnosis another picture which was given was from the dissection of temporal bone that is your cortical mastodectomy and posterior tympanity what they had asked you in this picture of cortical master victim is they had asked you this they had labeled this as a and as asked you to identify this structure so this ivory bulge which you can see in the mastoid cavity is lateral semicircular canal bulge if you see the orientation this is your anterior this is the posterior superior and inferior so here only what you need to see for your future questions is the boundaries and the probable questions that they can ask from this picture because now they are more surgical oriented with the questions so if we see the boundaries for cortical master dictum and you should know that the mechus triangle and the triangle of attack are two different triangle and have two different boundaries so mikey will strangle you all know that it is a landmark for your mastoid anterior can anybody of you tell me what is the boundaries of triangle of attack where we drill for cortical master adectomy so i can see your comments if you know just type yes otherwise i'll tell you so cortical mastered to me the triangle of attack is used to drill for cortical masteredectomy and if you see the superior boundary is your pegmin plate that means dural plate above which is the dura anteriorly is a spine of henle and the posterior canal wall right this is your posterior canal wall of external auditory canal posteriorly or you can say postero inferiorly is your sigmoid sinus bulge so in this area superiorly you can say the triangle of attack is your inferior temporal line actually after you drill in that inferior temporal line you will reach this dural plate okay anteriorly is your spine of henle and posterior canal wall posturo inferiorly is sigmoid sinus so this is the boundary of triangle of attack now here you can see a space and a star mark so what is this this is basically a procedure that is called posterior tympanotomy in posterior tympanotomy what we do is we drill in the facial reeses to enter the middle ear from the mastoid cavity so why we do it one important indication you all know is for insertion of cochlear implant electrode another important mcq that is related to is is what is the boundary what is the boundary in which we drill for the posterior tympanotomy so it is very clear once you see this image so again the landmarks or the boundaries for posterior tympanotomy is your laterally will be cauda tempaninov or the tympanic analysis medially will be your facial nerve that is the vertical segment of facial nerve and superior layers superior layers comment me i want it to be interactive so that you can recollect what all you know recollection of things is very important once you study try to recollect try to discuss it with your friends it will go into your permanent memory right so superiorly is in cuda buttress or fosa includes right so if you can see my arrow this is your fosa includes or in cuda buttress which houses the what it covers why it is called fosa intudes or intuitive buttress but because it is housing it is over the short process of increase so it is covering that incus okay and here you can see very clearly the incas the part of incas which you can see from the mastoid cavity site right and again this is your lateral semicircular canal ivory colored bulge another thing is doing a cortical masteredictomy is just a play of games so we say we surgeons say that while doing the cortical mastodoctory it is very essential that you identify the colors what colors basically superiorly you will find pinkish color due to dura so whenever you are near the dura you will find it the color of the bone changes to little pinkish posteriorly will be litig little bluish due to sigmoid sinus right lateral semicircular canal will be ivory white facial nerve again will be white means bland white and before you which reach the facial nerve there will be minor bleedings from the blood vessels that run along or above the facial right so now another important thing that you can see from the posterior tympanotomy space is your round window nish here if you can appreciate you can see a darker opening so this is your round window niche from where we will insert the cochlear electrode into the round window membrane and into the the cavity the final compartment is scalar tympani so this is the mcq for you that the electrode of cochlear implant is inserted into a scalar tympani and another important mcq that they had asked is brain stem implantation is done in so brain stem implantation is done in i want the answer i have already talked about it so brain stem implantation is done in you can comment it is done in fourth ventricle where lateral recess of fourth ventricle okay now again this figure shows you the lateral tympani medial is vertical part of fascia nerve and intuitive buttress only thing that changed it superior was here in the previous figure now superior is the reversed okay and now now moving to another important question is this this figure is just showing the electrode being inserted into the round window through the posterior tympanotomy now one another very important triangle is there that is called trotman's triangle and why it is important it is important because you use this triangle as an approach to enter into the posterior cranial fossa from the mastoid so if you need to approach posterior cranial fossa pathology through the mastoid you need to drill between this triangle and that is why it is important for you to know the boundaries the superior boundaries is a sinus that is superior petrosal sinus posterior boundary is sigmoid sinus okay posterior boundary is sigmoid sinus this arrow this arrow shows you the sigmoid sinus superior boundary is superior petrosal sinus and anteriorly is the solid angle solid angle is the where all the superior posterior horizontal semicircular cannot the bulge they have one united point that is called solid angle so anteriorly is say with me anterior layers solid angle superior layer superior petrosal sinus and posterior layers your sigmoid sinus it is an approach to posterior cranial fossa through mastoid now another important or future mcq they can give you is this they can give you this diagram and in this magnified picture you can see a yellowish drum which is attached to the long process of incas so can anybody tell me what is this drum which is being attached to the long process of increase so i'll wait for some seconds and see whether you know this future mcq or not so it is it is it is a middle ear implant okay so it is a vibrating middle ear implant what it does is it does the amplification of vibration once any sound reaches through ear so here what happens is the device that is externally placed it creates a magnetic field and this is your free floating magnetic transducer so in the magnetic field it has coils so it vibrates in the magnetic field which is created when the sound strikes the external device and the vibration causes increased vibration through the ossicles resulting in more intensity of sound reaching to the inner ear and that is why it is functioning as a hearing aid why because it is intensifying the sound but as it is implanted into the middle ear it is called implantable middle ear device the name of this device which was first approved is called vibrant sound bridge right so vibrant i'll write the name it is called vibrant sound bridge okay so yes a middle ear implant is a medical prosthesis that is implanted in the middle ear mechanically and it vibrates the middle ear ossicles by mechanically the device is known as vibrant sound bridge the external devices vorp which is a receiver and the internal devices floating mass transducer right so you've got this and it is very important for your future mcq now one two three years back when recent year question which was framed by i which the board which i couldn't name they had given a thickened nerve here and they had asked to identify this nerve so how many of you know the answer so this nerve is basically which is thickened here is greater oracle enough yes so in conditions like leprosy many a times you will see your patients presenting with thickened greater articular nerve and this is the thing they had asked you by pointing the arrow so if you see this greater molecular nerve it arises through the border of the steno medial border of the sternocleidomastoid and goes and supplies the pinna so basically a supply of pinna and why it is important is many a times during surgery if you injure this greater articular nerve you will result in loss of sensation of the pinna like in paraparotidectomy what we do is now is we preserve the auricular branch of greater auricular enough so that the sensation doesn't get lost in another surgery is rightidectomy where we where this nerve can be injured so your main function motto is to identify this now which is called greater oracle enough another important applied thing is in cases of fashion of paralysis a long time or in case of fashion of injury many a times you need to do cable grafting of fashion now that means you need to graft the facial nerve in the temporal bone if it is injured or cut or a segment of facial nerve is diseased or a segment of facial nerve is lost then you need to graft the facial nerve intraoperatively and then the craft that you use most commonly is this greater articular nerve so this is also a important uh perspective of greater oracle now that you should know that greater articular nerve is used for fashion of grafting okay another nerve which is used is surreal nerve sural nerve which is present medially around near the medial malleolus lateral malleolus is the sural nerve this is this now is also used but as greater auricular nerve is locally available you can just increase your posterior incision to extract this nerve so it is most commonly done the diameter is also more or less similar to the facial nerve so these are some important aspects of using greater articular nerve as graft for facial nerve implantation now there was a scenario where they where you got a patient which was presenting with chronic discharge of ear diplopia means double vision and the patient had presented to you with these long history of complaints what is the next investigation you would like to do in your patient so what you are suspecting with the history of diplopia chronic ear discharge retro or vital pain is you are suspecting a complication of chronic otitis media that is petrus episidis and in this petrocytus you are expecting a gradual negative syndrome so for diagnosing the petrocytosis you need a hrct of temporal bone without which you cannot see whether the infection has reached up till the petrous effects so you need to do a ct scan hrct scan of temporal bone and what all you get you get a triad of symptoms ear discharge which is due to chronic separative or chronic unsafe ear otitis media second is diplopia due to sixth nerve paralysis so sixth nerve is abducen so so4 lr6 that means lateral rectus will be paralyzed and that is the reason that your patient will present with diplopia retro orbital pain why this retro orbital pain is present because there is irritation of the gaserian ganglion or the trigeminal ganglion at the petrous effects okay so there is petroclenoid ligament which houses this gasserian ganglion of the trigeminal ganglion which causes the irritation causes retro-orbital pain so diplopia due to lateral rectus pulsing retro-orbital pain and chronic ear discharge so you need to find these three from your the question your examiner provides and fetch to the diagnosis of petrositis as a complication of chronic cortis media now this is the another commonly asked question where a child will present to you with a opening above the triggers and at the cracks of helix so the first figure that you can see here is your figure for tell me in the comment it is pre auricular sinus but in the second picture you can see a opening somewhere below the lobule between the angle of mandible and below the ear so this is something else so can you tell me the first one is periodical a periodical is highness i know most of you know but can you tell me what is this the second one so this second one is called oral fistula so both have different origins and that is why both have different place of pathologies this pre-oracle sinus is caused as a embryological defect in development what defect it is due to defective fusion of hillocks of his which is formed by defective fusion of first and second brinkle arch and the coloral fistula which has external opening somewhere near the pinna means below the pin and above this angle of mandible and an inner opening if you see the name which is called oral fistula so another opening will be oral oral means in the external auditory canal right so it has two opening one is situated in the neck just below and behind the angle of mandible means somewhere sometimes above the mandible or below the mandible in the neck and another in the external auditory canal and why it is formed due to defect in the first brinkle cleft okay the first one was first in second brinkle arch the coal oral fistula is due to first brinkle cleft right so i think you got both of them now what is this clinical picture the clinical picture shows you a hematoma rs or a cauliflower ear you can also say it a boxer's ear so what is the cause of it it can be caused due to blunt trauma over here where the blood hematoma forms between the cartilage and the perichondrium so this is a sterile condition mostly but if it gets infected and cause perichondritis then you need to intervene and drain the pus and the treatment of choice for this perichondritis will be can you do you know the name of the treatment of choice of this drug it is ciprofloxacin and by knowing that the drug of choice is ciprofloxacin you can just guess the name of organism so it is pseudomonas so pseudomonas is the most common organism which causes the condition of perichondritis like this okay now this is a clinical picture where your patient presented to you with painful eruptions near the ear near the pinna and a lower motor neuron palsy so these all are pointing you towards ramsey hunt syndrome where you get a painful reddish rash with fluid filled with blisters in and around the ears very painful can condition and a lower motor neuron palsy ah ipsilateral the thing you need to know is ipsilateral lower neutral neuron palsy so there is again a triad so in medicine there are a lot of triangles so a similar triangle is ramsey hunter syndrome triangle where you get a ipsilateral fashion of palsy ear pain due to the eruptions and vesicles in the auditory canal and the oracle so these you know that herpes has a dermatomal involvement so here along the facial nerve supply these eruptions and these things occur and why it occurs due to reactivation of the herpes zoster oticas okay so i think you won't mistake it now yeah yes now another very important question is which was asked by them is so i think uh i'm still live yeah okay so the given below image in the patient with the history of road traffic accident the options are battle signed bezos rap says italy's abscess grissinger sign so i know you all know it is battle sign but what you need more to know is what all things can occur in the post-articular region yes it is seen in fracture of base of a skull either from middle cranial fosa most commonly and what all things you will get you will get raccoon eye you you can get a csf otoria you can get post auricular echimosis that is battle science and you can get a bluish tympanic membrane which is a hemo tympanum right so these all you will be getting as clinical signs in case of your back road traffic accident causing a bass base of a skull fracture so raccoon eye battle sign hemo tympanum here a clinical picture is again shown to you with a glistening reddish posterior swelling so tell me the clinical condition where you will suspect this you all are answering great and i want you to again answer this so it is seen in acute mastoditis so the condition is called ironed out mastoid again one more swelling is seen in the post auricular region where in case of lateral sinus thrombosis due to obstruction of emissary veins you get edema over the posterior part of the mastoid and that sign is called you all know that sign is called grissinger's sign edema were the posterior part of the auricle due to obstruction of the emissary vein caused by sigmoid sinus thrombosis as a complication of unsafe chronic or dietitis media okay so it is called grissinger sign and not gradual negative syndrome both are from g but don't confuse this is a sign called grissinger sign that is a syndrome called gratinigal syndrome now again a clinical picture you found in a patient who presented to you at opd with complaints of decreased hearing upon further investigating you did a otoscopy and found a bony hard swelling like this in the autoscopic picture upon taking the history you found that he is a swimmer so what condition you are suspecting yes i am waiting for the answer so what condition are you suspecting yes it is exostosis and why not osteoma so basically you also need to see whether the swelling is bilateral or unilateral so osteoma is a single tumor composed of cancellous bone located at the outer part of bony canal exostosis oil is maybe a multiple growth located in the deep meters and mostly it is bilateral so etiology is cold water swimmers and history will be a symptom chief complaint will be hearing loss if the external canal is obstructed by the mass so antenna unless this mass is causing trouble to the patient as these are b9 you are going to approach it by observation that is conservative but it is causing if it is causing obstruction if it is causing pain in the ear if it is causing decreased hearing for the patient conductive hearing loss then what you can do is you can under local anesthesia through the post auricular approach or through the end oral approach you can elevate the tympanometer flap drill this osteoma that is the bony overhang and again reposit the tympanometer flap so main aim is to drill of this elevated and the extra bone that has grown there okay another otoscopic finding where your patient presented with chronic ear discharge but not too much pain here the patient is saying to you that he had a history of entering of water in the ear after which he complains of itching in the ear so very irritating itching in the ear with a otoscopic finding of this so what do you all think so this is a condition of oto mycosis yes newspaper like appearance or cotton buds so here what you can see is you can see some black dots in the white debris so the if i ask you the organism this is most commonly aspergillus whether niagara or fumigators or candida so mostly these theory organism cause otomycosis so do you know the blackish colony that is formed here the blackish balls that are senior is formed by whether neighbor or fumigators so it is formed by niger this black dots are specific for aspergillus niger if they are very specific with the organism the fumigators forms a bluish bluish type of colony so it will be smoky green sorry not bluish but green it will be smoky green so velvety powdery green type of colony in the ear and the candida is very peculiar it will be a beautiful white type of thing so it will look beautiful but it is very irritating for the patient and for you as a surgeon also because it needs proper care and recurrent cleaning of the ear so this is the candida this one is aspergillus fumigatus and this one is aspergillus niger okay so i hope you are getting things and this oto mycosis is also another name of singaporea okay so singapore here is again an another name of automycosis now this is a tympanic membrane but there is something different with this tympanic membrane two things two different things you can see here one is a thinned out transparent region a oval transparent region here so do you know what is this this is basically a dimeric tympanic membrane or a healed tympanic membrane and why it is more transparent than rest of the tympanic membrane do you know the cause it is because the fibrous layer in the tympanic membrane so you all know that the tympanic membrane has three layers epithelial fibrous and the mucus mucous layer means and yeah the mucosal layer that is continuous with the middle ear so here the fibrous layer is absent when the tympanic membrane is healing by itself if you do the tympanoplasty it is again all the three layers are present because you have given the graft which is acting as a middle layer but here the tymbanic membrane is healed by itself and the fibrous layer is actually disorganized more you can say the more appropriate is it is disorganized rather than absent so that is why it is more transparent another peculiar thing that you can see here is this whitish plague so this is what this is a tympanosclerotic plague so he nowadays this otoscopic findings are very important for you and that is why i have given these autoscopic finding whatever they can ask whatever question they can form so blue tympanic membrane one condition you already know that is hemotyping tell me the other conditions where you can get a brood blue drum so another condition can be a glue ear okay or otitis media with effusion one more condition it can be in cholesterol granuloma and in many case people say that it glomus tympanum that is in glomerus tumor your tympanic membrane appears reddish blue so if they ask you about blue drum this hemotype animal glue ear and cholesterol things are more appropriate than the glomerus because the glomerus is reddish blue yeah glomerus is actually reddish blue not totally blue so that is why hemo tympanum glue here are more appropriate answers for blue here but yes if there the question they have formed is like this if they have given hemo tympanum glue here glomerus tumor all the above then you will mark all the ever right another rotoscopic picture where you can see some vesicular eruptions in the congested tympanic membrane so here you can see small small vesicular eruptions so this is a condition called bullus myringitis and why this is so called because there are different small small eruptions and the causative organism now which is seen by culturing the fluid in this bula is the streptococcus pneumoniae so now it is known that it is caused by the organism streptococcus pneumoniae right so did you knew this now tell me the diagnosis of this otoscopic picture very common and very common in childhood in child age patient will present to you that the ear is becoming heavy it seems it it seems it is heavy and he is able to hear the sound less some days before he had some common cold nose block and all so what is this condition clinical first of all try to see what all you can see here so in this otoscopic picture you can see multiple air bubbles and you can see some air air fluid level so yes it is not asom but it is otitis media with effusion yes so it is air fluid levels which you can see okay now what is this condition one thing is clear it shows a perforation in the tympanic membrane so i'm not explaining the parts of tympanic membrane because i think you must be knowing it so this is the handle of melees this is the ambo this is the lateral process of malias this is your anterior anterior and posterior maleular fold and this part is your pass 10 suck above this anterior and posterior malleolus folds is your pars flaccida and here what you can see is uh which type of perforation first you need to define the perforation so it is a central perforation central perforation is a perforation in the past tensor surrounded by parse tensor so it will be surrounded by past tensor when a perforation is called marginal when the fibrous annulus is deficient whenever in a perforation the fibrous annulus the fibrous analysis is the whitish thickened part of the tympanic membrane which houses it into the bony analysis so once you elevate during the surgery if you got any chance to assist any ear surgery tell your senior or the surgeon to show you the fibrous analysis so once you elevate the tympanic analysis you will see that after in the end point where the tympanic membrane attaches to the bone the bony canal there is a cord like whitish structure and that is called fibrous anulus so when this fibrous analysis is also degenerated when it is absent then you call the perforation as marginal perforation right and usually and mostly any year with the marginal perforation will be a unsafe or squamous variety of chronic or dietitis media so from this central perforation you can fetch a diagnosis of acute otitis media so the newer classification i think you all must be knowing that asom csom has been changed to aom and com so that means this separative thing has been changed so now chronic otitis media is divided into mucosal and squamous cell variety right so this etico enteral tubo tympanic are also changed chronic odious media is divided into mucosal and squamous so if you go through that my videos detailed video in the academy platform you will find this so this mucosal has active inactive and healed variety the square muscles have active and inactive variety so this is the newer classification that you should know and chronic separative otitis media term has now been changed to chronic otitis media so this is a chronic dietitis media with a central perforation and mostly if the ear discharge is absent it is inactive mucosal chronic otitis media so this should be your proper and complete diagnosis now in this tympanic membrane picture you can see diffuse or you can see irregular margins of tympanic membrane perforation so what etiology can it be so it seems to be a traumatic etiology so it is a traumatic ear drum perforation and why it is important because traumatic eardrum perforation if any patient charges someone with the criminal complaints that because it amounts to grievous injury so you need to see whether this perforation is healing or not so you need to wait for six weeks and if it doesn't heal then it will amount to grievous injury or grievous hurt but if it heals somehow spontaneously then it will be your simple injury and not grievous hurt or grievous injury so usually you need to wait for some time and observe for a spontaneous resolution of this perforation now here is another beautiful picture which was presented to you by a child with complaints of conductive hearing loss and when you did the otoscopy you saw a pearl-like lesion through the intact tympanic membrane so what is the uh peculiar finding was it was the tympanic membrane was intact and it has a pearl-like structure through the tympanic membrane so this is a congenital cholestatoma why congenital because this congenital cholesterol has a criteria called levinson's criteria so levinson's criteria it says to you that there will be a white mass medial to the tympanic membrane that means inside the middle ear cavity okay the tympanic membrane that is parts flecida and tensor should be normal not only intact but they should be normal there should be no prior history of any ear discharge or perforation so these are the conditions for labeling the patients with congenital cholesterol okay so congenital cholesterol the cause you know there are many theories among which the most popular is the presence of congenital cell rest which gave rise to the formation of anginita cholesterol but it need to satisfy these criterias to be labeled as congenital cholesterol so they would mention in the question as a child presented to you with this otoscopic picture where there was no history of atoria there was no any autological procedure performed and the white mass was seen through the examination finding that is the otoscopic picture they have given so they are not going to mention normal parts placida tensa and the mass you need to see that image and take these two points from the history that there is no authoria and no ear surgery okay and then you need to mark the diagnosis as congenital cholesterol again the other types of cholesterol are primarily acquired and secondary cholesterol so primary acquired cholesterol will give you a peculiar picture like this where you will get a retraction pocket in the attic region that means in the past flaccida many a times you will get erosion of the attic wall okay so there will be erosion of the scutum and a retraction pocket so these primary acquired cholesterol why i am saying this is because these occur through the formation of retraction pocket through the prosex space okay so this bruce axe space is the root through it retraction pocket occur and once this retraction pocket progress to an extent that it loses its self-cleansing property the squamous epithelium starts depositing there and due to this deposition of the squamous debris the cholesterol starts forming and then the cholesterol releases enzymes that causes bone erosion so this is the pathophysiology through which a primary acquired cholesterol occur and peculiarly you will get a picture otoscopic picture like this where there will be attic retraction pocket with squamous cell debris or discharge right so this is a normal and this is a primary acquired cholesterol so if this picture is given to you as a autoscopic picture with some clinical symptoms and features you are going to mention it as a square muscle variety of of chronic media and that will be active or inactive based upon whether it is discharging or not whether this year whether this squamous deburrus is discharging then it will be active squamosal chronicotitis media with cholesterol and if it is not discharging it will be inactive chronic otitis media is squamous variety got it yes now what is the secondary acquired cholesterol so regarding primary that i told you can see here this invacination this retraction going through the neck of melees through the bruce space and finally forming a blind sack from where now no more epithelium can be cleaned and in secondary acquired cholesterol there should be a previous etiology that means there should be pre-existing perforation in past tense mostly post-superior marginal perforation okay so there should be uh already presence of a post-superior perforation through which either migration of squamous epithelium occurs or implantation of squamous epithelium occur or papillary in growth occurred due to improper ventilation okay now coming to another important mcq from the vascular supply of the little area now first let us see the general vascular supply the orientation so you know that in the android inferior part of the nasal septum which is a highly vascularized area we get bleeding from here and the area is called little area most common causes eye injury or the nose pricking in children so the blood supply is from the both internal and external character data the internal carotid artery component is anterior ethmoidal artery and the external carotid artery components are septal branch of superior labial artery greater electron artery and sphenocolotine artery right now what question they had asked is two versions of question one version was which of the following artery does not supply this little area so your posterior ethmoidal artery does not supply this little area another version of question was which of the following artery is a branch of internal carotid artery supplying the little area so if you see this question which of the following is not a branch of external carotid artery or you can say a branch of internal carotid artery in the kissel blacks plexus or the little cereal plexus so answer is anterior ethmoidal artery which is a branch of internal carotid artery so this question is a repeat from aims so it is not like i am framing it they have already framed this question so you should know this that they are forming this type of questions from this part another plexus is woodruff's plexus so can you tell me the blood supply of water like this so basically from woodruff's plexus bleeding occur in case of hypertensives okay and where it is present it is present just below the sphenoid opening posteriorly 1.5 centimeter above the posterior part of corona so you know that sphenoid sinus osteum lies 1.5 centimeter above the corner the upper limit of the corner and that is where your woodruff's plexus is present so tell me the blood supply of woodruff's plexus so the blood supply is through this fellow sphenopalatine artery so it's phenobalatin artery is also called artery of epic stacksters now there was one question with oroentrol fistula oro enterofistula can be caused by all except just tell me the answer abcd dental extraction carcinoma of maxilla caloric operation and max selector so this question i have already discussed if you remember the answer here is maxillectomy why because if you see the color and this oral and fistula or ventral vascular means a communication between the oral cavity and the anterior maxillary antrum or the sinus so it can be caused due to removal of this tooth the cavity can be left so it can cause the oro enterovis to allow calculus operation where we hydrogenically means the surgeon creates a opening through the oral cavity into the maxillary antrum it can also lead to the oral anterior fistula and carcinoma of maxilla due to erosion of the palatal bone can lead to oral anterior fistula but maxillectomy is total removal of this part this one part of the maxilla so there is no point of creation of oro enteral fistula when the andrum is not present you are removing whole of the maxilla along with the maxillary sinus antrum that the that cavity maxillary sinus cavity so no point of fistula if you are removing whole of the maxilla right so answer will be maxilectomy now one question was with the regard to polyp so with regard to polyp i'll give you a newer prospect perspective with regard to diagnosis through ct scan first let us see what question they had asked they had said or asked you that etheremoid polyp are characterized by all of the following except so first tell me the answer then we can move to the ct scan picture how you can diagnose this polyp once a patient brings a ct scan of nose and paranasal sinus to you in the opd viral in origin multiple antihistamines are useful surgery is treatment of choice yes i can see the comments so if you see the ethmoidal polyps they are usually arising from the ethmoidal air cells and that means as there are multiples ethmoidal air cells the polyps are multiple the ideology is allergic etiology and that is why antihistaminics can be given for the treatment and the final treatment the treatment of choice is functional endoscopic sinus surgery okay so let us again go to our options multiple yes anti-stamina useful yes surgery is treatment of choice yes viral in origin no these are basically allergic in origin right so this is a diagnostic nasal endoscopic picture showing you multiple ethmoidal polyps arising from the ethmoid sinus what all you need to see is this is your middle turbinate here will be your nasal septum this can be your bulla be from behind which you are getting ethmoidal polyp okay so not very clear because this is a pathological image again this dna is showing you something else a white for single white polyphoidal lesion so most probably not very confirmatory it can be a intraocular polyp which is arising from the maxillary antrum going towards the corner and the anterior part of the nasal cavity and you know this very basic difference that the intraconal polyp the in ideology is infection these are usually single unilateral tri-lobed grows backward treatment is surgical and in ethmoidal polyp it is multiple allergic bilateral bilateral because it is allergic why unilateral because it is infectious so one of the maxillary sinus can be infectious but if it is allergy it is a systemic disease and then you are going to get bilaterally the modal poly right and the treatment for ethmoidal polyp is both medical and surgical now you have diagnosed seeing a diagnostic nasal endoscopy can you also diagnose this based upon this ct scan picture coronal cut what type of pathology is it showing whether it is a androgyny polyp or a thermometer polyp because nowadays we don't do any endoscopic sinus surgery without a ct scan and in question if they ask you key what type of cuts you will prefer before you do your endoscopic sinus surgery you have to tell that you will look to the coronal cuts coronal cuts means like this so it will be starting from here here here here here why it is so because these coronal cuts are the roadway or you can say are the map to your sinus surgery so these coronal cuts it will start from here right when you insert the endoscope inside the nostrils so you inserted the endoscope you saw one ct scan cut picture then you more inserted it inside than another cut so by seeing the ct scan you can map out your endoscopic sinus surgery so you are getting my point you have to see each cut so that is why we recommend very thin slices that means one millimeter cuts of ct scan for nose and paranasal sinus so that we don't miss any structure any air cell through the ct scan we should know each and every thing before we do our surgery so that is a characteristic of a good surgeon who knows the anatomy before he starts operating so a surgeon which starts operating and then finds something abnormal is a very risky surgeon with the advent of radiology now every surgeon does pre-planning of his every steps of operation through the radiology so you can get a hrct ct scan means high resolution ct scan of nose and endoscopic this nose and paranasal sinus and means plan your surgery so if you see this picture of endoscopic sinus surgery means of this endoscopic ct scan of nose and paranasal sinus you will observe that there is something some opacity in the maxillary sinus which is coming out through the widened maxillary osteum into the nose and this is probably your inferior turbinate so this is arising from the maxillary sinus most probably a intraoconal polyp okay and if you see this picture here maxillary sinuses are clear the ethamoidal air cells have opacity so black denotes air in ct scan so here you can see mucosal thickening or polyp in the ethymoidal air cells and how you can say it is ethamoid by this normal ct scan if you see this is just given to make you understand the normal looking of this nose in paranasal ct scan if you see here this blackish cavity is your maxillary sinus this is your inferior turbinate right bilaterally inferior turbinate here you can get the middle turbinate what pathology you are seeing here is your middle turbinate is pneumatized pneumatized means air is present in this middle turbinate and if i ask you if i want to see whether you know that what is the name for pneumatized middle turbinate so i am seeing the comment whether you know this or not what is the name for pneumatized middle turbinate so it is called concha blossom so pneumatized middle turbinate is called concabulosa right so another thing is this these things are your ethmoidal air cells and the biggest lithium iodine cells is your bullet models so this should be your bullate models so here you can see this part is denoting to the ether modal air cell and this big cavity is your maxillary sinus this is your tooth oral cavity or heart palate and these two are orbit here you can see different intraoral muscles medial rectus superior vectors and between medial rectus and superior rectus one artery emits from here and that artery is anterior ethmoidal artery so this is also an important question that anterior ether modal artery emerges from the orbit between the medial rectus and the superior oblique at a conical projection called kennedy's nipple and enters the nasal cavity so this point is also important that is called kennedy's nipple when your anterior arithmetic artery enters from the orbit into the nasal cavity so now after seeing the normal anatomy you are better able to delineate that the pathology is in ethmoid sinus and thus it is a ethmoidal sinus or ethymoidal polyp okay so based upon the diagnosis you can plan out your treatment for the patient and this sinus you can see is your frontal sinus so bilaterally one frontals sinus septum is separating right frontal sinus from the left frontal sinus okay this is your orbital cavity this is your laminar pipe or you cannot this is your lamina papyrus here the latter the medial wall of the orbit the thin bone you can see is your lamina papadisia okay so this is your medial orbital wall and this is your kibri form plate this this is your base of skull or kibri form plate which is most common site for the csf rhinoria very thin bone here so this is your this is your lateral and this is your medial cribriform plate you need not to know in that depth but just know that this is your base of the skull so while doing endoscopic sinus surgery we try not to injure this part because it is very thin and we do not or not by mistake we try to risk means jock fully move the middle turbinate why because one part of the middle turbinate if you see this one part of the middle turbinate that is the middle terminal it has three part sagittal horizontal and coronal so sagittal coronal and horizontal so the corona the mid part or the coronal part the sagittal part actually the first part gets attached to the cab reform plate so if you move the middle turbinate jerk fully it can lead to fracture of capri form plate and can lead to csf rhinorrhea so you need to know this point that one attachment of middle terminate goes to the cab reform plate and it is important for you to not to risk fully damage this middle turbinate to prevent iatrogenic csf rhinorrhea okay so i think we had discussed a lot for today and just last question this is an easy one and we'll end our session and after the session do let me know how much it was useful for you because it serves as a motivation for me to find time and be a part of you in your success journey so i believe that you will make it this year because the time is tough for everyone i'm i'm also doing my kobe duty daily so it's quite a stressful time for all of us the fear of getting infected is always there the fear of making family infected is always there so i hope that you remain healthy in this pandemic in this phase and get best out of you and get the best results in this neat pg 2021 so do give your best whatever possible taking your happiness your health and your mental peace okay so you do not compromise on these things because these things are the ultimate things which matter so study well and be happy because this is not the time that you should be too much stressful so target sign is seen in spontaneous csf rhinorrhea traumatic csv rhinorrhea both are none so i i am seeing that dr dr nikhil have answered it as b yes you both are right it is a traumatic csf rhinorrhea finding why because this target sign is formed due to two circles one is the inner that is caused due to blood another is the outer that is caused due to diffusion by the csf so the blood will only be present if it has led to injuring the blood vessel so if there is any injuring to blood vessel if there is any fracture then only blood will come because spontaneous occurs usually in obese male with in increased or raised intracranial tension traumatic is due to any road traffic accident or you are doing an endoscopic sinus surgery and you shake the middle turbinate or you took the endoscope and just while doing the clearing the opening the ethmoids you injured the base of the skull or the cribriform plate so then it can lead to traumatic csf rhinorrhea where you will get this target sign or the hello sign where the csf will be blood mixed okay so i think i should end this session it is already 1r and do let me know your feedbacks this is dr shivam stay happy and do whatever you find good for you bye you", "vZlfLDVThVQ": "hello my beauties welcome back to my make up rule series and today I'm going to tell you all about mascara mascara is for with some of your guys most favorite Beauty / makeup product and for me it's probably also one of my most favorite makeup product because I think mascara is probably one of those multi-purpose super versatile type of product of course as usual I'm going to talk to you guys a little bit about the history of mascara mascara is came back as early as a 3400 BC where Egyptians used mascaras as a form of celebration for war and death but also they saw that the eyes were the window to your soul so not only today wore eyeliner which contain Kohl they also use mascara is to help prevent and protect them as they think that it would ward off bad spirits it wasn't until the Victorian era in the 1830s that people became obsessed with beauty and they loved pampering and making themself up a lot of times these mascara was mixed in their very own home by mixing ashes without a barrier the hot fire and then made their very own the Stars the very first mascara was known to be invented around the 1800s where the petroleum jelly was patented and this is actually a very important and prominent ingredient in all mascara and it wasn't until the nineteen seventeen where Eugene grimille was basically created the first packaged cosmetic mascara it was actually in a form of a cake and it is still found today so it was later on around the 1930s that their waterproof formula was invented although it did cause a bit of skin allergies and the scent was terrible so it wasn't until like around the 1960s where the waterproof mascara for Mia was created it was when they actually came up with the first patented mascara applicator that was like a grooved rod and that basically changed revelation of mascaras because it allowed the pigment and the formula to distribute on the brush evenly it was just a much more efficient and better way to apply mascara the most common ingredient eponymous cars today carbon black or iron oxide depending on color so that's black or brown and then you've got the emulsifiers polymer that coat the lashes and then you've got essential oils and thickening waxes as well as preservatives there are two ways of making the scara's first is the end hydrous which is basically you mix everything in a huge tank or a kettle and then you melt the waxes into it and then you just keep mixing it until it kind of forms into this semi solid state and the other one is called the emotion pretty much is where you add the water and the thickener and then you add the pigments on much later mix it all together in super high speed to avoid any air going into it and obviously to avoid evaporation and that's when you get basically the norm waterproof version so now I'd like to talk about the different types of mascaras you can get on today's market so you get the volumizing you get the lengthening and then you get the curl so a lot of times you might get volume and lengthening sometimes you get curl and volume at the end of the day we just want that full Luminess long lashes we want to give ourselves that don't lie effect or give our lashes a bit of a boost and of course mascara comes in different type of one you have the curved wand you have the mini comb you have the full-blown brushes and then you've got the one side comer one side fibers any type of brush head that will evenly apply the mascara onto your lashes are found in today's mascaras and each one will do a different type of job the more bristles you get on a brush obviously shows that it provides more will bring more product to the lashes because the gaps between the bristles are a lot smaller so therefore you avoiding less clumps the most common brush head found in coal mascaras are the curved one as it fits around the lashes and pushes the lashes up to hold that curl a lot better there are also mascaras with very Rush's that help to do the little baby hairs on the inner corners as well as the outer corners and obviously not to mention the bottom lashes - it doesn't matter what type of brush head you get nowadays the mascara is packaged in a tube basically designed so that when you insert the brush into the tube it will pick up all the product in the tube but when you pull the brushes out it acts as a filter and brushes off any excess product if there is any excess it is advised to use and wipe the excess onto a tissue and then apply onto your lashes so to avoid any clumping so there are different ways of choosing the best mascara to suit you so first of all you would like to find out whether you prefer more length more volume or you prefer to have your curls last longer a lot of times it's determined by the natural form of lashes you have so if you already have naturally full curly lashes then maybe all you need is something to help to lengthen them if you already have super long lashes maybe you just want something to help stay the curl so a lot of times if you want something to hold the curls longer you will want to opt for more of a waterproof formula when you want to hold your curls not only do you need to be waterproof a lot of times or formulas allow the lashes just stiffen up in the way it's been dried so therefore it stays in that position in a cold position longer it is also a lot more difficult to remove so therefore you will need an oil type of makeup remover to remove waterproof mascaras if you want something that's a bit more lengthening or more volume a lot of times you find you get five of mascaras five my scar is it basically little fibers that mimic this I guess the the length or the style of your lashes so it adheres to natural lashes and to create that long looking lashes the downside is sometimes you might get as little fibers in your eye and it can get a little bit irritating especially if you wear contacts so they're also the color mascara that you get blue purple green red orange whatever any color under the rainbow basically they're made up of the same ingredients but with different pigments and sometimes you may react as different types of pigments or different formulas so it's definitely very important to try the mascara out before committing to the full size when you have sensitive eyes it is often suggested to go for non waterproof formulas as non waterproof formulas tend to have less ingredients that will irritate the eyes a lot of times you'll also find mascaras that made from more natural products like beeswax and natural pigments and things like that as well but maybe the longevity of the mascara could be shortened due to using a more natural type of ingredients my little tip on achieving the perfect curl lashes is basically curl your lashes first apply a coat of waterproof mascara to make sure it holds the curl and then you can apply your favorite mascara whether it's lengthening or volumizing depending on whether you want more volume or more length sometimes you want both so you can apply that and then lastly finish off with another waterproof coat just to make sure that everything stays in place and usually that will last you all day long I will suggest to avoid curling lashes after apply mascara as a it will not only damage your natural lashes but sometimes you can accidentally pull lashes out as once the formula dries on your lashes and when you clamp them down they do stick onto the lash curler if you like to wear color mascara is not only can you apply them straight to last you can also apply them on top of black mascara or you can apply them onto your bottom lashes only so there are different ways of wearing color mascara and the reason why mascaras are so great is because you can also double up as a brow brush to help tame your brow hairs all you have to do just make sure you wipe any excess product it is strongly advised that if you like to keep your lashes more curled to apply the mascara onto the base of your lashes first and don't apply to the top of the lashes at some times it can weigh the product down and wear your lashes down another thing I find to better play lashes if you hold your wand is the other way you can actually brush your lashes upwards and it she lashes a lot more longer and pointy ER and you also do that from the bottom lashes too if you wiggle the brush toward the roots of your lashes it creates more volume and thickens your lashes to make to create that natural eyeliner look some mascaras all have expiry date on the bottle it usually tells you how many months until you have to replace them they range from about one to three months a lot of times people will suggest for you to replace them every six months a lot of times if your mascara haven't actually expired but the formula has changed as thickened or has become crusty what you can do is a little bit I drop and then mix it into the formula you can reuse the mascara again another way are reviving your mascara is that you can always use your mascara onto lashes and then use the heat and lash color to warm up the product last but not least is I like to talk about tubing because tubing is become the new craze out there everything everyone and everyone every brand Under the Sun is talking about tubing and microchipping with scar basically what it is is the way of the generic way of applying mascara is actually applying a product which are pigments are here to your natural lashes and then you'll need some sort of formula to help soften that and then remove it at the end of day with these tubing technology it creates this film on top of latches and it coats them so basically it's a budge proof it's waterproof it's great for sensitive eyes it holds everything and it also is super easy to remove because all you need to do is use warm water and you just have to wipe it off without any rubbing or tugging on to the eyes anyway thank you guys for watching if you have any questions about anything leave your comments below and I will talk about very best to get back to you as soon as I can I hope you guys had a lovely week and remember to make sure you check out my vlog channel as I'll be posting things like get up - and I will see you in my next video thanks guys bye", "6RCVa1npEHg": "[Music] good morning peeps welcome to another vlog today is a little bit interesting because they are calling for some really really rainy weather downtown Toronto has a tendency to flood when there a torrential downpour so we're a little bit nervous as to what we're doing today because we're going downtown right now but hopefully it makes for an interesting vlog [Music] so as I mentioned before peeps we are going downtown and we're doing a fixture that we've done quite a few times on this channel and I'll give you a hint it's one that I'm not a big fan of [Music] so if you were thinking bathtub you are absolutely correct as you probably already know bathtubs are a little bit difficult and then I aren't always a big fan but we've been getting a lot of calls about them and it's gonna take place in a building which means that there are two slabs on the side which means it's a little bit difficult to get it in taking that all into consideration we got a big day ahead of us with the bathtub but the good thing about it is the more you do the easier it gets and you start to eventually know these little tricks of the trade and make it a little bit faster so that's hopefully where it's gonna get it well one day I'm going to be doing a video and I'm gonna be like my favorite fixture which is the bathtub that's the hope that's the game plan oh and by the way peeps you know what to do baby let's go do a delicious bathtub [Music] all right so it's really coming down out there one thing I wanted to do in this video that we haven't done in the past with bathtubs I want to look at it historically I want to find out more information about the fixture itself when it sort of came into being so hopefully we can take a look at the Internet and find out if there's something really interesting up there so let's get to work here we go this is the one we're currently taking out right here we're getting massive saw and it's gonna get really dusty so we're about to get started let's get you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] already peeps so what you're seeing in here is something called a bathroom group a bathroom group consists of three fixtures a bathtub a vanity and also a toilet so essentially how buildings are set up is you have your building wall and then you have a soil stack that runs vertically through all the floors and then comes down horizontally and runs along the bottom floor as well so what you're gonna see is essentially the same fixtures on each floor so you're gonna have a water closet right here as you do down here you're also gonna have a vanity up here as you do down here and you're also gonna have a shower down here as you do down here now a bathroom group encompasses six fixture units the water closet accounts for four then you have a vanity which accounts for one and then you have a shower which accounts for 1.5 but we dropped the point five and just consider it six so here's essentially how it's all set up so you will actually have a wet vent going on here where you have a water closet which goes in which is a 3-inch pipe and then your shower will connect into your water closet in something we call the vertical leg which is the vertical portion of the water closet and then in that pipe right there we're gonna have a vanity connection which goes inside this series of pipes that goes all the way up here is going to be up size to two inch in order to account for the wet pen now if you don't know what a wet vent is it's essentially a drainage pipe that also acts as a vent pipe and vice versa and every wet vent has to finish off with its highest fixture ending in a continuous waste and vent which is what this green line represents here this green line is essentially the vent that travels upwards above flood level rim and connects into what we call a vent stack now a vent stack is essentially a stack that runs parallel to a soil or waste pipe that will be connecting all the continuous waste and vents on every floor so as you see here it connects up and will connect in and as you travel up along you'll notice that the second wet vent up here will also travel up and travel into it as well they will branch off and then come up to the final vent which is the stack vent which goes up through the roof already peeps so like I said earlier I wanted to look into the history of the bathtub because it's a fixture I don't know a lot of belts so let's dive into the Internet to see if we can find out anything interesting by the way all the links are gonna be down in the description below that way you can look at the sources goodall Wikipedia the bathtub bath or tub informal as a larger small container for holding water in which a person or animal may be most modern bathtubs are made from thermoformed acrylic porcelain enameled steel fiberglass reinforced polyester or porcelain enameled cast iron a history of bathtubs and bathing documented early plumbing systems for bathing go back as far as 3300 BC with the discovery of copper water pipes beneath a palace in the Indus Valley Civilisation of ancient India evidence of the earliest surviving personal sized bathtub was found in the Isle of Crete where a 1.5 meter 5 feet long pedestal tub was found built from hardened pottery Wow clawfoot tub which reached the apex of his popularity in the 9th late 19th century has its origins in the mid 18th century where the ball and claw design originated in Holland possibly artistically inspired by the Chinese motive of a dragon holding a precious stone the design spread to England where it found much popularity among their restorer see just as bathing was becoming increasingly fashionable early bath tubs in England tended to be made of cast iron or even tin and copper with a face of paint applied that tended to peel with time the Scottish born inventor David Buick invented a process for bonding porcelain enamel to cast iron in the 1880s while working for Alexander manufacturing company in Detroit the company as well as others including Kohler company koehlers still around by the way and JL Mont ironworks began successfully marketing porcelain enameled to iron bathtubs a process that remains broadly the same to this day [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "fHZj3vOEkgk": "[Music] you [Music] fake honey is everywhere discover how to know the difference with this simple trick we can easily say that honey is one of the healthiest ingredients on the planet honey contains a variety of vitamins and minerals the type of vitamins and minerals in their quantity depends on the type of flours used for apiculture commonly honey contains vitamin C calcium and iron if you check the vitamin and mineral content in regular sugar from any other source you will find it to be completely absent or insignificant honey has antibacterial and antifungal properties so it is often used as a natural antiseptic in traditional medicines honey contains nutraceuticals which are very effective for the removal of free radicals from the body as a result our body immunity is improved against many conditions even potentially fatal ones like cancer or heart disease but unfortunately probably due to its high price people often buy the cheapest one they can find in the supermarket or the one with the most misleading advertisements and sometimes the one in the best-looking most dazzling container which is a bad thing why well because when you buy this type of fake honey you are not actually buying pure honey how this works well in order to lower the price this type of honey is often subjected to numerous alterations a recent study conducted by a group of experts at the Food Safety News has discovered that up to 76 percent of all types of honey available in supermarkets have been subjected to a process called ultra filtration what this means well this filtration process removes impurities like wax traces but also the pollen as well which is a bad thing you should also know that the honey manufacturers say that this process is important in order to prevent crystallizing and to prolong the shelf life of their products the bad thing is that many consumers don't know the fact that pollen is extremely important and beneficial to our bodies and the fig honey does not contain it well the experts say that the main reason why you should avoid honey that's been treated with this type of processes that you can't locate the geographical origin of the honey as in cases of pollen contamination the origin needs to be analyzed and traced you can take this for example the Chinese fake honey it is often treated and contaminated with illegal antibiotics in some metals because the manufacturers in China used this process to import it and its origin is usually unknown so we can suggest a few brands in places where you can purchase honey which lacks pollen asterisk honey types sold at Walgreens and CVS Pharmacy do not contain pollen asterisk certain packages of KFC and McDonald who need une OTT contain pollen asterisk honey winnie-the-pooh which can be bought at Walmart does not have pollen asterisk 77% of the honey sold at Costco Target and Sam's Club do not have pollen and you should also know that there are honey types which have been combined with glucose as well as others which are high in poor quality made adulterated honey is honey that is not in its purest possible form some people also say that adulterated honey is often sold in the supermarket's so you should learn how to recognize it asterisk here's what you need to know well if your honey does not crystallize after some time there is a good chance it may be adulterated since the pure one will crystallize when kept in the fridge asterisk this is also very important you should always read the labels yes always read the label on the honey and if it contains commercial glucose or high fructose corn syrup avoid it asterisk or you can try this method as well you just have to add a few iodine drops into a glass of water and add in some honey afterwards if your honey turns a blue color it has been combined with corn starch asterisk or you can add a couple of drops of vinegar into a mixture of water with honey if you seafoam your honey has been adulterated with plaster asterisk some people use this trick as well you can burn the honey with phosphorous or a match and if it ignites it is pure honey asterisk or you can place a spoon of honey into a glass of water in case the honey does not dissolve it is pure fake honey or poor quality honey dissolves in water due to the high adulteration [Music]", "wmPgrf00AxY": "[Music] hey and welcome to watch Shannon lash with ash visit the video is

vibrant color the mesmerizing glow the constant motion you can't help it be transfixed by the lava lamp and enduring symbol of the late 60s it all started as so many ideas do in a pub this symbol of the vibrant counterculture was born as far from its psychedelic era as you can get post-world war two england by of all people an accountant Edward Craven Walker got the idea from a homemade egg timer Walker spent a decade and a half perfecting the mixture of oil and wax during that time he made a bit of a name for himself filming underwater nudist films why 1963 he was selling what he called the Astro limp then just in time for the explosion of peace love and rock and roll Walker's lamp was spotted at a German trade show by some Americans who brought it to the States as the lava lamp its arrival in the US was perfectly timed with 1967 Summer of Love & the new openness of the 60s drug culture the lamps out of this world design also fit with the times as the space race broadened our imaginations in fact the lava lamps first television appearance was on a 1968 episode of Doctor Who as the 60s came to a close Walker was selling nearly seven million lamps a year a decade later the lava lamps time was fading it would see a rebound with a wave of nostalgia in the 90s and it's earned a permanent place in countless dorm rooms but the lava-lamp remains forever a symbol of the 60s", "Bxpum2ueNBA": "y'all look at this overgrown lawn what's up party people it's Elizabeth with the Parker family Network today I'm very excited because we are going to review the Sorento wax beads now if you watched my original waxing video I bought the GG brazilian waxing kit on amazon and i tried it for the first time about a month or two ago and i was in love with all the products except for the wax itself the wax was very brittle even if you applied the wax on thick it broke apart very easily and I just wasn't in love with it so I did some more research and this was one of the favorites that was on the internet so I decided to order it and we're gonna try it today I didn't order those beads until I was finished with my GG hard wax so finally it's empty and today I'm going to be waxing up my eyebrows my underarms and my legs although all that's probably not gonna be on camera so if you saw my last video and if you haven't go check it out right now is pretty hilarious you would know that the GG hard wax came in this it didn't come as beads it was a block and it literally took an hour and a half for it to melt enough for me to actually use it that's why I got the beads this time so I'm gonna show you everything that I'm going to be using in order for me to have a somewhat successful waxing experience okay so here is basically everything that I'm going to be using I'm gonna be using of course a mirror this is my GG waxing warmer I got an empty tin can for me to put my beads in this is brand new hasn't been opened yet popsicle sticks baby powder some cotton rounds post waxing cool gel and pre Appalachian oil something a drink and of course my wax piece okay so basically I cleared my area going to open this empty nice and clean and I'm going to go ahead and turn my wax warmer up to high I smell like wax but I'm probably going to pour it on maybe a quarter of the way up and see how that goes oh my gosh they feel pretty cool I filled it up to about a quarter of the way through as you can tell I'm going to see how long it takes for this to melt enough for me to use it's been ten minutes and already it is doing way better than the GG wax so I'm gonna wait another ten minutes and check back with you it's pretty got my mirror propped up on Game of Thrones books aka a Song of Ice and Fire what a disappointment the HBO series was another 10 minutes is passed and it is looking pretty good really cool looking so I'm probably gonna give this another 10 minutes actually I'm probably gonna give this another 5 minutes smells like wax I think it's at the consistency to where I can turn down the warmer yes it is so this took about 25 minutes to get into this consistency which is really good we are going to turn the warmer down to a low setting wait another minute or so and then I'm going to test it to see if it becomes a honey-like consistency because that's what you want so I'm going to turn it down and I'm wait a minute or so okay so this is what I was talking about as far as the consistency goes so if it's like water like this that means that it is too hot if it's too hot and I don't feel like waiting I am going to wrap it around I'll stick wait a couple seconds it should start cooling off fairly quickly the consistency that you want is like honey now it should be ready to apply after I found my first waxing video I have gained a little bit of wisdom in my experiences so hopefully this isn't going to take me five hours like it did the first time I'm going to first apply the pre Appalachian oil on my eyebrows just a little dab a day we'll do do this side the middle and then this side and then while I'm doing that because I can't find my stupid eyebrow brush I am going to try to get my hairs up y'all look at this overgrown lawn make sure it's not too hot what I like to do put some wax on my popsicle stick and then twist it around so that I get all the strings and things and then just wait a few seconds before I apply so it's not like piping hot and won't burn my face skin off all right so I'm getting some right so what you're supposed to do is apply it and the direction of hair growth this isn't as stringy as the Gee Gee wax which I totally appreciate so so that's what I want you see it moving it's like flubber or something y'all seen that movie Robin Williams y'all remember that there we go yeah I don't know why I'm a little bit more scared this time but here we go whatever okay wow it's like I put a comforter on my eyebrows and just an FYI I got some paper towels here so that I can put my popsicle sticks with wax on so that I don't just like willy-nilly leave it around you pull it in the opposite direction of hair growth and make sure it's parallel to your skin so I'm going to do that and okay nothing came off it feels really slippery okay I didn't get that much wax this time or I mean at least I think I did not know okay I'm not a professional so anything that you see me doing I mean it's it's like I'm a first year at Hogwarts I haven't even got assigned a house yet so anything that I'm doing and you think oh this girl knows what she's doing I'm just gonna follow her yeah okay here we go I basically put on my pupil so see what you can see you see huh all right pull skin taut and we are going to pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth and then we're gonna pull it parallel okay that's it like it got something and he did I see some hairs in here look at that okay now remember with hard wax you can go over the same area more than once now I wouldn't recommend going over 500 times even though I did my first time I feel like you'll get better the more you do this to yourself so before I make any more judgments I'm going to go ahead and finish this part up a couple of things before you start messing up your eyebrows make sure that the corner of my eye and the top of my eyebrow or the innermost part of my eyebrow matches up and then going through the iris edge of your nostril should be the arch the edge of your nostril corner of your eye and this should match up as well now my Asian genes won't let me go this way you can see some like this trail of unwanted black sheep so my goal for this session is for me to just clean it up and make it look a little bit better [Music] and just to say right off the bat I feel like I don't have to use nearly as much wax as I had to with the GG wax I don't know if it's because I have more experience for some reason this vise gives me more confidence this is the finished product on my right eyebrow anyways I'm actually pretty pleased with it there are a couple places where I want to tweeze but other than that I think this is the best it's gonna get so now to the other side so this is that before looking super crusty I just noticed that what I've applied was not thick enough as you can see I poured more on top which you're allowed to do if I actually wait for the appropriate time this wax actually comes off a lot cleaner which I'm very happy about the GG wax did not there are bits and pieces flying everywhere string it's like I was engulfed by a spiderweb every time that I applied the wax and every time that I waxed anything I just felt like it didn't come off as a whole every single time hmm and I noticed that when I do peel off the wax there aren't many places where I find wax afterwards overall I feel like this is way cleaner than the GG wax this one turned out so lightly thinner than this one so if you could can I tell you could sort of tell a difference but it's not a disaster which is okay with me okay y'all we're about to do our legs so of course you're gonna need way more wax and I don't know how I'm gonna do this on this small of a thing but we're gonna try first we're gonna prep the skin the powder you didn't see me use it however whenever you're waxing all your other body parts besides your eyebrows you need to dry your skin using baby powder with a base of cornstarch it'll make everything easier your hard wax won't slip off of your slippery skin it's not even focusing but you can't really tell but have leg hair so there's a couple you see them like I said I'm blessed with Asian genes so that means that have thin hair all over my body see if I can focus a little bit more but I'm going to try my legs oh my gosh what what are you doing yeah oh my gosh okay okay Oh easy cleanup I heard definitely not paying three people this is literally the texture a fruit roll-up myself you need bigger popsicle sticks luckily when I first started this journey I bought some lilies bad boys I don't think waxing my legs this thing is like a tongue depressor for like friggin ogre giants this thing is huge I mean just like as big as like what is milady it's a giant giant crab sticks okay change of plan my leg hairs are way too thin which is a really good problem to have so I think what I'm going to do is I'm just going to shave my legs and then just wax everything else mmm but I think this is it for this video so some final thoughts real quick overall I really really like these wax beads the less of a hassle less of a mess they go on cleaner and if you applied the wax correctly there's less breakage I definitely recommend this over the GG wax now those are the only two hard waxes that I've ever used those are my only two experiences I've used the GG hard wax I think at least three different times I've had a little bit of practice with a with using this only once I already like it a million times better so I definitely recommend I will leave a link in the description below and as far as pain I mean you're ripping your hair out I would say there is less pain involved just because you don't have to apply this wax as often just because when you apply it correctly it does its job the first time no breakage and as you could tell there were less strings less just less of a mess when I use the GG wax every single time after waxing I had to pick up little tiny pieces some of the wax stuck to the towel that I was using and was just everywhere I was just engulfed in GG wax it was crazy and I had to vacuum afterwards here there is zero mess there isn't any wax on my fingers and there's like maybe one or two spots here and there but definitely way less of a mess I hope this video helped you give it a thumbs up if you're willing to try hard wax for the first time or this wax sara poll and comment down below what your favourite wax is is it hard wax is it soft wax do you even feel comfortable waxing yourself and don't forget to hit the subscribe button I think that's it for this video so until next time bye guys [Music]", "8VNLb5ilxH4": "bond to another condo both his under light plus T upon co-financed Ichi cascada ki jo p laminaria morrow

different types of differentiation such as the protocool portion fool to come up at critical points or current points to limit of a function etc etc all right okay so let's begin [Music] all right so this first question is a limit question from there different ways of approaching a limit quest there we have direct substitution we have cancellation and we have rationalization rational line creation is like finding the conjugate of an expression these are these questions I involve transfer charge direct substitution we just replace X with the volunteer but sometimes you know you have to be very careful alright gonna be in there substitution some time can you put the value of x directly into the expression you get zero instant or you get an illegal operation to work out for example you get five divided by zero all right and I know that's an illegal operation alright so be careful when you're do you know when you're when you try and go to go to which up port you're going to use the song limit cross ket alright okay so just looking at this place on your realize that on direct substitution is the best option alright and when we substitute is directly we don't get any illegal operation like dividing by zero and there's little thing here to cancel all right so we're going to substitute we're gonna replace X so negative two is decimal so you have you know about sports I'm so I'm gonna have negative cool well plus Phi all right I will know that negative cool spirits is four plus two four four plus five is equal to the square root of nine so our answer is plus or minus Phi right I mean it's under that is plus or minus [Music] all right so moving on alright so says if a function f is defined by that expression then the gradient at X equal to is alright so let me know some cash back here in memory [Music] so what when you have a straight line right we can find the gradient of a straight leg all right no when we have a curve looks on a curve that's a pervert is that confirms but we can't find it great about her the one can find a gradient at a point that's on the firm knowing C set months normally the axe is first then what we do is that we identify the point on the curve and we tip or ruler and we draw a tangent at that point and what we do find a gradient of that line all right however since it interprets it can use that approach then the chocos approach don't answer the Spencer all right Anna calculus approach is that we're going to differentiate this function all right but you know it's very important that you guys physically see what's happening sometimes we need to see a question that maybe accidents are poor in a whole is applicable what why are we be in the Sun you know on one once you can't see what you're doing mentally it makes it it doesn't make sense sometimes all right so what we have here is that this function is actually a curve if you were to represent this on a graph probably the curve a cubic function object all right now cubic functions I usually use a looks at something like that it's a cubic function all right and we want to know so let's for example that we have a cubic function here right and we want to know what but the gradient is at the point x equals two all right an exactly are graph do that you have a graph that's our x-axis that is our y-axis that's origin and this would be X equal two all right and we're gonna so we're not gonna draw a tangent and find rise over run what we're gonna do is that when I use calculus alright so we're going to French it f of X so we have the news F Prime [Music] and that gonna give us 3x square subtract 6x all right and when you finish it 505 well however only differentiate negative sign we get here all right [Music] so to find the gradient of that function at X equal to so differentiated and we're differentiated what this is what we want you know we gonna twist X speak to in that expression and that will give us the answer so we're gonna pick 3 who's here subtract 6 plus 5 a 2 squared is 4 and 3 4 this way well and so I'm going on here that's close excuse is also 1 well what's like I know that this will give us 0 right so the answer is just 5 so the gradient the gradient of the function at X equal T is equal to 5 all right as you can see that gradients of positive gradient so they make it to be like falling to the right so let's move on to the next question [Music] so this person was similar to the previous one but they're not talking about gradient right so it just asking to find our Frank on our prime what will be calculus would have mean that you can get a differential of what R is so what will do that we will differentiate our R becomes R prime or otherwise dy/dx so the city was some 30 X plus 6 and we want to know what this balance [Music] when X is equal to 6 so we replace X with 6 sorry not 6 it's to this testing is closing it's testing skills all right so it's actually to tell me that wasn't doing as well stool but yeah so when we get our internal so 30 times who is like the 60 60 plus 6 of 60 + 650 was 16 so our prime is this bottle it's a six phone they didn't tell us what what they want to fire it would look like a gradient alright for this question are we need to use just a different shapes and we know we know to differentiate it because of this this disarm our prime so our prime means that we got differentiate differentiate the expression you will place X with 2 [Music] alright so moving on smoothly right so so I don't want you guys to be this gentleman here when I'm so much you know like don't start a clean hit alright alright so please go forward on this diagram here um this topic [Music] so all right so we're giving two functions and we're asked to find the limit of that function all right as X approaches three as you can see if FG x is a composite function so we define F of G of X all right so f of G of X and this is a wild of started I remember I am other approaches that you can make but what we do is I will start off with f function so we just write for the F function all right so when I write of a functional what we do is that wherever X is in this expression we would case X to the G function so what are having two x Luna graphics super-happy yes all right take it from school G of X what what is G of X [Music] last warning all right well first one confirmed first one confirm the original thing over the first let up the first month we met for marriage Africa and f of X is works plus 1 so this first one came from the origin as well alright and we're gonna use this to deploy here that bracket or two times X is x 2 x 3 negative 3 is 9 and 6 and that's plus 1 rotated modified content this one here very carefully and minus 6 plus 1 is actually minus 5 all right so all of this year right here that F of G of X is actually 2x minus 5 so what we argue ones that we're going to find the limit of our finding value of e of X of that expression as X approaches 3 all right and what we will do is that we're gonna base on my observation here we're going throughout the user well nothing can be canceled there's no spur to rationalize and only the rationalize all right so what is that substitution alright so limit as extant a tree so meaning we're gonna so we'll place extra tree so all right - a gentleman wrote on here - 3 subtract 5 the two trees is what 6 subtract 5 the answer is just 1 all right so the value turret as X approaches 3 this expression here F of G of X is actually 10.1 it's a moving on smoothly [Applause] so [Music] all right so this is another limit question then you'll notice that you would want to use direct substitution here all right if you were to replace X with one look at the dynamic at the first expression this sort of in one so part one which is zero and zero and then this wouldn't be another one so this is your a kind one plus four is five so they they and zero times five is zero so we have a denominator that's equal to zero and we cannot divide by zero all right so direct substitution won't work for this one so what we're gonna do if you look at numerator this is a difference of two squares so we have x squared such that one and we when we expand experiments one get X minus 1 times X plus 1 all right so our numerator for this expression becomes X minus 1 times X plus 1 and what we could lose that we're gonna write back the denominator X minus 1 times X plus 4 what happened is that the X minus one at the top and excellent panel at the bottom you cancel leaving this expression here alright now notice that these two can't cancel so what we're gonna do is a very direct solution alright so it's X approaches one so we're gonna replace X equal 1 in this expression alright so comment down here so we have Lim X approaches 1 I'm gonna offer or expression here X plus 1 over X plus 4 and so that's 1 plus 1 X 2 + 1 plus 4 is what 5 the answer there is 2 over 5 all right so let's read about that to a little properly all right moving on to the next question question says the critical value of the function is all right so which I explain something here so let us say we have a we have a curve right our phone connected all right note at these points should have been the maximum point and stop in the minimum point now these points are called turning points stationary points are critical parts all right now the x value by itself of this point here these points it's called the critical value all right now a critical value at turning point or stationary point dy/dx is equal to 0 or F prime is equal to zero all right in other words the gradient of the function at a critical point is equal to zero [Music] all right so to find the critical value that we're gonna differentiate this function and put it equal to zero and solve for X all right so f prime f prime of X is equal to 2x minus 3 all right and the key point here is at a critical point f prime X is equal to so what woman knows that we don't put this expression R equal to zero and solve X all right so clearly when I bring over negative 3 times positive 3 I'm just divide everything by so the critical balladeer is x equals zero to R one and a half or one point five so moving on to the next question all right we have to look at this question very carefully though so we are four acts to differentiate is functioning all right now when when we differentiate Ln X and Ln X represents natural logarithms let me differentiate Ln X we get 1 over X all right ok no but look at this expression it's not Ln X and I look carefully what society is an exercise not sure so in other words what that feels what we call the product rule [Music] all right cool so what's the protocol alright so this is how I've taught my students all right and this is what I learned in high school how cool was I guess first times the differential differential of the second alright so I know in textbooks it doesn't actually go like that all right but this is all I remember first times the differential of a second plus second times the differential rdc of the first alright alright so let me just erase the top piece here so remember that when I differentiate Ln X we get on the wax I would also establish that we go down to use the protocol all right [Music] all right so it says first no first mean say you swear by the first term right by the ex so first times differential on second minute undifferentiated second term differentiate lnx when we differentiate olynyk's what do we get yes ladies and gentlemen we get 1 over X then know how plus plus nor the second what that mean means is gonna write by the second term and times it by the differential in first if you differentiate X what do you get fine all right and that's our answer and we can we can simplify this a bit further as you can see x times 1 over X that's what happened X will can slow go to and all of this is actually 1 and 1 times Ln X is us Ln X so this is our X 1 plus Ln X you guys are following let's move on to an exam question while this gentleman is taking a haircut alright so these questions were similar to the one we did earlier on but this question is asking us to find a gradient of that function when X is equal to what all right so what we're gonna do is that we're going to differentiate this and replace X with one no noticeable friends no let me you know what let me go back all right no a while ago for this question era is as fine a critical value so the critical value is also called th nary point or the turning point now at the turning point or stationary point or critical point the gradient is equal to zero in other words dy/dx is equal to zero alright so and if you want to know what X Balan is when dy/dx is equal to zero we equate is what is equal to zero and on sulfa X but let's fast forward this question we have a function but there is no critical point so this is just some this is just our this is a point on the curve alright so I didn't mention about turning point our critical point so this is this is just our regular curve and you know the point is just at X equal one alright what we're gonna do is that we're gonna differentiate this function here [Music] all right so this is gonna be G prime X [Music] so G prime X this is gonna give us our six x squared subtract four all right and then we'll go please X this one okay six times one squared subtract four all right now one square is one we work with this verse 1 square is 1 and 6 times 1 is 6 for every six of them or answer is so the gradient of this function 1 X equal to 1 so let me distract up give you a little tip so what's up so if you were to draw this G function you get a curve like this so imagine at this point here that's where X is equal to 1 alright so we want to what a gradient is now in 6e would have those identify that point draw a tangent [Music] draw tangent Oh [Music] draw tangent and find the gradient of that - all right and when you find a green that let's return it turns out to be so that's what we did a while so moving on smoothly for next question right so we have another limit question so with well where X square minus 9 can be expanded right x squared [Music] - nine you can expand that to the new vectors X minus 3 times X plus 3 alright but when you when you get that you know I divide it by five not really chancellor so that that's not gonna help us alright so we're gonna use direct substitution alright so what I'm gonna move what I'm gonna do a morph is X to the negative 3 so we have negative 3 square subtract 9 all over 5 alright now what is negative 3 squared 9 so it's 9 subtract 9 over 5 which is 0 over 5 which is actually know if we had I was 0 something happen coming good Avenue Rock all right so 0 5 [Music] all right [Music] all right so this is a very simple question since I'm following the rules to be used to differentiate that form come on to the first question and in the response to the big event but obviously it's a fraction at all so we love use the quotient rule all right so the answer is portion and the previous are what a person is so moving on alright so this is a form of the function by that for what value of x is a marginal profit equal to zero all right so we're going to differentiators and put it equal to zero all right [Music] let's do that [Music] and finally I'm Sonia was so it will become T prime x so P ferrets Wellborn differentiators lemonis ever because you're pointing five is actually a water we have our negative of water it's clear what's gonna happens up what I multiply 2 times negative 1/4 it is negative 2 over 4 negative I know we subtract 1 on the power there so when we want to differentiate all of this here are right here so we get negative 0.5 X Plus [Music] so it says what marginal profit when you eat one alright so that's all for X what I'm going to bring over the negative 0.5 X becomes positive 0.5 0.5 X I was deprived in my way this is your point from can slow so what do you know X is equal to 12 3 divided by 0.5 mm in photos all right so let me running second what we do we differentiate that and put it equal to zero and then we solve for X so when X is equal to six the marginal profit is equal to zero alright so in other words whatever that variable represents when that verb is equal to six the company or the firm would make any money all right [Music] all right so this question here it says if ey D X is equal to X square minus square 25 then the typical points are X [Music] all right now when is a critical point in them you're talking about x and y values all right but luckily just to make life a bit simpler they didn't actually corresponding Y value is just the X values all right now to find the critical points all right what we have done is that they were giving you a function for example Y is equal to say 3 X square plus 6 X to find the critical points would have differentiate this and we have button 1 dy DX all right let's differentiate this would have been equal to 6 X plus 6 all right and the cause is a critical point at a critical point dy DX is equal to 0 and I will solve for X all right no there's a trick to this question where you notice they already give you what what what dy/dx is untrue yeah so you don't so in other words don't do not differentiate this expression it was already differentiated how do we know by looking at the dy DX notation all right so all we need to do now is just equate is equal to 0 and solve for X all right now as you can see this is actually quadratic equation alright alright so to solve a quadratic equation in some space what we'll do we find out what is a in expression it turns out to be 1 this is actually negative 4 and C is equal to negative 5 all right now what we do is that we multiply a times C which is 1 times negative 5 1 times negative 5 is 1/5 all right so that this is number one focusing on so you're gonna ask yourself see carefully one whole numbers will multiply negative 5 I wanna add the same two numbers you get B it is negative 4 let me say it slowly alright now when you multiply a times en get negative five gonna ask yourself one two numbers multiply the two numbers is negative five I'm gonna add the simple numbers we get the B value which is negative four so you're gonna ask yourself boy what what two numbers no clue when you multiply to give you negative five first would come but Papa Thiam I would have would have been with one on high we have to remember that this is a negative means a one of the numbers have to be negative but there's more to it when you add those two numbers no you must get negative work so do I make the one negative or do I make the fireman no it doesn't matter where you put in negative when you check in for the product because doesn't really matter so if you have negative 1 times 5 you get thank you right if you have 1 times negative 5 you still get me by what it's a problem when it's adding and subtracting well because the middle term is negative or it doesn't mean that you want the highest um body to be negative terms of that negative 4 [Music] sorry not negative 4 negative 5 and positive 1 are the numbers all right now in the examiner don't end up with two numbers and don't shake it don't come up with two Norma's out creating that is this correct check it let's multiply these two numbers when you multiply these two numbers you actually get negative 5 but what I was saying earlier if you put a negative right the one you still get me the file but I add in part nor the tricky part let's I don't know negative 5 plus 1 the Romans are born five dollars wash up with $1 the pi3 one dollar will still all miss our own rooms our own four dollars so we notice negative five and one actually works you know once you have identified those two numbers this is what you do next so let me write them down with your son negative 5 and positive 1 all right so whatever the know like you said it's a the midterm we're going to erase it but Eirene so in the second line you'll have x squared so you don't have this anymore no x squared then a little drop in these two numbers in any particular order X square subtract 5x I always like to put negative 1 first plus 1x I'm not such a phenom X's on it - not much all right so look I robot the first term and I robot it last time and I drop in two numbers now because this term has four terms there are factorize by a grouping sort of extra minus five X so X love in common so what lopaka just X subtract five and over here no well the nomads come on up in one and we have X subtract five based on here [Music] all right okay so no sins because we have X minus 5 and X minus 5 it's comma a natural because it's common we're going to factorize it both what what left but always this X and this our plus 1 X plus 1 so I forgot to put I put equal sign here [Music] everything is equal to r0 and then you're gonna split this packet into two and we get we get down X [Music] X minus five is equal to zero and X plus 1 is also equal to 0 I know when you solve this topic you get x equals 5 what appears of this X equal negative 1 so I know stars these are the critical values all right are these are the critical points at x equals five and at x equals negative one now suppose I want a corresponding Y values you know you're going to put these two x values separately in the original equation to find the corresponding Y values all right but because with one of the original equation you will have believed it all right so the answer for this is x equals five and x equals negative one and those are the critical points all right so all right so we are we are gonna question now this question you telling us what critical values are all right it's telling us what if you tell buddies are but they want to know they want us they want us to find out what is the maximum value because Willie if you have a curve you know and that's the critical point these are the critical point all right without a graph we wouldn't know that this point is a Max and this point is a me all right so let's perceive all right so it says what is the maximum body so what we're gonna that will differentiate this function here G prime I'm gonna differentiate it you get 1/3 X square minus 127 all right no you see because all right suppose I didn't give you the critical values what you would have done in them is to put this equal to zero and Silas alright and when you solve this you have got x equals negative 2 and X equal 3 all right but you don't have to do that then make it work simple let us tell it out that these are the values all right but we don't know if when X is equal to negative 3 the point is a maximum or maybe all right and you might be asking how do we determine when the function is max our minimum all right so this is what we do all right now if you differentiate the function again one second time [Music] and you put in the critical values X valence and if that expression is less than 0 all right or in other words if it is negative then function G of X would be a maximum all right so it was it was positive then gho the winner a minimum what if it is equal to zero all right so the car went equal is able to call the point of infection all right so I'm glad I got all the way [Music] so what differentiate is the first time so what will that will differentiate it another time all right when we differentiate are differentiated another time we get 6x all right well then know what we want do know is that we're gonna replace X with this value the critical value so I'm gonna put negative 3 there if you put negative 3 they are going at 6 times negative 3 which is negative it all right so when I put in the critical value x equals negative 3 this the second derivative is negative all right and if you can recall being negative is actually less than zero once it less than zero is called a maximum all right so when I use x equals negative tree function is up maximum all right so that's your answer X is equal to negative 3 all right what do you put X equal three in this expression we get three times six is positive 18 so when X is equal to positive three the function would have a minimum value all right so please skip back on the video because sometimes this may be confusing all right all right hope not all the times confusing all right so let me say this again when X is equal to negative 3 all right the maximum value is equal to negative 18 now why is that so let me run our rent again because when it differentiated a second time around an input negative 3 expression the entire expression will get a numeral to be negative 18 one previously I said that if the second derivative is less than 0 less than 0 is negative then the function is a maximum is more than 0 it is positive and it's a minimum stationary point a typical point if everything is equal to 0 to call the point of any vector alright alright I hope you guys get back all right so let's continue [Music] all right so this is a very simple one [Music] when you do French it you know I'm stripping them at you come long trucks we have some rules all right so it's prime so what we will lose I would differentiate the fire mix if you differentiate fireworks what do we get we get five all right so we'll put it right here and then we'll differentiate sine we get one plus I'm sorry go that one and then you're worried about the fireworks all right and that's all right so five costs five it's all right what happens when differentiate cosine if you differentiate costs you get negative sign all right and there's a little table that I did up some months ago a weeks ago then look back at it right all right so the axis to differentiate this function here it seems to be roughly use a protocool all right I'm your mom and you can recall that when you differentiate Ln X you get 1 over X all right whatever happens when you differentiate e to the X if you differentiate e to the X for example D D DX e to the X when we differentiate that we get back e to the X all right let me try to explain what something here all right then on example suppose you get D P DX e to the 3x squared how do you differentiate that so what happens that what you're gonna do is just gonna differentiate the exponents if you differentiate the exponent that will give us 6x and we write the 6 X as our base and what we'll do next is a right but original present with 6x e to the 3x port that's your answer well that's not really answer and I was a shining or what happens when he differentiates e to the X all right and when I differentiate e to the X again my intellect but I just provide another example to see what you're doing all right so and you can see why no when it when I differentiate e to the X is about to give up e to the X let me let me try to explain oh so you have e to the X all right so what happens I would differentiate it to the exponent and when we differentiate X what do we get 1 and I'll just write about original thing you know 1 times X times X the same thing all right so let's get to the question all right so hopefully we can use the product rule and watch the product we put a pool was I guess yes [Music] thanks differential of they were second because of space and it is comfort on under so first means it over by the III X first times differential of a second alright Plus second times differential of the first all right so as you can see we can pack the rice out into the X if we take out e to the X and one apart my screen here e to the X what never back is just one one over X plus plus one Ln X so our answer there is alright so this question once finally the function is increasing are increasing your function is is increasing when dy/dx is greater than zero function accompanies function is decreasing from dy DX is negative all right so what we will do is that we're gonna differentiate this function an input X equals zero and observe what happens to the function if when you do that it's a positive term that you get means that [Music] it's increasing and if you get a negative expression it means that is please all right no mind you know don't get this mixed up not talking about critical points or turning point all right blow into mix of that what would you set a while all right so you don't differentiate f of X becomes f prime X that's going to be 6x squared subtract three so what we want to know is that will kiss X with 1 0 all right so this is a little brain so 6 times 0 square subtract 3 will always go in true so end up with negative three all right oh this volunteer is a negative one it means that it would have been less than zero meaning that it is function is decreasing - the answer there would have been a for Apple if it was the quickest exit positive tree it could mean a bit the function is increasing [Music] so moving on smoothly alright so here we have another function to differentiate but what is notes about is function here it's a fraction or a portion control and we have something called the torsion rule this is what I remember in eyes all right but the quotient it's the bottom number multiplied by differential of the second number a second term hola my apologies my apologies that's the rule it's what um this is the quotient bottom and GC of the top subtract top times GC bottom bottom number all over bottom number square and the bottom term here is exit from X square or the bottom number of the denominator so bottom is here is basically work Ln Atilla let me let me remove this because I know the lobo or we video it up in on the top right so account for this thing SS right top number first so i the bottom reverse which is one x multiplied by the differential of the number signal differentiate Ln X which is what 1 over X you can see the answer for that right away subtract the top law to the top rope in 1 and then x times differential of the one bottom which is 1 all over bottom square which is a export so all we need to do is just simplify this expression here so we're not top x times 1 over X will give us 1 subtract ln x times 1 is just Ln X all over X square all right so let's look at this person here let me see many questions I have whoa what was the last question this is last time all right so it says if G of X is equal to that expression you're getting critical values right so yet again know we're talking about the point on a curve where the gradient is here are where the curves just about the turn somebody near you in a plane I'm going to claim just about to turn all right at that point day that's gonna be your stationary point turning point are critical points all right now if they ask you to find a critical point it's different from asking what the critical values are but the critical values are just x value that you would finish excellent when I differentiate it a second time all right all right so to answer this question what we're gonna do it's a differential G function H it becomes G prime of X and that is equal to 3x squared minus 27 all right now the critical values would have been well the point at which the curve starts to turn a true and then no G prime X is equal to zero so what we need to do is to solve this arm stingier aren't aligned so what we're going to do is that one of two over negative 27 and we get positive 27 by the way this is just one approach I could have actually factorize over this thing here as a different of these words and solve it so anyway so what that is is bring over negative 27 or our add 27 to the left hand side of equation and also to the right hand side equation all right and we end up with 3 X square equals one cell and what we do is a lot of wanted to fight everything by three three cancel so X square X square is equal to 3 into 27 which is 9 and the 5 X to the spine square root of 9 but when it finds where winds and gentleman may use my reason here yes when you find square root you always get a positive or a negative so in this case is actually positive one negative sorry I thought positive and negative square root of 9 is so these are our critical values all right now if they ask us to find critical points what we will do is that replace the X values plus three and the minus three in the original equation and get the corresponding Y value all right so when you can for example suppose I'll use a positive three I wanna put positive three original thing again for so you know what retrieval represents three four represents the turning point critical point or a stationary point but give them ask you to find the critical values file is different from twenty know they're talking about when you put it equal to zero and your salt bags we solve this why it's all about one plus three and negative three all right so that's that and I believe this the end of the presentation and hope you really learned a lot alright so thanks for watching and I'll see you guys around take it easy keep seeing that what's up free [Music] you", "Aomj3ezPCmY": "JEWELRY RING? [PART 1] what, do you want to be a jeweler too? It's a lot of work, you know. But I'm sure you would like it. I'll show you. Look. This is a ring. Take it. What do you think?  No, don't eat it! It's not edible. We still haven't made edible jewelry, although that is an idea. I have to work, what are we going to do? Are you going to stay here with me? (in background) Let's go [inaudible], I am your father. [inaudible]... woohoo!.. you were with your godfather? Hello Kamikazes, since Christmas I have not been to neither the gym nor the pool. I dropped everything because I had a ton of work and on top of that I wanted to start the Youtube project. But alas, it is time that i return to going to the gym. It is something that I like to do, I need those endorphins, So today we are going to start, It's monday, today we are going to start with the gym And after I am going to tell you what we are going to do today. What a drag to get in the car right now, no? Gym: check. I'm going to swim for a little while, I didn't bring the gopro so, This camera isn't waterproof So we will see eachother in the workshop in a little while. I'm happy because today I didn't have to do any leg exercises Because the truth is, I really don't like those. So I worked the upper body. I'll see you in the workshop. I'm back at the shop. I have all of these envelopes from the jeweler Ferse (?) The jeweler Ferse's owner is Jorge, who is from Pontevedra, And he always gives me a lot of work. The truth is that all I do is procrastinate. Later i will explain to you what this word means, It is a word that I have been introduced to relatively recently, But i think it defines very well what happens to me. The main job will be to recreate this ring, of imitation jewelry. this ring is a ring that one of Jorge's clients loves And he wants me to make it, based on this model, but in a high class, fine jewelry version. In 18 carat yellow gold. So I am going to cast it in wax I am going to use this wax that is a modeling wax that jewelers use It is Ferris brand, like the underwear but in  modeling wax and you will see how I can sculpt it. It works with files, sandpapers, with the micromotor (rotary tool?) to give the wax it's shape and then we can  use the process of micro fusion to transform what was wax before, into metal. So yeah, I'm going to stop procrastinating and start making the model of the costume jewelry ring. Lets begin. I have to bring some bracelets to the post office. Okay, the bracelets have been sent. Where was I? Yes,  I already have the interior hole of the ring to a size 13 which is the reference size from the fake ring, and now what I am going to do is use the ring to put on top of the wax and mark the outline I will cut it with the saw and will continue to give it shape, sculpting with files and sandpaper until I achieve this shape. Let's continue. Procrastinate. This word means to not do those things that are urgent, that we must attend to, And nevertheless do other things that are more irrelevant, but produce pleasure. If you find this word on wikipedia, I am sure you will find a photo of me next to it. And i will explain why. Creative people procrastinate a lot. Because creativity is very pleasurable for two reasons. the first reason is that we are creating something that doesn't exist. and that is very pleasurable. the second reason is that we are making the people that receive our creativity, happy. the opposite of procrastination would be the routine but , as my 92 year old grandmother says, and she knows a lot about this, in order to have things done, you must do them. so I am now going to stop procrastinating and continue with the ring. I have the ring finished the only thing i have left is to polish the surface. for that I use gasoline. What gasoline does is eliminate the lines that we make when filing and sanding the piece After, i will mount the ring in the casting tree (?) I will make the covering(?), and into the oven it goes. to the oven. 14 hours in the oven, and we will continue. i love this part of the song thanks for subscribing to the channel, especially to Paula Vi\u00f1as give a like if you enjoyed the video, and we will see eachother next week kamikazes. [singing \"Gasolina\" by Daddy Yankee]", "W3ERecszBQQ": "ANILLO DE COMPROMISO - DIAMANTE NEGRO (Engagement ring - Black diamond) Hello Kamikazes, greetings from Sabanete in Antioquia, Colombia. Hello Kamikazes, from Catoira, Pontevedra. Greetings! Hello Kamikazes! A big kiss to all from Norway. Greetings Kamikazes. I'm Ar\u00e9valo from Peru. Hello Kamikazes, from the SENA Materials Center. Greetings from Colombia! I would like to ask you a question. - Sure, tell me... How do you feel about having shellfish and Albari\u00f1o wine for dinner with me, for the rest of your life? Will you marry me? Hello Kamikazes, I'm Miguel, Pablo's little brother. I'm living in Antequera because I met on the social networks the woman of my life. I want her to marry me. So, I need an engagement ring. Who better than the YouTuber jeweler to do it? He is not aware of this. Let's ask him to do it and see how he reacts to this. - What's up Leo? - Good morning dude! - Let's go together! - Let's go Leo! - Good morning 'melon'! - How are you? - How are you Pablito? - What's up Pablito? Stop! What do you want from me? I'm working! - I need to ask you a question, Pablito. - Let's see what you think about it. A transcendental question? - Well... Maybe it is. - Do you like bachelor parties? - Yes, yes.. - So, you will go to mine. No! - I'm getting married. - Very well! Congratulations! - Thank you! - But I need a ring. - So, go to a department store and buy it! - Are you telling me to go to a store being you a jeweler? - No! I don't think so! - I think you will do it. - You want me to work for your wedding? - And more will you work for the bachelor party. - Hopefully... - What do you want? - Do you want me to do an engagement ring? - Of course! - And you want me to say 'yes'. - Not you. I want her to say 'yes'. - Well, you too. You've to do it! - Have you already thought how you want the ring to be? - Big, beautiful and not expensive. - Is that what you will say to her when you propose bended on your knee? - That I'm big, beautiful and cheap? - Yes Sir! - Now seriously. - Tell me how you want the ring to be. - I have to think about the design of the ring. - I've always liked black diamonds and the princess cut. - From there, you can choose the rest... - You speak as you know something about jewellery. - I've learnt something from a Smurf character... - 'YouTuffe' is very practical! - It's not 'YouTuffe'! - YouTube! - YouTube! - YouTube in English. - That is very Andalusian! - It is obvious you live in Antequera. - Ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9. - Let's go to the point. - How do you want the ring? - With prongs? Diamonds on the sides? - A solitaire. The typical solitaire. - I'd like it to have lots of diamonds. - Lots of diamonds... - Yes! Ahhh, I forgot to tell you, because you gonna pay for it! - What? The ring? - If I pay for it then I'll also spend the wedding night with her. - Nooo! You'll not go so far! - The \"overnight stay\" right like in the old times... No, no, no... \"Droit du seigneur\": a supposed legal or customary right of a feudal lord to have sexual relations with a vassal's bride on her wedding night. - Let's focus! - How do you want the ring? - Solitaire, black diamond, princess cut, white gold and if possible diamonds all around. - And you want me to say yes? - Well... yes! No? - So, I missed it! - When do you need it? - I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. - The day after tomorrow? - Yes! - And you want to leave with the ring? - Yes! Of course! - Ok, I'm going to start working. - Take it easy! And work hard! - And remember: the day after tomorrow! My little brother is getting married. He has no clue about what he is getting into. I have already finished the arm and the prong. Now I'll do the pre-setting in the arm, the welding of the prong then I'll  finish setting all the diamonds. We keep going! Well Pablito, I'm already here... Let's see what's her answer! And if you have to go to my bachelor party or not! - My love? - How beautiful! - I would like to ask you a question. - Sure, tell me... - How do you feel about having shellfish and Albari\u00f1o wine for dinner with me, for the rest of your life? Will you marry me? - Yes? Ohhh how cute! How emotional! My brother Miguel proposing and the only thing he is able to say is about having every night, Albari\u00f1o, a very tasty Galician wine and shellfish. \"Marry me!\" Ohhh Miguel! Always thinking about gobbling up! Maria, you win a jewel! Well, in this case two: my brother Miguel and the ring I've done for you! And you Kamikazes, thank you so much to subscribe to my channel.

J.M", "0APQpCA-Yek": "[Music] i am thank you me thank you done [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] you", "LFqddoW9BKA": "hey guys what's going on this is a ways back with the third part of our blended series so in this video I'll be talking about selecting objects moving them rotating object scaling objects and we'll look at three with points before we start over class I just want to mention if you have any question you can treat me at away smooth out 01 and you can drop a comments below and if you like this video give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel so let's get started I'm going to teach you how to select object in blender the first thing what he gotta do is go to your user preference I'm going to click on it and then I'm going to go to input tab and going to make sure that your preset is set to blender because all the selection are mirroring any any presets i'm using it's going to be blender if you guys familiar with released remax you guys know that you can select object by clicking left by in blender we click or right to select an object so these are the few things are different than others software if I gotta make sure that your preset is blender so you can follow along with my instructions ok so let's start learning how to select an object the very simple way to select any object all you gotta do is just right click on the object and that will select that object if I select this cube you can see on outliner here I've got the name of every object I have in this drawing so let's say I've got one cube here I've got one cone if I click here it will select that cone or click on selander it would select a cylinder land so you can select objects from here these are basically some kind of layers if you guys know any other programs such as Photoshop we make layers in those programs so okay so if you want to select multiple objects so you hold down your Shift key and then right click ok so there's one thing I want to mention here as you can see if i zoom in by using my mouse wheel that the box has a orange outline here and then we have a red outline here this is just telling us that that was selected last so here let's explore outliner ok so if I click on any object it will select them if i expand this got this camera I've got the properties for that as well so these properties will change when I just collapse there if you turn off so click on this I button it will disappear the object is still in our model but it's just not showing in this perspective view so I'm going to turn it back on if you want to turn off the cube you can turn it off you can turn off cylinder and then there's a camera button here if I click here this is basically just going to turn off from the rendering so if i render this let's say if i render this image right this object so if I turn this off it will render all the objects except cube and the next we got selection you can't select it anymore so that's what you write so if I'm trying to right click here it's not letting me select that okay so now let's have a look at that i'm showing you the multiple selection as well now we're going to look at selecting objects from this select menu in 3d view so the first option we got here is circle so if i press see the shorter cupid odyssey so if i click here now as you can see that I've got a circle here I can increase the decrease size by scrolling my mouse wheel up and down or if you don't have a three button mouse and you can use plus a minus to increase or decrease signs okay so I'm going to increase that so let's say if i'll click here what it's going to do it's going to select these three objects so anything comes in that circle will be selected so this is one way of selecting your object to these select anything from your plan or you wanna dislike everything all you gotta do press a it will deselect everything so the a command is basically deselect all are you can select all okay so if i press a now it's going to select all objects available in our plan and d selecting them by pressing a key next we got border right so if i click on border the shortcut key for this week so i get this window and hold your button and this draw window anything comes in that window will be selected as well as that's another way of selection press a to deselect and then let's go and have a look at select a batch run so i'm going to click on it it's going to give me this little dialog box right so I know about my sing right I'll click on it and then I'm going to go so like that select veteran again and then here I'm going to try the name of an object such as cube okay so type Q and then I'll press ENTER and as you can see that it will select the cube let's go back click on select pattern so let's say I've got one two and three four objects starting from alphabet see right so if you want to select add the objects that are starting from say so what I can do click here and then click to select pattern and then you type C and Static sign all right and then enter and now it will select all the objects lender cube camera and then we've got corn as well so this is how you can select now there's another random option this is just a random stuff that if you are selecting any random of just a little press a to deselect and then go back to select and then click on random you will select some random object in verse so in verse the shortcut key for that is to control I this is just like I press a to deselect and I want a selected cylinder and now I want to select all the objects except cylinders so what I can do control I and now what it's doing its selecting all the object what you are not selected so accepts number everything is selected now camera I can click on select camera so if any any camera is available in your scene so you can just select them straight away this is just a basic overview of selections due to the course i will show you some more ways to select an object but this is just the basic way to select an object i'm going to clean up a little bit i'm just going to select cube con sphere and i'm going to press Delete to get rid of them and now we have one object right so i'm going to show you how you can translate an object enable 3d space so first thing what i'm going to do is click on this tool so I've got the translator date scale mirror command C alright so I'm going to select this cube by right clicking on it and now on the corner here you can see that it's telling us where are our axes so x axis is basically a red arrow why is green and then vertical axis which is z axis is the blue axis so let's say if i click on translate now it turns to white so if i move my cursor as you can see that in moving around over 3d space so we're not sure where is it basically so when i right click to finish the operation and i'm going to press G key which is a shortcut key for translating an object so I'm going to click on it and press G key and now I can move around right so we're not sure where our object is moving in or 3d space but you can see down here that our X values Y values and devils are changing the way while I'm moving the object and you can see those values in our properties panel here as well so i'm going to right click to finish that operation all right well this is not very effective way to move around object in over 20 faith so we can constrain this object alright so I'm going to select this object by pressing right click I'm just going to orbit that alright alright so I'm going to click on translate and now it turns you wipe right so if i press X key now and now if I move my cursor it's only moving on x axis if I hit Y key now it's only moving on y axis if I want to move it vertically I can press that key which is over vertical axis so I can move it on the z axis I'm going to right click to finish an operation alright so if you go to your properties panel and then click on this object cube properties so here we got location of an object I can change these values the first one is x y&z so I can change this value to move around why and then vertically the z axis values alright then we can move our object by using this gizmo so down here we got this gizmo right if I turn it off it will go away I want to turn it on and then down here we got three options that's like a moving option next we got rotating and then we got scaling up there first we're going to look at moving so i'm going to make sure that i select this arrow and now if I hold my green word up arrow and then move around it's going to move from one place to other place on on y-axis I can move this on x axis as well and I can move this on said axis as well ok so now i'm going to change the values from here pressing 111 to make sure that this is properly centered in our 2d space alright so let's say you want to move your object on x axis you can do that in a 2d space but i want to show you that i want to show you how to do that in auto mode all right so I'm gonna go and press 74 my top view and now as you can see on the top my top use perspective you right now I'm going to hit five num key to change that to orthographic view now you can't see the vertical axis which is dead so all I can do is now I can move it from x-axis and y-axis so if you click on translate it's going to turn to white and then you can move around we're going to right click to cancel that one thing i want to show you that it's good idea to use the shortcut key which is G if we click here and it's going to start moving from various cursor is so I'm gonna make my cursor here and then I where press G and now it's moving along with my cursor so this is a really good way that you want to move door object on x and y-axes you can do that that's I if I want to move it on I'm going to press the scape to finish the operation I want to change this to front view all right this is all front or to rock with you so now we can only move on x and z axes so if i press G key and as you can see that i'm moving on x axis and z axis you can do that by grabbing these arrows as well alright so now i'm going to change that to my perspective view by pressing five on a numpad and then i'm going to change that to just going to orbit that all right it's going to change that to years of perspective alright so this is the way you can move your object i'm going to show you one more thing if you click on this plus sign you can get these properties here in the proper got location which gives you X Y Z values here see you can do that you can move around in several other ways as well so I'm going to click here and then just drag it back to get rid of that alright so now we're going to look at how to rotate an object which is pretty much same moving object so how do we do that when i select this object by right clicking and make sure that just going to expand this as well so here we got rotate command right so I've got rotate command here I can rotate object by using that gizmo and I can rotate the object by giving values here alright so let's click on this your date command and now if I move my cursor around it's moving wherever my cursor goes alright so if i press X key now it's only rotating on x axis if i press Y key I'm only rotating on x axis that key is going to do that on Z texts which is very handy alright so i'm going to right click to finish them operation and click on g let's say for click g alright i can move around and up and i press are now it will the translate basically change to rotation press X Y to date on waxes and Z so it's good idea that select make your cursor closer to your object and then press R and it will change that to rotation alright this is the same way you can do that by changing values here i'm just going to expand that if i want to take these two XX it i can change the values here all right while values are here as well and I've got z values here as well just going to make them 000 all right now let's have a look at how can we rotate by using the gizmo so if you click here it will go away and then got to make sure they still on and then click on the second option and now our gizmo basically changed so we've got blue green and red lines around so what I'm going to do this is my x-axis or I will click here and just hold my button and then just move now it is rotating on X sorry Y value if you want to move it on set you can grab that blue and then just move it red is the X so you can move that as well we're going to go and finish this operation by pressing pressing a and your deselect that object and one select that and we're going to make sure that change that to zero and zero and zero now let's go to work or to go off your views / 7 press seven whoops press seven now and then make that orthography and then if I click x value now and while belly now so in orthographic views you can only go date on x and y so if you change that to phone by pressing one monkey now you can change that to z and x value alright so this is the same way you can move your object by using these two commands this is pretty much the same concept and now let's have a look at the scale objects I'm going to go back to my user preference view and then i'm going to select an object and now I as you can see that it's giving me a rotating gizmos so what i canna do is click on x sorry s you can click on scale or you can just press s so now you can scale your object alright so as you can see that on the right in the properties or values are changing as well alright so if i press x it's gonna scale that on our x axis if i press Y is going to scale on Y axis Z forward ago you can do that and i'm going to right click to finish and i'm going to change that to next option alright so now you got three pivot points were so if i grab this is going to scale on x axis y and that access all right and then i'm gonna go and change this valleys as well as you can see that we can change a scale from here as well that's too much so i'm going to press ctrl Z to undo all right so these are few things that you can do you can go to auto BBQ you can scale it on xn y value now we're going to look at how could we transform our orientation just want to let you guys know that if you have any question you can treat me at a way smoother 01 on twitter and i will answer your questions right so now we're going to look at some transformation let's go and select this share I've got four objects here bed table this is a small table and a chair right I want to select this hold on shift key and select the whole object why I'm going to click on a gizmo and then as you can see that i'm just going to rotate that about let's say here and i'm just going to zoom in and around alright so now I've got this gizmo here I can move my chair and I want to move this here all right and I can just move it up and down alright so now as you can see that I can only move this chair on basically on a global axis so just going to take that back right so now what we can do basically we can change this all right so if I go select my object all right and now X Y and set is on global so I don't change this to local if i change that to local as you can see that that gizmo has been changed according to that alignment of that object so now if you click here and then you can just move and you can just drop it under the table right so this is the difference between global axes we got local axis and we got normal axis and gimble which is using mesh modeling we'll talk about it in a later alright so now I'm going to look at changing or region of object so if I select this bed my origin is here in the center so I'm going to go to my quad view toggle quad view and I can see that this is Center and this is on center and this is on centers all right so what if I want to move that origin so what I can do I'm gonna go and change my cursor about here and click here and then here i can see that i can align that to a ballot corner so this is exactly there right now okay so i'm going to go back and change so my quad view backward so my pivot point our cursor whatever you call it it's here on the corner so I can go to object transform so here we got four options dramatically to origin origin to geometry origin to 3d cursor and origin to center of the mass so origin the center of the mass will be will analyze how big is the object and that will change the origin and make sure it's in the center the next week God origin to 3d cursor what I'm going to do origin to geometry that will the same that would send to the region and then do Matthew to origin so what it will do is basically it will move that geometry to origin so this is original already there so you will not move I'm going to go back and change that to origin to 3d cursor so I'm going to click here and now my origin is on this point right so if I click on rotate and now as you can see that I can move my bed from this point but before if I wanted to do that it will rotate that in a circle so it's very handy in the animation when you do when you try to animate your toys and stuff like that so you can or change our region and animate them so let's go back and I'm gonna go and change that let's say go run do and then I'm going to change my origin point to Center geometry to origin so click here it's going to move that to the origin point so let's go and undo that and let's try the next auction so origin to center of the mass so if I click here it will change the origin and we'll make that in a center of the geometry ok so the next we got I think I've covered everything origin to 3d cursor so if I click here it will change that here so now if I scale it it will scale from there as you can see that that point stays here by changing from that point and after change there it will change form that point the guys so now we're going to look at some pivot points so down here you got pivot point option so let's say i'll select this box right I'm going to make sure that i'm on a rotation and then i will grab this blue z axis I'm trying to rotate that all right but what happened if you want to rotate two objects at one time so let's say you follow my shift key and select that object as well as you can see that the pivot points gone in the middle now so I can change that if i go here and then click on active element alright so what it does basically let's say let me deselect everything so when I select this box first and hold down my shift key and then this box I'm if I try to rotate that now it is going to rotate that Q so what's going on basically that the last object is select it will rotate from Daiso pivot point will go at the last election all right so now let's always another option here I'm going to decide by pressing a and then let's go and select one two three objects all right so the pivot points went to the last object if you go here and then click on midpoint so the pivot point will analyze the mid area of the object selected and you can rotate from there all rights i'm going to press escape to finish the operation and then let's go and select the next one individual origin so if i click here and now it is basically on individual origin so if i move it every object will rotate add their own origin the next option we got 3d cursor so wherever your 3d cursor is they are going to roommate your date from this let's say for move my cursor here and they going to rotate from here so that's how you can change your pivot points i'm going to bring it back here and the next week got a bounding box or click here that's basically it's gonna sent to that as well so it's pretty much the same with active elements alright so this is how you can rotate or scale or remove your objects one that's how you can change your pivot point so now we're going to look at the last thing in this video it's called snapping so you can snap any object to your greed or any other object as well so selected this cube right let me select this cube here and then down here I've got this snapping option here by default it sobs you gotta make sure that it's turned on and now once it's on this next option is called snap element so you can snap to the increment which is basically it's going to snap that to grid you can snap that to vertex edge face and volume so the vertex moves let's say if I select that and now if I move my cursor and it's going to try snapping to these vertices you can see that it's going to try slapping to this com so that's how you can snap as well so if you want to snap to the grid let's say for a click here and then change that to increment it is going to snap to the grid you can change the grade if you go to your properties click on this plus sign and then go down in the display you've got a grid information so grid lines I can increase the grid lines as you can see that and I can increase the scaling factor off the grid so you're going to go back to one and you got subdivision as well so if I just gonna open now so you guys can see if I move my cursor now it's going to try a snapping to the object so let me try it snapping this to our circle all right so I'm gonna change this to where it exists and I'm going to snap this to that were dicks now okay so let me leave that and then it's gonna snap to that vertex so you want to look at it better way so I'm gonna change that to wireframe and now let's go and twice lekton those vertices you can select the face let's say you want to select to the face you can select that the face and now it's going to try selecting those faces so this is there you can snap to other objects and do it and this is all you can change your grid size scale and subdivisions so I'm going to go and change these to let's say I leave it here and then we got a few more options here so if I go to object and you got your snapping option there so if I click here you've got selection to grid you can make that selection snap to grid click here it's going to snap to the grid object selected selection to cursor so if I move my cursor about here that's our 3d cursor right so I'm gonna change this to selection to the cursors it's going to take that object to the cursor so you can change the pivot point as well if you wanna up to the exact place so let's go and try another one so now we got some cursor snapping option as well these are the selections these are the object and then selection to offset so you can do that you can apply the offset as well so we'll talk about it later but i just want to give you some information to object go here and then go sir too great so our cursor is now snap to the grid so let's say i will just go and snap my object to go so now now it's gonna be exactly on the grade so let's have a look turn all of our toggle quad view now as you can see that on the front right and we got our dresser in the center alright so i'm going to go back to my perspective view and then next option we got here snapping to Center because such a center girl said agreed and goes it to active let's say if I select this all right some s go sir is there right when i go and snap my cursor to active so it's going to take my cursor and just drop it to the active object that's it for this video we're going to start learning mesh modeling in the next video so stay tuned for that if you like this video give this video a thumbs up and if you have any question treat me at twitter at a waste mearal01 and i'll talk to you guys in the next video", "VNEt_AlKc10": "hi this is amy lohr and this is the essentials 101 class and i'm very excited to be sharing all this content i'm just setting up my powerpoint here real quick there we go um so i'm from orals wonderland and i am featuring products from young living but this is also a lot of content specifically about essential oils how to use them safety precautions methods of use and just a lot of great information about how to live uh more naturally and and healthy so um let's get into it i do want to share a little bit about my experience how i got into using essential oils which basically is i had a lot of physical health issues as far as issues with allergies asthma digestive health issues some problems with pain and for 15 years or so really didn't get much relief from any of that in traditional western medicine so i started exploring a lot of other ways to heal my body and better understand my my body how it works how to use herbs supplements essential oils and um it just got into using young living and really haven't looked back now i don't take any medication a lot of the problems that i had are resolved or well maintained with what i'm using and just integrating a natural lifestyle a lot of it along the way was also learning about how things within my environment or pollution or chemicals in the products that i was using that were toxic were actually negatively affecting my health and contributing to some of the problems that i had so it's really a big passion of mine to bring this content to people so one that it raises your awareness of your environment your body your health how to better take care of your health and really simple and easy ways because if it's not simple you're not gonna make the changes and also then to introduce to you products that maybe you're not aware of uh maybe essential oils are completely new to you you've never heard about them or you have used them before but you don't actually really know much about purity or quality so to introduce to you some new products that you can use to support your health and then to connect you to a company that i actually trust and connect you with the information that that you can make your best decision about their sourcing and standards and testing to to hopefully get the products from a company that that you can also trust but i am big on giving you the information and supporting your best decision for yourself with that so what are essential oils um they are the most powerful most powerful part of the plant essential oils are distilled from the plant material so that could be from the shrubs the leaves the flowers stems bark sometimes the roots any of the plant material depending on on the plant you were using in a distillation process to extract the essential oils from that plant material so during that process it's really important that there have never been any chemicals used on those plants because in that distillation process there is steam used with that plant material and if there's ever been chemicals used on those plants it ends up in the essential oils and can't be removed so young living is a company that actually takes steps to ensure that their land that they specifically own or partner with farms throughout the world and that land to make sure that there hasn't been any chemicals or pesticides used on it for the past 50 years before they even start planning so they're really big on quality impurity which is why i i've chosen them so essential oils have also been used really for thousands of years to support the body to support any of the body systems whether it's the cardiovascular system respiratory system nervous system immune system they can be a support in the body's natural abilities to heal so it's they're really an ally to enable and support the body in doing what it already does essential oils have also been used uh historically in skin care or for cleaning or for perfumes and cosmetics i'm showing you right now a starter kit from young living which includes 12 different oils a diffuser and other samples of some of their other products that i'll talk about toward later in in this class but i want to show it right now just so you have an idea that as i talk about some of the different products as an example of using essential oils in your day-to-day that you that you know what i'm talking about and that you can have an idea of if you're interested in getting any of the products today that this is a great way to get started and it's actually really economical with all that you're getting there is 165. um and actually uh there's a discount going on that i'll speak to at the very end for some people right now so how do you use essential oils well there's really three methods of using essential oils and the first is inhalation so that means that you're breathing in and smelling the aroma of the essential oils and you can you can use this method through using a diffuser or you can simply just open your bottle of essential oil hold it in front of you and just take a few deep breaths of that and you'll notice if you open the bottle of essential oil and you smell it it should smell quite potent and concentrated if it is natural and you shouldn't smell anything other than plants in it it shouldn't smell some essential oils on the market you can smell like a terpetine smell like in the backdrop of it or some kind of chemical smell if you smell that you have an adulterated essential oil so um i'll talk in a moment about the different kinds of essential oils on the market and how you can how you can regulate your own quality impurity and make that assessment so what's great about using a diffuser is they're usually electronic so they plug in and you usually add water to the inner compartment and then you add a few drops of essential oil you plug it back in put it all back together and it's a fine mist that goes up in the air with the essential oils and so that disperses throughout your environment and is an aroma that you smell throughout the day young living's diffusers run generally for six hours and they'll turn off automatically once there's no longer any water in it so you don't you can put everything in it and forget about it it also uses ultrasonic technology so it uses sound to create the mist as opposed to using heat which heat will actually deteriorate essential oils and make them less effective so you don't want a diffuser that is actually using heat and if the diffuser doesn't if that you're purchasing doesn't identify what method it uses to create the vapor then you don't want to buy it because it's likely going to be something that's going to deteriorate the essential oils you also don't want a diffuser that is made of you want to know what kind of plastic the diffuser is made out of because certain most plastics actually will be deteriorated by essential oils the essential oils will break down the plastics and the petrochemicals will leach out of that so you never want to put your essential oils in a plastic cup or a plastic water bottle because it will have that effect on it and then you're drinking plastic which is not going to be good or you're dispersing plastic in the air with your diffuser so you don't want to do that most of the diffusers on the market beyond from a reputable company that is an essential oils company you know the sourcing you can trust them most of them are not the proper plastic i've actually bought some before and made that mistake and the diffuser broke within a couple months uh so it's worth it to uh get a diffuser from young living and you get it in the starter kit if you go that route the other method of using essential oils is topical so you can apply them topically to your skin if you do that you always want to dilute the essential oils and you dilute them with a what's called a carrier oil the carrier oil can be anything like olive oil almond oil jojoba any of those will work as a carrier oil uh and when you're applying it topically you'll take a few drops of the carrier oil one drop of the essential oil and then you can rub in your skin uh essential oils are so concentrated that you can use a much larger volume of the carrier oil to allow a lesser ratio of the essential oil i'm not going to get into dilution ratios but there's a lot out there if you want to check into that you want to be careful of warming or oils or cooling oils which means that they when applied to the skin they will be hot and and warm up or they will cool so hot oils are things like cinnamon clove rosemary oregano they're all very hot oils so you want to dilute much higher so that you don't get a chemical burn on your skin with that heat and cooling oils are things like mints and eucalyptus or wintergreen and you also want to dilute highly with that as well lastly is internal usage and most of the essential oils out there do not uh cannot state that you can take the essential oils internally because they haven't gone through fda approval to be taken as a food basically and to be consumed internally so you want to check that if you're going to take any of the essential oils internally that they have that approval and way before you're taking them internally young living was the first company to actually get approval from the fda for their specific line of oils to be taken internally or to be used in cooking as well cooking and baking and that is their vitality line of um essential oils which is their white label so you'll see the backdrop here the valor essential oil has a solid purple label young living's vitality line which is safe to take internally or to cook with or to use as a supplement has a white label and has a added label that says vitality i'll point that out to you later when we see the starter kit again so the thing about taking essential oils internally is you want to be careful about those burns or getting sensitization you want to also be diluting them with something that's fatty so that it's you're you're not getting a chemical burn and also you only want to take essential oils internally acutely you don't want to do it regularly because it can disrupt uh the bacteria in your gut and that's not a that's not a good thing so if you have some acute issue that you're looking to support by taking essential oils internally then uh you know do that on a limited basis uh one of the great ways that we love to teach people how to take essential oils internally in a safe way is to infuse them with their tea and the safe way to do that is you take the the plant material or the tea bag you put it in your cup you put a drop of the essential oil on top of it you let it sit there for about 30 seconds and it will the essential oil will emulsify with the salts in the plant material and then you put the water on top of it so if you do that you should not see any of the essential oil floating on the top it is actually safely emulsified and and binding with the plant material just like it would with binding with the carrier oil and then is safe to take internally so that's a way you can enjoy it with your tea and then as i said just don't do that regularly okay so essential oils history just very briefly as kind of mentioning this with uh what they are and how we've been using them uh obviously we know there's scriptural and biblical references to using essential oils we've probably heard of frankincense and myrrh the egyptians also use essential oils for beauty products and embalming they use them in bath houses pretty regularly um and as perfumes as well whoops okay so do essential oils work and you know that lavender that i bought for only like eight dollars at the market you mean that might not be pure uh probably not just because uh it says pure or natural on the bottle uh that doesn't mean anything therapeutic grade essential also doesn't mean anything so labels can be quite misleading at the market and the problem is that there is no uh there is no governmental regulation over essential oils not because it wouldn't be useful it's because plants are so diverse and it is very challenging to regulate a plant season to season and to be able to say that a lavender essential oil is the same season to season uh so let me say that in another way if you think about a field of lavender being planted in three different places throughout the world those are three very diverse different environments that that plant is growing in different climates different soil different temperature and so every time that a plant is exposed to different environmental uh stimulus it reacts differently and as it reacts its makeup changes just like our bodies change and so when we when we distill the essential oils from that plant material we will see that in the end product and it can look quite different from country to country or city to city or season to season so a lavender for one season to the next can have its chemical makeup look quite different and this is why we can't make claims to say lavender essential oil treats or cures or prevents this issue even if there's research out there in the world on how lavender has been effective at treating something that is because we can't say that lavender is the same as the lavender i have in this bottle of essential oil and so that is why regulation is difficult and of course when there isn't regulation there's a lot of people who take advantage of that and abuse that and try to make a lot of money so the what we see in the market is a lot of essential oils that are adulterated or manipulated and i'll speak in a moment about uh what all of that means as well but what you need to know is when you're going into your grocery store uh there is not any labeling like there would be on a box of cereal that says all the ingredients what's in it essential oils can have a lot of different things in it a lot of constituents that are all from the plant material or they can have a lot of other things added in that bottle and they actually don't have to list all of that stuff so you need to know more about the company and sourcing to actually make your best decision about quality so uh seed to seal explained um young liv what sets young living apart is their seed to seal standard and to simply state and break down what this is is that young living isn't using any of those chemicals they're not adding anything to the the bottle of oil they're giving the best care in the industry to the plants and to the entire process seed to seal is an eight point testing system that they utilize three different times throughout the whole process of planning and harvesting distilling bottling manufacturing and delivering to you so they're actually creating the standards throughout the 25 years that the company has existed for the whole oils industry that others are are actually really replicating and and trying to do and the whole premise behind the seed to seal standard is it's all about the best sourcing standards and science they have many scientists and researchers on their team that are regularly looking at how to best grow the plants they're caring about sustainability issues they're looking at the local economy and you know how to best care for the plants as well so that the land doesn't die off and it can be a thriving land as well here you can see a map of the young living farms all throughout the world that they own partner and ultimately can regulate and control the standards at each of them if you want to find out more about the seed to seal standard you can just go to seed2seal.com s e e d t o s a so this photo is of a frankincense resin and um it being i'm sorry it being distilled at the proper temp temperature for days to pull the best oil out of the plant the what you need to know about frankincense and getting the essential oil is that the labor to distill this plant is one of the reasons it's so costly the only way to actually sell frankincense for ten or twelve dollars would be to adulterate the oil or you would make zero profit from selling it at that cost so that's oftentimes what's happening if you're actually getting real essential oils it's labor intensive to harvest and extract and obtain that essential oil and you'll see the cost of the young living essential oils reflective of that it's going to be reflective of all the labor that's intensive in doing that how many days you have to extract it is is all going into that cost so all the oils in the world fall into four catter one of four categories authentic manipulated perfume or synthetic authentic means the oils are 100 pure all that's in that bottle is plant and there's no synthetics no additives that's what young living essential oils are manipulated means the final product has been made to smell more pleasing less earthy it's been doctored in some way or there's been additives to it to enhance the aroma so you might still smell the plant material but you also smell something else or it's just not quite what it should be perfume oils are not pure they're mixed with synthetics to enhance the aroma and these oils have no therapeutic action at all it could purely actually be just chemicals and the perfume synthetic oils are not true oils at all they've actually been synthetically created in a lab to make to smell like an essential oil and you might have some kind of mix of all this you have synthetics added into a plant material you have some perfume and other chemicals added in to make it a unique smell as well so when you're looking at quality impurity and you're going the length to actually get essential oils you want the best because otherwise it's if you're getting a synthetic or manipulated or you're not actually really sure what you have in that bottle it's like going to the grocery store buying a a bottle of orange juice taking a 5 of it and then adding water and drinking that uh you're you're not really getting orange juice at that point and really out there in the market there could be as little as seven percent plant material in a bottle of essential oil and they could still call it essential oil also if the essential oil is called has an organic label on it it's important to note that that organic standard is only applied to the plant material that is in that bottle of essential oil not anything else that might be added so that can also be misleading so what is the impact of of spraying pesticides i'm actually going to show you a video quickly to explain today is treated with pesticides that's not so healthy for the environment but does it really affect us meet the palm berg family they don't eat organic food but for the next two weeks the palm beach are going to eat only organic before they begin urine samples are taken from each of the family members and it turns out they have a number of different pesticides inside their take me bodies so everything in the kitchen is replaced and they begin eating only organic then another round of samples are taken and now almost all the pesticides have [Music] disappeared [Music] foreign sorry they're trying to get past this slime there we go okay so um what i love sharing about that is just helping you see here's the science behind what we're doing with food and when we're looking at essential oils and the effects of pesticides it's far the effects of utilizing essential oils that have any chemicals or pesticides used in them is far more profound because of the concentration uh so for instance um if we're looking at uh sorry i'm trying to find my stats here we're looking at what goes into a bottle of essential oil 60 000 rose blossoms provide only one ounce of rose oil uh 200 pounds of lavender will provide seven pounds of oil jasmine flowers have to be picked at by hand before before the sun becomes hot on the very first day they open making it one of the most expensive oils in the world a sandalwood tree must be 30 years old and 30 feet high before it can be cut down for distillation and gary young the founder of young living his sandalwood trees must be 90 percent dead before they're harvested so you can see in those statistics the labor involved and um also that whole process if there's any chemicals used in any of that how it's going to deteriorate the quality of the essential oils and you're not getting the the quality that you could have otherwise and when you use an essential oil that has the pesticides you're getting a higher concentration of those chemicals than you would even in your food so it's really important to keep all of those considerations let me go through we actually talked about most of this stuff and so also because of that a little goes a long way um one drop you can dilute with even a tablespoon or more of carrier oil and put that in a rollerball like a perfume rollerball you can you can buy those easily and you can use that over a period of a month which makes them extremely cost effective i want to make note of uh thieves the young living thieves blend because it is an essential oil blend that young living made that is also combined in with their cleaning line so there's an all-purpose cleaner there's laundry detergent and other products that you can use instead of cleaning products that have harsh chemicals added in them so i do a whole class and uh and have videos on creating a toxic free home which features all of that content and the thieves product as well so just to introduce a little bit about how you can get started with young living is some of the benefits of essential rewards so one of the things that's great about the company when you're considering getting essential oils and and one of the other reasons to choose young living is if you're purchasing products regularly on their monthly auto ship program which is what essential rewards is you're going to get 10 back over the first three months and then you'll get 20 back after that so it's an excellent loyalty program and all of that can be used as cash towards other products so it's really a great way to help you get started in in the in using the products and and with a healthier lifestyle i mentioned the thieves product and this is actually a video showing uh someone using it to clean a pan that just has not been able to be cleaned so i'm just going to show that really all right guys so we're trying a little experiment here because we just had a wild moment with lemon oil um getting all the grease off of the bottom of a pan and this pan is particularly difficult like this has been through multiple dishwasher loads been scrubbed multiple times my sister loves to deep fry stuff with coconut oil so it's like not not coming off i mean we have a strawberry chicken shell we're just gonna scrub it and show you that it's it's not going anywhere like this has been through multiple it's one of those things where you scrub it's hard you can it's not going anywhere right so we grab some baking soda it's pure baking soda and thieves now we're not going to use all those these but we'll pour a little bit of each in and yep just like a little sprinkle we'll put a little bit of leaves cleaner in there see if we can make some headway on this pan that's been through the dishwasher so many times so if it's something that i just cook i put a couple of drops of lemon and lemon just makes that pan amazing if it's something that has been there for a while you can't get it off this is my go-to you want to be rachel but even more she wants a nice good taste now we're going to take over the sink let's do a good rinse on it following the pan let's see after multiple dishwasher loads and soap and all the other good things with this really nasty non-scrubbable pan looks like [Music] all right i love showing that because uh who doesn't want to easily clean a pot that has all that grime on it so i show a lot of other examples like that in in the creating a toxic free home class if you want to check out all of those things uh so when we're looking at um our oil safe and also uh how do we start integrating essential oils into our day-to-day lifestyle why why would essential oils be relevant to your your daily use so it's a lot of it has to do with swapping out things that you're already doing or using with something that is natural and just plant uh with essential oils so think about do you use perfumes do you use cologne air fresheners are there scents that you use in your home you know to spray on your carpet or if you have pets do you use candles whether they're scented or not um there's a lot of toxic chemicals and and candles and it's actually can be really harmful just to burn even an unscented candle because it comes from petrochemicals uh the paraffin is is a petrochemical that is melted so you're getting uh actually those chemicals in the air as you're burning it so replacing all of that stuff with the pleasant aroma of something that is just a plant in the air by using a diffuser you will majorly improve your lifestyle and and making positive steps for a healthier lifestyle if you take those steps and then you're looking at how each of the individual oils support different systems in the body and enable the body to uh i would say support the body in its natural healing abilities and you know is an ally that way so you're receiving those benefits as well as that pleasant aroma and being able to get rid of some of the chemicals in your home uh what i just shared there with the thieves cleaning line and young living having actually over 600 different products from personal care products makeup that is mineral based and natural as well as a dental care toothpaste deodorant nutritional supplements they have all of those things that you can consider looking at things you already purchase and start making some small swap outs so that you can get rid of some of the chemicals in your home and improve your health that way so when we're looking at oils themselves you know are they safe i'm talking about how concentrated they are uh the fact that if you apply directly if they're warming oils you could have some chemical burns there that's why i teach this because there are some basic precautions that you can make and anytime you apply an oil to your skin and you're having some kind of reaction you just you know take out a lot of that carrier and just keep applying that and using that oil to kind of cleanse and and soothe anything there and generally that's enough um so there are also some other essential oils that are photosensitive these are generally citrus oils and that means that if you apply them to your skin and go out into the sunlight that you could get blisters under the first layer of the skin so you'll see that there is a caution on those citrus labels to avoid exposure to the sun in the first 12 hours after after using it you can also apply them under your clothing so that it's not exposed to the skin or at night time or don't apply them topically use them aromatically so the other consideration is you know when you're looking at swapping out things and what you're already using do you actually know what is in the in the products that you're already using and if you do some searches to see what those ingredients are and the effects that they have on you they can be you know quite quite negative so if you take some of the simple precautions that i talked about today and you pay attention to your body and of course if you have any medical conditions or medical concerns you talk to your doctor as always and just be responsible with your health then you'll be okay um just pay attention be responsible and continue to get education about all of it and um that's that's the best we can do with anything so one of the other points to make is that uh some statistics with the average woman applies over 300 chemicals every day to her body just through soaps makeup shampoo hair care products and oftentimes 80 of these are even before breakfast so if you really start thinking about what you're doing um you know and making some changes if you look at young living essential oils you're using just one ingredient like lemon oregano tangerine you don't have the synthetic additives so some of this might be a little bit overwhelming and might be wondering where do i start if this is new to you and that's why we have the young living starter kit um instead of trying to select i'll get this oil or that oil which oil do i need what's great about this starter kit is it has 12 different oils and each of them are versatile enough that they support different systems different needs obviously they have different aromas so it's a great way to get introduced into the company and all of these are the company's most popular essential oils as well so they're ones that people keep coming back to to get more of so i want to take a few minutes to mention the specific oils and just some highlight some quick uses i don't have a lot of time to go through that but what you're getting in the kit is frankincense and all of the bottles of essential oil are 5 ml 5 milliliter frankincense is one of the top skin oils and between the frankincense and the valor essential oil the cost of that if you were to get that separate just individually the cost for both of these those are actually the full cost that you're getting for this kit so this kit cost 165 and um that's majorly discounted if you were to get all of these things individually you're looking at more than four hundred dollars so getting this collection to start is also going to be the most economical it also means that you become a member with young living which simply means that you get an ongoing 24 discount on any of young living products so you really don't i it doesn't make any sense to go another way to become a member you have to get a starting kit a starter kit there's a couple different kit options this is the best essential oil option and with the membership there's no other requirements for membership you continue to get a lifetime 24 discount um and if you if you go inactive at some point you just simply place an order to to reactivate your account so frankincense um is one of the key ingredients in young living's brain power oil it's great to diffuse it prayer time to help with grounding and purpose and it's great for focusing lavender essential oil is included this is useful for relaxation it's soothing and calming great to add to some some carrier oil in a bath and it's really has many uses it's considered the swiss army knife of essential oils because of that peppermint vitality oil if you look in this photo you'll see the weight label vitality oils that's what i was speaking to earlier this is a great support for any uh digestive discomfort you can dilute and apply topically and of course you can bake or cook with it citrus fresh vitality is a mix of orange tangerine grapefruit lemon mandarin and mint which gives it a nice uh very unique aroma as well with the citruses and mint thieves vitality includes rosemary clove lemon eucalyptus and cinnamon and that is the essential oil that is used in the thieves cleaning line as well as in their hand sanitizer and we like to diffuse this a lot to support our immune system peace and calming is a great emotional support for exactly what it says to enable a greater state of peace and calm stress away is a mix of vanilla and lime aroma and uh it's just a great one as an emotional support as well if you're having a lot of stress rub it on the base of your feet or use in your diffuser lemon vitality this is also a great versatile essential oil useful as a tonic for the body great to get anything sticky off of uh you know anything you have some sticker on the cabinet or the floor or some kind of container and use the lemon essential oil to get that goo off pan away uh this one has a wintergreen and uh i'm gonna forget the other ones but the primary smell in it is wintergreen and we use this as a support for your your muscles and and muscle pain digize vitality is supportive for digestive health in the digestive system raven blend um and i'd also say digize has fennel in it um which is an herb known to be supportive for for the gut raven blend has raven sarah peppermint and eucalyptus radiata and that's supportive of you know chest and the throat has a soothing aroma and then lastly you'll see a couple other samples in here you'll see the ninja red that is wolfberry juice that you can drink and the wolfberry is actually a fruit that is the highest antioxidant in the world so there are other fruit juices blended into this as well other essential oils and it's really a great supplement to the body and great tasting as well you'll see a one ounce sample of the thieves han sanitizer which is 99.9 percent effective at killing germs includes the thieves it's infused with the thieves blend has aloe vera and 65 alcohol and then the thieves spray which is a great uh thing to have when you're going to the store to use on your grocery cart or a quick cleaning of knobs or anything else like that especially uh during these covet times uh and and it has 70 percent alcohol in it as well uh two things that that alcohol can't with either of those or what the cdc recommends using for cleaning all right and then i i also did not mention a valor blend that essential oil we love this one as an emotional support to help you with feeling a sense of groundedness self-assuredness uh it's a very popular aroma with blue tansy and black spruce in it as well uh most people really love the aroma of that one on there to the next slide that's gonna let me there we go okay sorry we'll keep going through these so again that starter kit is uh 165 uh which is a great value for everything that you're getting there you have everything you need to get get started and okay the three cabinet challenge so this is basically looking at three cabinets in your your house that you have cleaning products in pull them out see what they are and go to the young living site and see see what you can replace it with that thieves all-purpose cleaner i use as a window cleaner glass cleaner and mopping the floors for every purpose in my bathroom if i need to scrub it i use baking soda and i go through all of that in my creating a toxic free home class but um start looking at what's actually in your home and how you can make some simple changes and we actually have if you get the any of the starter kits we have this great challenge because some people get the starter kit and they're just like this is great but i don't know what to do and this walks you through some challenges of how you can start using your kit making making things with it make blends with it and just have some fun with it as well so there's also the option of being able to get your oils for free get them paid for that is simply um being able to share the share essential oils and refer people that you know or you encounter to young living and then getting compensated with that we won't go into detail with that you don't have to do that but if you want to or you're concerned about cost then there's some things that we can talk about with that so lastly we made good time here is how do you how do you get the oils so um you know we've talked about what they are the power of them um the alternatives which is you know using what you already are which is likely going to have some some toxicity in it and swapping some of that stuff out with essential oils getting rid of the candles or the fragrances um and receiving the benefits of the essential oils too so if you want to take the next step to actually getting the essential oils the way that you do that is you go to youngliving.com so that's y o u n g l i i libing.com click on become a member there's a tab there somewhere click on become a member and select the starter kit that works

or process for 30 days from the date that you purchase your starter kit so it's really risk free and a lot of times people say i'm not sure about this yet but as soon as they get the starter kit they love it and they didn't enroll in essential rewards and they kind of kicked themselves because there wasn't any risk and a month later they're buying they're opting into the essential words anyhow and

the request", "ujnlqkkQSDA": "so I guess my announcement is that some of you know this already because you were there but last week the the reduced risk pesticide list was approved by the Commission on the environment and final approval for the year so as a reminder okay it's so tired of hearing on these as a reminder every year we have work meetings we go through the list we try to take the bad stuff out put the good stuff in and and then we run it through a public hearing where we actually have a public hearing not devoted to the list per se but to general IPM activities on city properties and then we introduce the list to our Commission on the environment they have the power to approve disapprove or change this list and it's important for us to make sure we have transparency with the public and you know kind of the conversation going between city staff in particular and the public and that's what the Commission meetings are for they've been really extensive the past couple of years as you know because of the roundup issue this year yet I I feel like the pressure or the participation at least lightened up a bit and there were actually there was no opposition in the room last week at the Commission meeting for whatever reason I like to think that we're getting the word out that you all are doing a great job and everyone's committed to all this so happy about that the confusing potentially confusing thing now though is that the schedule has changed so we're not it's no longer a 2018 approved list or reduced risk pesticide list it's just the current list and they'll be in list last update last updated on it so this is just to ease other people's confusion when we had a 2017 labeled list and it's 2018 and what happened am I looking at the right list there's only one list posted it the current list approved last week the next time we'll have to visit this is gonna be next summer starting in July so it's a July August where August September get a process so that's that's where it's at and what I'm gonna do right now is is go through quickly what some what the Commission saw a few of things a few the slides that the Commission saw for those of you who have already seen it you can like play with your cell phone or something and mostly just highlight what the changes are in the list they're pretty minor but there's a couple that you really need to know about so just FYI this is this is the trends the pesticide use trends most up to date the red are Tier one products at the time of use so you'll see this is 2010 here all leading up through the full year of 2017 and in 2015 is when glyphosate became a Tier one product so a lot of what you see is yellow and these previous bars are now red right and it's it's it's the right trend this is all in City pesticide use it doesn't include public health East which wouldn't make a difference on this one so much but the Tier you know helps us focus our efforts and if you add up all pesticide use for Tier one products in city it's been a ninety six percent reduction and for that you know you guys can give yourselves a little hand I think cuz that's amazing and the the key here though is that last for explaining that last four percent you know or communicating why we don't have complete elimination of Tier one products is always challenge and that's what we tried to do in the Commission meeting we cited some of the data in human terms this is rec park only all parks sixty gallons of active ingredient in 2010 if you you know active ingredients like 53% I think with roundup custom it's different for different products so this is mostly Roundup or glyphosate and darlin and turf lon and in 2017 1.8 gallons on 3,500 acres of land for active ingredient right so you multiply that a few times for what's in the bottle but that's great and and that's something I think the commissioners really heard and you know that last four percent it's all about stubborn weed problems that looks stubborn have any we've ever done this yeah thumbs down okay ciabatta grass and rec park had some great examples of sort of this this last four percent problem and you know i talked about all the trainings we've been having and tried to get good photos of you all was really hard and and also pointed out and i don't maybe you haven't don't know about this yet but we we have a new dashboard for reporting use data it's interactive it's better than the last interactive one we had it's on the website you can fiddle around with it and look at the data in a lot of different ways and it lets us update things a lot easier now i we used to have to do weeks of checking for like we are unit issues and so forth and now we've got a lot of it automated so that's good i reported to the commission about about other cities are updated in monitor city other cities and their progress you may know richmond had a has a total pesticide ban and their the city staff has been asking them to roll it back because it's not meeting their needs at this point that's what we've been hearing her vine had an ordinance allowing only organic products and some of those were a danger labeled unfortunately they are returning this year to a limited use of some products that we wouldn't use actually especially I think bindweed was a big one a lot of median strip problems they have a lot of median strips a lot of boulevards so the point there was no one no city our size has been able to completely ban the the Tier one products but we've been really upfront in reducing it and restricting it and reducing it yeah you all have been really out front I told them about future activities this is really just I'm skimming through this because you know it all but we're still emphasizing all holistic programs like Bay friendly where we're not just thinking about pesticides but we're thinking about what what we're planning and water conservation and all that stuff biodiversity and we are now you know going into the future we're working more on pest prevention by design in affordable housing and a pest tech we're looking for funding for this but we're gonna do some of it no matter what in phase four of the rad affordable housing conversions so that's turning SF public housing it's it's sort of a semi privatization of it it's but it allows for renovations of some really nasty nasty housing situations and we're building pest prevention into that and some of you are involved in this too we have the ongoing pest prevention guidelines for landscapes that we're slowly churning our way through one meeting per month it's this is not funded either so it means it goes a little slow but it is happening and then Public Works had our a report on their activities rec Park report on their activities and here's what I actually have this up here for is just to clarify what the new changes are to the list the list itself is all posted now I'll send you an email later today with the link but it is on our website now as a reminder the current restrictions on Tier one products are listed here the 15 feet from paths restriction the more requirement for more specific notice public notice blue indicator dyes no use on blackberries no use for purely cosmetic purely cosmetic purposes which is it tough one no broadcast spraying with a boom except on the golf course Harding Park no you sunny areas frequented by children which you weren't doing anyway or a requirement to make sure that the contractors are on board when we have a landscape contractor in particular they have to know what's going on and also the requirement for directs or excuse me supervision by a certified applicator when there's Tier one herbicide being used and that means someone has to be on site with the license we are we went through all that in previous years and a lot of those were due to public request or partially due to public request and we wanted to highlight that for the Commission because they want that's one thing that's really important for them is to know that we're listening to them and to the public the changes are some of those are now expanded to all or besides and really some of these makes sense anyway I mean if you're gonna expand public notice you should just expand it for any herbicide treatment out in the parks so people want to know where exactly things are being treated not just a sign that says weeds right it should be a sign that says kind of let's see blackberry along this trail 510 feet along this trail or something that so they know where it is so that's all herbicides blue indicator dyes for all our besides the public Commission wanted an expansion of the Berry's definition to anything human edible so that's mostly blackberries but there might be a few little stray I don't know gonna have shad berries up around there I'd be a few huckleberries I don't know you're not doing it anyway but it's now an official restriction and the contractor training which should be happening no matter what I mean the contractors need to know that we have these restrictions so these are now in place and approved by the Commission and we have ten months of not worrying about this whole thing which took a huge amount of time by the way but it's worth it there's also a prohibition I should have said on greenroofs and greenwalls and that's really because we want to understand what what it means to manage these things first of all we assume that you don't need it on a green roof green roof we really hope they don't need it on a green roof because it's right next to where someone's working or living but if they do we want to hear an exemption request right so we know how this should be restricted and and then we tighten the form at the list it's more logical now so some of you already went through this a year ago almost but we we added we added a generic boric acid ant bait Tier one smoke bombs for rats those were the two tier ones that were added the rest of it is mostly administrative I mean mostly product name changes addition of some tier two products that are potential alternatives to glyphosate and like lifeline for example in as machs so that's all posted I'm not going to go through the whole list with you here I just wanted to let you know that it's all it's all happening it's all done for this year I did want to just say that one reason one reason we really wanted to get someone to talk about palm trees is because it's been an ongoing challenge for a lot of people to to deal with pest management problems that come up with palm tree that are the wrong species or in the wrong place and usually it's an extremely expensive operation to replace them and I you know we've had this come up numerous times over the past 15 years and we haven't had the chance to bring in someone who actually knows about palm trees and can talk about what we should be paying attention to when we're choosing what to plant and you know what what the site characteristics are like and what are the best species and so forth so I'm really happy Jason you could join us today thank you thank you very much let's see if I can clip this on so I am a plant person and I'm here to talk to you about palms which are my expertise area of expertise having volunteered here at the Botanical Garden for a long long time and I am I've been at flora Grubb Gardens which you may know is a retail nursery down in the Bayview District we have a wholesale operation in Southern California where we grow palm trees and other kinds of palms not all palms or trees which I'll discuss can you work that thank you so as you know the healthiest plant is the plant that's best adapted to the site it's planted in and that's best cared for a lot of the commercial palms in California are grown in Southern California and are better adapted for hotter climates than the one that we're in some are adapted to San Francisco but San Francisco has an unusual climate compared to other urban areas of California aside from say Monterey and Santa Cruz so the plump the palms that we get from from the general commercial growers may not be the right palm for the site in San Francisco they may be but they may not be my book is about designing with palms and it targets designers as well as palm fanatics and plant collectors for the designers what I'm helping them do is choose the right species for their designs so for our purposes the book actually addresses that same question choosing the right species for a location so as to avoid some of the pests and fungal diseases that we get on palms so I'm gonna go through and describe a little bit about the palm family and show you a lot of beautiful pictures taken by my collaborator Caitlyn Atkinson any ugly pictures are taken by me in this slideshow I don't want to attribute the ugly pictures to Caitlyn but I did include a bunch of new photos into this slideshow so this goes very cool and moist right and it's not caught it's not common to find this was super mild climate anywhere else in North America aside from coastal California but there are other places in the world including some of the high altitude cities in the Andes from which a lot of the plants you see literally right out the door here come and so that is the source for some of the palms that actually are better suited to our climate then the ones often miss planted so those are just a few bits of information before I get into it so the palm tends to have an iconic shape and image people know what a palm tree looks like if you're five years old you can probably scratch out a palm tree it's one of the earliest plants depicted in human art there are ancient petroglyphs in North Africa and in Saudi Arabia of palms 5,000 6,000 years old some of the oldest coins in the Western tradition have palms on them part of the reason for that is that palms date palms and specific represent a source of food and shelter and a place where water is available when you're living in the Middle East and the desert this this plant that has been under cultivation as long as figs and olives and pomegranates is the tree of life well this is the Tree of Life for the tropical Pacific and Indian Oshin this is the coconut palm palms are the third most economically important plant family after grasses and legumes so when you think of grasses you think obviously of wheat and corn and all the other staples rice and then legumes are being so soybeans and all the other beans palms are the next on that list we're not super conscious of that here in more northerly latitudes but wherever palms grow the people who live among them use them and in some cases use an innumerable set of parts to that palm so for example in India the palmyra palm is celebrated for having 800 different uses in an ancient poem and the coconut palm probably has you know three or four hundred different uses it ranges from food there's water in those coconuts there's materials that you can use to build for example a thatched roof you can even use the trunks to build posts that will last for some years you can make wine and sugar out of them so just a sense that palms for us tend to be ornamental plants but for a lot of the rest of the world palms are workhorses so here in California the most common palm that we see is the palm on the right which is the mexican fan palm Washingtonian Oh Busta it's native to Central Baja California it's unbelievably adaptable I like to call it the cockroach of Palms it will grow anywhere from foggy coastal California down to Baja California it'll grow in Florida it'll grow in Hawaii all of these places in the US it is very easy to grow super fast growing it hangs onto its dead leaves for the for the majority of its life at least within our cultivation timeframe and it can be a problem because it's got these dead leaves that hang on to it and in a in a landscape it's it's helpful to remove those and it takes a lot of effort to do so and it can be dangerous they do reach a certain age at which they start to lose their leaves spontaneously when they're dying when the leaves are dying and so that plant on the right in that photograph from Santa Monica is actually at the stage where the the dead leaves just peel right off and some of those Washingtonian rebus does next in fan Palms in San Francisco are doing the same so around the 16th and mission and 24th and mission BART stations those are some of the tallest oldest ones in San Francisco and they are actually kind of at the age where they'll hang onto a few leaves but they mostly just drop the dead leaves at this stage in the middle is a hybrid between the one on the Left which is our native desert fan palm so the palm on the left with the skirts the the shag that photograph was taken in the indian canyons tribal park up above palm springs it's just a 10 minute drive outside of Palm Springs this is the the palm that's native to California and Arizona it's also native to northern Baja California this is a palm that you'll see all over the place from reading down to obviously down into the low desert it's super cold hardy but it is not very tolerant of humid coastal conditions even in Southern California and it's prone to Diamond scale so occasionally you'll see this SPECT and planted in San Francisco and for the most part those plants those palms the desert fan palms planted in San Francisco are not long for this world because they get this diamond scale on these humid conditions of marine layer which eventually kind of eats away at them and they they get weakened and then they're killed off by any number of other fungal diseases particularly pink rot so at the park in Hayes Valley there are four of these planted and they're just slowly dwindling so that's a classic example of species selection that doesn't work for the benefit of the plant and the landscape but there are alternatives to this plant so the middle plant is the hybrid between the two species and that one has some of the tolerance for the humid conditions that the mexican fan palm on the right has and you can sort of see in that photograph the two palms in the middle are the hybrid and then those ones off in the distance are the mexican fan palm the skinny or taller one so that's just one example of how species selection can you prevent or avoid some of the fungal diseases but there are some other downsides on the Mexican fan palm that are have more to do with appearance that I can talk about a little bit later so the effort here is to look more closely at palms and so the that iconic picture both here in California and here down in Florida kind of gets in the way of our really examining like what are palms what are the parts of palms what forms - palms take their twenty five hundred species they range from being little understory plants in the rainforest or in a you know just any kind of forest little tiny plants that you might mix up with a fern - bamboo like clusters little like sort of shrubby palms that have really thin bamboo like stems there are vining palms so rattan which you know of as the material used for furniture and some other uses there are three or four hundred species of these rattan palms down in Southeast Asia as well as down in tropical America those are palms but they're just climbing up in the in the rainforest and you wouldn't necessarily notice them as palms and then there are other kinds of shrubby palms palms that just grow leaves out of a stem that stays underground that stays in the soil and and then shrubby palms that that are kind of low but still make trunk so you end up with kind of a Paradise Island effect if you prune and groom them correctly and I'll show you pictures of those as well so yes we talk about palm trees but in fact the diversity of the palm family and the forms that it takes is quite high and botanists consider the palm family to be a rather diverse plant family so this is sort of the the classic view of Palms and a landscape they're very tropical looking palms are the sort of superlative foliage plant they have the biggest leaf in the plant kingdom 80 feet long as the tallest longest leaf in the plant sorry in the plant kingdom and it is a palm from East Africa on the Left we have a fan palm called Bismarck iya on the right we have a feather palm from called BEC REO Phoenix both of these are from Attica a scar so the two big divisions and the palm family are the fans and the feathers the fans on the left the feathers on the right the fan I was talking about with the Mexican fan palm the feather is that coconut palm the first slide this is if you don't have a fan shaped leaf or a feather shaped leaf on a plant it's probably not a palm so sometimes we look at cordyline Australis and we call it a Dracaena palm but the leaves on that plant are they're spear shaped or dagger shaped they don't have that complex feather or fan shape also that is a branching plant and palms in our palate do not branch I'll show you a picture of a palm that does naturally branch so this is an alternative view of how palms can be used in a landscape this is a landscape in Santa Monica that silvery fan palm that is a shrub down in the grasses with the meadow II vegetation is naturally a shrub it has multiple stems that arise from the same root stock it's called camera ops humilis Argentia the blue Mediterranean fan palm it's native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and Algeria and it's one of these incredibly Hardy to cold and to drought plants and it happens to be a palm and it has some really good uses in the landscape and it's a pretty hard plant to kill so far we haven't really seen any big problems with it it's fairly new to the market it's about twenty years into the market it is a blue form of the much more common green Mediterranean fan palm which we have been seeing for many many decades but probably centuries in California so anyway this is a vision of using palms in a landscape that kind of defies that tropical stereotype part of the effort of my book is to defy the tropical stereotype get people to think about using palms in different contexts because they have particular aesthetic and functional uses in a landscape design what's that that one you can call the blue Mediterranean fan palm or the blue Atlas Mountains does great I planted a gorilla planted don't tell the police too little three gallons of the of that species in a sandy little median that had gone unplanted right before the big five-year drought that we had so it got about two months of rain and those plants are still growing and they're living in sand and there they got rain they've had only rainfall in their entire life I can't tell you they're growing fast but they're doing perfectly fine and they look fine so that's as tough as a plant gets in San Francisco so the effort I would love to see is to expand the palette of palms that we use in San Francisco they're not going away of course Isle of Palms a lot of people hate palms I think part of the reason for that is there's such bold plants so a friend of mine a designer whose work is in the book talks about how especially these fan palms embody this kind of explosive energy it's like you took a photograph of an explosion in in the midst of happening you know in the middle of that explosion and you've got all this energy this radial energy popping out and in this case on the left and this this is called a blue Mexican fan palm so different from that Mediterranean found bomb this is actually from Baja California it grows as close as 10 miles from the California border it actually grows in the same habitat as that desert fan palm the native one but it happens to be more tolerant of our conditions here on the coast it's more drought tolerant slower growing not as big in in any case the introduction of new species I think will help avoid some of the pest problems that weed that we see on the palms this one on the Left this bruh heya Armada the Mexican blue palm is growing down in Atherton where temperatures in this garden have dropped below 20 degrees more than once in the 20 years the 25 years that the gardener's been working there and what you see coming out of that crown are the flower stalks to hundreds of thousands of flowers on those flower stalks really great source of nectar and pollen for pollinators and again it's a really well it's a palm that's really well suited to California ornamental landscapes probably better away from the ocean I must admit based it's desert desert origin so I've seen them do better on the east side of San Francisco not so great over here on the west side of San Francisco on the right is the andean wax palm this is a photograph taken in Ventura this is a palm in the genus Ciroc salon all the members of this genus are from the mountains of South America from the Andes they range from Venezuela down to Bolivia they are all high altitude relatively high altitude palms one of the species in this genus of the wax palms is from an altitude of 11,500 feet so consider you know that's that's as high higher than Tioga Pass in the Assembly but it's on the equator so the temperatures there are quite cool year-round if you go any higher than where that plant grows they get frost on many nights of the year in habitats this this particular species is also from a relatively high altitude these are cloud forest palms so again these are palms from areas where a lot of the plant material you see in the Botanical Garden comes from a lot of our best ornamental plants in California or sorry in San Francisco come from these cloud forest habitats and this Botanical Garden actually has the best collection of this genus outside of South America because our climate is so well suited to this genus so palms are flowering plants they're monocots they're related to grasses orchids lilies bromeliads agaves aloes all the monocots so they don't make secondary growth in their trunks they're not really woody trees the stem on a palm has xylem and phloem growing or moving in a spiral up the trunk the basically the entire trunk is sort of olive with the vessels and they were very fibrous they have a tremendous tensile strength if you think of Anderson Cooper reporting from a hurricane the plants in his background are usually palm trees blowing around in the wind the leaves are very flexible the trunks are very flexible they may shed their leaves during a really severe wind event occasionally they'll be uprooted but less commonly they'll be broken they don't break very easily there's some exceptions to that but in general palm stems are quite flexible and very strong so occasionally I'll be hired for a consultation project where homeowners or you know homeowners association they're concerned about the height of their palm tree they're worried that it might break or fall over that's really the least of their worries but because they've got such a tall stem in some cases like that Mexican fan palm and because there's this crown blowing around up above they look kind of out of kilter to people but in fact they're very well suited to the structure that they have nonetheless the the photograph on the right shows a flower stock popping out of a protective casing bracht again probably thousands of flower buds on that flower stock this is growing in Walnut Creek it's a member of the genus Budhia and on the right photo just a picture from Hawaii of palms growing kind of like grassy little seedlings so just a hint at their event their genetic relationship to other monocots to grasses and other monocots photograph of some pollination going on on a sable palm on the left on the right fruit in December on our native desert fan palm so they're their plants they have ecological relationships they they are involved in the web of life they're not just these sort of architectural elements that come in on a flatbed truck and get planted like Pretty Maids in a row so on the right in this oasis down by Palm Springs these fruits are gonna be used by the Coyotes the foxes as the western blue birds and the leaves are gonna be used by hooded Orioles to make their nests they're hanging nests and of course the people of the desert use the palm so the the people in the KOA Indian tribes you like take advantage of all the different elements of of that beautiful fan palm that we think of as an ornamental for shoes for shelter they even use the fruits for food there's a flower made out of the seed the fruit itself is sweet and can be made into a sweet beverage so again even in California there are important human relationships with palms and of course that relates to us and as much as we want to make sure that you know when people are interacting with palms they're not interacting with a you know as little as possible a plant that's had to be sprayed with a pesticide or a fungicide and so by choosing the right plant we're not we're putting ourselves in that position much less frequently so an illustration again of what palms are and what palms are not so on the left the photograph shows tricky Karpis Wagner II on us in a garden and Guerneville as a super Hardy cold cold hardy fan palm from Japan and China so up in the upper left corner is the palm you can see the fan leaf down in the center of the photograph that blueish crown yucca is not a palm if you look at the leaf form it is dagger shaped or spear shaped but it does have that sort of palm form it's got a trunk down below that little straw colored section and then oh goody I can use this and then and then the crown up above so not a palm palm on the right this might look like a palm because it's got that feather shaped leaf but if you look carefully at the way the leaves are emerging from this cycad down in Georgia they're all coming out at once and they're uncurling almost in the manner of a fern fiddlehead so palms have a single leaf emerging at the center at all times in from a spear like structure and unfolding into the newest leaf so that fron you can see the unfolding process under way the stuff is still folded together up here but on the apical end of the leaf it's unfolded and then here's the next spear coming up so that illustrates you the way that palms develop there's one bud at the top of each stem so if it's a single single stem palm tree like a Mexican fan palm it only has one bud way up there in the crown so if that bud is damaged it's gonna take a while to recover and if it's cut off it's not gonna branch it there's no new bud that's gonna form on the side of the stem there's again there's no secondary growth on the stems of Palms and then on the right is just an illustration of kind of the folded miss the way if you carefully at a palm leaf it is an unfolded leaf so there's a fan and there's a feather in the back photograph that one from Hawaii again just another illustration this one photographed here in the Botanical Garden this happens to be that species from the highest altitude this is Ciroc salon parva fronds and again this is the leaf that's unfolding at the moment and then this was probably the last leaf to unfold and then as time goes on each leaf has its career photosynthesizing and is displaced from above by the newest leaves and then eventually dies off and falls off on the right is just a fan-shaped leaf from another palm it's just steps away from here this is called tricky carpus princeps but again you get the sense for each part each segment of the leaf is a single fold same over here each segment is a single fold there are a couple of unusual species that that have a slightly different structure to the leaf so this is called a fishtail palm this is Kerry Oda gigas or Kerry Oda obtuse ax of which there are a few here in the Botanical Garden this is from the mountains of Southeast Asia and it has the the primary feather shape and then the secondary feather shape composing the primary feather shape if that makes sense so the leaflets come off of like a secondary rib that comes off of that primary rib so here's the primary rib in the secondary rib and then all along here are these little leaflets that look like some say fish tails I prefer to think of it as like a pectoral fin on a fish and then on the right another species that's blooming and fruiting here in the Botanical Garden so this genus happens to grow in the manner of say an agave where it has a vegetative phase it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and then it has a flowering and fruiting phase after which it dies so that's also something to keep in mind when you're dealing with palms in the landscape particularly this would be say in a park setting where you're gonna have to take this plant down when it's done with its lifespan just as you would like a big agave so that genus is called carry Oda and it's the fishtail palm it's the only genus that has that bipinnate structure the secondary feather shape so this is another variation on the fan palm so there's basically two variations on the fan palm there's the plane pinnate leaf which is where the segments all meet at the center of the blade of the leaf right there like there's a little buckle and they all they all converge on that center point and then there's the cost of palm eight leaf so the cost of palm 8 leaf is a it's also a fan shaped leaf but there's a there's a rib which is the Latin word for their cost as the Latin rib for Latin word for ribs scuse me so that rib runs down the middle of the blade and so some of the segments converge on the rib and some of them converge right in the center which is hard to see in this picture this is a sable or asana from sonora this is also growing down on Atherton also tolerated temperatures below 20 degrees so I'm giving you this information so that you can distinguish between different kinds of palm trees and once your once you're in San Francisco and you've got so few different palms that you see in the landscape it's a lot easier to use these tools okay so the parts of a palm leaf include the sheath so this is over here this is called the knee cow palm this is from the native New Zealand palm these are growing here in the Botanical Garden this is the sheath of the leaf the sheath surrounds the trunk and it connects to the trunk in a ring and then there's also the petiole of the leaf which I will show you here so the petiole is that kind of branch like structure that connects to the trunk and then there's the blade of the leaf which would be where all the leaflets are this is the blade this is the petiole and these are the leaf bases or the sheath so the sheath takes different forms on the knee cow it's an entire fleshy photosynthesizing part of the leaf on some of the palms a lot of the palms that we see in California only one part of the sheath is still alive and photosynthesizing and connecting the entire leaf to the trunk and the rest of the sheath kind of disintegrates so in a Chinese windmill palm you might know the furry trunked palm the sheath disintegrates into a fibrous mass like a it's almost like the it's like a natural form of a fabric but nonetheless that is connected all the way around the trunk in a ring just as that perfectly green sheath here is it just takes on a different form but now it's still connected when it when the leaves are alive they're still connected and delivering water and taking sugars down into the trunk so on this palm you can see below the crown the remnants of those old leaf bases the stubs that are still dried out and stuck to the trunk and that would have been where the live vessels were on those old leaves so the roots of Palms are fibrous they're wiry they are not very thick and they experience no secondary thickening which means that when a when a palm root emerges from the base of the trunk it is at its thickest diameter and from there it will start to branch so as they branch those branches are thinner and thinner and thinner as they go farther from the trunk this is why palms are relatively easy to transplant as large plants because they continually make new roots from the base of the trunk so on these Washingtonians in Walnut Creek you can see the many little fibrous roots that are coming out from the base and how they're easily intermingling with each other because of their fibrous nature because they don't have any secondary thickening they can't really strangle themselves also those roots have a career kind of the way the leaf has a career so the roots will eventually some of those roots that are the oldest roots will give up and they be a part of the The Palms functioning as much anymore and they'll be succeeded by the new roots that are continually emerging for the base of the trunk again this is why palms are relatively easy to transplant as large specimens not all palms are but many are this is an example of still root palms from a tropical environment these are called walking palms they're two of them and again you can see the way that their roots are kind of intermingling with each other this is just a really blatant illustration of how the root emerges from the base of the stem there's no tap root etc and then on the right as an example of roots coming out along the trunk of the tree so way up above the the soil line and their function is actually not to absorb moisture and nutrients their function in this case is to fend off herbivores they've got spines so you can see the branching habit of the root and at the tip of each of these roots is a spine and their job is really much more about defense than it is about absorption of course down under the soil line it has regular roots that are doing their regular job so just a of the fishtail palm and some some kenty of palms which are how we a force triana in a nursery in boxes illustrating that palms can be maintained in small spaces with some success although in general they're happier once they get in the ground and this is a shot from the Transbay Transit Center with Washingtonian bust of the mexican fan palm planted at a large size in order to achieve a big impact early on in the growth of the park these have root ball anchors as do some of the other tall palms in the park in order to sis to keep them secure while the roots get established into the medium there no generally the hybrid is half as prone to the diamond scale and so unless you really need a thicker heavier trunked palm I would have not avoided but it wouldn't be a over the Mexican fan foam so a great planting of the hybrid is in front of the ballpark so those palm trees in front of the ballpark are the hybrid between the desert fan palm and the Mexican fan palm so here's that shot I promised you of the naturally branching palm this is a genus from Africa and India called hyphae knee and it naturally branches in this dichotomous fashion so the next round of branching is going to be equal to this to this branching so that it'll go up in perfectly symmetrical branches I think the maximum number that's been counted is like 32 or something it's quite an extraordinary sight on the right is the australian fan palm live a stone Australis photographed at the Huntington Botanical Garden in Pasadena so this is a really useful palm for us that's rarely ever seen it's a fast growing fan palm it's not susceptible to the diseases that we see on the Washingtonian and it'll tolerate cooler conditions than The Washingtonian likes particularly in shade it can it can grow fine and under a large canopy the only big old established tree in public in San Francisco is on top of Lafayette Park underneath the canopy and blue gums so this is again we're looking for different species to use this is a good option instead of say a Washingtonian air say on the west side of San Francisco in the fog belt it's not gonna look so good it's gonna grow slowly this one is not gonna suffer those same problems an example of that vining palm this is here in the Botanical Garden this is a type of rattan palm they are fiercely armed quite beautiful but you don't want it in your garden so look at all these stems climbing into this photinia tree other examples of palm forms that we don't see so often in San Francisco this is in the Botanical Garden right over here this is a bamboo palm cama Doria Costa Rica na very well-suited to California and particularly coastal California I'm sorry and San Francisco and then this is another camera Doria this is camera Doria stolen if uh this one grows also kind of like a bamboo palm but it's so small that it's almost a ground cover and this is a perfect example of the forms that palms take that we're just not familiar with as much because we think about that icon the coconut palm or the date palm and then if you look carefully at this leaf you'll see that it is feather shaped it's just that the segments those folds are not divided from each other you can also see the stolons for which it's named so it's got these these stems that kind of climb outward from the center of the of the clump and they make new stems coming up here so that's how it spreads not very aggressively but nonetheless enough to function in this garden as a kind of ground cover this is camera dori micro spadix this is another kind of bamboo palm this is a garden and cal hollow so the habitats of Palms often include in especially in North America pines and Oaks this is not something we think about very much in California but in fact here in Florida you can see the slash pine pinus le ah di as the canopy over Sabal Palmetto which is the state tree of cal of Florida and South Carolina the Palmetto and then underneath hard to see in this light there is a ground dwelling palm called Sarah Noah repins the saw palmetto and so this is just a very natural assemblage of species in habitat and so is this again in the indian canyons tribal park up above palm springs this is our native desert fan palm growing with the deciduous trees in fall foliage that are also native to this drainage so this is our native California sycamore these are some cottonwood trees these are some willow trees this is a slide just to give you a sense for how palms grow in habitat they aren't all tropical lowland evergreen forests dwelling plants they're not just tropical beach plants so this is a an example to of how to manage a palm from a young age into an older age so this is called bruh heya Clara same species same garden too like five years apart so when when this is a rosette plant in in in sight it takes up a lot of space because the leaves come out they splay out and so the this is flora Grubbs garden my boss's garden in Berkeley so what she did was she pruned the lower leaves carefully she didn't cut too much into the crown but she pruned the lower leaves enough that she could have space around the palm to use the open space that's next to it and then as the palm got older she didn't have to prune the leaves as much and in general with a palm you don't want to prune green leaves very much because it takes away from the vigor of the plant it can reduce the the health of the plant it can alter the taper of the trunk and it can expose the plant to pathogens especially airborne fungal spores so you know she took a risk it wasn't a big risk but a minor risk and made it a very livable space of course in our parks and other areas it's very important to have space around the palm and these are armed so there are thorns on these petioles not a huge deal but nonetheless best to keep those a little bit out of the way of the public so here underneath the canopy of this plant you've got space because it's been allowed to grow up a little bit she didn't print it down to two or three leaves she just she left like ten leaves in the crown and it was able to grow speedily enough to develop that crown I'm sorry that trunk and make space for her to hang out okay so instead of The Washingtonian I'd love to see you people use the Guadalupe palm so this is the palm that's on the median of Cesar Chavez this is the palm that's in the southwest corner of Dolores Park this is a palm from Guadalupe Island which is the southernmost outpost of the California floristic province meaning this is a California native by the measure of biogeography it is a plant that grows in habitat with a race of the Monterey pine it grows with Wray be sanguine ium it grows with a lot of our native ferns it grows with ceanothus it grows with Artemisia californica this is a plant super well-suited to coastal California and even the inland California to some degree it's super cold hardy it doesn't get very tall it's not very fast-growing it doesn't have thorns on the on the petiole and as it ages it sheds its dead leaves spontaneously so this is a plant that I find to be more pleasing in the fog belt it's much better adapted to the cool summers it's also super drought tolerant and it's not particularly prone to Diamond scale which is the thing that takes down the Washingtonian flyff era and the hybrid so this is one that I really urge people to choose over The Washingtonian in many cases another photo from habitat this is in South Carolina again the Palmetto the state tree of South Carolina Sabal Palmetto growing with for the the Quercus virginiana the southern live oak and with the loblolly pine on the coast of outside of Charleston another palm that's used insufficiently in California overall is the butea palm Budhia odorata this is from Uruguay and Brazil it's super cold hardy it's tough as nails it's drought tolerant it also makes edible fruit at least on the east side of San Francisco that's delicious but it will tolerate the foggy belt quite well it called the jelly palm and it kind of has this flavor in between like a loquat and plum it's actually delicious it's one of the few ornamental plants with edible fruits it's actually delicious so I I was down in our growing grounds tasting a couple different ones last week so again The Washingtonian robusto so question about pruning The Washingtonian robust done a lot of palms can actually have their leaf bases pruned to reveal that ringed trunk and as long as that cut isn't deep into the stem you can avoid problems with the fungal diseases that fly on the wind these are newly planted and so they've got relatively small crowns you know after a palm is dug from the field it's gonna lose a lot of its surface area on the roots and the Crown's gonna die back and then it'll regrow from that single bud up at the top so one of the big problems in San Francisco and in California right now is Fusarium wilt that's killing the Phoenix canary ANSYS Fusarium world is a relatively new problem up here it's been a problem for a longer period down in Southern California and went up when a Canary Island date palm gets Fusarium wilt it will die there is no treating it and so this is the classic example of a species selection that needs to change for the landscapes and in California unfortunately there is no true alternative on the market so the best alternative is that the true date palm which is Phoenix dactyl if era this is medjool so consider Phoenix a fruit tree think of the many different kinds of apple trees we have there are even more kinds of date palms but in California we only have like 15 or 20 and of those not so many available for landscape anyway these get dug out of orchards down by Palm Springs Indio Coachella Valley because they're they're relatively cheap they tolerate cold they tolerate heat they're not so great in the chilly summers here but it is really the only alternative on the market that will fit the bill for a place like the Embarcadero because of the requirement for the trunk now there are better species for this purpose Chilean wine palm takes on the same grandeur of the Canary Island date palm on the left there but here it is adult but these adults are super hard to come by there just aren't that many of this palm in the landscape to dig and when they are available they're extremely expensive because there's so few of them so here we are in the Botanical Garden again not that these are gonna be a source for you know other landscapes but as time goes on they will become those majestic palm trees and our hope as growers down in Southern California at East West trees the wholesale business that I also work for is to begin to replace the Canary Island date palm with this Chilean wine palm a nice pair of them that you can see nearby is in front of the DeYoung museum there are two of them right next to each other and they you can see them you can tell the difference because they have this kind of concrete colored smooth cylindrical trunk which is fatter than the Canary Island date palm and not as rough this happens to be related to the coconut palm and it makes edible coconuts little tiny marble sized coconuts that are delicious and you can buy them online if you're if you're interested so back at trans Bay where the landscape architect chose to showcase some of these newer species that are better adapted he managed to get his hands on to one of these big Chilean wine palms this is quite a spectacular specimen and then he also planted some other unusual species this is called perigee baya kokoity z-- this is jubei achill Ensis this is perigee baiyoke acquittees and indeed they're closely related this one is from the Andes so this is another of these cloud forest species this is a good alternative to like a queen palm which I don't actually have a photograph of but the Queen palm is very commonly planted as a street tree here it's only marginally successful in San Francisco some of them look great and do fine and others don't look great and don't do well so this is a much more vigorous plant in our climate because it's from this cloudy cloud forest atmosphere and then a couple of other tricky carpus taquille there's a wealth of tricky carpet species that are well suited to our climate and that would be nice alternatives to that standard Chinese windmill palm again photographs of Transbay from above here's that perigee bae ik acquittees i showed you from Transbay older as time goes on the free leaf bases fall off and you end up with us almost coconut like palm tree it's quite graceful and beautiful fast-growing loves the sunshine and this is photographed in Bogota eight thousand five hundred feet in the Andes in the Botanic Garden there and here it is here at the botanical garden you can take a look at it just right around the corner by the entry kiosk two plants that are already starting to bloom you can see the little coconuts forming on this in front essence another well here's that that wax palm genus in habitat when I was there in June again cloud forest habitat gorgeous palm tree a nice alternative something that we don't really have in public landscapes here except in the Botanical Garden oh not yet we're trying we've got about five hundred one gallons so this would be a great plant for parks I don't think it would be a great plant for streets at least within the regime that we currently have in San Francisco the other fact about this palm Ciroc salon kindy un say is that it is the tallest palm in the world so i got to see a hundred and ninety five foot palm tree in habitats probably about four or five hundred years old just fantastic also there's a cool waterfall didn't want to miss that oops wrong direction so this is in bogota this is their sort of their main ceremonial street runs up to the Catholic shrine on the mountain where they have planted them as an a lay with this water feature down the center and this goes for blocks and blocks and blocks this was planted probably in the 1980s or early 90s and here it is at the Botanical Garden just planted as a Grove quite spectacular and here we have it in the Botanical Garden these are the biggest ones besides that one I showed you from Ventura and then in the foreground the Chilean wine palm that we talked about earlier oh and the other thing about these is that they these are already about 70 feet tall and they don't even have flowers yet these are still teenage not even teenagers these are juvenile palms they will open out their crowns the way you see in the habitat photo and they and the older Botanic Garden photo okay the wax covered trunk and then these are some other pair of Jabez so another species from the Andes a really good alternative ultimately to the Canary Island date palm this particular species is very large fast-growing somewhat drought tolerant and here are some down in Atherton and a hybrid just to give you a sense for the look this is a species on the right this is the Ken T of palm this is growing down in Santa Monica this is somewhat marginal in San Francisco they can be perfectly happy on the east side of San Francisco but they're prone to GLIAC lidium rot pink rot so it's been a bit of a battle over at the Academy of Sciences because they are not super vigorous in the fog they're slow growing but where it's a little bit warmer they're more vigorous and they tend to outgrow that pink rot which is a chronic but not necessarily lethal disease on the left and unusual palm from Australia from Lord Howe Island the same Island this is from this is called had a seppie Canterbury onna so these are the New Zealand palm this is the one from an island group north of New Zealand this is called ro Paulo stylist Bower I and then this is the one from the main islands of New Zealand where Paulo stylist Sepideh photographed here at the Botanic Garden this is a great plant for San Francisco it's kind of plant that doesn't like hot dry weather just like that wax palm and thus grows more vigorously for us than anywhere anybody else in California flower stalks are pretty showy and crazy looking like an undersea creature it's a good plant for a parks Bay not super drought-tolerant so it's not gonna be a happy street tree and doesn't love the Sun so but again we always think upon trees is sort of these hot dry plants but there are a lot of uses for palms that we don't think of because of that stereotype was our question ni ka U is a Maori name and the species name is long and complicated it's row palace stylist RH Opie al st yl i s and rh yeah and Sepideh is the species name of this species the other species in that same genus from Norfolk Island and also from New Zealand Bower I BAU er I so comes as a surprise to some people to learn that San Francisco is a place to grow certain palms that can't be grown elsewhere or are poor performers elsewhere this is a close-up of that silver Mediterranean fan palm that I showed you from that grassy landscape this is the regular green variety so this is a super common palm this is the most adaptable palm I think I know of in in the ornamental palate you can grow this in Hawaii you can grow some in Miami you can grow it in Seattle you can grow it here there are about 4 of these in front of the Cliff House in pots and they don't look terrible compared to most ornamental plants in that part of our city so it's super tough in many many respects it does great in the desert it'll grow in the shade it'll grow in the Sun as long as it gets good drainage it's basically indestructible and there we have the Chilean wine palm over there at the de Young Museum again you can sort of see how that might be a good replacement for the Canary Island date palm in its scale and its form here's a hybrid between it and that Budhia palm that I showed you earlier with the really blue fronds next to the swimming pool this is a hybrid between the G and the butea this one and this is photographed in Walnut Creek so you get some of the huskiness the the crown scale of the Jubei uh but also the relatively short stature of the butea and that recurved leaf and no fruit again live a stone Australis I showed you earlier this is a really good alternative to Washingtonians pcs of live a stone just some features of color that are really beautiful this is the hardiest of all palms this one you can grow in Long Island if you really want to it is a ground dwelling shrub from South East us from South Carolina down to Mississippi in Florida it's called the needle palm and then on the right this is the Chinese windmill palm that we know rather well from San Francisco tends to have some nutrient problems it always looks a little bit yellow partly I think because it gets dried out a lot it would prefer to be a little moister than we provide for and partly because it is just kind of a greedy plant it likes a lot of fertilizer here's that Wagner Yanis which is basically that same species of the Chinese windmill palm but with a more beautiful leaf and then some more tricky carpus this one is tricky Karpis lattice ectis this one is tricky Karpis Marty honest this is tricky Karpis princeps again a lot of different color form shape available in this genus all of these plants are from the Himalayan uplift these are also kind of like the Asian version of the Ciroc Salon genus so these are all well suited to San Francisco this is tricky Karpis tuck heel here in the botanical garden this is the one that grows the farthest west and very high about 7,000 8,000 feet in the Himalayas it grows in habitats with birch trees and fir trees and oak trees and rhododendrons and all sorts of temperate flora an unusual palm called a Ranga micrantha this is just an example of sort of the farthest edge of plant introduction this is a shrubby palm from the Himalayas about maximum altitude 8000 5 it's an example of the wealth of possibilities that are out there both for landscaping with palms and also for replacing some of the more common California grown hot weather palms so this is a list I'll give you guys of the the plants that I discussed in the slideshow in order of the slides a lot of botanical latin and then in terms you I am NOT a pathologist but these are the things that I see in my work Fusarium wilt is by far the worst thing hitting palms in San Francisco and the only alternative is to plant different species and wherever possible the best alternative is the Chilean wine palm para Dube at a rally I which I briefly showed you at the base of those white waxy trunks here in the Botanic Garden is a great alternative as well it's much more unusual in the Chilean wine palm but but it is available diamond scale hits the desert fan palms and the hybrid between the desert fan palm and the Mexican fan palm so diamond scale looks like scale but it's actually a fungal infection it affects the lower leaves first it's worse in the rainy season you'll even see it in our hot inland areas where there's a lot of rain in the winter time so you'll see it affecting palms in Calistoga santolina you know in the Salinas Valley and so by the time spring rolls around the Crown's have kind of dwindled from the bottom and then by the time August September October roll around the Crown's have regrown and they look fine it's not it's a it's a problem when you get super far inland more like Central Valley especially farther south they are unaffected for the most part the the rain the the length of the hot dry season is enough that the distance from the fog belt is enough that they don't really suffer too much pink rot is a chronic disease oh no I I haven't really seen it on Washington you but most other palms that we grow it's not lethal in most cases unless the palm is otherwise weakened so I bet it could kill one of the Ken Tia's in front of a California Academy but in general and I think it's attacking a couple of King palms on Castro Street but in general if the palm is reasonably vigorous it just out grows this chronic thing pink rot GLIAC lidium but what happens say with The Washingtonian flora the desert fan palm is it's already weakened by the reduction of the crown from the diamond scale and then the the glia clay diem goes in and kills the bud because it's just such a weak plan at that stage and then in general you see some scale on palms in the landscape not a whole lot but palms in the nursery are affected by mealybugs scale mites especially indoors of course once they get in the ground and as long as they're not being farmed by ants the palms are mostly able to fend it off themselves Gophers love palms and agaves and they seem to be sort of the worst mammalian pests on palms rabbits will eat seemingly anything and especially palm leaves I don't know if there are rabbits and I don't know if I've seen rabbits in Santurce go there must be and then the biggest pest threat right now is the giant palm weevil from South America and lower Central America which has been discovered in southern San Diego County we're very concerned about what quarantine efforts are going in to preventing it from expanding right now it seems to just come across the border from Tijuana and that will kill big palms particularly Canary Island date palms it could be an enormous headache and a windfall for arborist taking down palm trees and then once seen a couple of years ago the red palm weevil which is sort of the Asian version of this South American giant palm weevil was seen in Laguna Beach it seems to have been eradicated hard to say if it really truly was this has devastated the Mediterranean particularly Canary Island date palms in the Mediterranean so these are weevils whose grubs eat the bud of the palm tree so if there's only one but at the top of that stem they devour it and the whole tree dies really fast question Oh interesting Wow where presidio parrots so the just the the conyers that are flying all over okay so so do you thought your hypothesis what's that yeah yeah interesting for years you guys didn't do a lot of pruning on the Canaries I don't know your current practices what's what's your grooming practice yeah yeah okay yeah I'd I don't know what to say about that that's a really interesting situation where the where the parent yeah yeah sorry to hear it yet another yet another problem yeah I think this is the last slide yep so open to any questions you might have I'll answer as well as I can thank you so much for your attention and time appreciate it and thanks for inviting me today any yeah any animal rats birds particularly on Canaries because they've got that the leaves of all Phoenix's have what are called a can't the files which are basically leaflets that are adapted to be spines down in the core super hazardous for anybody working in a Canary Island date palm or any date palm but especially the canary they can pierce your skin they can pierce leather gloves they can leave really nasty openings for infection for some reason the canary of all of all the Phoenix's leaves the worst possibility for infection and so within that very protected crown birds and rats can be very happy you know I know on Dolores you often hear like five different kinds of birds living up in the crown of a Canary Island date palm on the females took so phoenixes are dioecious they're male and female on separate trees and so the ones that have dates the ones that have fruit the females are also a good source of food for the birds and for the rats as well not that I'm aware of the so palms defenses tend to be mechanical such as the spines and also the fibrous nosov the foliage the stem and the roots so most herbivores that take on palms are fairly specialized the rabbit and the gopher are perhaps exceptions but with it certainly within the insect world the there's not a lot of aphids for example that really can take down a palm because their leaves are just so armored in their in their substance not even just the organs of armature but the the fiber that that constitutes the leaf but I don't I don't know of a case and you know I'm not the expert on this stuff but I haven't had any clients who've had problems with rats hurting the palm itself a rat bites mites okay wow that's that's heavy Wow and what prevention measures do you use and how long does the infestation last on human yeah but you have all that allergic reaction I mean I think that it wouldn't hurt the plant particularly I think you know it might be a temporary solution perhaps just to drive out the population if you do that you want to you definitely want to do the washing before the trimming and best if you do it in the dry season if you can yeah though clean experiences is super well adapted to our climate and part of that is its ability to draw moisture onto the trunk because you know if you think about the architecture of palms they're really good water catchers and and in particular Phoenix is adapted to capture fog because of its habitat where it's from and so not only does it do that with the crown but it also like absorbs that moisture in the fibrous leaf bases that are there underneath the crown so the number of different epiphytes that grow in Phoenix Canary ANSYS is extraordinary there's hardly another host for epiphytes that I can think of in our climate that matches the canary they do although I when I see big epiphytes like cap row smih like mirror plant like Pines eucalypt mean there's some eucalyptus and some palms on the corner of Octavia and market I do think that there can be a problem with the roots managing they're managing to get their way all the way into the bud and restricting the emergence of the new leaves so I think there is reason to remove big epiphytes if it's just like the usual small stuff but if it's a big fat rooted tree or shrub like a cup roast ma I've seen coasts live oak you know in a in a canary island I mean a yeah canary island crown I think there is reason to remove or at least cut back regularly so that the growth isn't so vigorous and doesn't attack the crown itself it's not like the plant is trying to do that you know but it's not like the job of that of that epiphyte to do that but that risk does I think exists yeah the other thing I haven't addressed is just in pruning I mentioned it's best not to prune green leaves when you prune a canary you must use a completely sterile blade so it's got to be a new blade out of the package a cauterized blade or a blade that's been in a 50/50 bleach solution for half an hour and you've taken that bleach solution very far away from any plantings because of course that would kill any plant and you rinse that blade completely so that there's no more bleach on it and you really do want to do a hand blade it's very hard to fully sanitize a chainsaw it's a lot faster to use a chainsaw but it can be a real problem the other thing is some of the you just don't want to bring down a dead canary on date palm that's died diffuse area more who knows what with a chainsaw and I've seen this done where every little bit of sawdust is a vector for this lethal disease and so I mean I don't you know it's just like I've seen it on the Embarcadero I've seen it in Union Square it's not it's just a very bad idea it's it is the perfect way to distribute a possible vector for the fungus that kills the other palm trees so that's another thing and then upon planting if you're planting palms out of a container you don't want to manipulate the root ball so it's the opposite of what we think of when we're planning a woody tree or woody shrub you want that container root ball to just slip right into the hole and backfill there's no reason to manipulate the repo and all you're doing is setting back the plant because what's gonna happen is new roots are gonna come from the base of the trunk and they're gonna succeed that old root ball and find their way into the surrounding soil and upon planting a crucial piece is to make sure to cover the base of the trunk so again unlike the way we're taught to plant woody trees and shrubs you don't want roots exposed at the base of the trunk you want to make sure that the base of the trunk which is called the root initiation zone is covered with soil this is a particularly California piece of advice because if I were in Florida this would not be the same advice but in California where we have nine months or three months or six months of dry those roots just hit the dry air and stop when they're coming out in air it's only the roots that hit the soil and can stay a little bit moist that are able to get themselves into the soil and start to support the new growth of that palm tree yeah and you know if it's 2 or 3 inches or even 6 inches it's probably fine you don't want to go really you don't want to go more than 6 inches deeper but if it's in the container and there aren't there aren't exposed roots you plant it at grade if it's in the container and there are exposed roots you just cover it with a mulch so that you can cover the base of the trunk now you planting a giant Canary Island date palm that already has like a cone of aerial roots way up above the grade level that's a different story I mean there are some Canaries on Dolores that have 10 15 feet of aerial roots you're not gonna bury that palm tree to that depth by any stretch of the imagination but it wouldn't hurt that palm if you were to lay down 2 or 3 inches of mulch on top of the exposed roots just at the bottom of the trunk you know of course you can transplant big palm trees but even in that case the the remaining root ball the part of the root ball that that comes with the tree should not be manipulated upon planting and then in terms of media it's surprisingly helpful to use sand as your backfill again contrary to the way we plant woody shrubs and trees because the palm is going to need as well aerated a medium as possible for the development of those new roots and because the branching process leads to a finer and finer root tip as it reaches say a clay layer the plant is going to benefit from that that well-drained porous sand medium plus it's a lot easier to stabilize a palm tree in heavy the heavy mineral medium of sand and you get much less compaction due to organic decomposition say in advance of the of the roots developing you know to fill that space yeah in general your transplants gonna be more successful with a bigger root ball on field dug plants so the larger a planting hole you can prepare in in whatever project you're working on and the larger root ball you can spec it's gonna raise your prices on freight but and it might raise your price on the plant too but it's going to set you up for much better success in the long run now those are Washingtonian robust as those are Mexican fan palms and I recall seeing that what was implemented there was annex how little volume there was yeah mm-hmm yeah yeah and you know sometimes it's worth it for the person choosing the plant to go to the farm where the plants are being dug especially if you're planting a dozen or two dozen or whatever it might be again it adds some expense on the upfront but it reduces the headache in the long term and I think if I recall correctly I mean I can you know they're they're a little it's almost like the grade was raised a little bit on the planting holes on the wells there's more there was more volume added to the root ball for those Mexican fan palms now palms again they can go into these relatively small root volumes into into containers as long as they are maintained with sufficient moisture and fertilizer so fertilizing is the other topic a lot of palms like Queen palms and the Chinese windmill palms could benefit from a regular fertilizing regime March June and September ahead of the warm season to get the color better and probably increase the vigor of the plant but you know this is why you might choose different species you know you you can kind of opt out of that at least in a non sand soil in in San Francisco and a sandy soil I would always hope that we are able to fertilize because there's palms in general like a little bit more fertilizer than a lot of other plants so the Washingtonians the perigee bay is the Braja is they're not they're not hungry for fertilizer particularly but these Queen palms which I didn't show a photograph of because I'm not super fond of them for San Francisco and these Chinese windmill palms which are better more easily used in San Francisco they both like a good fertilizing regime and in a palm you want to have sort of a medium to low phosphorous number and you want to make sure that your fertilizer has the micros the full spectrum of micros particularly magnesium and that will basically set you up for success if you're able to lay it down March June and September you don't bother with the fourth quarter because of the temperatures and the you know that time of year most of the palms aren't really growing much I am in discussion with them yeah right right right so that's a great area to grow Queen palms I mean basically I'd rather oh they did and I they looked to be they look to be planted bare root I don't know I didn't watch the installation process on those they're very long gated and they look like they're grown in a particularly hot climate and in a dense planting originally I do not know I have no idea where they were sourced from Bauman doesn't return our calls because we're really persnickety we like we get our we get in there and we say look this is gonna be better if you do it this way or if you select this crop versus that crop but the you know those Queen palms are a good choice for the design and for the microclimate of San Francisco I would like to have seen them planted at a very small size from a 25 gallon because Queen palms are rather narrow when they're young and just with a sort of a regular pruning of lower leaves you would quickly have tree like Queen palms say in ten years you'd have palm trees but but the choice based on whatever regulations about the view shed or the the driver safety and pedestrian safety was to have big tall trees but yeah the fertilizing will help you know and you know again queens are there hungry the metal sheath is a good option and we here in the botanic garden we have trouble with squirrels just they get they live in the crowns or they they chew the the buds of the nikkei palms that I showed you a lot of and I would like to see a cuff a metal cuff or a smooth cuff used on the trunks of those palms that aren't in that aren't touching the Crown's of the other trees because once you obviously once there's they're close enough for the squirrels to leap over same with the rats it's not worth bothering on a palm that's like touching another tree or close enough to another tree but if they're on their own if they're separated from each other those cuffs would be helpful I think in reducing rats and other animals that grow run up from the ground I don't think so because you you just want to have them high enough off the ground that they can't be vandalized and low enough from the crown that the the rodent or animal can't cross it because it's too smooth so it just needs to be the you know the length required to prevent a rat from making it across you know on the way up but I don't have any expertise in it it's purely just observation on my I've never installed one I couldn't tell you where to get one yeah pruning hygiene above all making sure that you use sterile hand saws for pruning I think it's worth pruning you know for removing leaves that might fall for taking away Spore bed for other fungal diseases that might be like chronic like the glia caladium glia caladium effects the the pink rot effects canary on of date-palms they almost always grow out of it but it leads to years and years of you know unpleasant looking crown and so I imagine that if you're removing dead leaves you're reducing the source of fungal infection on that plant but you're also improving safety because they're you know they're spiny when they hang when when they hang in fall and then you know canary on date-palms are quite drought tolerant San Francisco so not letting like if they're if they're in a lawn or if they're getting a lot of water if you can possibly dial down the water it's probably better for the palm and then I think removing those big woody epiphytes so like the gum trees that are in the ones that market and octavia the oak trees the pine trees maybe the the mirror plant I think that's just beneficial in the long run to prevent the possibility that those would grow into the bud and and restrict the bud yes the Guadalupe palm is yeah so the the Mexican blue palm is also from near California and it's from Baja the Guadalupe palm grows with California native plants with the requirements of California native plants so if you look at the Grove in the southwest corner of Dolores Park you'll see that where the lawn sprinklers used to hit the trunks there are cavities they look deformed they're not happy and then above the point where the lawn sprinklers used to hit the trunks the trunks are perfectly fine it's an indicator to me of their natural inclination to grow in a more summer dry environment they I mean in habitat they grow in many parts of the island or they used to before the goats ate them all and one of those areas is underneath the canopy or with the canopies of trees that capture fog and drip it down all summer long all dry season long because down there the dry seasons like nine months I have seen like native bumblebees foraging on Guadalupe palms in the nursery at floor grub gardens you know I like just I've talked about this with other folks who are enthusiastic about California native plants as I am in San Francisco you know we've seen the hooded Oriole building nests in our washing Tonia's in the nursery we've seen mourning doves forming their nests on on the palm leaf successfully you know fledging chicks on the Guadalupe palm the Guadalupe palm is truly the sort of bio Geographic native of California the you know unfortunately that desert fan palm is not you know it's from the Sonoran floristic province and it shows because it just is not adapted to this cool humid coastal condition that we have the blue palm you know it it's more tolerant but it's also snorin flourished floristic province but any palm is going to be well most palms are going to be good sources of nectar and pollen for the generalists in our environment just as hummingbirds will go to a lowe's you know when they're blooming so will other pollinators go to palm flowers but palms also do in habitats have very specific pollinator relationships as well some are general some are more specific so you're welcome [Music] and that's the place you want to go that's like rarefied plants some really interesting plants at Merritt College very cool stuff I should plug my book before I go this is my book you can get it at flora group Gardens you can get it on Amazon if you want to follow me to my car I'll sell you went out of my out of the back of my car but it's got you know I can praise the photographs above all because I didn't do them Caitlyn Atkinson took the photographs they're very beautiful but I hope that the because it's written from a San Francisco perspective there's a lot of information in here that relates to west coasts cultivation of Palms but there's also plenty of information about tropical palms which is obviously where most palms grow so the lat I guess the last you know the the palm family runs from as far north as the Italian Riviera as far south as New Zealand way deep in the South Pacific there's plenty of Palms for us in our landscaping region they're just super unusual at this stage and I'd love to see greater diversity so that we you know we can actually employ this unusual group of plants in in more beneficial ways for the landscape so thanks so much for

Alzheimer's disease researchers report in the Journal of the American Medical Association that the more people consume vitamin A in their diets the lower their risk is for developing the progressive neurological disorder examples include fortified cereals green leafy vegetables seeds and olive oil those participants that were in the top fifth of intake for vitamin E had a 70% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared with those in the lowest tip during the four years study the eating habits of 815 dementia free participants aged 65 and older were tracked at the conclusion 131 were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease the study found that while a rich vitamin E diet helped the majority of seniors the bad news is the genetics can cancel out the benefits of healthy eating we found that certain people who are predisposed to late onset Alzheimer's disease because they have a certain genotype did not appear to be protected from their high intake of vitamin E from foods an

anecdotal evidence shows that pains and inflammation can remain suppressed for weeks coming up the Taekwondo lifeline the most of the privileged world learning martial arts is a great way of keeping quit and losing a few pounds but one man in Kenya is using martial arts training as a way to get kids off the streets and give them a chance to make something better of their lives the road to perfection is long and hard that these young men it starts at four in the morning every day the students at the Georgia Tech Wando Academy in Kenya all of them used to be Street kids as did the school's founding father George Moreau until a stranger changed his life thank you was the man who changed my life he came to the street where I was hanging out and I made fun of him to teach me a lesson he beat me up I was very disturbed because I thought no one could beat me that's what most thugs think when I saw him again he told me that he does Taekwondo and that he can teach me George in his students all knew how to fight before but there's a difference between street fighting and the martial art Taekwondo it's a self-defense technique using bare hands and feet but fighters most powerful weapon is his mind you know need I know a toll on us you know I was just like them know when I started my quando I really changed my bad manners have gone I've changed my lifestyle and I have a future thank you because Taekwondo teaches you discipline and that's something you need in life I think that it will help these children if they have the same experience George started the school in 1996 with just one pupil now 21 Moses matura has put his past behind him and he's the team captain all I used to do was sleep blue I stole whatever I could things like that George doesn't just coach them he's become their family with a little help from his wife whenever all comforta my wife is comfortable with my background and the issue of helping these kids neatly come home they watch Taekwondo films if we just say what they want because they know I'm like their father she's their mother my core now then of course free food you know Athena they're just like my children yes yep it's been a long time since I started taking care of them they are m'lady so if this was not my calling like I would have left it a long time ago that there isn't enough room at home for them all so he's rented four houses on the street where he lives put up 25 boys to raise money for their upkeep he gives extra taekwondo lessons in the little spare time he has and he's also found donors generous enough to help out because I think it's a very important project and I think he's one of the only people in in Kenya that actually do something for these kids and actually take them into into his own hands and and maybe make sometimes maybe make some good citizens out of those guys when we see a child with the talent we help him to develop it when we see a child left in the streets by the mum we take it oh no so at the end we'll never have any street for easy mobility you know cuadrado street boys the universe which we are having over 250,000 street children in the country this is a big number and we are not talking of children who are just out of school they are on trips maybe 90% are in the old drugs the new government solution is to round them all up and put them in social centres but it won't be easy to institutionalize kids who are drug addicts and used to their independence that's where George could be on to something the Taekwondo skills are unlikely to get them a job they do give them a discipline and strength of mind enough to give up drugs and to change their lives today's recruitment round was fruitful it looks as though George's school is about to have a few more students I'm very happy with this Taekwondo but I can't afford to pay for my training so it would be good if they assisted me with that self-defence is very important to be fit and to be able to save your backside if you're attacked by thugs mcdonough me a kimono today's training was the best really cool game so I'd like them to come for training more I'll do what I want to do is to join them and I need Anya double cordial world to become a kung-fu person it takes extraordinary foresight to know that learning how to fight with discipline can make such a difference to young men who grew up fighting to

number of ear cleaning parlors popping up around Tokyo these days normally a part of the services available at traditional hairdressers these specialized shops have caught on with many stressed out Japanese businessmen yamamoto me macaques shop manager ko Ichi Kawasaki says an average of 30 to 40 people mostly they're not exclusively men of all ages come to his parlor a day and pay 2500 yen or 22 u.s. dollars for a 30-minute session someplace here they are on the streets again having my ears cleaned on someone's lap reminds me of my childhood days so good yes it's very so soothing killing me I pay special attention to not hurting the customers here's when our sessions include hand and feet massage but most come for the nostalgia of the ear cleaning experience for many japanese people

Joseph's Day on March the 19th", "HraOWuXc4C8": "hey everyone in today's video I have a updated everyday makeup routine and I'm going to try and make like all the major props in this video drugstore

the surface you want to really pata into your skin to make sure it goes into all your pores and then after you've applied your primer what you want to do is take your your face mask my favorite one is the origins ginseng refreshing face mask to wake up tired skin and makes my skin feel so hydrated and glowing and reminisce its Museum and basically just tickle - pea-sized in my I'm just rubbing it into my skin by doing all these staff will make your skin fit a lot more smoother and hydrated before you apply your makeup because if you have smoother skin your makeup will look a lot nicer as well

eraser and just kind of reduces the appearance of lines of course or regular and stuff like that so make sure it's going really smooth we're just going to take the tiniest bit of this because you don't want to apply too much and then just completely defeat the purpose so I'm going to apply it on the fairies that I would normally apply my primer which should be more kind of in my t-zone because that's where I have kind of some more problematic and pores I'm just going to rub this into my skin I'm actually nutrition food so soft it's so good next we're gonna be taking my L'Oreal Lumi magique foundation on this is in the shade golden linen which is a really nice color and I also really match money sounds well I'm gonna be taking on this no you silly rules golden collection brush which is the what's its called you defined our buffer brush so I literally just do two pumps on the brush and then just stop it run my skin and then just start to really buff it into my skin I'm by priming the primer of the origins face mask and the origins mask eliezer my foundation that seems to be going on a lot smoother for concealers and I'm gonna be taking the Maybelline fit me concealer and mine is in the shade 15 and because I don't have a really hard on face idea by quite a bit of this but it's really hydrating and thin this consider so it doesn't like it you know and so what I do is just apply some under my eyes and this really reminds me of the North Reading creamy concealer and it's a lot more like nourishing and as the skin and I think it would actually prefer this to a doc concealer and this is only uh carranza sex for shadow cause I think which is really affordable for a drugstore concealer and again I'm just using the same brush just to dab it into my skin and then you said my I'm dry on the rest of my face I'm going to taking the bushwa rice powder and it's just a really nice glow to your skin because does have a little bit of shimmer in it so because I left a

parts so much is it how to make those sounds light underneath there's a lot more emphasized but I'm going to show you only the tiniest bit of this as you can see this side is looks a lot more defined compared to this side and then just add some warmth back into my skin I'm taking the NYC and Adam Smith skin bronzer in the shade tonight and it's like this is literally I think I'm I honestly thought when I got this in America I think it was like $2 or $3 it's so unexpected I'm going to say it's the most prettiest it's natural as bronzy color ever another days you can some of that I'm just kind of

Agua me matrimony won't you be anymore okay bye-bye", "dKHEVGDWDU4": "well hi everybody nice to see you today thank you for joining me turn that on just a little bit I've got a little bit of a Sun problem it's I'm hoping don't cause too much of a problem with video so let's trying to block some of it oh I believe it's just a little too high some try and no fun way there we go we'll kind of go off just a little bit alright so today I'm going to be doing another journal but I wanted to just show how easy it was to use what you have you don't have to buy other stuff you don't have to and that's the reason they call it a junk journal because you use junk but today I'm going to use a cracker box okay I love these crackers so you'll see me do a lot of journals out of these right but also to use you know leftovers and things like that like the pieces I cut out from the box you know the tabs on top the second thing you know now some of them I probably won't use but like these I might use for tabs there's four of them I can put four signatures in here that the spine is pretty it's pretty wide let me see if I can find my ruler right off hand is hiding all righty yeah the spine is about two and three quarters so well a little bit less probably two and five-eighths yeah about two and five-eighths so I mean that's a pretty good size look how wide that is and you don't have to make it this big you can cut it down which is what I normally do because you know I don't I don't need anything that's super big but it's tiered preference whatever way you want you know like this one there's another cracker box I cut this down because I wanted a skinny a tall skinny journal I've got a purpose for this one even though it's really really fat right here on the spine that's about how wide it's gonna be you know with the signatures in there and I made this maybe a little too tall for me I may cut it down a little bit but not by much because like I said I've got a reason for this one forget this one satisfied so I trimmed down a box earlier and you know I love my jelly plate I've got jelly played papers up the wazoo okay they're everywhere so I went through and after I made three junk journals which is in another video and I used up a bunch of papers in that and I had a bunch more so I made four more signatures using you know just my daily plate papers and this is on really heavy cardstock now these are four one two three four pages in this signature but they're so thick you know I don't want too many and there's between four and five in each of these I haven't added anything else I haven't added any book pages I haven't you know done anything along those lines which is yeah so I took one of my jelly print papers and cut it up and trimmed it I glued it now I will tell you this okay I didn't want to use double stick tape but they didn't feel like getting out any of the other what do you call it [Music] we're getting a good sunspot here I may have to pause this and come back when the Sun has changed directions in the sky or positions but yeah I just I wanted to use up some of my jelly plates that's what pages that's what I make me for so I've been using those that's the inside I haven't done anything to the inside yet but I'm thinking I'd like to use some tissue paper on the inside because I've got like a whole drawer full of tissue papers that are really cute here and there you know then I just half the time I don't know what to do with them other than collage with them when you say I've got well that's not tissue paper those are papers all right so I've got you know some baby blue some white blue that green would probably work cuz that would match the dragonflies I've got some flowers I've got sprinkles like that gold pink and white stripe and this one is really pretty and I don't remember where I got it from so I'm kind of supporting that one I just I don't know what I want to do with it yeah I have an idea but see there's some more white red Christmas and this is all stuffed in one drawer I'm thinking I'm going to do a giveaway and here's some really pretty vintage wrapping paper tissue paper rather I've got papers with some tissue paper with clocks [Music] so I mean we'll do a giveaway right now in our Facebook group which is coffee cup cracks in conversation the link is down below in this description that's the word but we're doing an event called clutter box for the rescue and somebody who gets mine it is probably going to get a good chunk of really nice you know tissue paper like these are napkins those don't even go in there now I've got a bunch of white because if I see it like I got this at thrift at the Goodwill this whole package there's like there's 18 sheets but it's 520 square inches 20 inch by 26 inches wide I got it for 50 cents so I could probably stop getting some white tissue paper from now on but it does make a really nice texture on mixed-media projects on canvas things like that I just haven't done any canvases lately which I could probably see how that feels like parchment paper but yeah I'm not even done that's done so but yeah I've got so much tissue paper now there's some really hot paint it looks red in the in the cameras frame but it's not it's like a dark pink I mean I don't know if you can see the difference cuz here's red there you go and it's not it's not as faded as it looks it's it's a darker it's a more vibrant dark pink but I mean as opposed to like you know that pale pink on that note now some people probably have a whole lot more tissue paper than I do honestly this is probably all I got room for and I'm barely you know I'm bursting at the seams with what I got crack the Lance crack Blanche there's some more very delicate tissue paper so I think that's what I'm gonna do I'm going to use some tissue paper on the inside this may not be enough or just enough there we go check that out that's pretty dadgum cool but I'm not just gonna lay it in one flap I'm gonna I'm gonna collage it all right now with this I am going to get out for my punch now I make my own some people will use 2-part glue one part water I use half and half get up my little cup you can get a set of four of these little glass dishes at the Dollar Tree for a buck and they're perfect to put your mod podge in if you're doing I don't know it's just it's I love them they're perfect for a lot of things but yeah I make my own I by the gallon of Elmer's glue at my Lowe's and I make my own I bought a gallon of glue probably two years ago and I still have almost half of it left oops oh I don't I did it again I do not know why I did that dagnabbit okay so we're going to put some pages on and even though it looks almost see-through when it dries it'll come back out probably put something under there and I've always found the minimize your air bubbles when you lay down anything for collage you start from the middle and go out that's kind of you know common sense but some people like for me I'm such a half the time that common sense doesn't come until after I've already screwed up and then I'm like Oh duh but that's me and if you you know for me let me see maybe I'll throw in a couple of different colors in here instead of just all green since this is it's got some yellow in it you see right there's some gold in here give it a little bit of you know dimension or something but I'll do that on the top layer I'm not going to do it on the bottom then I don't want it to just appear and if this wrinkles I don't care that's the whole point about tissue paper it's all Oh something born in the water now wrinkles are good air bubbles are not because air bubbles will tend to you know when they dry out they'll tend to split and then you'll have you won't have complete coverage so I'm putting a little extra on the spine only to help reinforce some of it I'm in tissue paper that's obviously not gonna do a whole lot but any little bit helps even when it dries after the Mod Podge you know dries with the Mod Podge it still gives it a little bit more strength and that this is a pretty good stiff cardboard so it's not like I'm worried about you know my signatures falling out or anything like that I always forget when I do this sometimes to flip it over and make sure I've got the edges glued down say like that alright that was a big piece if I could've cut that one down but now I didn't and that's okay the edges that are hanging over I'm flipping back onto itself and some of it yeah it'll have to be trimmed and cut you know the drill but for the most part it helps a little bit with coverage okay and some they won't get that air bubble out that I saw I have a couple more pieces of green I'll use just to use it up hmm let's see trying to figure out where I should put it I'll put it right across the bottom and there we go all right now I'm going to tear up some of this gold and just put smaller pieces you know on some of the bags not blanks per se but some of the thinner spots that aren't as sick as the others don't want that straight edge edge it's not so much already never I want to add more I can add more put the storage on the inside so we can still use the pieces and then only the rough edges show on the outside I can do that well the only thing that I feel is the drawback to using my Podge is that it's really hard for it to not stay sticky even after it dries I don't know if you've ever noticed if you've mod podge it a couple pages in a row and then you closed them up and had them open them in awhile when you go to open them again they're they're stuck together and that's one thing I don't like about my podge but okay so I'm gonna pause this for a minute I'm going to clean this mess up a little bit and I'm going to use my heat gun and dry this that way you guys aren't sitting here waiting for me to get that done I'll be right back one thing I wanted to bring up I trimmed it off you know the excess but when you use Mod Podge it tends even cardboard it tends to want to curl it okay but as you can see originally before I stopped the video it was a lot more curled as it dries it will lay flatter and if you have a problem you can always block it you know by putting some wax paper down and some heavy books or something like that drive your car over it if you want but okay so I've got probably about a minute left to cry and then I'll be right back okay now it's mostly dry surface wise it is in fact you can feel that the cardboard is still a little damp all right but it's straightened out for the most part you know now I'm going to flip this over I like this but this is a little plain for me and I'm not real big if you've noticed on a lot of my journals I'm not real big with a bunch of stuff on the outside because honestly if you put your journals in your book case it's gonna fall off its gonna get knocked off its gonna get ripped off its gonna chip off it you know so I kind of just leave it um not completely plain but it's not super embellished but that's just my preference you know I believe that most everybody's journals when they do do that are absolutely gorgeous me I'm always afraid my brain and my I'm just not that talented to be able to get away with something like that and this isn't really I mean obviously you can see this isn't it's not gonna cover it up but it just gives it a little bit more of a I don't know just something something I like dragonflies and this was actually the piece I used to make these that this jelly plate was one of my friends I had they had one of those scanning cuts I believe and she just scanned and cut a whole bunch of things and she sent me the negatives which is like a stencil on cardstock which I thought was fabulous and I love using those on my jelly plate now obviously they don't last you know like they would a regular stencil but you know you can get some really beautiful pictures out of them and then you're able to even just use use it oh pardon me use it the stencil part itself you can use in projects so then you see I'm not you know I'm not gluing the whole entire thing down I'm just doing it in spots obviously I didn't do a very good job there there because I might want to tuck something in there I don't know but I am putting the glue along the fold I'm using the glue to the in case I'm using the tip of the glue gun in case the glue dried faster than I could get the lace down that way it will loosen the glue and I don't have to run another bead okay I'm going to do it on this side I'm going to need another good stick so let me grab one put this on here first I could probably get away with just not you know putting so much or putting it all down at once and just a little bit at a time but for you know time side time sake and video sake I will and yes I have a little spatula to help me with my glue and my hot glue I just to me it was just quicker to do it this way sometimes I use this sometimes I don't a lot of time you should just hear me cussing and going wow cuz I brought myself which I do quite frequently little pieces sticking up right here alrighty so let me trim this I don't use the same scissors I use for paper that I do for fabric or cloth or lace or anything like that I use different pair of scissors because paper I believe next two rocks are about one of the worst things you can put you can use on scissors the quickest way to gel them is by cutting paper so I have a pair of paper scissors and then when I those get really really dull I delegate those to cutting cardboard and then I also have a pair of I have two different pairs of fabric scissors so oops caught a piece there they need to do that all right now here I'm just going to lay that down [Music] same with right here not a lot just a little alrighty now see that then there's your inside I'm not done with the inside but most of the times I just honestly I'll put a pocket in it and not many people pay attention to the insides anyway all righty here are my four signatures but I'm going to decorate those on the next video I'm not gonna do a two-hour long video I think sometimes it's just too much so but the next time I will we will decorate the pieces whoops that we cut off the end we've got tabs that I can put you know on on those there's the other one or signatures or tabs that'll work you decorate those but I want to show you what I did with the cutouts or the cut-offs whatever you call it for the other box I did just to give you an idea all right so I covered one side the back this side with paper this side with some tissue paper and I also had an extra piece that I made onto it and made into a pocket but I cut you can you see that see if I get really close okay well I I cut the tissue paper and then the top bottom part and the top part so that they would match without a breakup I thought that was kind of cool and then I poked a hole obviously and just tuck some things in there that's just some of the scraps I've been using in the other journals nothing specific and then this one I thought would make a really nice bookmark I used what was left over of this stuff laid it on the back and took s'more left over this you know I'm using scraps that's all I'm doing put it and then I inked the edges on both sides and poked a hole and then this one no it's not there oh I put it in okay I'll have to get it out this one I made to match this that I did on another one I started working on this one already um it was in one of my videos about 20 minute gifts he's a calendar but I made this so I gotta put this in there before I mail the box cuz I put it in as a gift I finished this one up but uh yeah you can use these cut them use them as pockets even if you okay for example that part right there you know when you open up your box of crackers and it wants to you know you have a place to tuck the tab in to close them use that as a tuck spot on your journal you know you put it in there and that way you take this out instead of a pocket you've got an automatic tuck spot see how that works right cool put this back together obviously these are matching for the one journal I'm doing and this will be for my Doctor Who journal - the pink stripes but like I said I just put it in there to get it out of the way but yeah so the next journal will work on some of these and maybe I'll come up with something else cool to add to it might pick out some clusters or make some more that'll match but on that note I'm gonna let you go for now I'm gonna do my spiel in case I stop it and do a part two but I may just cause this and just pick it back up now I think I'll do it apart one in the part two but uh yeah so if you liked my video give me a thumbs up please share okay

2 of z jaipur literature festival we now have the poetry yoga vedanta presented by british council our speakers for today are Camilla Luca not mark Waldron melissa lee thornton ram swaroop Kison yogurt wada and k surgeon anna i would like to invite chris hollyfield director of poetry book society to say a few words good evening welcome to this british council event organised with the dry pure literature festival I'm Chris Holyfield I'm the director of the poetry book society which was founded by TS Eliot and friends in 1953 you can't hear me can you put the microphone on please can you put the microphone on please hello right on now understand okay i'm going to start again so you can hear me this time welcome to this british council event organised with the Jaipur Literature Festival I'm Chris Holyfield the director of the poetry book Society in London the poetry book society was founded by TS Eliot and friends in 1953 and it's the only poetry book club in the world our poet selectors choose the best new collection sources of the water and and their choice is going the bulletin and which is sent to all members of the PBS we also run the TS Eliot prize which 10 days ago in London we had the readings in the Royal Festival Hall with an audience of two thousand I can and it's the biggest poetry event of the year in a UK we were delighted that Sarah how one this year with her collection loop of jade it's the very first time in 23 years of the prize that her first collection has one so it was very exciting she's a brilliant young poet I'm here to talk about the next generation poets 2014 and you're going to hear four of them in a few minutes this is a once-in-a-decade promotion and the judging panel had to choose the 20 best collections from poets who published their first collection in the last 10 years and we had 250 submissions so it's quite a hard task for them in the UK we did a tour of 23 venues involving 56 poets including some from new generation which was in 1994 and involved poets like Carol Ann Duffy and simon armitage next generation 2004 had poets like Alice Oswald and Owen shears they were both brilliant lists and a third is just the same we have a special website for next-generation poets which has readings poems interviews and blocks from the poets as well as notes for reading groups you can find it at w WX generation poets com the poets are now touring internationally as part of a partnership between the poetry book society and the British Council so I'm just going to briefly introduce these poor poets Luke Kennard is a poet in fiction writer with his second second collection the harbor beyond the movie he became the youngest poet ever to be nominated for the forward prize hi Miller who is from Jamaica actually won the Ford prize in 2014 with the cartographer maps away to Zion Persian fiction writer melissa lee hortons second collection beautiful girls was a poetry book society recommendation mark Warren works in advertising and was chosen for next generation poets 2014 for the brand-new dark as you will discover they all have wonderful individual voices and that's what the poetry book society is good at identifying superb new poetic voices so I'd like to just conclude by saying that it's great for the UK next generation poets international showcase to bring the poets here to read as part of this fantastic international event that the fabulous jaipur festival hi hello is that still working God yeah it is a much better yeah the tragedies of being tall I'll just read four poems and I'll read from this collection called a light song of light and in this collection there is a man that keeps on featuring he's called a singer man in in Jamaica years ago when they used to build roads the government would hire someone to sing songs well they built these roads and this man was called a singer man so he features in a couple of the points a short biography of the singer man the singer man born in 1903 has lived in spalding in lime tree grove in a village called rim wherever there were no roads wherever the hills rose up like a flock of green parrots you would find him singer man paid half shilling a week dug trenches fill the pits with mortar and bits of broken stone but singer man's most crucial job was to lift up mentors the time chichibud Oh to the swing of a workman's hammer and no one knew if it was the hammer or if it was the song but there was no rock so strong to resist the fourth accented beat that Oh in the singer man's song for sure you have to imagine that you're visiting Jamaica and you're reading a Porsche or brochure avoid the three lane highways drive on the singer man's roads your journey even when bumpy will be sweet they ascend lifting you as in a chorus the sharp corners turning you like a force of melody there's a back road that sings it's offbeat way up stoney hill built of course by the singer man and the slim road to Mount Pleasant also built by the singer man any yes it was the singer man who orchestrated the long road to Portland made it full of waterfalls so that a man and his mule traversing its miles could forget for a while the solemnity of their loads please when you visit Jamaica drive on the singer man's roads and oh thank you that's very kind the color of the singer man's songs I was thinking that you know if you're if you're kind of black American artist you might sing the blues so what color with the singer man sounds beauty that really strange question to have but I'm a point so the color of the singer man's songs if the singer man had gone to America he would have sung the blues he would have sung the blues with a voice like John the Baptist with a tongue covered in sand and his blues would have been that kind of Blues that is fed on locust and honey blues like a cry that cometh from the wilderness blues like the sound of warthogs alarmed at the sky and the singer man would have sung it straight from his field in Arkansas to herald Ireland's living room where Arlen would have gone to his keys and composed a song more sad than blues in the night but the singer man did not go to America he stayed right here so bless up to him and his song and all music that is sad in its own color bless up to every song that bless up to the notes that fall like flakes of rust bless up to every song that makes its own way out of dongle a path straight through getters bless up to the mentor which becomes scar which becomes rubba-dub-- which becomes legend bless up all the red gold songs all the weary evening time songs songs given to us by the singer man and I will end with a point that I can't read because it's not in any book but it's a point that Chris commissioned me to write last year and basically uh the Queen she took out all our gold well not all of it but to get a lot of the gold and put it on display and so Chris the pointer society asked me to write a poem responding to this exhibition on gold there's another one but I focus on the goal uh I didn't think the poem was very political at the time until the next morning everyone was tweeting they couldn't believe Camilla read that at Buckingham Palace and so now I realize the point might be but this is my response to go there's a series of poems in this collection the cartographer tries to map away design about place names in Jamaica and so this is just continuing that series about place names and I have to remember it by heart place name a raka Besser origins disputed but most likely leave over from the Spanish order cabeza golden head though what gold was here other than light glinting off the bay other than bananas bursting out from red flow as though this too is disputed not the flowers but the origin of bananas they may have come here with Columbus on a ship which in 1502 slipped into a rock abeta the way grief sometimes slips into a room in those days the Sailor try to name the island Santa Maria as if not knowing we already had a name in another language a language whose speakers would soon all die though this too is disputed not the deaths but the completeness of genocide for consider if you will such leave over words as hurricane consider barbecue consider Jamaica land of wood and water of wood and water but not of gold could someone please go back in time and tell Columbus in China there is no word for gold christopher columbus in italiano Christopher Colombo in espanol Cristobal Colon a teacher once told me colon is root word for colonists and though i know that was false etymology there is some truth to it erica besa at which place you might find such tranquil villas as golden rich golden cloud golden I longtime home of Ian Fleming who SAT there on cliffs edge the morning's breakfast brought to him by a woman named Doris the scent of a key and crisp fried bread food wax wafting up to his nose drills while between his teeth he bit a number two pencil all the time looking out to sea as if fishing for a story maybe a man an incredible man let's call him bond James Bond who knew double-oh-seven wasn't actually Scottish but a barefoot boy from st. Mary Jamaica like so many others he too migrated the brutish winter cooling his complexion down to white such stories Goldfinger golden eye the man with the Golden Gun have you never stopped to ask where does all this gold come from have you never wondered what was found in El Dorado well let me tell you not a nugget not an ounce of or but light gilding the bay and perhaps bananas and perhaps a key and such language as could someone wind to capsize Columbus's ships and if that's not gold then what is hi um I'm Luca nod it's really wonderful to be here thank you for having me I'm going to start with a poem about clinical depression and it's called chorus the choir hadn't left him alone since the first day of summer he awoke to find them stationed around his bed one day the choir arrived without warning or explanation sang the choir in plainsong handing him toast on his first day back at work the choir stood at his desk singing the choir and making his professional life impossible two weeks later his partner left him for an osteopath Hannah cannot stand the choir any longer they sang that night he pummeled the choristers with his fists he beats the choir in frustration but though they are bruised and bleeding at the lip they sing with redoubled vigor sang the choir and then they sang he cannot get to sleep he cannot get to sleep he cannot get to sleep in perfect fifths until he fell asleep in time you may even grow fond of us they sang quietly um this is called my friend and like most of my poems it's about not being a very good person my friend your irresponsibility and your unhappiness delight me your financial problems and you're expanding waistline are a constant source of relief I am so happy you drink more than I do and you don't seem to enjoy it as much when I hear you being arrogant and argumentative my heart leaps your nihilism is fast becoming the richest source of meaning in my life and it is my pleasure to watch you speaking harshly to others when you got up about our mutual acquaintances I sigh with satisfaction your childish impatience delights me the day you threw a tantrum in the middle of the supermarket was the happiest day of my life sometimes you say something which reveals you to be rather stupid and I love you then but not as much as I love you as when you're callously manipulative your promiscuity is like a faithful dog at my side when you talk about your petty affairs you try to make them sound grand and important I cherish your goshness and your flippancy at times it seems you are actually without a sense of humor and I bless the day I met you you bully people younger and weaker than you and when other tell me about this I am pleased sometimes I think you're incapable of love and I'm filled with a containment of waking on a Saturday morning to realize I don't have to go to work I often suspect that you do not even like me really and my laughter over flows like water from a blocked cistern thank you so I read that poem before my two sons were born so now the line about having a tantrum in the supermarket is sort of tinged with horror for me which it wasn't when I wrote it um I'll do this little formal poem which is what men made of words men made of words live in migraine hotels and talk not of music but speaker cables they stay up to drink whiskey with red lemonade point out the mistakes whereas made of pronunciation directions and sales some compared charts before prints of Kandinsky some pic on the barmaid Nebraskan and pretty their guiding philosophy never needs telling the fauvist so colorful what is it they're selling art never hurts for the men made of words and if you like I often let down your guard when you're drunk in the hush of a theater courtyard or forced to find work beneath Travis deed arches you find yourself under the weight of their glances make your Excuse while the handshakes are hard and run for your life from the men made of words bless you need to cap off the repo thank you for doing that it's very encouraging um okay I'm gonna finally read this little poem which is a it's the love home and it's a poem about coincidence it's a poem about how where you end up in your life and what you end up doing and with whom and you have so little control over that and we used to sort of have words like fate and boosters who used to think of it maybe in spiritual terms and many of us but still do and this is a way of trying to deal with that with that with absolute with us of terrifying coincidences as bad as a sort of terrible Victorian novel was my feeling that there's more coincidence in life than in a bad novel um and it's about and partly it's inspired by meeting my wife and the only way the only reason I met her was because she got to see in her biology anvil which meant that we went to the same university so she got 3 a's she'd gone to cambridge and married married some other and so i'm grateful that she had a bad day on the day of her a love biology exam um anyway yeah it's all finished on this thank you thank you so much for listening but it's good leather band road should anybody ask me how we met I'll read them Ansel Adams on photography I'll say it's in the way the artist brings out of the landscape what the frame brings out of the painting which is to say you bring out the best in me but not the way the male odd reaction brings out the best in food through the combination of amino acids reducing sugars and heat no it's more the way the right light brings out the right wine and the scene reflected in your eye places me front and center looking in trying to describe the color it's what the singer does between the words that makes the words the words and not just words the crows that current stud the Risen green don't startle as I cycle through and crunch the gears the canada goose that turns its neck 182 rifle through its feathers rolodex distracted weavers weave their hair into the tapestry a chess move made six hours ago only makes sense now the way the symphony opens up only when you know what's coming next your place in it and why or not the way the past's not even past and looking back I overlooked the beauty of the worst of it the exam flunked as filed the blown bulb and the curtain drawn which gave the bar its votive glow the way that led with more coincidence and happenstance than a minor Victorian novel and yet with the absolute conviction of its binding and with gratitude to you place hi I'd rather you yeah can you hear me okay just with this mic yeah the shoes of a clown oh how I'd love to own a pair of those long towed clown shoes I think I'd find myself so engaging in them I put them on sit down upon a chair reach out my legs and happily be holds my oddly shod feet I'd stand and slap their long lengths on the ground to generate a flapping sounder a flapping sound like a crack like a crack crack and then I'd hurry backwards up the stair I'd hurry up to see you to show you my two new shoes and you'd turn around and apprehend myself emerging up from them a genie drifting from its polished lamp a plant sucking at its just watered ground so I'm going to do a few poems um and yeah it's fantastic to be here I was thinking this morning that that I'm i was a little bit worried that Mike because I write my poems in England it's kind of cold and they have that kind of feeling of slightly cold feeling about them i think i was worried that if I brought them here what was going to happen to my they kind of melt in that color hotter environment but so far they're okay I think so um this is called the chocolate car the little chocolate car has no wheels or windows and a body shell that's a sweet wrapper everything inside the car is made of chocolate the engine the battery all the little pipes and cables the petrol the oil the water the steering wheel and handbrake the carpeting and dashboard the seats and seat belts the sweet wrappers in the dual compartments the dual compartments the driver and passengers their flesh and their blood and their bones their skin and their hair the brains in their heads the food in their stomachs the feces in their bowels the urine in their bladders their clothes the money in their pockets the dirt on their shoes as well as absolutely all of the empty spaces in the car and made entirely out of chocolate the chocolaty smell with escapes from the cars body shell is the perfume worn by the chocolate woman who sits completely engulfed in chocolate in the chocolate passenger seat she smiles to herself with chocolate lips oh the chocolate teeth in a chocolate mouth at crammed full of chocolate she smiles because she can sense her she's pregnant with an embryo that's a miniscule errant miraculous bubble of air I read this as am a commissioned to do a a poem for a book of magic spell poems to change one dog to one cat you perhaps or to go to the park at a convenient time of your particular choosing you should find that what may be a dog knowing it by its humour take it home then fast on the ready table siphon its yap you can do this then on the wash table stick it with a shameful enslavement to mice on cushions in the drawing-room make it to fathom slowly and then quick that it is not itself disconnect with a step forward yank its crush on booze as the microphones hello allafrica disconnect with a straightforward yank it's crush on booze and the two of the meaty cigarettes and the brunt of the trundling ground so first all day litter fish cat being fish dog being fished and make sure to bend it as well to a pale dusty blue before you plead it and if needs be require it to black and to show what you've done make it to whistle itself once if you like okay one more moment in a very short one this one's called some all my poems are advertisements for me when I was young there was nothing exactly stupid about the world in fact in the good old days that was the thump and the tug of it the way it heaved itself like a stone yanked so to speak in glory the way it fell up crushed up and then crushed up again getting newer and newer louder and sweeter the way it watched its own face fall between its fingers as though its face where a handful of gold coins I think I might have known the whole drag of everything going upwards a tide that pulled me with it actually I know I did you were part of all this by the way and the sky Wow where to begin the sky was so adult not imbecilic or thin or so so or girlish did I outgrow it did I drink it shoot it find a way around it did I get inside it and drive off in it forgive me but on my way to work this morning even though the Sun was on fire and the trees were up I was in the apocalypse death it's not what you think it is it's actually what I think it is and one last short poem um it's called the fire hose if I was I don't know walking down say a street and i happen to come across a group of I don't know firemen and they were fighting say a fire then I might imagine my time not their fire hose to be a long and beige salami and then I might imagine my time not that I could take a slice of that salami that I could peel it at this ring of can the skin and then I'd have a lens the freshest monocle through which if I held it to my open I I probably see a group of firemen with a cup hose shouting angrily thank you I'm still get out this way hello everyone and it's absolutely wonderful to be here and to see such a lovely big audience and so thanks very much for having me I'm going to read some poems that are in my new collection that comes out in September and and the first poem I wrote em after a friend of mine died in 2014 and em it was a really wonderful man and I really adored in my looked up to him and I found that the grief just very inexpressible so this was the only thing I really managed to write about that and it's the shortest thing I've ever written wish list there's a ruptured vein in the arc of my heart a sonic rush in the steady of my being a wake up call in the doubt frozen morning and you with your head down there's a promise thrown into the seam of my brain a room filled with schools and carvings and s\u00e9ances a thrill struck wide by the cleft in your name and you you with your head down thank you and the book that I've written sort of describes the very complex relationship we all engage in at some point in our lives between like love and harm and now the two things can sort of coalesce and The Ballad of sexual dependency the pain isn't real you can shine a torch light on the wound it's healed in a matter of days but the scar itches at night and I claw chunks out of it don't tell me love hurts it doesn't it arrives and it leaves clean like death and birth and when it's gone it leaves nothing to mourn unless you can mourn happiness this prologue is of course meaningless my hair is dripping wet on my t-shirt I've been in pain for four months persistently my husband emailed the morning I was gone the subject field read The Ballad of sexual dependency he knew I would come home regret is a cowardly responds to doing something you absolutely mint now I know I'm not brave I can't face the world alone I slept in the loft and cried intermittently it's okay though i severed the limb cleanly and cried out for less than a minute and when it was done I remembered everything and learned to bite my tongue I'm in bed applying for free school meals we have nothing I have the melody but no song I'm not going to be anyone's miserable list I'm both the torture and the tortured i will put some effort into retracing the hotline mm with the emotional precision of a scalpel what doesn't cut me makes me real emptiness as a place in my life as just lost which fraternize is with myself a basement and in winter I look hot in summer dresses and no one trembles when they hold me close enough to despise me I am all alone in this life even my dreams do their best to let me down confetti I'll be in New my husband said I wouldn't survive the year but surviving thus far I look around and the body count is not severe this is last once a bit longer hmm it's not quite as is depressing probably and this ache cannot be pacified by pain alone sometimes I have nothing but my lavishly delusional dreams I wake in hotel rooms drenched in sweat cuddling the pillow loneliness can't grow up in this infantile age of instant gratification and sweetness I lick up the lollipop love you're so sucker into my wounds I keep pouring on the salt and rubbing it in to even it out but I love this sting too much I suck in the air through my teeth and want the unambiguous hit I crave intimacy until it fills me my drug of choice human connection I walk from one disaster to the next calmly scoring scars and sores registering my interest in your Omni virus excitement the sad city jerks spoke of the cost of living wages keeping your head down shadows tripped along in the dark and I said we all have a place in this world it's just that some of us are falling off its edges when i'm drunk i just become more acutely self-aware i fall over inside myself until the numbness grunts miss adjourn i just want to choose between one high and the next why do I remember painful events with wistfulness and nostalgia I want the sweet sting I want don't change and don't invite me when my veins are flooded give me language if you can't give me peace there is just too much of me everywhere and in your eyes and chest where I know I wanted and not wanted where I hide my fantasies were safe keeping I don't expect you to give them back I don't want you to keep them intact if they turn black I'll reimagine them and read define all my boundaries the syrupy taste of desire Colts my insides and I taste it and feel it sticky all over me I'm a scumbag and I don't know how to speak to the world I have the soda the aspartate in blanket I just need someone to hold me down hold me steady and apply pressure on the parts that hurt how many different ways can I say this you know what I want and what I need and how to deploy the strike that will start the war you know one to offer what's anticipated and when to hold back give me pleasure until I'm sick until I kill it can I be your little girl pull my hair damage my liver mold me into a caricature of myself mold me in your own image I can turn you into God and this terrifies both of us I've got all the time in the world I brush past strangers tried to touch as many living things as I can I'm voluptuous with torment don't cry over me your tea is a sweet and I like them the opium eating heart sucks in agony like a void and turns it into a work of art I suffer you suffer we all suffer etc we're entangled in what Cesar's clever people we are for finding selves in what Lord knows best I'm your worst nightmare and your most vivid dream out of context in an isolation without dramatic backdrop without the addiction a living contusion you make me come true the safety catch has been off for years just waiting for someone unhinged enough to fire the gun my roms location

Chidori kaatham Taruna una chan jealous orion i can go on like this is the language in which i right malayalam but i am reading the English translations for you a lead to old poems and to comparatively new phones sorry this is a point that most of you have heard many times stahma stammer is no handicap it is a mode of speech stammer is a silence that falls between the word and its meaning just as lameness it's a silence that falls between the word and the deed it stammer precede language or succeeded is it only a dialect or a language itself these questions make the lingus stammer each time is tammer we are offering a sacrifice to the god of meanings when a whole people stammer stammer becomes their mother tongue just as it is with us now bored too must have hammered when he created man that's why every word of man carries different meanings that's why everything he utters from his prayers to his commands stammers like poetry the magician is like a story for those who do not know the traditions not to marry as you've even know he's a Hindustani form of music there's a reference to a particular to marry in the forum the magician I clearly remember the day the magician had come to our school you know in our young days it that we used to have magic shows once in a while like everywhere I clearly remember the day the magician had come to our school he sold some card tricks and asked for a girl it was Khadijah who came forward the bold girl who had been laughing at his mat manliness telling everyone the secret of his tricks he laid her on the table on her back and removed her clothes one by one magic thought everyone and kept quiet then the magician took out a butcher's knife from his bag I am going to cut this girl into four slices like halwa he declared any any objection he asked the teachers and students magic thought everyone and did not object we gazed with bated breath he slowly brought down his knife hadiya's blood ran about on a school floor screaming magic thought everyone and did not wipe the blood the magician cleaned his knife got down from the stage and walked away magic everyone thought and did not stop him when he did not come back khadijah be called out it together she replied but we could not see her her voice had come from the Arabian Nights the book we opened the book and so Khadija gliding on the flying carpet dropping flowers and peacock feathers over the bleeding Damascus the dead Baghdad the choking Tehran the screaming Cairo the seating pureness flying with her was a to marry bubble mura na soota to toe hi Khadijah I called again she dropped a slate pencil from the flying carpet with that pencil I wrote my first poem I still write as i write each line I leave you my home and go to My Beloved's hey one of the of the two poems I wrote recently a short one I know two forms based on what recently happened in Turkey part of it as part of the Democratic protest there one was a dancer erdem gunduz a young dancer he came and stood in a place where every kind of demonstration was forbidden he just came there he just stood there he was not demonstrating he was not sloganeering but he knowing that from the social media thousands of people came and stood there and that became a major protest another was that also happened in Turkey in the that this happened in gezi Park the other thing happened in Taksim Square where where again demonstrations were forbidden a man and a woman a couple came and stood there fishing for hours and then a lot of couples game and they stood there kissing for hours and that became another another another show of protest I am trying to create two metaphors for poetry out of these two small incidents the standing man a man still silent stands in the park where demonstrations are forbidden he is going nowhere nowhere is he coming from the world passes before him and time behind him in between with no flags or slogans he stands still silent the world moves with the Sun and he multiplies becomes a hundred becomes a thousand hands in pockets this desk and still silent this is a nation' in war in a shin the stands stands up against injustice a glimpse of the future seen in a lightning flash a man stands in the park still silent the Sun goes round him poetry is a man standing alone in a forbidden place and the and the second one the kiss you didn't believe you when the poet said the world the changes when two people kiss it is Octavio Paz who said that you didn't believe when the poet said the world changes when two people kiss see them a man a woman they kiss not a man and a woman but many men many women in the same square where the enforces of low and of morals used to form together if ever they walked hand-in-hand a man a woman many men many women in the squire once a person to every kiss they are working the low the present slow of death they are making below the future slow of life poetry is a private kiss provocatively exchanged in a public place I'll I'll finish with this old form the mad oh I hope I'm not exceeding my time the last one yeah the mad I had a lot of mad people in my family literally and I'm not sure I am NOT one one of them the mad the mad have no caste nor religion the trans and gender live outside ideologies we do not deserve their innocence their language is not of dreams but of another reality they they allow is moving light it overflows on the full moon day looking up they see jobs we have never heard of they are shaking their wings when we fancy they are shrugging their shoulders they hold even flies households and a green God of grasshoppers leaps up on thin legs at times the seed trees bleed here from the streets they reach heaven leaning in acceptance eyes just as we do but there anything here and singing in the chorus well patty the air that ami SI claro over the Mediterranean with our heavy kid the strap our panel from erupting they have another version of time our century is their second 21 seconds under H Christ 69 they are with the Bata in a single day they reach of the Big Bang at the beginning there go on walking restless for their purpose boiling still the mad are not mad like us just assuming it's okay okay yeah I read I'm John asked for it because my name begins with why yoko is my newborns have soft lips skillful tons and elastic chicks they can pour now produce any sound that exists on earth to learn one's mother term means to stifle it a sounds one doesn't use many forgotten sands never come back the sound of the foreign language records dreams in

you because I'm not at all familiar with the audience here how many of you would consider yourselves web developers no 10 [Music] 13 how many of you would consider yourselves hardware hackers how many of you would consider yourselves something and completely dinner accident okay well I don't like we could you at least interested in the web how many of you have ever seen a website good we've got some common ground objective I work on the chrome security and what I'd like to talk to you about today is the way that we're approaching the web platform and the way that we're approaching the API is that we give to developers and the way the platform is designed in general the platform has kind of organically grown over time some pieces of the platform make a whole lot of sense and other pieces of the platform make no sense whatsoever but they're kind of these are black semantics that are stuck with when I talk about a platform I'm really talking about the AP is that we give to developments on the surface area that there's AP is present not only the developers but also to attackers I'd note by the way that this link for slides is up and available right now so none of you have laptops which is great but if you did have a laptop I would suggest that following along here would be helpful just because there are a lot of links this presentation is basically a brain dump of a variety of projects we're working on that I think are important and if you're at all interested in developing things for the web these things are going to be paying are these things are going to be api's that are available to you in the near future and that I hope you start talking her out of it so I consider myself a web developer at heart I've kind of moved on from web development i'm starting i'm working in chrome itself so about five or six years ago i started on the chrome team started programming in c++ but before that I worked on the web and I did HTML CSS and JavaScript peloton was a prime web developer the very first browser that I ever uses this one know about mrs. yes mosaic in CS a mosaic I think I got this and like my parents got internet in a box right so it's a box delivered to our house it was great he hooked up our modem we dialed in and use mosaic to get to various websites and the work that many websites at this point was like 94 95 and for me it was absolutely transformative to see a few source option here because I would browse around the web and I did all this great information and then I realized that not only was there information out there but I could create it myself and this is factory today we were coding everything by hand uphill both ways in the snow so you can actually look at the source of a page and map it mentally pretty easily to what was rendered on the wage so there was a one-to-one relationship here and it was really just transformative for me to see that I myself could build these kinds of websites about five years ago when I started working on Chrome I realized there was kind of another layer of view source because all of that HTML CSS and JavaScript is actually rendered to receive electronic or through rusts or threw out some other lower level language and building those those browsers is a massive projects chrome chromium itself is hundreds of thousands of lines of code we have lots of dependencies that bring the numbers up significantly higher it's a large project and anyone who's ever worked on a large project will tell you that large projects are never finished and in fact large projects are always broken in various ways though it continually surprises me that chrome works at all because we keep walking through these things you look at code you say this code is crap how could this ever have worked and then you realize that you yourself wrote it three years ago and now you get to fix it so I've written a number of to do's myself I looked through the carrier-based last night there about 14,000 two dudes in the topics there another two or three thousand fix me comments in the code thing so there are a lot of problems that we know about and we knew about them when we were writing the code because otherwise the comments wouldn't be there right if you look at the bug tracker than we have so if you go to see our bug calm you'll see another several hundred thousand bugs that are open so people are reporting bugs to us it's not just bugs are you and that we knew about when we were writing but people are also telling us about things we didn't know about them we're writing so the project itself is very physical it's very large and we're human we're following we're going to make mistakes so there are bugs in the project that we know about their bugs in the project that we don't know about and all of these together mean that the project itself is broken but imagine magic promotes imagine that a team of elves came in overnight and fix every bug incur may be absolutely perfect it would implement every standard perfectly so every line of every standard is done the elders even at tests so that we won't drastic screams so we have a well-tested perfect implementation of every standard out there for the web my contention is that it would still be broken and it would be broken not because the code didn't do what we expected it to but because the implications of those expectations are actually different than what we thought they were we were designing things in the personals the platform itself has issues and those issues are baking the design of the platform this is especially true for really old things so if you look at the original HTML spec and the original JavaScript implementation for for netscape without in today there are there are issues of design that make it difficult for us to really lock things out there are just some things that we made some really good decisions way back when so maybe same origin policy for website so that you know your example calm cannot access bank conferences that wasn't a given so way back in the day they were really there were actual questions about whether it should be possible for you to load data from anywhere and to make requests anywhere and to just treat everything is one big homogenous pool of data and that makes a lot of sense when it's used for science and literature it makes significantly less sense to infuse for baking baking applications so we made some good decisions way back line but we also made some bad decisions and I'd like to talk about is the way that the chrome team is approaching this position so in the way that the current team is those looking backwards to try to fix old 80 is but also looking forwards to design new AP is in ways that actually make sense so the chrome team is really concerned with regard to the web platform with too well I am really concerned with two main classes of attacks so I assume that the browser is perfect I assume that the elves came in at some point and fixed all of the implementation bugs and what I am trying to do and my team is trying to do is actually build on top of that you know Kwazii perfect system and leave the imperfections to the rest of the security who is worried about finding all those bugs in six mo so from my perspective but browser itself by design is a confused deputy so this describes a class of attack that uses the browser's privileged position as your agent on the web so we call it a user agent the browser is you represented to the web and the browser makes requests on your behalf the browser's stores data on your behalf and browser shares data on your behalf and it can very easily be tricked into doing things that neither the server nor the client actually wants it to do so two broad classes of attacks are things that I really want to fix no I think are really important the first is called cross-site scripting who's heard of cross-site scripting everyone as I said you said you were five developers what's going on cross-site scripting is as you all know a mechanism of tricking a server into delivering code that the server doesn't actually expect to be delivering so I talked about the same origin policy earth and as you probably know any code that executes in the context of an origin has all the power of that origin so if I can trick a server into delivering JavaScript then the server will send that JavaScript down to the client the crime will execute if you know anything about v8 in grown you know that VA loans JavaScript and wants to execute absolutely as quickly as possible and this is a great thing when it's actually too did you attend it's kind of a terrible thing if the code isnt what you actually wanted to have anyone so cross-site scripting is a big problem almost every website is going to have an injection attack of one sort or another Google husband Jeff Kent attacks even though we have an internal security team whose entire job is dedicated to preventing these kinds of attacks it's quite possible that besides that you're responsible parasites that teams your companies are responsible for has similar kinds of holes if you look at the vulnerability reward program at Google where we take researchers to tell us about bugs instead of exploiting them we see that cross-site scripting is easily the largest category we have at people again even though we invest a ton in stimulating systems and even though we invested time into education internally so the second kind of attack that I think is pretty interesting it's called site request forgery so again the browser doesn't really understand what's going chrome firefox whoever it's going to make requests on your behalf and when it makes those requests it's going to make them with your sword with you as the user initiating the request or at least that's what it looks like to the server so is evil com makes a request to bang com it's going to send your cookies along with its going to send the token of the bound tokens along with it and the channel ID and whatever else so all of the authentication information is being sent along with leezar advice so if the server is not defending itself against this kind of attack that it's quite possible for evil calm to change safe on bank calm perhaps by transferring all of your money to eagle on top this ends up being back in a variety of ways it's something that I think we need to address in one way or another and I'll talk a little bit about the strategies really different don't even know Mario Heinrich Mario is a great job he's incredibly smart last year he suggested that web security has become a paradox that web apps both complex and secure cannot be built that the web staff has grown beyond that being possible yay so he's happy I think he's happy because it's a pen tester so he really wants these holes to continue to exist so that you can keep hacking into websites and educating developers but i find this sentiment somewhat nihilistic and I think that it's unfortunate when we look at the platform and say well the platform is large and it's powerful so therefore it's indefensible I think instead what we should do is actually examine the platform and figure out what changes we can reasonably make so the current mean at least the web platform side of the chrome team is really interested in measuring the usage of various things on the web so we have a metric system internally where if a user ups into sharing usage data we can kind of figure out how often certain api's are used so these are not really complicated counters it's really just if a thing happens and increment something and then we look at those counters and say well on expert pageviews wife and using this kind of information we can look at the old API is that we don't like and we can look at the way that those api's are actually used and try to figure out what changes we can reasonably make in order to make those api's better so you like everything else is Google we try to be data-driven and we try to understand the impact on users but that doesn't mean that the platform is immutable so we definitely want to look back at these old api's and figure out what kinds of changes we can really make at the same time we want to look forward and we want to give developers API so something we talk about internally in the chrome team a lot is the idea of giving developers sharp tools so if you've ever cooked or cut anything with a knife you'll recognize that a sharp knife is significantly easier to use and therefore significantly safer than a dull knife if you have a really sharp knife it'll cut right through things you don't have to exert much pressure which means you have a great degree of control over where the blade is going if you have a dull knife and you can't really cut anything unless you exert a lot of pressure and when you exert a lot of pressure do you use control over where the knife is going so if you're cutting some food it's quite likely that if you have to press really really hard to deny it will slip and you'll end up cutting yourself so we want to give developers sharp tools because we see when we don't give them sharp tools that we end up with things like flash areas that we say exactly if we don't give them the tools in the platform they will route around the platform in whatever ways they can they will see the platform is damaged and they'll route around it so you'll get things like flash that end up causing significantly more problems over a longer period of time than a well-designed API that actually gave them the power to do the things they wanted to do in the first place so the current team is really interested in giving people sharp tools and if you look at sharp tools you recognize a couple of things that I think are really good metaphors for security on the web so you'll see that the tool has a sharp piece I mean not so sharp piece it's relatively obvious in between those two pieces however you'll see a little brass bar and at the guard so the guard serves a couple of important purposes first it stops the knife from sliding down your hand cutting yourself on the sharp blade so it gives you context in which you can actually use this tool makes the tool easier to use and give you some guidance as to how it is right you hold the hills you don't hold the blade second it stops sharp objects from sliding down the blade to cut your hand so if you're a fight if don't my type but if you are a nice fighting then you want to have a knife that has a guard because it will actually stop the opponent's knife from sliding down your blade and cutting year and a half so it protects you from things on the web and the interesting thing about this is that it's not an opt-in protection its structure it's built into the tool itself so you are protected in some way from attackers on the web just by having this tool because the tool is designed in such a way to perfection the second thing you'll notice is that knives and swords and other bladed instruments usually have a sheet or a scabbard or some mechanism by which you can put the knives away and make it blunt so if you have pigs at home you probably don't want to leave a sharp knife lying around you once said put it away into a knife block or into a sheath or a scabbard or something and that will actually build a knife because the outside of the sheet is not going to cut anybody you can hit them on the head with it but you're not going to come and dulling the edge of a sharp blade did you know that you're not going to use it's a really good metaphor for the kinds of Austin protection so we can give to developers by providing them with AP is that allow them to lock their sites down more more securely than we can do by default so we have all these api's people are relying on them we can't just change the web out from under them but we can give you the ability to change your own application so make it different than the rest of the web and actually more secure by simply turning off things that you know you're gonna use you can reduce the service area for attack simply by putting your night or putting various api's into she's so let's start with this idea of a guard what are the structural changes that we can make the web to make it better to make the api's on the platform that we provide the developers more sensical and more sensible the very first thing we need to do is improve TLS that's absolutely critical this structural change is something that's been ongoing over time so the chrome team has been very just over time at getting folks to start using encryption and start using HTTPS as opposed to http I think Firefox is published their telemetry that shows that they finally gone over the fifty percent mark so people's people in Firefox use more pls than non TLS and police in terms of time they're browsing I think Chrome has similar numbers published on Google's HTTPS transparency you haven't seen that I think it's pretty interesting it shows you excuse me it shows you how much rules traffic is encrypted and I think it's something like EV nine percent at the moment the outdoor incoming traffic and it also gives you an overview of kind of where websites are and what large websites have transferred over and what and whether they have good TLS configurations and then what websites have in trans terminators there's a really great website in the state's called secure the news and this actually do through a lot of news websites and will tell you whether or not they're using HTTPS now news websites in the states are not great there are a lot of these websites that are using TLS and actually some large websites have just made the jump so in New York Times for instance just transferred over I think last month which is great it's really exciting news sites in Germany are not quite with the game or at least I haven't seen them be that way so to go outside Eagles Stan these are all not available over TLS and in fact most of them some of them will actually redirect you to http if you do to https others will not even load the page at all so if you go to build https do that ze it will give you a 410 error that says this page is not available in very stated yes it loads the page over HTTPS but it doesn't give you any data it just gives you an error it just kind of said regardless new sites and these kinds of non login sites are things that some people think don't really need TLS because you know why do you really care TLS gives you a number of important benefit it gives you a modicum of integrity that is you know the bits that are being delivered over the wire or actually intact when they get to you and haven't been modified by someone in between so if folks aren't injecting as your websites and they're not changing your website so that you know that if there's an article on to Deutsche that is actually s\u00fcddeutsche I writing it and not Vodafone injecting an article that's really positive about Vodafone so you get integrity you also get authentication that is you know that the server that you're talking to is the server that's justifiably using that name so it's not any signal to the it's actually be supposed to be you and it gives you a measure of confidentiality so no one knows what articles you're reading so that if you're really interested in the new Power Rangers movie no one's going to judge you for it because no one knows that you're really interested in our interest movie probably a good movie but you know one of the things that's changed recently is the introduction of lesson grants anyone heard that let's encrypt excellent wonderful lesson grip is really exciting because it is a certificate authority that has significantly better properties and a lot of certificate authorities had in the past a lot of people have really focused on the free notion let's encrypt that is it gives you a certificate you don't have to pay them for it and that's great because it really opens the doors to a lot of people that weren't going to pay for certs but should be using circus but I think actually the more important change is not free but automated that is there's a protocol called Acme which allows you to obtain a certificate for a server without manually going through the process of going out grabbing a surge installing on your on your server and then setting up your server such as it's actually using the cert to deliver to deliver an encrypted connection the automation portion of this is incredibly important it's important for a couple of reasons saving status quo you'll generally go to Samantha you'll buy a search it'll be good for about three years and after three years and one day you'll run a fire drill because no wonder the company has any idea how to deploy a cert because the last time you did it was three years ago and the three people responsible for it have all left the company so each I'm sorry or they don't remember right we did no one documents thing so when there is a fire drill and when your cert has expired you need to go out and figure out how to do all this stuff and it just it never works out the way that it's supposed to let's encrypt I think by default right I think right now only serves our only gives you a certain from 90 days and I think the goal is to reduce that so that it's not three years but 60 days or 30 days or three days these kinds of short-lived certificates I would really love to see that be the norm for a variety of reasons first of all because it's automated looks thank you because it's automated and because there's this protocol behind it and there's a program running on your theater it's going to be something that you do on a regular basis it's going to become part of your normal deployment process as opposed to a one-off thing that you do three times a decade it also gives us the opportunity to change the civic and ecosystem more rapidly than we've been able to do in the past so if you followed along neta stuff in the last two years you've heard a lot about style one and you've heard a lot about at least chrome trying to deprecate sha-1 as a signature algorithm for certificates because it's not good enough these days it has taken an incredibly long time to get shell 1 deprecated and this was partially due to reticence on the part of ca's to make any changes whatsoever but it's also due to the fact that if you serve certificates or if you sell a certificate for that's good for three years and we have to support it for three years because otherwise we're making people sad so by reducing the longest amount of time that you can service tificate for we're actually making it possible to change the ecosystem more rapidly so shorter load certificates along with automation is absolutely going to Perdido system that said deploying a certificate is still more difficult than it ought to be there are a couple of servers coming out these days that actually build TLS into the core infrastructure of the server so caddy is one of them County is incredibly simple to set up and all you have to do is point a dns name at it and then you will get a cert it'll get a certain on your behalf it will renew the cert on your behalf and it continually updates the configuration of the server so you don't have to care about things like cyber suits or algorithms or anything you all you have to do is deploy caddy and then like magic your tlf set up we'll just keep iterating and keep getting better over time wire is an organization in the States or a magazine that has migrated over to JLS and what they did is that I think is really nice it has put together a series of articles talking about the way they did the migration and the problems that they ran into overtime and this was incredibly useful to us as browser vendors and also as API designers to kind of figure out what the holes were and where people were running in pain so these are really good articles if you're at all interested in migrating your site's over to TLS is anyone willing to admit that their company does not serve their website or tails okay actually so those folks I would really recommend that you take a look at these articles and the rest of you they didn't want to admit the fact that your site is not a repeal up I should all take a look at these articles because they really go through a lot of the struggles that large companies will face when doing the exact migration so I may I migrated Mike Weston word over TLS years ago and it said like an hour it's relatively straightforward I knew all the content just five months this don't significantly longer and I think that what what's interesting about these kinds of larger sites is that they run into very different problems than you see on smallest one of those problems is mixed content so mixed content is basically a guarantee that we give to users we say if you see TLS that is if you see an encrypted connection we want to verify to you that everything on this page is encrypted because otherwise we're lying to you if we tell you that it's secure so we block things like script loaded from AC or from HTTP on an HTTPS side because there's no integrity for that script it could be anyone delivering script at this page and this is something that we think that certainly wired saw and other folks have seen as a real blocker towards us how to migration there are large news organizations that have run websites for long enough that they have lost the previous to CMS is that they used to deploy any sort of content to the website so they have a database the database is full of stuffs but they have no program that actually interacts with that it's just sitting there serving stuff on their website and for various reasons the reticence actually go through those database entries and modify them because you know they might break things and they don't have any way of recovering from that breakage so we've talked a little bit with these folks and kind of tried to design a P is for them that enable them to continue serving their websites but do it in a secure way so one of those is called upgrade in situations we know that you sell https as HTTP on your website you wrote HTTP example a calm but you really meant HTTPS so you can instruct the browser to kind of make this transition for you so that we will automatically upgrade the request before we send them out on the wire and we'll treat them as next contact so if you have an image on your page that's linking to https devil um if you set upgraded security quests then we will automatically upgrade that and ensure that we never have mixed content on your website because we're always upgrading the request a shin yes what's interesting about this but it also cascades down into frames so that if you load various content on your website we can guarantee to you that we're never actually going to degrade the UI that we display to be uses we're always going to be loading good content that's over an encrypted channel this looks like upgraded feature requests the header as part of content security policy that will talk a little bit later about and the idea here is that you deliver this HTTP header along with the page and you say i know that i spelled things HTTP on this page but please browser help me out here and we'll do that upgraded security glasses available in basically every major browser today except edge edge is working on but they're not quite there yet so it was just deployed in iOS 10 3 that came out last week I think so Safari 10 3 years on Iowa's sports and one on Mac its bidding chrome for a long time and it's been in Firefox for a long time which also means that it's an opera and this gives you a pretty good coverage with regard to upgrade it to request and if you look at this library will to see that they found this to be an absolutely critical portion of their upgrade backers so allowing them to do this allowing them to up great things about actually changing things on disk was incredibly valuable to go so the inverse of it you'll recognize it upgraded secure requests is basically the site asserting to the browser that it's supposed to be loading phase generation guess so asserting the third-party resources should actually be issued yes the inverse of this would be those third parties asserting if they should always be loaded their accts even if you sell them as HTTP so a good example of this would be youtube com youtube com has been around long enough that it wasn't though ways delivery over HTTPS it isn't delivered over HTTPS now when it's serving an HF TS better which means that the browser will never connect to it over HTTP we'll do a client-side redirect before actually going out to the web which means that you'll never make a non-secure connection to youtube.com at sea than there was however there are tons of youtube com frames on the web and those frames are all HTTP youtube com because that's what they were when the person originally copy and pasted it and no one's going to go through and change a billion frames in the web it would be nice if we use hsps in order to upgrade those requests to unblock those websites from actually upgrading to TLS without forcing them to go through all their code and make changes unfortunately this introduces a little bit of non-determinism because you as a developer have been to every resource that you require you've been to your CDN you have the hfcs pin for that website so you know that you're always going to load a diverse CBS but your users have never been to your cydia and never will be to your cpa or never will go to your TV a which means they will see breakage they will file bugs you will close the bugs because it works for you and then everyone will be sad when you actually figure out what's going on what we'd like to do is reverse the order of hsps admix content so that hsps happens first does the upgrade but does it in such a way as to not introduce this non deterministic behavior so one approach to this that Firefox is implemented and is in the process of applying or at least as a mountain i'm experimenting with it's something called hspf priming and the idea here is that if we're going to load a non-secure resource we will first make an HTTP x request to that origin and say hey do you have HS yes and if you do great we'll keep will store that pen and then we'll upgrade the request and this removes the this makes it a deterministic process that is we will always get the pin if there is append to be gotten and because of that we should be able to invert these and allow those third parties to actually assert something about their own resources which I think I'll be pretty I would know however that this isn't just for websites it's actually kind of important to encrypt communications likes email forensics start TLS has been around for a long time and it isn't is an opportunistic encryption bag where a server that wants to send us an email will ask permission to send some email from an SMTP server and it will along with that you'll say hey I can totally encrypt this if you wanted me to if you get the right response back then the transmission will be upgraded to an encrypted pls connection and then you'll send the email over an encrypted connection which is great because that means people can read your email or at least no one but those two parties can agree unfortunately because it's opportunistic is trivially blocked so an active network attacker only has to block a single header in the response and that's just trivia it happens all the time because people want to be able to read email any virus does it's a lot where it says oh I did they can't read TLS but I'll just stop that TLS stuff so that I can parse all these messages and then stop it from getting the server any virus so it's a thing MTA FPS is basically applying the notion of HTTP or a chest es tu email so you have a DNS entry or you have a file sitting on your server somewhere that expresses a policy about your email sir by doing so you can actually in an out-of-band way assert that you should always have a TLS connection to me when you're Latino so this gives you similar properties they just es on the web if you have an email server I really recommend that you set something like this up because the encrypted email is incredibly important yeah encrypted communication is there I'd also note that again looking back at these kinds of old api's it's it been the case we have launched a lot of AP is that looking back we kind of wish we hadn't launched in that way in particular there are a lot of AP is that are available over non secure connection that should never have been lost over not secure connection so geolocation is kind of canonical example it shouldn't be the case that by giving a origin to your location permissions you're giving anyone on the network between you and that origin glf inspiration because it is a non-secure origin there is no authenticity which means I can four words that content to my heart's content so I can grab to your location just by being an active network backer that's kind of unfortunate what we're trying to do now is looking forward only launched new colorful AP is that are using TL their locks through a secure contacts so you can have geolocation on 18 yes but you can't have geo location of HTTP there are a variety of API doing so geolocation is a canonical example web crypto getusermedia so your camera and your microphone credential Iseman API service workers payment requests and many many more the idea is these kinds of AP is especially if you guys that have permissions associated with them are only it's only a meaningful granted permission if it's lots to in a context you can assert something about you can't discern anything about HTTP so giving access to these api is a very should be is simply about idea again looking at the data that we have we've been able to deprecate a number of these api is over HTTP so geolocation was turned off last year at the early last year over HTTP so you can only access reservation yeah my hope is and will become more aggressive of others I would like to live in a world where we only launched new API over HTTPS that's been a difficult sell both internally and externally but i think that browser vendors in general or started to get on board with the idea that shipping new API HTTP is simply that idea the last kind of structure will change i'll quantum at is a distinction between internet and Internet so again your browser is a privilege is in a privileged position and is acting on your behalf with your credentials one of your credentials it's actually the network that you're connected to if you happen to be in an office connecting to network you have access to different kinds of resources then i would have access to you from outside that office because you're in trusted internal network you're running on a trusted machine and you're able to make requests to things like your printer or your router but i wouldn't be able to make a request to you at least on that poured from outside because of this it's become relatively common like one kind of time it's relatively common unfortunately common is a tax on people's routers because routers are generally at known location so one that if you want 60 one is probably going to be a router and if not it's going to be 10 one or something along those lines because of that and because of the fact that router is never actually expected to be attacked by the web and are written in such a way that makes csrf style attacks trivial and number of cases it's quite possible for an attacker to force your computer to make a request to your router that then changes your DNS server so that you're using the tuckers dns server and at that point your web is very different than the web that actually exists because of this we'd like to make it more difficult for attackers to use that privileged position of your browser in order to attack things that the web doesn't normally have access to this includes your local internet but it also includes things running on localhost so on the loopback address if you install some software locally then it's quite possible but that's all for it sets up a server and then serves require response to requests for particular origins Dropbox does is Spotify those as Google on some products that do it it's relatively common let's try to kind of give a website a little bit more access so Dropbox for instance wants to know whether the dropbox client themselves that it can give you a link that do is to your local policies and they do this by having a server running locally and accept requests from dropbox com and dropbox is clever enough that they do reasonable course checks on this information so they verified it it's actually coming from dropbox com and not from anyone on the web Trend Micro was not going to be kind of checks and because of that actually has a remote code execution on your computer just by sending an HTTP request to local lips which is kind of not awesome it would be great if that wasn't to think about it I would like to do is split the web into these three layers at least these relays please please make up to me so you have the web the outside stuff you have internet and there's an RFC RFC 1918 that defines and a couple of other updates that define a set of ips that are internal or reserved for internal use this is completely different in ipv6 I have no idea what we're going to do there but at least try to you before we should be able to make something work and then you have local ins and you can kind of think of this as an onion and the privileged kind of expand you get down if you want to lock down access to local oh and you want to lock down access to the Internet and we can do this by expanding the notion of course so their cores cross-origin resource sharing and it's basically a system by which origin one can ask permission to make certain requests origin to generally we only do this for non simple request and course turns what I'd like to do is extend that to actually force a course pre-flight for any request that crosses one of these boundaries so if you're going from the web to localhost the browser will first send an option to request the local is it's okay do you understand the course protocol do you understand that you're going to get a request from someone outside of your network and you totally have to set up if if the software is written in such a way that is acceptance requests and sends a reasonable response back then it will allow the request if the software doesn't respond because doesn't understand options or doesn't understand this protocol it will lock it down and we'll make sure that the web is incapable talking to things like hold routers that are never going to be updated I think that's pretty interesting it turns out to be really difficult to implement because figuring out what IP address are going to be talking to is actually pitiable especially when ipv4 ipv6 world there's the the best named algorithm that I've ever heard is called happy idle and no idea what's called happy august so the idea is that you race life easy for an ipv6 connection and whichever responds first is the ones you're actually going to talk to you so its way down deep in the network stack and it's really difficult to get to the point that I know what connection i'm going to talk to you at a point where i can actually make this kind of creeped record class so i have like half an implementation of this and blink and it turns out i'm going to have to do a little anyway let's move on to the notion pass these structural changes to opt-in changes that developers that building websites can use make their own websites more secure the first and foremost of these is called content security policy common security policy is a policy mechanism that allows you to determine what resources load on your page the basic idea is that you have resource and various types and you say okay script can load from these origins it can load for my CDN it can load from me myself but it can't load from you belong and they can't load from and this actually gives you the ability to lock down your site to prevent cross-site scripting attacks or at least mitigate the risks associated with cross-site scripting common security policy is been around for a number of years now we're kind of just now getting to the point where it's useful we've seen github so github has done a great job with their common security quality they've actually put a ton of work into locking down the origins from our stated resources and they have probably the best list based on security policies I've seen where they actually know what's on every surface of the loading things from and can verify that their only loading their own code from those servers Google luck tom however has had a much more difficult i'm deploying one of these lists based policies because as it turns out there's a lot of stuff on google com and if you're at all familiar with like return based or return oriented programming if you have these gadgets in your code you can kind of run any code just by stringing together gadgets and various buyers the same thing is actually true on origin blood google com there's enough code on google com that you can find something to load that's going to do the work that you wanted to do so it's totally possible to bypass a card security policy that's whitelisting on things like hula both github and dropbox have been using CSK using it for quite some time and they put together really good descriptions of the ways that they've gotten into their current policy and kind of the challenges they ran into overtime and the things that they've learned during their plan so I think it's really worth your time to take a look at both of these if you're responsible for a website at all and you want to defend that website again say but college like cross-site competitor however these kinds of policies can start getting a bit absurd this is Twitter's policy Facebook's policy was even longer you start kind of running out of space on a slide to actually display all the origins of your loading things from it turns out as I mentioned earlier that deploying a policy like this on a site like Google acog it seems pretty simple and happily however consecrated quality level to which is supported in basically all major browsers at this point as a as a mechanism called announced that allows you to whitelist a specific script not by origin but by saying I meant for the script to be on my page so you have a token that you send it a header so you're talking to ABC and then that token is reflective in your page as part of the script tag so if the tutor things match and you're doing a good job of rotating the tokens and generating a new token every time a number used once then you can actually verify that this script is the script that you wanted to run because you knew that ok an attacker are trying to inject script in your page doesn't know that's open is therefore not able to execute scripts the smart folks on the Google security team has put together a set of guidelines for what they're calling a strict CSP and it's a certain on Stacy SD the idea here is that you use these noises in or it's a whitelist and or to allow specific script elements on your age and then you grant those script elements the authority to load news fair so there's something called strip dynamic and CSP three that allows you to kind of give give power to the scripts that you load to load more scripts and this actually is pretty interesting because it gives you kind of a loader mechanism where you verify the loader script and then you say well my loader script can load stop say let it load things this turns out to be a really good way of employing CSP and making it much less fragile than these kind of origin based lists because if you are loading maps for instance maps is going to load whatever Maps wants to load you don't have to know all et servers that maps is going to use you just say max please do your thing you trust the script and you allow that script to to load the various resource abilities so if you're at all interested in deploying content security quality a strict non-space EST using start dynamic is what suits inside of Google are actively deploying on Google products and it's something that's probably order to be significantly easier for you than the long list of origin you see on something actually I get up I also know that there's something called sub resource integrity and as you notice the moment ago comment security policy is generally origin base that is we say I trust this origin origin please give me script it is the case however that CD and get hacked jquery CDN was hacked a number of times over time they were developing some resort integrity which i think is interesting the idea here is that it gives you a content-based mechanism of saying I want to load the script I want to load a script from this origin but I also want the script to be exactly the script that I think it is so I sent the script up to my CDN I take a hash of that script shots will shop 256 or buds ball or whatever and I reflect that hash in an integrity attribute within the script element on the page and this allows the browser to say okay I'm gonna download and then I'll verify it will make sure that this content actually matches the content you subscribe the integrity and if you do this then you get a content-based check to verify not only but you're executing scripts in Georgia but it's actually the scripted you want in CSP three we're going to layer hatches on top of some resources a group so kind of security policy will verify the hashes that you that you list first specific script and then some resource integrity will verify that those hatchet is match the actual content this gives you a content-based mechanism allowing a specific strip to execute on your page which i think is gonna be really powerful especially for these kind of loader mechanism but we're talking about where you say I trust this script and really I only trust this script not just any script of this order we've made a number of changes to cookies over time it cookies are kind of one of the large mistakes that we made with designing the web it's really unfortunate that cookies have a completely different security model than everything else so generally speaking we have an origin base security model let me say this origin is responsible for itself and not for anything else and it should have access to anything else that should have to request things from other origins it should just gain access my cookies however kind of brutal origins down to an effective TLD +1 so you have comm with the TLD he and then you buy something calm so something calm is the etl v plus one there are also things like appspot com and appspot com in itself is kind of a TLD so we treated differently than we treat something like exam tomorrow so cookies have power up to the effective top-level domain so you even if I'm on something something made something something calm I can set Andrey cookies from eggs abelardo so anything under the seat Ald is kind of all lumped into the same pile there are a couple of things that we'd like to do to to change cookies to make them slightly less terrible at least in terms of its security properties a couple of those things are here so same side cookies is the thing that I'm most excited it shifts I think in crim 51 Firefox is working on an implementation another folks are interested the idea is that instead of allowing the user agent to make authenticated requests on your behalf anywhere that website wants which enables things like cross-site request forgery of X you can specify that a specific cookie is same site that is I want to send myself this cookie but if anyone else initiates the request the cookie shouldn't be set so you can imagine a session serving for instance that is set to be a same site group that is if example calm sets the cookie great if example calm makes a request to example like hi great but if example calm I'm sorry if evil calm makes your request to example calm then you shouldn't find that cookie a long way because sending that cookie will trick can trick the server into gating the request and saying no this is totally the user I think we should you know transfer all their money to the evil on top if that seems like it is it reasonable to do so same side cookies give you the ability to lock a cookie to a specific sites contacts you can I can make requests to myself so whenever I call my own API they should totally work but if anyone else calls my AP is you're not going to deliver that cookie and because you don't deliver this it's relatively straightforward for the server to understand this is not an authenticated request and shouldn't actually be executed they elude that there's a wax attribute or relax value for the same side attitude so there are kind of two modes you can run the same psychic you set what is the lacs mode and a lacks node has the property that I just talked about where sub resource requests from evil calm will contain cookies when going to you google but if you navigate to vidcom will send McCurdy's a long way so it is a top-level navigation we'll treat that insane even though the navigation was initiated by Ibaka strict mode won't treat that in the same side navigation and we'll say no evil law com initiated the request and we're not going to send it even though you're doing a top level navigation this gives you the ability to set up kind of a two kooky system so if you're familiar with like Amazon for instance if you go to Amazon it knows who you are and it says you know hello Mike would you like to buy all the things today and you say yes please give me all the things but when you actually want to buy things you have two real dedicated type in your password and then you go through the checkout flow so there's kind of two levels of access the website there's a yup I know who you are and can show you a reasonable rendering to give you the information you're looking for and then there is you're going to take a dangerous action so I'm going to really examine with your glass more carefully by having these two kinds of cookies a strict and alack smooth same side cookie you can build the same sort of Mecca where you stand and have the browser guarantee that these cookies are only being sent in particular set of contacts and I think this is going to be pretty vulnerable as I said it's only in chrome right now but I'm hopeful the fire box will be shipping it relatively soon as well Dropbox just put out a really good article about same site cookies and the way they've deployed same Cyclopes on their insights for CSRF protection I think it's absolutely worth your time to skim through tubes it has the potential to your evening mitigate an entire class about csr attic ducts old day will kill all of them but it has really good potentials pretty excited about to equal sports the next change that we've made is adding in a prefix to cooking games so one issue with your keys today is that you have no idea what the properties of that cookie actually are it was always sent into the server is the name is about so you might have a security you might have an HTTP only turkey it might be same site it might not be you don't know when it's actually being delivered to the server what the property are and it's actually really difficult to change that because of the way the treaties are used and because they said wise they use changing that behavior would be incredibly difficult so what we're doing instead is smuggling some information in the name of the group and then making guarantees in the browser that cookies with certain names must have certain properties so there are two prefixes that are deploy today what is underscore underscore hose and the others underscore underscore secure secure a straightforward you can only use the secure prefix if your cookie has the secure attribute that is it's only delivery of a GPS so is it a little bit more interesting we're actually making the cookie City Reta model as close to yours and security model as we possibly can we say this is a host cookie that is it has no domain attribute it is secure and it has a path that gives a group of is made and this basically maps a cookie to an origin more or less like it still only come reports but it does a pretty good job for https websites and i think this is actually being used on something like zero point zero eight percent of the set turkey headers the currency is today so it folks like dropbox and took like github are using it as CSRF production because it gives you some good guarantees about the provenance of a particular key and the properties of that so we see this this is kind of new it's deployed in firefox exploiting chrome and folks are starting to use it so i think it's going to be pretty interesting going forward the last James that we've made the cookies is the secure attribute that I mentioned earlier so secure has been around for a really long time but it doesn't act it hasn't actually given you much guarantee of security because secure cookies could be set deleted and modified by non-secure origins so this led some vulnerability to google.com it's love the vulnerabilities and other websites where a non-secure subdomain for instance will be able to set cookies on your demands so you can use session fixation attacks you can remove security type cookies and we want to lock that down low so we've made some changes to what the meaning of secure is that is secure should mean that it's only sent from a secure website from a secure origin and it can't be modified by a non-secure urge this also means that we've changed the eviction policies your cookies so it says non-secure cookies are evicted before security so if you have a non-secure origin you shouldn't be able to force you to tradition be to be removed from your JH we rolled this change out in chrome 5657 firefox just rolled it out in Firefox 52 and it looks like it's going to stick it's a little bit iffy to make changes like this because of the number of websites that use cookies weird ways we've seen some issues with it but hopefully the issue to think that we can without authentication living contributed to the thing that cookies usually do which is authentication it is incredibly important that we stop session because fishing is one of the huge user facing problems that even if we solved all the technical stuff fishing is going to force people to give up their passwords and that's going to be problematic in terms of authentication we saw that with Podesta in the States it's just something that's going to be a perennial problem it would be great if people would use house advantages because concert managers make it possible if you not to reuse passwords across every website if you just fished on google com you don't automatically go up your da blue dots work as well one way that we can do this is by allowing websites to integrate more fully with the bathroom so the credential management API tries to do this where we say the website can get credentials from the passive editor can ask for them directly and if the user is set themselves up in such a way that they want to automatically log into their website they'll never see a password form again I think this would be a much better world than because of today so if the password manager knows your counselor and you configured your browser to automatically sign you in then when you go to the website it'll ask credential you'll give it to the website and then you'll automatically be signed it without actually having to interact with a certain or at all the goal is that over time it should become dangerous for a user to type in a password themselves and we should be able to slowly iterate toward the world where passwords are not something that users see but instead something that is mediated by the user agent building on top of that it would be great if we could get rid of password vault together because passwords are terrible right it'd be really nice if we could start using things like security keys how many of you have a security key okay excellent everyone should be raising our hands because it's incredibly important if you use the Google accounts of you to drop out to talent or github account for anything along those lines these are a facebook they all support second factor authentication and a security key is something that gives you really good security properties in terms of anti-phishing that is if I do evil calm it is impossible for evil calm to respond to a challenge in the same way as good calm the token will basically generates a public/private key pair it will send the public key up to the server and then next time the server asks for something you verify that you have the same key that you had before thank you verify key persistence every time and by setting up by setting that up you can actually really good guarantees that you're actually talking to the use of you expect to be talking to so something you know something you have black ass URL learn like as qrl um I think the idea here is that your hardware device so the sturdiness of the hospital SQL us girls okay cheers p I don't know okay sorry um it's authentication mechanism okay um program driver wrong it's really interesting we should talk yeah yeah no I'm curious I think that the reason I bet you're certain securities is because there are deployments today and we're building an API for the browser and my hope is it will build this on top of the credential matter today guys we just talked about so that developers will have kind of a one-stop shop for all 10 occation they can get passwords they can get second factors if you come up with an amazing view authentication mechanisms in the future there will be a single point where developers can go to kind of get au 0 Medicaid feature policy is something that allows websites to turn things off so the future policy is like a sheet before the various ap is that you have on a website if you know that you're not going to use geolocation why allow yourself to have access to your location so it kind of works in a similar way to the sandbox mechanisms that you see on various medic systems where you say this process is going to do some stuff we're not going to talk to the network so don't even let us talk to that work or they tried to talk to network kill feature policy people just to remove api's from websites and say okay I'm not going to use geolocation so they'll need to give it to me this has really interesting performance aspects because if you know you're not going to use document right then the renderer can actually do a different a fast nap on your website and say oh you're not going to do the opportunity right so I can make this amazing spare so does really interesting performance benefits but it also has really bad security events because you can actually turn off surface area and just renew it entirely from an exact this repertoire the final thing I'll talk about is an original policy we've talked about a lot apologies and it would be really nice if you didn't have to deliver each of them individually on every website right because they're all HTTP headers origin policy tries to unify these into a single manifest file under origin that sets off the security properties and sets up other properties as well for your words so for instance i talked about chords earlier and i suggested that there's these cores pre-flight that basically verified if you actually speak cores and if you understand what's going on it would be nice if you could just assert that you understand what's going on so we could remove all of these transitory and not valuable requests for the lac so origin policy might be a way of doing where we assert in a secure way that I understand cores please stop sending me these pre flights just take me to course request i'll totally verify my story it also would allow you to pin things like common security qualities and instead of delivering a 4k commentary polity with every response you instead deliver it once and manifest and then have that manifest cast in the browser and used every time those are responsible about it so this has some really interesting properties I think we'll probably be able to merge it in some way with the application manifest that browsers you do today because you things like installation or home screen and I'm producing the properties that was going to happen I said last that was entirely wrong sub origin there's a thing called an origin that we talked about earlier and the origin is kind of the core of security policy on the web it would be really nice however if especially for large origin to contain on bulk to your applications so google com is a good example of this you have ducks you have mail you have mass and all of these are separate application code by separate team that shouldn't have access to each other's data and yes they're all on google com and therefore share a lot of resources share a lot of responsibility but also share a lot of authority if you really like to get somehow shard this origin into a variety of sub origins and basically the privileges that we're doing to each to each page and the page and hit a certain no I'm a docs sub origin I'm totally not actually google com please treat me different this has some pretty interesting properties we're still kind of working out what exactly it would mean to be a sub origin we have an implementation of the current draft synchro so the great if you could play around with it and going to give us some feedback as to whether or not we're going in the right direction but this is a really interesting area to explore because it gives you the ability to reduce the privilege of a particular page protecting the other applications on your org from prudential badness so if you look at like google.com we have things like zeitgeist from 2007 this is not written in a secure way it was written by third parties but we haven't looked at it in a long time it did great if we could show that off in some way without are some changes before I isolated origins is a similar to sub versions but the properties of then you're going to be different you want to actually lock your side down so they can't talk to other side those eyes can't talk to it there are these things called chrome applications so in Chrome OS for instance you'll have an application that shows an HTML page we're killing from applications for a variety of reasons mostly because the back to the web but we want to replace them with something that is Webbie but gives you the same isolation properties so you have your own creepy jar you're not making requests into the authenticated things along these lines we're also this is very exploratory so ideas here would be welcome but we're kind of trying to figure out what it would mean for an origin to really isolate itself some rest away so with that one thing before it stopped every time I come to a conference and look out and I look up the stage and everyone looks like me we are all white we all are losing our hair many of them have beards or older than they used to be and it's kind of sad I really like to see more diversity both covers it's like this but also in our work and our lives I think it's unfortunate that the culture that we've built for whatever reasons has made it harder and harder for people that don't look like me to be successful I think that's that and one of the answers but it's something I'm thinking about a lot and I the only thing about as well and with that we're opening the stage for a few questions and I have been frightened for any volunteers exactly that maybe 11 general question to me what you're talking about it at adding features either there's not much we saw hd2 developing a new stuff it isn't a tender wait how are the view what they do poke me is there anything but like HDD 30 or something that your district focusing at with adding all the features to make them and it's worth it on the web so the most negative lately opportunity you make like this way you're good yeah I think a number of folks so first let's say the HTTP two is great and you should use it and what's I suppose is a lot hdds like no browser is employed it over HTTP which is wonderful there are new protocols that are coming out so quick is one of them where the team is experimenting with UDP is because TCP connection they're getting some really good properties especially for things like video so yes they're working on new networking center but I think your question is actually whether we can set a new baseline so a good example of this is the the quirks mode versus standards mode for HTML where you have old HTML pages that are relying on rear behaviors that we decided we didn't want anymore and browser vendors a belated as they look at the doc type of the document and said okay this is an old lock type we're going to use this crazy old rendering mode this is the new doc type so we're going to use the nice new standard mode render mechanism that's really expensive it's really expensive both in terms of maintenance because now we have to maintain two paths but it's also really expensive in terms of helping developers understand what's going on because we're kind of locking ourselves into backward compatible it would be nice if we could figure to not need to be backwards compatible with api's if you don't like because generally speaking if their API is you know likes then the attackers will use them and we need to figure out ways of actually turning them off either by Chilean entirely from the web or by giving developers the ability to turn them all themselves one thing we've been thinking about is the notion of a like security mode where you say you send the head over to send please make me secure one and maybe over time that turns embassies make me security or please make me secure three and we have just like a different set of settings that we apply to a page based on the movies you've opted into I think that's a totally reasonable thing to explore but it's not really clear to me what we can do in that kind of in a simple toggle sort of way that really improve security of the website some things are relatively straightforward life turning out document right that would have really nice and thoughts other things are more difficult like setting up a common security policy is generally requires a lot of server-side changes and requires you to really understand the application so I would love for there to be a new mode for the web that just turns a lot of things off trying to contours of that is is is difficult but I think a worthwhile effort movie every market cheering for shooting right now it's not it's not one in so long honey yeah I understand Alton way like don'twe going forward and marketing pages that did you stop me is devil Secutor buzz you just better yeah so what were there are two things here first really importantly in a lot of those cases we end up using users as a cudgel against the website and hitting a website with their users makes the website change but also kind of makes the user sad because they're also getting hits in this process so she'll one depredation is a good example of this where when large websites you shall once we can't turn it off without making you and there's a really interesting balance that we need to find between making users sad and making websites change and I don't think that we found that yet I think we're still figuring out how far we can do because all of these kinds of changes improve security but at the expense of user happiness and kind of the end goal increases be happy on the web and to be doing good things and we want them to be secure while they're doing it but we can't take security in absolute like it would be great if we just turned off a lot of 80 eyes but doing so would break lots of websites and finding your balance there is difficult and something that we saw one last short question and afterwards you're welcome to continue discussing you'll find my carrel there's a very comfortable job day for the workshop one and also great coming awesome last question um the family we can talk in a bit much okay I'm wondering a couple of the things you talked about I'll see the focus on it rather than rather than having a non-deterministic behaviour rather than having differences with the first contacts so swingers website Google in particular has backed as analytics and those those those certificates people were seeing extra tentative painting has a lot of the a lot of support rate their universe I'm just again do you know what are there any efforts underway to detect bad certificate given the depth of that that taste yeah so specific a threat sparrin see is the the big fat that we're making Todd trying to figure out what's going on where you go system still good transparency it's basically a mechanism of forcing certificates to be pulling and we use the magic block chain and then everything is that it right so you have a block chain of certificates and you said and you can verifiably prove that the certificate was given to you at some point and we're starting to force again we're forcing CA is to use of the transparency and actually submit all the certificates they meant to a set of the surveillance systems that allow us to verify that cert is actually valid so for symantec I think we're already requiring that an SCT in the cert and for other cas I expect that we'll be making like the goal is to get to see CT everywhere you should be able to verify your certs and I think we're making progress to a cycle so city is I hope the anti serials [Applause]", "YoEQ82rWmc4": "how are you good at all why not now for the phonics

a key book and I will try to read it for you and explain you and suggest you the improvements in it number one but do the deputies represent in the oil deputies is a lesser number phone number is a poem of lesson number four this is a very famous poem by believers words so daffodils represent the nature and its impact on the human beings represent means to to to say something on behalf of someone so daffodils actually are saying about the nature the beauty of the nature because what Rose was the poet of nature and he has selected daffodils for the representation of nature the main focus is definite and its impact on human beings but changes the beauty of nature brings on the human beings on the personalities on the move on the temperaments of devil now certain do you see these are only one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and eleven these are only eleven Birds to answer but as you know in the frontal board examination system and we also practice the same better when you are asked a question for three marks you are supposed to write at least 30 to 40 words so you have to explain it more okay the key book winter has just given an idea so all the birds I have spoken to you about the deputies you can talk about [Music] explanation and more feelings what do the fertility rate in the way they repent that each and its impact on the human being then actually the poet has shown with filling in the whole point so the whole topic is about the evidence questionable to ha how has a poet highlighted highlight and the impact of the point by using the figurative length the poet has highlighted the impact of poem by using figurative language he prints the images of lakes fields trees and stars in an artistic manner the poet compares the deference to the Milky Way galaxy and the tree through dark now figurative speech about the figures about likely excretes tree stars and he also compares them with Milky Way galaxies and when even they are moving here he say that they are touching so these are the examples I think this is enough answer number three you what was quiet concept of our mission this is also another lesson KY the Azam affirmed three years before the birth of Pakistan concept about nation now in inverted commas are the wording of the guide you see this is inverted comma and we start start with a w capital we are a nation with our own distinguished distinctive culture and civilization language and literature art and architecture name then nomenclature sense of values and for pushing legal values and moral codes custom and calendar history and tradition aptitude and ambitions in short we have our own distinguished distinctive outlook on life now student you have to learn the burden of kind like you do at ease that you do I add of Quran when you are coding but when you are quoting some speaker or some for it you have to be careful even about the punctuation even about minor things and major things also never miss anything so keep learning keep practicing so about the meanings distinctive made different we have our own different culture civilization is the way of language and literature we speak different language and our literature is a summary picture art and art we have our own construction style and we have own ours name than normal pleasure Islamic name then non-islamic are different sets of values and proportion we have respect level different kinds we have legal laws and moral codes different from this especially customs and collectors can the Islamic lenders know all too well and customs also like we do not do the holy like they play with colors and we even if we are living in India we should not follow the holy because this is not Islamic maybe it is even not not do but we have different customs and history and tradition history means the past we have different paths and traditions that is also like the customs FDU is a trend what we like and what we know like and ambitions are the wishes the Eve's ensure we have our own distinguish distinctly out rope in our own life we have a different outlook means overall view overall view about life fourth one is how can we become a strong nation now this is a game from guys lesson we can come a strong nation if we start to think beyond personal local lingual ethnic sectarian or provincial identities and prejudices I think you need to include more material but I will explain you about the minis if we become we can become a strong nation if we start to think beyond personal your means more than more than personal beyond any we should forget the personal interest we should think in collective interest the common interest beyond personal needs been when something is the personal interest you will you forget the common or wider interest of people local local needs then you are talking about nation we are talking about every area local is you you like you are from the Hall will reveal our or Quetta you are thinking about that praiseful but you have to think about the whole country go provinces whole cities whole town everywhere lingual lingual means regarding language we have our local languages Punjabi first Oh Cindy Bellucci Kashmiri and we have different but who is the national language so we have to promote it ethnic we are we belong to which caste of its background sectarian that is the religious part she asked me will be the over or LED is a lesson oh there are many sects so we have to also think as Muslim not LSAT or provincial ID we should not be limited to the provinces and prejudices prejudice means when you when you are a self-centered when you have bad feelings or bad intentions about other other cultures or other cities or provinces or other sects it the language is or and so on you can explain in this to make it in the 3040 word limit next number four five what does love of our country demand from us [Music] this is also a very wide subject you can write things and things then they have given only few words so let's write the love of our country demand from us to become United and put our right our country so this can be the starting sentence you can write go things the love of our country demand from us to become United so the unity is very important so the kind items idea unity theta listen so we can quote this also and we we need to improve our education system but does our ultimate promise so we have to serve it we have to give this country better education system we we need to give this our country that better health facilities better infrastructure better facilities in the cities and in the villages we need to make more provinces to decentralized the power and we need to do the justice system more better and this is all about love the country even the leaders and the individuals the general public they they should have at least the idea how to love the country and how to make progress so so try to make it more powerful number six how does the interior of the mosque bleue youth also I think from robots I think the interior of the mosque at the lower level is lined with more than 20,000 handmade ceramic tiles in more than 50 different tulip designs interior the inner side also most at the lower level so this is about the position the interior the inner side and the lower level means the ground floor or maybe the basement is lined with more than 20,000 at me so this is the quantity handmade means ceramic tiles you know the time yesterday Mecca is the quality there are lossy or the ceramic and maybe stones and different materials these are the qualities so hand handmade are more delicate honey they are more near to the to the nature or maybe at that time the machine people not so much available in more than 50 different we live design so this is important to do to make 50 designs in 20,000 tiles so they are different design the upper level of the integer is a don't print rupee and to adorn me beautified is beautified with blue paint this is more than 200 stained glass plus strains strains other spots okay so the quantity is 200 intricate design beautiful designs allowed nature natural light to brighten up its interior so this is also a part of the art and architecture to use special colors which are helpful in increasing or maintaining or maximizing the like impact rather than to tend to della fight or make it dull so if you if you put the black color the class then I cannot come but if you use yellow or light cream maybe it is more important anyhow the artist note the and if you want to see what he's saying you need to go to that Masjid issue I encourage you to have at least a wish to proceed it brighten up the interior and said earlier further illuminated it with their glow chandeliers Noguchi palace they are the bulbs or the lamps they are collectively and collectively they are mixed with the glass and decides to make more shiny and more spread of light illuminate is to like other people their glue glue is also a shine the most important element is the interior of the mosque is the mera mera all Muslims know what is the matter of the Muslim place which is made of finely carved and cultured marble may rhombus I think the place where the emotions so it is fine Liga means with any weekly carving carving is a when you when you create a design of the out of two like the solid stone and you lose different heart tools of identity and make shapes out of it so when you using it it that is called the carving and sculpture barber sculpture are like idols do they make booties and the gods and even at times even in China and Japan till now they they used sculptures and they prayed like the Buddha and different gods dim they pray that is a sculpture but even in muscle boy we don't make the shapes of animated things we just create the curves and designs that is not animated who I hope you understand - to the right of the Maharaja the richly decorated perfect so this other description numbered 7y was a separate Troy room attack to the mosque that is also from the same lesson why was the separate royal room attack to the mosque a septal droid room situated at the southeast corner it is made for especially it is made for especially for Sudan where he spent his both of time alone so that was the purpose number 8 what does the horse yes why does the horse infinitely away the next move of his master from the poem shop equatable so easy the whole thing there is no house nearby he will be unable to get any food or maybe he was surprised that if they stay on it part because he was surprised the why he's standing there in the middle of no there they were only Richard they were only snow cone they were only children at one side and other side of river so the horse all the surprised and he wanted to move on but he he he was following him fast so X I'll be paraphrase the following lines or before you extend that whose woods are peas I think I do his house it is in the village pollito he will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up finnstrom so student this is very important and very famous stand up from the point stopping by the birds own on a snowy evening you can written by Robert Frost Robert Frost was also a point of nature and he loved the nature and always appreciated the beauty of the nature like food word so both poems are related to the nature but this point also tells us in the end about the practical approach of life because when he says that I have promises to keep that scenery is so beautiful that he wanted to create more and more but he had promises to me and Maya to go before I sleep so these were gel that he even practical man I'm just giving you a real idea so you can add you with your food expression and capital all the time so I always encourage my students to motivate my students to write the name of the poem and the poet at the beginning of the paraphrase so it gives a good impression on the projector that the student move although they are not asking for three marks what is the name of the poem enter it but you can add if you want so I will start the paraffin thing like like this that this way the distance that has been taken from the poem with in inverted commas dropping by default on a snowy evening by Robert Frost Robert Frost also in inverted commas and also common noun the appointment with their common their proper now so you will write with the capital letters next the poet has stopped near the snowy boots he first wanders who owns these words in the same same breath he can that he thinks he he does know who the owner of the world lived in the house in the village he would not come to watch his boat so he would not get into trouble for trespassing on his name so trespassing is also unlawful so he's appeared that he is doing a he doing and illegal things next is the vocabulary exercise to the correct option three branches were covered with blanket of snow in this sentence we find an example of personification number two keep a pure morale for L is the self-esteem you the floors are covered with carpets that language is an antonym of antonyms and synonyms antonyms are the opposites covered exposed be the little birds are piping yet the underlined word is a synonym of piping twittering okay that is not piping I think that is beeping click grammar to the correct option the police dispersed the crowd the headline word is their collective down crowd the dog sat beside his master number three wait till I return oh I heard a noise coming from behind the room five fine he spoke very loud that underlined word is a network of degree degrees how loud low or very your little bit that is the degree number six we bought him goo that libraries and infinity number seven he fought he is fond of cooking and Blackbird is a challenge number eight if you had studied hard you would have signed the shoe is pressing on my toe that deadline phrase is a preposition phrase but in which of the following we then appropriate syntax but we usually by the end of the day we are usually tired by the end of the day this is the most there are machines in it I can read but this is the most proper writing skills right paragraph on any of the social issues to ensure a clear topic sentence supporting details this is about the paragraph writing Japanese in comparison clarification or explanation of develop that mean IDI appropriate [Music] general is but shouldn't I have given a very comprehensive lecture or so we have this terrorism that calculated use of violence or threat of avoidance civilians in order to attain goals that are political or religious religious or ideological in nature this is tan through intimidation or coercion or still in fear it is very important to understand that both of the activities and protests are not against social injustice it should not be related to terrorism Muslims all over the world are ill treated when they react against it they are named as terrorists there is a need to draw the line between terrorism and protest yes injustice we need to root out the causes that individuals at the group to use violence this is the only way to overcome the issue of travel number two right and I expose it early composition showing comparison and contrast between things even situation places except the idea of overpopulation you there is no doubt overpopulation there is no doubt that world is full of problems urban population is one of the biggest problems of the world today the developed countries have overcome the issue too much extent but it is tell the core issue of developing our end or hundreds of other countries with the passage of time the number of people is increasing but on the other hand resources are decreasing is an awfully to check the population growth at general awareness is really to be created among the masses if the phenomenon remains the same the day will come when there will be no resource left on the earth the issue needs to be addressed and practical steps are to be taken up in this respect otherwise survival would be impossible write an essay on general these are the guidelines here is the unemployment than three I I will not do the reading to save the time because we are already cd8 but you would write it in your notebooks you can still the screen and you will okay mm for now or today this is enough inshallah see you next time till now allow faith and salami best of luck", "yQFLTeIxvuM": "hey guys this is Kristen with HP wax Center this is a video that so many Belle have been asking for Sarah pill versus star collapse now if you have seen my channel you know that a lot of my video suggestions come from you guys so subscribe to my channel got a little red button on the bottom like my videos and if you have any suggestions or things that you want me to make a video on comment below you'll see that I respond to almost every comment that I get so let me know and I would be happy to make a video for you now let's get started CIRA pill versus start pill they are both high quality hard waxes I just stay away from anything that's cheap not a good idea this is my business this is my baby I want to ensure that my clients are happy and I'm happy just if I don't like my wax everything's gonna go wrong now these two waxes they are extremely similar they're pill is it's like a darker blue almost like a navy star pill is like a blue teal it's a little bit lighter so you'll see that when I actually apply it to my client cuz I'm going to do a demo for you guys I'm gonna hit pause readjust my camera that way I can work with both hands and you will see it pick up here in one second alright guys we are back so I've already prepped my clients skin so you're not going to see me do that I apologize I'm gonna put sere pill on this leg and start pill on this leg I'll remind you in case you forget but just so that you have a reference wax ready over here they are both applied in the same way which is nice and so you have to change anything you just want to apply down and back around so you'll see that this one is a bit darker compared to when I get V star pill wax and luckily you can see his hair perfectly in this video I tried doing this on my arm and yeah it didn't work out so well you just can't see anything so I finally brought in the model here we go okay so see this is a little bit lighter again seer pill and star pill no you these are both fast drying waxes so you want to remove them pretty quickly after you apply there you go okay so if you just look in the camera you can see I mean I will do a cleanup strip but it's not super necessary if you can see the wax or the hair in the wax this is the seer pill and then start pill like I said they're both high-quality waxes so they're gonna do their job as long as you apply them correctly and remove them correctly exactly why you want to ensure you get a high quality wax compared to just whatever is cheap exactly I know it's terrible on their website they only say that you need to apply it once and that's it there's no need for tweezers or anything like that honestly I think every time you need to do a cleanup strip even if you can't see some of the hairs here's gonna be you know out of whack sometimes you it's always best just to be safe go over it one more time that way in case you can't see it you're just double-checking yourself but again seer pill start pill I'm gonna want to go ahead and remove them because they dry quickly there we go obviously I'll clean up a little bit of wax so I got over here I'm not gonna leave him with that but yeah if you're looking for a high quality hard wax there we go um both of these are fantastic start pill is a little bit more cost effective compared to Sarah pill that if that's the factor for you then give it a try but like I said I really do like both if I have to rank them I've been using star pill for so long it's I'm I just I love star pill so I know I'm I'm gonna lead towards that a little bit more as number one Sarah pills number two and then if you are looking for a third one I used to use Bearden before star pill I might say barren and would be number three there it is just not as good with picking up the fine hairs but start pill and Sarah pill are extremely extremely similar if cost is and you know a more of a concern for you then go for star pill if not then try Sarah fill they're both great but any questions let me know I'm always happy to answer them for you what number here is five one two five oh one two seven six seven thank you guys", "oG2v_gSL1y8": "guru plague on oosoo Marceline and guilt upon Desiree I can Roberto deli how do we try again Corona again I wished on the Kaveri Part

in blue if you want to be the best use the best and that is bared in blue one of the things I want to go through really quickly is how the blue should look inside the pot and I realize I can't just tilt it over that much but it needs to be solid inside the pot literally a solid Center so that when I go to get my product I'm going to pull it from the outside edges and I can get a ball of wax right on the spatula that's when it's the correct temperature for spreading as well as for the skin so let's zoom on down and I'm going to get to work yeah make sure you you know you're gonna turn her face as much as you can yeah the one that I didn't you actually look worked out really that's pretty good yeah yes inch by inch hair by hair okay sorry okay we good yeah all right let's get started no she has some makeup on I don't really care I'm not going to remove it that sounds kind of strange but the face has its own oil so I'm not going to strip it and then reapply oil and the burden waxes work over oil so we do long strips long strips when you do it this way what you end up with is fewer strips to actually apply and it takes as long as you take care of the skin which I'm going to show you how to do it's much faster than a bunch of little strips so we're going to put on as many as we can you don't I show you how I do the upper lip which is directly over the lip line you'll find that their lip doesn't come off but all of the hair that's right in that edge right along the edge it's really cool soft wax we can't just go aggressively over the lip like that move up to the eyebrows with these cool spatulas precision spatulas this is for the eyebrow when you're working on eyebrows put your finger over so you don't actually remove the eyebrow no when you're new and doing waxing of eyebrows they're scary because we're always afraid we're going to just pull that entire eyebrow off well as long as you cover it and protect it with your finger you'll be good to go and you've put it in place and then pull it from there okay pull the skin get the edge pull pull I pull the wax off quite slowly on the face notice how I'm moving my hand all along the way here let me get my hand on the way so I pull pull pull and I've had a few people my sister being one of them that asked could I pull it any slower to torture her however the skin comes off the wax excuse me the wax comes off and we want to leave the skin behind and we want to be careful when you're on the face not to over exfoliate with the wax so when you're looking at certain body parts like right here it's very easy to have too much skin removal and while it might not feel as fantastic when I'm pulling it slowly off it's actually better at protecting the skin and you had your face waxed completely did you break out at all the first time I did okay getting top of the eyebrow I wasn't like to make sure when I'm filming to get one spot of wax on my glove it makes everything perfect okay pull-pull-pull say I'm making the skin tight all the way up that strip removal pull-pull-pull here all right a couple more little strips and we are good straight up from the corner of the eye I don't do any measuring on brows here the cool thing about hard wax is that where there isn't hair it doesn't stick so when you're getting that wax edge it's very easy to just simply remove because there's no hair there no pick pick picking at it so don't your clients just hate you just there now I'm going to do one more little strip here it's almost like you kind of meet in the middle and of course her skin turns red so you really can see where you've been and where you have not yet been right here if they need a little more right there go ahead but I'm telling you this area you have to be careful with it is the part where I have seen skin come off or it hyper pigment part so when I peel it off slowly that is why this is good all right skin tight not pushing on their windpipe makes breathing challenging there and one little final strip here always gonna leave a little bit of wax on their nose because that's the perfect place to leave it and now I'm going to finish with the post went to central oil you don't need to drop this on the face you actually put it in your hand first why why is there wax right there cuz I'm filming there we go and then some blemish control the only time I don't use blemish control is sure to have them break out so I'm just going to always use it whether they say they break out or not and then post wax soothing cream this helps take the red out of the skin the one final thing and I'm not going to put it on for you I want you to make sure you always do for your clients when you are doing waxing and they are it's an exposed body part like the face you have to put sunblock on before they go outside you cannot let them go outside with a freshly waxed body part that will be exposed to the world and the UV rays because it will burn tan pigment in a completely different manner there you go face waxing with the beard and blue", "z6hTXSjHWI8": "once silky smooth skin that lasts longer than shaving with a luscious all-natural aroma of sugar wax it's easy in

every microwave is different so adjust your heating time to suit your own microwave oven make sure you watch the jar as it heats and stop the microwave immediately if the wax overflows smokes or sparks never leave the wax unattended after heating touch the jar gently to check that it's not too hot before you pick it up carefully remove the jar from the microwave keeping it upright to prevent the wax from spilling step 4 mix after heating to the desired temperature use the wooden spatula to mix the wax until smooth and uniform like the consistency of yummy toffee then take a small amount

device as you proceed to begin preferably apply the wax in a tiled area so that you can easily remove any residue that may fall onto the floor the sugar wax is water rinsable so any small spillages

the area to be treated immerse the spatula in the jar and take out a large knob of wax on the tip of the spatula turn the spatula over to prevent the wax from dripping with the edge of the spatula make a thin uniform layer in the direction of hair growth to form a strip of even wax make sure that the layer of wax does not exceed the length of one strip step 6 remove all working quickly place the strip on the wax firmly smoothing it down in the direction of the hair growth always ensure the last 1 centimeter or so of the strip is wax free in order to facilitate removal pull the skin tight with one hand and using the other hand remove the strip rapidly in the opposite direction of hair growth as close as possible to the skin if any wax is left on the skin after removing the strip reapply the strip to remove any residue any wax residue can be rinsed off with warm water if red patches occur apply a cold water compress for a few minutes to soothe the skin these are normal and should disappear after a few hours the strips and spatula can be easily washed in warm water and while some of the red dye from the wax may remain on fingers after washing the strip's this will wear off over time so simple so easy so irresistible near irresistible toffee apples sugar wax", "yDBWDrY22Tc": "the knock-on young people these days Millennials as they're called is that they're lazy self-absorbed and needy the unwillingness to work hard to get there they really want to work hard and they really want to succeed let's see it it seems like we've been misunderstood my name is Thomas and after graduating from University I spent four months thinking about what I wanted to do with my life applying for jobs that didn't excite me for reasons I didn't understand I felt like I was carving my own destiny into a mundane and frustrating life it wasn't that it was lazy entitled and I'm pathetic it's the times have changed and Society had given me a path that I felt was outdated so my quest for answers I decided to try something different in the summer of 2015 I met three strangers Matt amar and Erin who felt the same way I did together we wanted to spend the most thrilling month of our lives so we decided to try 30 things we have never done before in 30 days with about $500 to spare for the month and living in our friend Dre's one-bedroom apartment we spent 16 hours planning filming editing and uploading a video every single day to share our story on the list there are things our friends and family strongly advised us not to do but we did it anyway because why not this is my friend comminution birthday today he's raising money for charity oh it literally tastes like a rug inside you a seven-man a group of friends is spending this month pushing out of their comfort zone they're hoping it'll inspire Montrealers to take some risks Oh clearly he's busy we're gonna meet him there's no idea we can't see true Hey to the end those things over a Oh I miss you", "YoQODBS5r50": "[Applause] hey everybody happy wax on wednesdays i thought it would be a lot of fun today to show i'm testing out several papers i tested out five different papers uh for use with cyanotypes cyanotypes are a 19th century photographic process and if you'd like to see exactly how to start out doing this fun process that you can l give an encaustic finish to then check out the creative adventurer process our project for last month and you can see how to get started in these fun ways of doing the cyanotype prints now i've tested out five different papers and i'm going to start out with the fluid 100 cold pressed finish paper it's a 140 pound watercolor paper it's a beautiful watercolor paper and i did these small 5x7 pieces and you can see here that they had a lot of detail so i'm writing them on a scale of detail depth of color of the cyan color and also durability so i'm testing them on these three criteria for each paper and this next one is and i used both a variety of watercolor paper and also photographic print making paper so paper that you would print your photographs out on they're all uh cotton to some degree some of them a hundred percent some of them um let 25 and so on um this next one is um you can see that there is a lot of detail and a lot of depth and this one and i was quite surprised on some of these papers because a lot of them are not my favorite for painting and this one was the fibrino hot press watercolor paper and this actually i've had this for quite a while it's not my favorite for painting but for the cyanotypes they worked very very well so this is the studio watercolor it's hot press it's a 140 pound paper and it's 25 cotton it's also archival and acid free so um perfect for cyanotype i did about the same length of exposure on all five papers so each one i did about an hour because when i do my cyanotypes a lot of times i layer them and it takes just a little bit longer and where i'm at in the world in this time of year which is fall so i exposed them for about an hour and each and you can see in this fibrino watercolor paper all of the detail and the depth that was achieved with this paper so i really enjoyed this paper and it the depth here of the cyan on the edges here now i diluted a little bit in the middle which is why it's lighter but you can still see a lot of detail but you can see the depth of color there on the edges is absolutely beautiful this next paper again was not my favorite for photograph printing um i do love the feel of the paper it's very velvety and this is the hannah mule uh fine art matte photo paper and this one i would say was my favorite it had the most depth and depth of color depth of detail and it also held up the best and when i say that i meant mean for the washing it this paper needs to be washed for at least 10 minutes to get the chemical back out of the paper so with some of these papers held up better uh in the washing process than others this is the hannah mule fine art inkjet paper it's a like i said it's a very beautiful paper it's a hundred percent cotton and it's a smooth finish and that will um and it's a photograph photo rag so it's 100 caught in photo rag it's 308 gsm so but there's several papers that i used in this experiment that were also a um a textured paper that were photo for photographic prints um that they were meant for an inkjet printer for photographs and they have a slight texture to them just like a watercolor paper this next paper is a perfect example of that and this is the epson fine art velvet paper and it has a slight texture to it like a cold cold press watercolor paper would it's a very it's a fine art printing paper meant for an inkjet printer it's a hundred percent cotton and is acid free or and of course archival because it's meant for fine art photographs so this cyanotype ended up having a good depth of color you can see on the edges where it's not diluted it has a very deep cyan color very beautiful it had a okay detail not as good as a couple of the other ones did you can see here compared side by side with the deepest color which was the hannah mule this one has a slightly you can and that's a fun thing to tell too is that they have a slightly different color each one of them has a slightly different tone to them when compared with the other papers so this one was okay it wasn't the best one and it got a little bit hard to wash fell apart a little bit the paper did you can tell with the detail and this last one surprised me i thought it would end up being one of the best ones this is the arches cold pressed paper and same thing when the washing the the cyan color in the edges you can see is very beautiful and deep so the depth of color is good the detail was okay but a lot of the detail i think was lost and i think that it began to degrade when it was washed i did the same exact process to each of the five papers and with these last two i saw that the paper was beginning to degrade it even the top layer lifted in a couple of the areas so not completely a tear all the way through but you can tell that the paper was actually disintegrating so with again with the same zac exact pressure of the wash and exact same time for the wash so this is the 300 pound arches a 140 pound sorry 300 gm uh watercolor paper 100 cotton and it is the heaviest watercolor paper a beautiful watercolor paper i love this for watercolor but for the cyanotype it just didn't it wasn't the best in printing and i'll continue with these to experiment and compare these papers again other different under different circumstances but you can see compared together um the fluid watercolor that did not reach the depth which is the smaller five by sevens didn't reach the depth of colors as some of the others and the hannah mule and the uh fabrino i feel did the best in all three categories so just a little bit of a helpful couple of tips if you're looking for some paper to use for cyanotypes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so", "HiJhPuwFFSU": "hey guys this is Kristen with HK Wax Center I got my order in for the star soft it's the clear hard wax by star pill and I've been testing it out playing with it and I told you guys I would do a review on it so here you go now before I get started if you haven't seen my channel before I used to use baron I switched over to start a star pill once I found them cuz I just loved them and I mostly used their blue film hard wax now I did test out or I've been kind of slowly morphing into the other ones too like I lastly just did a video and they're pink film hard wax which I love that's a creamier composition and then now they're clear hard wax which this one is especially formulated for sensitive skin so maybe you your skin gets really red after a wax or you have to you know be clear of any kind of perfumes artificial fillers stuff like that issues you know with your type of makeup you wear so it's not this would probably be the waxes for you so I'll kind of explain what it is and I'll do a little demo and then wrap it up so for the for the clear wax now this one's free of any kind of pine resins it also has no coloring agents no perfumes and no preservatives as well so like I said anyone who's got sensitive skin to take a look at this wax here what else it has a very low melting point so that's one of the more probably the biggest difference between this one and the blue and the pink is that it you need to keep it at a lower temperature because it's so elastic the wax is softer so it just needs to be set lower than the other two which is something that I just didn't really anticipate until I played with it and discover that which is fine it also takes longer to set it I've discovered so when applying I did find myself having to take little breaks on this like I've I've gotten to the point I've been doing this long enough where I will always apply multiple strips before I remove them so I'll you know apply two or three come back and then take them all off so at this one I did have to wait for to set it just took longer so keep that in mind if you are a speed waxer this one will slow you down but but it does a really good job at gripping the hair too so let me show you the wax um and you can at least see what it looks like so this one it's like I said it's clear which honestly that threw me off I have never actually seen a clear wax before which it makes it really easy to see the hair when you apply it but it is kind of surprising but I will tell you them okay let me put this back on here and I'll do a little demo for you guys now before you actually attempt to buy wax review it see if you like it you need to make sure that you're actually going through the right steps and applying it the right way that is so important and I'm constantly seeing people on YouTube doing these review videos and they're applying it right so the wax isn't performing the way they want it to but they don't realize that it's actually their fault so I'm gonna go over those of you real quick there are five key points whenever you are looking at buying a new wax and wanting to actually use it so first you need to make sure that you have the right temperature and you're using a high quality wax the second one is prepping the skin so prepping the skin is so important you need to make sure that it's cleansed correctly so there's no makeup sweat any kind of lotion dirt like that you need to make sure that the wax is actually adhering to the hair so that it can be pulled from there so prepping the skin is so important next would be actually applying the wax so I've done videos on this before too but applying is such a key point with actually using hard waxes and making sure you're doing it the right way so you get the results that you want always apply pressure go with the hair growth you know the way the hairs grow and go with the hair growth first make a lip at the end and then pull it back down you want your edges to be really clean so that doesn't break in multiple pieces when you pull it off so as long as you're applying it right and using a good quality wax you'll be fine next is just removing it which whenever you remove the wax I always I'll push with one finger where the lip is in the opposite direction so it kind of pops the lip up and then I'll pull it that always works great and then normally I'll apply pressure afterwards just so it helps the customer to and then last one would be post wax care you want to make sure that your client is sent home with the knowledge to make sure that their wax is going to have the best results possible so I will use mostly I recommend highly Mia's healing and restoring cream that's really good for facial services or even arms legs back stuff like that that's my go-to and then PFP vanish is my favorite form of Brazilian and underarms clients so those two have been awesome always open to suggestions but so far this has been my favorite so let me actually apply this so you can see how it looks and how it works now obviously I don't have my model with me it's just me today and I promise you I have hair on my arms you just can't see it because I've been getting wax for six seven years or so so anyway is just kind of difficult to see in a camera so I apologize but as you know start feels great and this is their primo wax so it's going to pull the hair out no matter what but let me get a little bit on my stick and I will have you see if I can get close enough here okay so we're going to be applying down again with pressure when you get to the bottom make your lip at the end and then pull that back up here we go so like I was saying this wax is clear now I apologize I am so pale um but that was the biggest drawback I would say is that because it's clear it was just harder for me to see my edges and I'm so particular about making sure my edges are clean so which again I also know that it's clear because it's free of any kind of coloring agents so they're doing it on purpose but I and also I've gotten so used to having a you know a color like the blue or something like that so it just threw me off um but that was really the only thing I could think of um it's just that it's just kind of harder to see or maybe I'm just getting old who knows now whenever you apply it you can see it goes on clear and then it starts to turn opaque when it's drying so you can kind of see it there in the reflection it's not as clear as it first was when I applied it so wait a little longer and then I'll take it off like I said this does set longer if you've seen my other videos I can apply it wait a couple seconds and pull it off you do need to wait for this one um so just keep that in mind if you you know have a system down where you're popping people out all right 15 minutes or so it doesn't take you 20 instead so but this one here should be good to go here we go awesome now if you can see this in the camera well you really can't sorry guys I tried but but it does a great job moving the hair I really liked it my skin's liked it my clients have liked it and it makes it hard to pick between which one it's the best everyone's preference is different like I said this is just formulated for sensitive clients so if you have that to use this one but any questions or anything let me now phone number here is five one two five oh one two seven six seven don't forget to subscribe if you like my videos or like I said me have any other suggestions for other videos I'm always happy to hear it but have a good rest shooting bye guys", "V18UU1oGktY": "hi welcome to the online jewelry Academy I'm Professor John R and I'm your instructor if you like these videos be sure to like them and to subscribe in this video I'm gonna talk to you about how to make wax pots now what our wax pots these are the little pots that you put together with the waxes that you normally use to assemble wax sheet and wire in order to make wax models for lost-wax casting what I've done is I've melted various types of waxes in two separate containers so that I can use them at as I need in an appropriate situation in other words each one of these waxes is unique and special they have different characteristics different melting temperatures and I need to be able to select exactly the right one for the situation that I'm in where I'm trying to assemble either wax wire or wax sheet now the process is really simple what you need to do is just find an empty metal container now if you're using a food container be sure to obliterate any information about there being something edible in this container you might want to spray-paint it or at least go over it with a permanent marker and write what's really in the container next what you want to do is put your wax material into the container and you'll notice that I've cut it up into small pieces I'm melting perfect purple which is a low melting temperature wax that's often used to make repairs to wax models so instead of melting a large stick of wax I'm melting small pellets now why am i doing this well think about this if I go to your wedding my cocktail is gonna need more ice cubes in it in about 10 to 15 minutes but I can stand and appreciate the beauty of the ice sculpture of you and your beloved all night the reason why surface area this has a lot of surface area because it's broken up into little chunks where this is like the large ice sculpture of you and your beloved at your wedding the big volume doesn't have as much surface area as it would if I broke it up into small parts or like the little ice cubes okay so I've got it in here next thing I want to do is I want to transfer it to a double boiler now this is just a container with water that comes to a boil and we do this in order to avoid ignition you don't want to put the wax into direct contact with a heat source because it could ignite and burn your studio or your house down secondly using a double boiler will allow the wax to melt smoothly and to create just a nice big lump of wax in the container the third thing is you don't want to scorch the wax we don't want to overheat any of it and introduce some kind of carbon into the situation which could affect your wax models once you're done you'll have a nice smooth surface of wax that you can dip into with a heated wax tool and apply it to whatever wax model you're working on I hope you like this tip there are many more like it on online jewelry academy calm and remember we post all kinds

when none of us are going anywhere there's nowhere to go to get ready for but I still got ready today because I felt like it I wanted to have a date night at home with my husband later tonight so it just feels nice to get ready sometimes even if you aren't going anywhere just to feel saying you know what I mean but a lot of you guys I'm sure right now aren't looking up how to do different makeup looks because we're not going anywhere right now so I wanted to do something along the how-to and life style kind of line personal care stuff and you know a life style kind of videos for you guys let me know if you guys like that idea more if I would do a little bit more how to do certain personal care and stuff or lifestyle kind of videos you know I have my famous smoothie recipe that I think it's amazing snow maybe I can share you got share with you guys how to make that you know bring you more lifestyle kind of videos in this moment for a while anyway let me know in the comments down below if you guys like that idea so today I thought I would do something very useful for you guys I don't know about you but I go to a brazilian waxing place for my brazilian waxing and then for my arms and all that but I do laser on my legs but I had to stop that you know when I got pregnant and I'm still breastfeeding so I'm I've stopped that so I just shave in the meantime when I until I can get back to doing my laser when I'm done breastfeeding but I do ask my arms for now I think one day I'm gonna also do laser on my arms as well but I do definitely go to a brazilian waxing place for brazilian waxing you know it's a very I don't know if you guys have heard of it if you guys are familiar with brazilian waxing so brazilian waxing is actually much less painful like or pain-free almost to me anyway i mean depends on your pain tolerance like the traditional sugar waxing with strips can be very painful if the VAX is not hot enough or not in the right consistency I have trust me I'm been Maxine since I was 18 years old and I've really used everything under the Sun I mean I have a little gross I can show you guys it's gotten way too gross right now so I bought like all these contraptions to do sugar waxing this is one of them it's really gross right now and I also bought like you know sugar X's like this from the store this contraption this goes in in here it's a sugar X that annoys a roll-on that has a rule on that I use that for a while and I have another one for the same another warm-up for the same thing like I've invested in this stuff you guys I mean I I've made sugar axe at home on the stove which you can do by the way but you know you know it's a lot of trouble it's a lot of hassle and in a lot of the times if you don't get the consistency right or you know if it's too hot if it's cooled down too much you know if you mess up even the slightest it can be very painful and it can be very messy but later in my life like later you know when I was a little older I discovered brazilian waxing and I have never looked back since so Brazilian wax if you guys aren't familiar it's hard wax so there's a difference between sugar wax and hard wax so Brazilian wax amines are hard wax they come in these little wax beads they usually dark blue they maybe come in other colors too but usually dark blue and then you melt the wax and then you know it turns into a thick you know consistency they go like paste and then you you know spread it on meet on the area you're waxing and then it turns hard and then you don't need waxing strips you just pull that strip and then the hair comes with it the nice thing about Brazilian wax is if you guys didn't know it actually adheres only to your hair it doesn't actually grab onto your skin so it just pulls the hair very swiftly instead of pulling on your skin tag on tugging on your skin too much which is a great thing because when you pull your skin all the time you your skin ages and you get lines and wrinkles and stuff like the skin tends to age a little too fast when you always wax and for me I don't know I'm my complexion is dark so there's a certain cutoff that they don't do laser in certain areas for people with darker skin today I'm gonna be using this brand right here I know I got it off Amazon so the maxing beads look something like this can you guys see so that's what the beads look like I like to use these these little rings that I bought from Sally's to put on the wax warmer the little tub like that so this is actually an empty tub that I got from Sally's and then you put the wax beads in it and the rim around it and then you plug it in and the back starts to melt so this is it's hardened again this is from last on my wrecks you don't need this but it's really nice that you can see how it spilled all over so it keeps it from dripping on the container and all over the place let's get into the demo I used to do this a lot when I was younger at home waxing so I'm gonna today show you how to do a Brazilian wax at home without going to a salon so I always usually go to the to my waxing salon to get my Brazilian waxes done but I am a hoarder and I like to have things on hand just in case I need it and yes here's the opportunity and you know I'm glad I did that I collected all these items over time and now I'm needing them because I can't go to the salon to get my Brazilian wax I have all this stuff that I bought over time just in case at hand to do my own Brazilian wacks at home Brazilian Rex is very pain free it's as plain free as wax can get so I but I thought I would show you today a hard wax person and hard web so this is what I bought I believe I got this on Amazon access and I'll just bet I don't really know this brand it's a seller pill blue cracks so you want to be sure to get the blue wax the hard blue wax like this it's not easy to find I remember when I went to buy this on Amazon there was only like one seller carrying this item so I got this bag and I believe I got this brand right here Gigi this is the sally's beauty brand they have this brand at Sally's Beauty and I got this one also this is again blue X they come in these speeds as you can see I will show here in a in a in a minute when I open this package they come in these little beads and then you heat it up in a wax heater like this one right here again I bought all this stuff at Sally's Beauty so I'm going to get started by turning my waxer on and it pits like it heats up in literally 30 seconds so I'm going to wait for it to heat up a little bit and then I'm going to and I also bought this right here this is a empty wax container like one that you can refill it's like a refill Cardon it says right here refill so you want to get one of these take the lid off put that in there actually before I do that I've also bought these right here these are just something nice to have it keeps the wax from dripping so you put the you put your carton in here let me not tear it Bango and then you put it insert it to the racks heater like this so it just keeps from dripping all around and oh I forgot to mention that you want to make sure that you lay something like this down paper or something down vex can get really messy really quick so you don't want to get it on any of your surfaces so you want to make sure you've got your table or whatever you're doing it on covered this is like some pit Trader Joe's paper bags that I cut up to use for this because you want to use something you can just throw away afterwards okay so the the racks containers heating I can feel the heat and now I'm going to put wrap these in there so as I was saying this is what the beads look like they're like they look like lentils you know blue beans so you want to put I would put just enough to do you know one area of your body and you don't want to heat up too much that's all that one just heat up enough so that it can actually heat up if you put too little then it won't really you know work well keep evenly so just enough to cover the bottom of the heater there and then these are the other things that you want to have these I got again from Sally's Beauty you want these application and nobody call this sticks application sticks and you can stir the wax with it and then you can also apply apply the wax on your body with with these flat sticks so I'm gonna wait now for the wax to heat and melt give it about I don't know I actually just my first time that I'm melting this particular box so it could take up to three minutes and make sure to keep like stirring it as it melts what my wax is seating let me you know go through the items I have on this table like I said you already saw these these are the the rims you put around the wax heater I'm sorry the wax container the container you are melting the wax in just to keep it from dripping and then I got for selecting beats that I original you guys and then this is really disgusting because it spilled everywhere I've access spilled on it but you need some kind of aloe gel to apply on your whatever the area you're waxing after the right things to call it down and to keep it from hurting and then these are just a couple of other options I wanted to show you guys so this is the Brazilian bikini wax I got from Sally's Beauty right here and then this one is a silly and body hard wax and this one is Brazilian bikini wax also I got from Sally's beauty but they are a little bit more like sugar wax like that I don't like this particular type of wax because it actually even though it says Brazilian it's not really like Brazilian to me because it's not like the blue this stuff hurts so that's why I like to use these blue beads they they just fall just the hair they don't adhere to the skin so they just you know grab a hold of the hair and pull the hair instead of pulling your skin and here's some honey wax that I have again is sugar back so all this I bought from Sally's Beauty but I prefer the blue back speeds to the other alternative and and then you have these vaccine strips these are mainly used for the the sugar honey wax or the sugar wax I showed you earlier that's what you use these strips for for Brazilian wax you don't you don't need these strips for that kind of Aksum because their backs dries and then that you know turns into a strip and you pull that you don't need actual strips okay so the wax is heating now as you can see so you want to give it a stir you see that starting to melt so you want to make sure all the beads are melted before you apply how do you know when the wax is ready so you just have to keep stirring it as the the beads start to melt and you want to make sure there are no lumps big chunky lumps or in small lumps anything left that it should be like a smooth liquid pretty no very thick liquid so I still see a couple of small lumps you want to break them all down keep stirring and then when you lift the back stick it should drip down like this very easily it's completely melted now so it's ready to be used so I'm gonna take my stick a little bit of the wax on it and then you want to make sure you call it a little bit in your hand before you put it on the area you're waxing whoops this is exactly why you want to have something to lay under because it'll drip everywhere once the wax start to melt and you see how hard this wax is it's starting to like create a little VAX hair see it's a hard wax blow on it one time and you can start trying in a corner makes you sure it's not too hot and then start applying this is how I like to apply it you want to start you know right in a corner and then kind of go diagonally because that's kind of how your hairs growing so it's not that hot you can like almost put it without even blowing on it it doesn't get too hot that's the beautiful thing about Brazilian wax it doesn't get so hot that it's too hot on your skin but it still melts and forms a thick strip and you want to lay it you want to make sure that this trip is really nice and thick because you want to be able to pull it off so you want to apply a nice thick layer like this okay so I'm gonna leave that there I'm going to pull this strip off first before I go any further once it's dry you don't want to wait too long either so when it's dry you can you can literally touch it and not have it stick to your hand so it's dried and now it's ready to be hold so you want to grab a one corner like this and start to lift it up little by little like that and this is actually fairly pain-free this this particular type of wax it doesn't alledgedly it doesn't that's what the the salon that I go to tell me and that's what I read everywhere that it only grabs the hair not the skin so I'm gonna make sure that I lift up all the edges first there you go I got a hold of the edges and then you back pull it off takes a little getting used to this particular type of wax to really learn how to see it's very easy to pull as you can see I didn't actually I'm not kidding and I didn't feel a thing okay I'm gonna start lifting the edges and then you oh look at how easy that was and it was paying for your didn't feel a thing see how smooth that looks so I'm gonna move on to the other arm now make sure that you're not putting too many layers on it just happened to me with my this strip I did before this I had put too many layers so just make sure you don't go over it more than twice sometimes it will break off like that no need to worry you just keep pulling it until all of it comes off I'm glad this happened so you guys can see how to handle it just keep pulling it off lift from the edge and pull off it doesn't hurt a little bit so came out to the sunlight that I wanted to show you the arm in the sunlight you see it's a little red so I'm going to take that aloe vera gel I showed you earlier and I'm going to apply a little bit of be a little aloe vera gel to cool down the area I relaxed so that's nice and cooling and then after that you can apply some lotion as well I hope you guys found the how to do a Brazilian wax at home useful please let me know know in the comments below if you guys like to see more of these type of videos everything is closed right now including the vaccine so on so I thought this would be really helpful to you guys to do at home you can order all these products on Amazon and do it at home by yourself this way you guys know how to do your own waxing at home please let me know if this was helpful to you and give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel I will see you guys in my next video", "krkJKfb0lOQ": "[Music] welcome back to the channel good friends Brian from apex detail today we're gonna take a look at fireballs sio2 infused fusion wax this was formulated to be a show wax demonstrating high-end super hydrophobic properties and will give your painted surfaces a real bright wet looking shine the two main ingredients amongst many are a Brazilian t1 carnuba and also sio2 included in the package to application blocks two scoops to scoop the wax out into the applicator blocks the can of hard wax is in a nice burlap bag for show of course and also a an instruction manual the wax is formulated to deliver that super hydrophobic high contact angle beating on the surface of your car truck or motorcycle this behavior will take place after two hours of application and cure time the wet look will appear in full force in about 6 hours and you can see it's a hard whack I'll demonstrate here how much or maybe it's better to say how little is used out of the jar to apply on this Corvette here the c7 Corvette and we're going to apply it to everything all the painted surfaces in the door jambs all the painted surfaces under the hood in the trunk area we're going to do the wheels we're gonna do headlights taillights parking lights absolutely everything what's applied it will need a full 24 hours of cure time before exposing to free-flowing water and also you can maintain it with two products that they offer their ultimate coating wax which I will show in future videos and also something called the tour billon number one they have tour billon number one two and three I will explain that later as well so instead of using the applicator blocks I'm going to just use a plain old microfiber applicator scoop it in there get a little bit on the applicator get go to the panel spread out in little circular motions light circular motions and then from there do the crisscross pattern which once it's spread out and that's to ensure a nice even layer of the sio2 onto this hood here or whatever panel you're working on so what size or how far do you want to go and apply this product before you come back and start to wipe it off if you're in a nice cool shaded area which they do recommend you can apply it to the whole car and then come back to wipe it off I like to do it to say a hood the size half of that apply it then wipe it off and move on wiping off I normally have two towels when I deal with any type of sio2 product doesn't matter if it's a professional coating an sio2 spray coating or also an sio2 infused wax the first towel will just gently massage it even further into the panel and then buff to perfection with the second microfiber what do I do with those microfibers afterwards I have a bucket of warm water and about a half ounce of power clean there I'm going to throw them directly in and that really slows down the curing process within the towels so I can quickly throw them in the washer and get those washed and dried and they still get downgraded to interior work engine compartments wheels whatever and here is the first person view so you have an idea of just how easy it is to use you you you you you you you that's basically it as simple as that I'm going to get it applied to the rest of the vehicle here I'm not going to forget about the headlights taillights exhaust tips emblems door jams and the wheels and after use this is all that we used really that jar will last you a long time alright so how did it make the car look well I keep this thing super glossy did diminish or take away from the gloss did it add the gloss in my eyes it didn't diminish it didn't take away it actually added depth and added to that dripping wet look on to the test panel and just like the test panel anything you apply it to you want to give it a wash you want to give it decontamination clay iron remover and at least a one-step correction let's get some gloss meter readings before we apply the product in this little test area okay just slightly above the mid-80s at 87 we'll write that down let's get it applied no need to put it on any thicker than this this is exactly what it should look like as you're spreading it out on the panel it's really it's why don't use those two scoops they get it too clumpy in one area and you're just laying down way too much in one concentrated area this little applicator here you can pick up 50 Cent's 75 cents a piece a dollar apiece wherever your look is perfect for application you okay it's time to let it cure properly it does mention that you will start to get that hydrophobic effect within two hours best guys to let it cure for 24 hours and it's actually over 48 before I get back to it and start to test it and I can immediately feel the increase in slickness and as you can see by the block it's a pretty big difference what about the increase in gloss we started somewhere around 80 7gu and we're now in the mid mid to upper 90s anything around 90 the the common car owner will find super glossy those of us with the i-95 is just impressive and anything in the high 90s nearing 100 is just super glossy and super impressive let's drag this panel outside we'll remove the tape we'll take a look of the rest of the characteristics of this wax well it definitely is hydrophobic let's put it through the 10 wash test the 10 wash test includes a bucket with one ounce of car pro reset and one ounce of a strip wash obviously breezed right through the ten wash test kind of already outperformed what I thought it would I thought maybe it would go seven eight washes but well it's still super hydrophobic let's move on to the traffic film test this is a test that traffic film which comes from anything that can and will leak from the car down onto the roadways and then splash back up on to the surface of your car after a good rain fall a bit overcast today but I do like to let it set out and dwell on the panel for about three I can probably get five minutes today before rinsing off and then I'll hit it with the alkaline cleaner and then we'll go and hit it with the strip wash once again so this ceramic wax gets hit with just about anything you can think of up and down the pH scale I tried the test fell off in between rounds of the traffic film test so the next round isn't diluted one bit with water we'll let this do all again and we'll just repeat and rinse until I see this breakdown and it starts to sheet so after two rounds and that follows the ten wash tests it starts to sheet more than bead still sheets very fast that protection is still there it's just whatever is included in this formula to make it super hydrophobic has broken down but there's still plenty of protection there and that brings us to the final flawed segment of the video the fireball fusion wax blends the highest quality of carnuba with that's IO to what you're left with alright

swak Singh before you perform a nose waxing service here's a list of questions to ask before the service can begin do you have asthma are you prone to nosebleeds are you on blood thinners do you have a cold or a runny nose do you smoke more than two packs of cigarettes a day if your client answers yes to any of these questions the service cannot be performed if your client has a nose piercing we do not recommend performing this service as with the ear do not cleanse the nose prior to the service it is sensitive area and needs the protection of natural body oil before performing the service

area apply satin release to the applicator as well begin by using a small wooden applicator dip the tip into the hard wax with your hand rotate the wooden applicator in a circular motion this will allow a small ball of wax to form at the end of the applicator never blow on the wax as this can cause the spread of germs put the applicator inside of the nostril but do not insert past the crease squeeze the nose on the outside above the crease this will seal the hard wax inside the nose leave the wooden applicator in and wait approximately 60 seconds or until the wax is hard tap the wax if it's not tacky it's ready to remove have the client stand or move forward so you can get a firm grip on the applicator place your hand in the center of the forehead for a steady position hold the nose at the crease and pull straight down in one quick motion repeat the last three steps on the other side then apply satin cool to a q-tip or cotton swab give it to your client to cool and soothe the inside of the nose and close the pores a nose waxing service can last five to six weeks it can be an add-on to all men's and ladies hair services so try making subtle suggestions for nose in ear

the FEMA booth you can see it all behind me there is Frank in the background and I'm really excited to sit through a little bit of a demo using the new thing of our collection first I want to show you the amazing stencil that she has there is this one which is called dandelion how cool is that then this is one of my favorites is called Minds ears then there is this one which is called read my letter read my letter then we have gothic I'm just looking at the names in the back and we painted wallpaper because it does look then we have ornate world we have this one is the laurels and the last one is floral net so very very cool patterns and I can't wait to use them in all my projects we also have she also has some new than wax in there they're really really nice their math and very creamy and I want to show you all of them so I'm gonna kind of bring down my my camera here so you can see them I also want I'm going to be working on a couple of pieces that were made by Frank Garcia with his new molds with charges utterly amazing I'm really excited to use them and I want to show you how these waxes work on them so the nice thing about these waxes that they're mat and you they can be used on any almost anything and they give you a really nice patina effect from there waxes we have the rustic Brown rusty Brown and it's just a beautiful color comes also in the rusty red two together are very similar to the recipes that we have but they're just creamier than the rest pen paste from phenobarb and not as two ingredients them so it's more acts like a wax than then as a paste so then you have the patina green and then you have the patina blues which is very similar to the second set for the colors are similar to that work together with them then we have the old white which is the first time I've seen a white wax and it's utterly amazing you can use it to be pilots which I'm going to show you and then you have the charcoal black now what's cool about it is that you can use them on any type of surface you don't even have to use them on a black surface but you can and you can use it with many different applicators so you can use it with a different tool so I want to show you how I'm going to address this is one of the Frank Garcia pieces my black one I'm just going to basically cover the a piece and the details are just beautiful they're amazing so what I like about this is that it's not as dark as you think it is it actually is more like chocolatey brown and the reason why I add this first is because I want to create kind of a shadow in the background with these so I always thought the dark one first you don't have to do that but I like there is a lot and if you want to you can definitely add I like Jess you do this or black gesso and it works perfectly so there is that and I cannot go in with a little bit combine it together because that will give it that a rusty look and if you don't want to use your brushes you can also use your fingers this paste is so creamy and it's there it is with the brown and the red together I should have put my gloves on and then I'm going to use a little bit of this patina just to give it that really cool patina effect that and I did it in that 36 or what I like about this is that it's really quick and easy to use you can also then go by with some of the boxes from a favorite vintage gold I just want to show you a little bit you can add a little bit of nice highlights again I'm losing my finger but you don't we can go back and forth with the patina we are happy with the result and I want to show you the other there is no solution give you this for example this is another I want to show you how to alter this one but instead of using the patina when I use a bit charcoal a charcoal black this gives a really nice coverage to the background in its vanilla bit like that rusty the non metallic look so it almost looks like metal but it but you could add definitely a silver to this or any other color and that would look really cool because you would have like that charcoal affected there underneath and then silver on top I'm just going to cover it about it giving it like a nun Kiki I'm keeping a beta what you see it's kind of like an antique III the mix and look so I'm going to show you now like look how cool that is see and but then what I really want to show you is the new light Gamzee where because really quick [Music] basically showing I couldn't eat they really quick I did this one with the patina the patina effect yeah so you can really create some really neat and taking effect that almost feels like an antiquing cream you can also use them with a stencil so all the stencils that I showed you can use them and basically run them through a stencil and create these really cool effects so that's really neat as well so there's lots of things that you can do with another piece that I'm thinking that we do the patina and the blue together first there's so many different options that you can do it and just use patina with a little bit of wood without any Browns or anything just having it all the scene I know but and I'm going to use a little bit of the rule yes is really really nice pretty and just what's the main so there's no probably so many different combinations that can be done with this and I'm just really excited that there is new ways of antiquing things and they've been using so many different surfaces but I saw like I said things with stenciling probably so many different things so thank you everyone for joining me today at the Prima business if you like this video
