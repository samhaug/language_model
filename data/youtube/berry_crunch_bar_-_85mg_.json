Today, I'm going to show you \nhow to make copycat Nestle crunch bars. Oh, yeah. Crunch Bar is \nessentially milk, chocolate and crisps. Right. So it's really easy to \nreplicate at home. And what's cool about this is \nyou can make your own variety of flavors of crunch bar. If your favorite kind of \nchocolate is the Hershey's Simponi milk chocolate, then you\ncan use that to make a crunch bar. If your favorite chocolate is \nsemisweet chocolate chips, then use that. Maybe the private selection \nblueberry almond chocolate bar is your favorite \nkind of chocolate. Then you can use that so many \nvarieties of chocolate that you can use so you don't have to \njust stick to the standard milk chocolate crunch bar if \nyou don't want. Also, some of you might \nbe thinking, why don't just go to the store\nand buy one ? Well, that could be said \nabout anything, right? When you go to the store and \nbuy cookies, when you go to store and buy bread, when you \ngo to the store and buy a cake as opposed to making \nthem at home. Well, at the speech, \nthe purpose of having fun at home, in the kitchen, \nmaybe you do it with your friends, with your kids, \nwith other family members. You get the idea right. Also, if you buy in bulk, \nbulk chocolate in bulk, crisp rice Bullis a box of \ncereal because ricer is so cheap, you can make\na ton of crunch bars. That's a lot cheaper than this \none bar that cost a dollar. All right. Super easy to make \nonly two ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it. Before I move on, make sure to \nsubscribe to my channel and hit that notification bill so you \ndon't miss out on any of my new videos. Let's get started down below in \na description box, you'll find a list of the ingredients \nand the amounts. But it's pretty easy \nto memorize this. And now I'm going to\nstart by melting my chocolate. I might demonstrate it with my \nmilk chocolate symphony bar. I also have the almond, \nblueberry, dark chocolate and I also have \nsemisweet chocolate chips. And now let's \nmelt the chocolate. I'm going to just\ndo it in a microwave. I normally will do the \ndefrost setting, which is about 45 seconds on my microwave, \nand then stir and then defrost saying again and stir. Also you can do like twenty \nfive seconds on high and then stir twenty five seconds stir \nuntil it's melted. Or you could do the double \nboiler method when you take a small pot and you put down a \ncup of water in there and you take your bowl, normally it'll \nbe a little bit bigger. So it sits like this and then \nthe steam from the hot water will heat up the bottom\nof the bowl and gently melt the chocolate. That's the double \nboiler method. You can do that on\nthe stovetop if you like. I normally just do it \nin the microwave. Oh, right there. Chop. It is melted. Also, I just want to mention, \nif you are going to use a glass bowl, this is \na Pyrex bowl. It is microwave safe,\nbut not all glass bowls are microwave safe. So just double check where you \ncould use like a ceramic bowl. Just make sure that it is \nmicrowave safe if you want to use the microwave. And once the chocolate \nis melted, we will add in the Rice Krispies or crisp rice. I usually do a\none to one ratio. So one half cup of chocolate or \nlike a four ounce chocolate bar or four ounces of chocolate \nchips and then one half cup of the crisp rice or \nRice Krispies. And I don't want \nto stir vigorously. You just want to come in here \nand just fold it all together, because if you \nstir vigorously, then you'll break up those Rice Krispies \nand you don't want to do that. Pretty simple telling you this \nis an awesome way to make your own homemade crunch bars. And now what we do. I have a pan here. This is a granola bar pan. I use this for candy \nbars as well. You can find a\ngranola bar, pan, dot com, also online Amazon. You can find similar \ntype ones. And this one is neat because it \nhas these old lines and to gauge how much you're \nputting in there. So what we're going to do is \nwe're just going to fill up the cavities with the chocolate. I should be able to\nget about four of these from this one batch. And so I'm just going\nto put in a scoop here. I'm listening to one scoop. Prabha first. And come back and \ndo another scoop. Depending on how thick you want \nthe bars, I don't like them super thick. I like them kind of thin and \njust kind of spread it out. You could even go thinner and \nmake probably five of these if you want it. All right, there we go. And then I usually come \nin with, like, my silicone spatula and just kind of way to \nuse the back of the spoon, just kind of push it down. OK, just like that,\nand then give it a. And there we go. And that is ready to go in \nthe fridge, I'm going to fill up the rest of these with \nthe other chocolates. All right. So I have all three \nof them done. This is the dark chocolate, \nalmond, blueberry, private selection, \nbrand chocolate. This was the milk \nchocolate symfony bar. These were the \nsemisweet chocolate chips. And I purposely did a little \nbit more crisp rice in this one. You can tell it's \nmore chunky looking. And I did that on purpose to \nshow what you can do. You could also use the less \ncrisp rice if you want, and make them make \nthem more smooth. Another thing you could do if \nyou want the top to be completely smooth is come back \nagain with some melted chocolate that doesn't have any \ncrisp rice on it and just put a thin layer on top and just \nsmooth that out if you want. I don't bother with that, \nbut that would just be a design choice. It won't affect the \ntaste at all. And now let's put these in the \nfridge for about 30 minutes so they can set up properly. One thing I want to note is I \ndidn't temper the chocolate. And what happens if you don't \ntemper the chocolate is if you leave the candy or the \nchocolate bar out at room temperature, it'll get \nreally soft and sometimes melt on you depending on\nhow warm your house is. But that's okay. I just normally store those \ncandies in the refrigerator anyway, so it's \nnot a big deal. One of these days I will\ndo a video on how to temper chocolate, but I don't \nnormally do that. I just storm in the fridge and \nI like eating them cold also. But another thing you can use \nis you could use the chocolate candy melts and those don't \nneed to be tempered at all. And you can put those out at \nroom temperature and they'll take a longer time for \nthem to melt. All right. So let's put these\nin the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Oh, right. And then when they come out of \nthe fridge, after they've set, you can just come in here and \njust squeeze the sides of the pan here and just pop out the bar. Look at that. Pretty cool. And on the bottom, \nnice and smooth. There you go. We have a nice \nlittle crunch bar. This is one of the milk \nchocolate ones and if I bite into it. Look at that, the classic \ncrunch bar scenario, pretty awesome, and then for \nthose of you who don't remember what they look like or if you \nhaven't seen one of these, going to just open it up and \nshow you a live look like. That's their classic French \nsymbol on their. And then on the bottom,\nyou can see the crushed rice. But it's very similar, \nthis chocolate milk chocolate one, \nthe classic taste, almost identical to the one \nthat I made pretty awesome. These are a lot thinner also \nthan the ones that I made. And then once again, \nI recommend just storing them in the refrigerator. Even this one with tempered \nchocolates getting a little soft. My house here in Arizona, \nit's a little warm. It's about 81 degrees \nright now. And so these are getting \na little soft. So I just always\njust storm in the fridge. And when you take them out of \nthe fridge, if they're a little too hard, just let them sit out \nfor about three to five minutes before biting into them. All right. The homemade crunch bars are \ndone and turned out fantastic. They're really easy to make. Only two ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it. I'm Matt Taylor.

Hmm, huh?", "fbQz18Ftz6E": "what's going on everyone TJ fitness demos reviews and together with me today the new bodybuilding Signature Series protein Crunch Bars I'm gonna take you through the macros of this thing we're gonna try and find out if there's something really fresh here then we're gonna try both flavors that were launched together then right towards the end of the video we're going to talk about pricing and the final verdict should you care let's get right into it yeah guys so does the world really need another protein bar even if it's a crunch bar probably not because we have like so many of these by now you know I mean there's like 20 20 different brands doing protein bars right now and really beyond the a memory bar and maybe the Mark LeBlanc is out right bar and a couple of others there's not really a lot of innovation since you know the last let's say couple of years quest bar and then one bar and then you know everyone else anyway bodybuilding that comes Signature Series actually like some of the products that they know I really like the protein that they launched the isolate first one they'll try the new I saw wine I do need to try it but anyway generally speaking good product good value for money and you know why not they have a lot of exposure to their site why not launch their own brand so far the products have been good anyway so this new crunch bar obviously sits on the crunch bar category which is like the muscle Pharm one and the products one in a couple of others muscle thick and your leg support let's look at the nutrition facts so you have single size 57 grams which is just average for protein bars usually get between 50 and 60 230 calories so that's very similar to the muscle form crunch bar and then you have 9 grams of fat and then you have how many carbs 20 grams of carbs 5 grams of fiber total sugars 5 grams and 5 grams attitude so it's 5 grams other other sugars so you know 5 grams of fiber is okay I actually don't like the 15 grams 17 gram fiber bars that then you know you get bloated if you eat two of them and stuff like that then you have as far as protein you have 20 grams of the protein is coming from protein by the white part in isolate whey protein concentrate and that's it that's okay as far as ingredients so you have 20 grams you know tradition very similar to the MusclePharm Crunch Bars not very different from any other thing out there so really it's about the flavor and let's see if there's something different here so I have two flavors here one of them is the baked which one is it chocolate peanut butter and the other one is the chocolate cookies and cream cookies and cream let's try the cookies increase first this is the way that they look like so this looks like a normal protein Crunch Bars right so let's break one in yeah so this is how it looks like again like it looks like a regular crunch bar hmm these are actually good I mean this is really good for a chocolate crunch bar for a protein bar this is good is it amazing is it like the best I've ever had is it really super different than any other good crunch bar let's say the muscle firm wrong it's not but it's really good it's actually right I would say two on par with the best out there as far as protein bars well I'm actually very impressed with the choc with the cookies and cream on it does taste a bitter cookies and cream it's crunch the crunchiness is just enough but it's also soft then they did a good job let's try this peanut butter one chocolate peanut butter so it looks very much the same just you know brownish this is how it looks like listen guys this is a very good job with this one also this is really a chocolate and peanut butter I do you do feel the peanut butter you do feel the chocolate the crunchiness is on point I would say this is on par with the new muscle Pharm Crunch Bars the revised version the reformulated version which I repeated here on the channel in a little below which I love they're amazing and both of these both the cookies and cream and the peanut butter are amazing and even though I'm a peanut butter person I would say the cookies and cream is even better so I would say bodybuilding that come really nailed it down with these bars really nailed it down super salty I'm very impressed I didn't expect to be so impressed anyway as far as pricing you know this retails for the average $24.99 for twelve bars for a box but listen like with the rest of the Signature Series you should expect to see these on a deal you know like a BOGO 50% BOGO 50% plus a 10% off coupon or stuff like that that should bring the price down for like 15 dollars a box or $17 a box and I would say this like this is one of the better options out there this is better than the process ups bars it's on par with the MusclePharm crunch bars which are which are really really good the new reformulated version make the content of the protein is on point listen people the bottom line is I totally dig these I'm gonna be buying them anyway if this video is helpful your a protein bar decision making process give it a thumbs up subscribe to the channel to see more reviews like this because

recipe that you ever want to make to bring to the office make for your mates or anything like me bribe your mates with it's these Crunch Bars now traditional crunch bars that you find at the supermarket are loaded with sugar not only that the cereal that they use in them it's pretty sweetened so we are gonna give it a healthy makeover and it couldn't be any easier now to make my homemade Crunch Bars you only need five ingredients peanut butter maple syrup chocolate chips coconut oil and of course the crispy rice cereal now this recipe is completely vegan and gluten free but it's also sugar free too because the syrup and the chocolate chips have no sugar in them but you won't be able to tell they taste that good firstly in a microwave safe Bowl or in a saucepan add all your ingredients except for the crispy rice cereal and we're just going to melt it together until it's combined just make sure it's all mixed together and then we're gonna cover the cereal mixture with it give it a good stir to make sure that all the cereal is covered in the chocolate mixture then we're just gonna get a square pan and cover it with some parchment paper and pour the mixture into it now I always leave a little bit in the bowl because best part about working with chocolate is of course licking the bowl afterwards and just spread it out in an even layer so it goes to mostly the edges now we're just going to refrigerate it for about 20 minutes and then we can dig into it okay we've taken it out of the fridge now and we're just going to cut it into some bars [Music] and here we go

it delicious two quick things to get out of the way before we get started I will be using this silicone mini loaf pan which will give us six of these candy bars if you want you can do something smaller the macros will be based on this size candy bar secondly we will be using these Pro mix protein puffs in place of our rice krispies now if you are very much clean kedo i think this disqualifies because it does contain a small amount of tapioca enough that we're gonna wind up getting about two grams of net carbs per candy bar but it's not so much the carb thing it's the tapioca thing so call it dirty Kido if you want if you're alright with that let's get to making these things whenever I do anything on a silicone mold I always put it on a small baking sheet just because it makes a lot easier to transport it around it's not all floppy then we'll put one scoop of protein puffs in each one of the cavities and I will link to both a silicone mold and any ingredients that I use down in the description then give this a little shake just to even out all of our puffs and we'll set this aside then in a saucepan over low heat add 3 tablespoons of butter 3 tablespoons of coconut oil and a generous eighth of a teaspoon of vanilla extract when our butter and coconut oil are all melted we will add 2 tablespoons of swerve confectioner's and whisk until it is completely dissolved when your swerve is dissolved you can turn off the heat and we'll just use the carryover heat for the rest of this we have three tablespoons of almond butter you can use whatever nut butter you want I'm using almond butter whisk until the almond butter is fully incorporated into our butter and oil and finally we'll add two tablespoons of unsweetened dark cocoa powder whisk until smooth once the sauce is smooth we will add it to our puffs as you pour the sauce make sure you get around the edges first and then work your way into the center don't worry about covering up all the puffs right away we'll take care of that I like to make sure that I've got enough for all six and then I'll go back and hit the earlier ones with a little bit more then using a spatula or butter knife is poke around at each one of the cavities a little bit to make sure that that chocolate gets well distributed and I don't hit any dry patches of puffs as I'm eating and I finish off by just giving them a little Pat to make sure that they flatten out and then these will go into the fridge for about an hour our trench bar chilled for about an hour I popped it out of the mold hmm what I love about this is first it has more of a dark chocolate taste than a crackle or our crunch bar and as I've gotten older I've really gravitated towards that darker chocolate taste so I really enjoy the taste but then just that the mouthfeel the crispy little pops like Rice Krispies it feels like you're eating a crackle or a crunch bar you can also make this recipe using no sugar added chocolate chips like Lily's for example milk chocolate or dark chocolate all you will need to make your chocolate sauce is 170 grams of the chocolate chips and three tablespoons of coconut oil and then your puffs and you're good to go and also just for fun I decided to compare the macros in my candy bars to a perfect keto bar my bars little higher on the net carbs but they're also a lot bigger for net grams of carbs versus two net grams on a bar fad might have 22 grams this has 18 and protein mine has 14 grams this has 11 so there you go by way of comparison the full printable recipe along with all the macros is on my

will be showing you how to make a low-carb yogurt now it's gonna be a lower carb option versus what's in the stores so if you're looking for something and you miss that this is a great great option I did use a specific brand of yogurt because it is the lowest one that I could find that its lowest in carbs and I am NOT being sponsored by them they are Stonyfield organic plain yogurt and it's the Greek plain yogurt made with whole milk so that's the one that I found if you find a different one and it's lower than this one please leave it in the comment below for me and it'll help someone else as well so let's get right into this video it has that low carb yogurt as well as other yummy ingredients now let's get to it okay guys so what I've done is I went ahead and put my powdered sugar in here now it is important that we use powdered sugar so that you don't get a gritty texture I guess is the preferred word the texture now I do prefer using swerve in my my goods now you can use obviously use the favorite one did you prefer that you prefer to favorite sugar substitute go ahead and use that I prefer swerve and this is the powdered swerve and now they're selling it in my local grocery store so I love it so I'm gonna do that and to that I'm going to add the yogurt that I was able to find so as you can see here per one cup sorry her 1 cup it is 9 carbs and that to me is a lot compared to I mean it's a lot lower compared to the other yogurt I found so it is as I mentioned the Sony filled organic Greek plain and whole milk I am NOT sponsored by them I just want to give you helpful tips you know so okay so now let's mix all that together really well and this is the best place to go ahead and do a taste test because if you feel like you need more you can so I know in my written recipe I put one cup but it's really one cup but start with a quarter cup at a time so that you can figure out how sweet it is pretty good now I'm gonna start adding everything else so here we have our pumpkin seeds they are raw and organic then we have unsweetened organic coconut flakes you can add whatever you want I have the sliced organic almonds I have the dried chia seeds gonna give it a nice crunch as well with the other nice and then we have our sixty percent cacao Ghiradelli Tom chocolate chips I don't have Lily's the option over here for Lily's chocolate chips so I went ahead and got the one that has the least amount of carbs you go from you know you gotta use what you have better best good better but I guess you could say excuse me this is vanilla to this we're gonna add almond extract sorry but give it some really good flavors now once you get all this mixed up yeah you can try it and taste it again excited for this really really so what I've done is I went ahead and in line what I'm gonna pour these into so you can use whatever mold you want the idea is to get it as thin as possible all mixed put a little bit then [Music] might be a little bit of a paper plus you get as thin as you can because the nuts are in there choose less you all right so you keep going I'll go ahead and fast forward this part so you won't be bored [Music] [Music] so now we will go to the freezer in five hours and we're gonna cut this up so you see this is white this is the BART and we're gonna try what happened there we want to try and make it as even the chunks I would keep them in the freezer [Music] very nice chocolate their cheese they're cool that was like right there you go so this is going to be kept in the freezer you need to put in a ziploc bag as well and then just let it sit out for about three to five minutes before you go ahead and sink your teeth inside thanks for watching [Music]", "NyunTJDHII0": "[Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] do [Music] [Laughter] [Music]

fast are 18 hours I am also a creature of habit what I mean by that is I live pretty much via schedule every single day is pretty much the same routine the same schedule I get up at the same time I go to bed at the same time and throughout the day when I eat it's usually about the same time I get up at 4 a.m. and I go to bed at 8 p.m. now that may seem unrealistic to some of you but really my wake up time in my bedtime are dictated by my work schedule and on a typical day I start work about 6:30 in the morning therefore I have to get up at 4 a.m. in order to get my workout in I may sleep in one day a week but typically that's about it and if I do I'm usually up by 5:30 maybe 6:00 at the latest with going to bed at 8 p.m. I try to end my eating window about 4:30 in the afternoon I also really like to go to bed on an empty stomach I am totally acclimated to this so I never get hungry between the 4:30 in the 8 p.m. time frame I typically break my fast the following day at 10:30 a.m. and therefore I have an 18-hour interment and fast as I take you along on what I eat throughout a day I am going to share with you two alternatives I generally eat about three times a day and breakfast is usually one of two things lunch is generally one of two things and my third meal dinner is generally one to two things so I thought it would be a good idea to take you along with me on both scenarios good morning I just got up I am getting ready to start my workout it's a few minutes after 4:00 that is what I had my alarm set for was 4:00 in the morning I'm getting ready to go in the basement and do my workout I will have the workout program that I have been doing linked in the drop-down box below I'm getting ready to take my first vitamin my first set of vitamins so this is today's this is the vitamins for the whole entire day I'm getting ready to take the one that's in ass which is just it doesn't stand for the days of the week for me s just means number one I'm not going to go through all of my vitamins I have a video sharing with you everything I take on the daily that will also be linked below you can tell I have my morning voice but I want to show you my my phone so that you can see what time it really is so yes very early I don't drink anything but water during my workout and I generally drink another 16 ounces just finished my workout it is 5:30 8:00 in the morning and this is what I have prior to pounding the coffee this is my lemon ginger detox you can get to the recipe of this through a blog post and that will be linked below I did not include the honey so in the recipe you will see that you can include honey I did not include that because I am intermittent fasting but everything else is in here I have this every single morning and I have it right after my workout or upon awakening after I drink like about 16 ounces of water but it always gets drank before my coffee and I have been drinking this for years probably eight years every single morning many of you that follow me drink this every morning because you had found out about it from me so it's really good it's got a little zip to it but it's a great detox and way to start your day after I am done having my lemon ginger detox I move on to coffee and I drink three mugs so you can see the size of this mug right here it's about 12 ounces and I use stevia I don't put anything else in my coffee I drink it black but I do put one packet of stevia in each mug so three cups each with one packet of stevia I am getting ready to eat my first meal of the day this is one of two things that I have again I had mentioned I am a creature of habit so some days I have this breakfast here in on other days I have the other breakfast that I will be showing you but it's always one of the two there's no rhyme or reason I don't alternate I just gauge it on what I'm craving which one sounds better or what I have on hand so that I can make the breakfast what we have here is my toasted English muffin and I topped it with half of an avocado and then I took a couple slices of tomato here's the English muffins that I used it's the Ezekiel four-point-nine sprouted green what I do is I take one out in the early morning and I put it in a ziplock bag so that it will thaw because I do store these in the freezer and yep that's the English muffin it's toasted and then over here I have four whole pasteurized eggs they are scrambled again I always use pasture-raised what I do so I can't really show you the finished product is because it's messy so what I do is I will take one spoonful kind of like this and I will put it on my English muffin and then I will take a bite and then I will add otherwise it all just falls apart the egg will just fall off so I just put a little scoop on at a time oh the other thing too that I need to mention is on top of the half of an avocado that I spread between the two so again it was half of an avocado and I just divided it between the two it wasn't a half on each one but I sprinkled Himalayan pink sea salt on top of the avocado so again English muffin half of an avocado we have a little tomato which you could go without that and then I have the four eggs and I would just put it on each bite and it's delicious it's absolutely delicious as you can see one bite gone a big bite and my next bite is ready to go I am also breaking a 19-hour intermittent fast I normally intermittent fast for around 18 hours but I had a coaching session so I had to break it at the 19 hour mark today today I am having the other thing that I have for breakfast so if I don't have the toasted Ezekiel English muffin with avocado and egg and sometimes tomato then I have my breakfast quinoa there will be a printable that you can get to in the drop down box below if you want the recipe for this but basically it's quinoa some cookies and cream protein powder I top it off with pecans raw almond raw almond butter and then I also do a little sprinkle of the almond milk in there it's so delicious I cannot tell you how much I love my food everything that I make is delicious I don't feel like I'm compromising taste or flavor or texture at all it's so good if I need to have a snack between meals I try to stick with something such as cucumbers I absolutely love cucumbers I find them to be very refreshing also sometimes I miss having crunch when you are a clean eater you're generally not eating a lot of crunchy stuff so having something like a cucumber will give you that crunch sensation the only thing that I have on the cucumbers here is Himalayan pink sea salt and I will have the Himalayan pink sea salt that I purchase linked in the drop down box below this video for meal number two or I guess you could call it lunch which is generally about three hours after I have meal number one I will have one of two things this is avocado egg salad now if I had my toasted Ezekiel English muffin with the avocado and the eggs on it I wouldn't have this on that day because I've already had eggs and I've already had avvocato so I kind of switched things up that way now on a day that I would have my breakfast quinoa for example this would be an example of what I would have for meal number two what I have here is four whole pasture-raised eggs and then I used a whole entire avocado I really gauge how much avocado I use by how big the avocado is the one that I had was really small so I use the whole entire thing there's nothing else in this except for pepper and Himalayan pink sea salt now this is a lot of food this doesn't mean that everyone could have four whole eggs in a hole avocado that's a lot of food it's also a lot of calories I have a very active and aggressive workout routine so I may be able to take in more calories than maybe someone else I definitely do have to watch my calories I do put weight on very easily but it's one of those things where I can't really tell someone how much they can have as far as quantity because you would have to play with it for example my mom if she were to eat this much especially this much avocado she tends to see that she starts to put weight on so she was able to gauge that about herself you really just have to play with it and you have to modify things to what works for you so you could start out with four but maybe you knock it down to three or maybe you do you know three up eggs and a half of an avocado really just figure out what works for you I will also link in the drop-down box below the food chopper that I use to chop my my eggs with so I showed you the avocado egg salad that I make for lunch now on days that I don't have the avocado egg salad I will have what I call a plant in protein concoction salad and really what that is is I take whatever veggies I have in the refrigerator and I make a concoction out of it and I generally add for the protein chicken or tuna today I am using three ounces of chicken breast you really can't see it in there because it's mixed up this is not a recipe it's a concoction anyone can do this you just go in the refrigerator grab whatever veggies you have that you like and you chop them up what I have here is I have finely chopped broccoli I'm really not a fan of raw broccoli unless it's finely chopped but I love roasted or steamed broccoli I just prefer my broccoli cooked but broccoli is really good for you and if I chop it up finely and mix it with something now it's a game changer so what I did is I took the broccoli and I used my green food chopper the one that I have showed in the past you can see it here I will make sure it is linked in the drop down I poured the broccoli into a bowl and I added 3 ounces of chicken breast and then I mix it up with a little bit of avocado that was kind of softened because I want to get a creamy texture and I added a little bit of vegan ace and I will put that in the drop down box below it's kind of like a healthier version of a Mayo but I only wanted to use it to get some type of creamy consistency to the texture which you can also use hummus and I'll be honest with you if I have hummus on hand that is generally what I will use but I didn't have any hummus so again this is just a concoction and then what I did is I just topped it with some yellow and red peppers because I had them topped it with some crumbled goat cheese I absolutely love goat cheese I'm a cheese lover altogether and I'm not talking about like your cheese you would get into like a not not invitation type cheese I'm talking give me a cheese board at a restaurant and I am so happy give me some fig jam some baguettes to put it on some you know not all the variety I just I love cheese then I took a little bit of olive oil and just drizzled it over top and then I just topped it with some pepper so again it's really just a concoction oh and I think there's some tomato on there yeah there is this is generally what I would make on a day that lets say my first meal was my Ezekiel English muffin and I had the egg in the avocado then I don't want to have egg again so I would make something like this as my second meal and although I did use a little bit of avocado it was really just to get the creamy texture down something like this is not what's making us put on weight folks this is all good veggies this is very plant base but we edit in some good source of protein in there you could also top it with nuts just get creative for dinner I am having salmon and I am having roasted vegetables both of these are my recipes and I will have the blog post where you can get to the recipes for Tracy's baked salmon in Tracy's roasted vegetables in the drop down box below this is one of the two meals that I pretty much have for dinner every single night again it's usually one or the other as you can tell for all of the meals throughout the day this is absolutely delicious sometimes I put capers on top of the salmon and you will see that in the recipe I didn't have any so I was not able to put any on and for the vegetables it just depends on what I have in this little concoction I have broccoli asparagus and red peppers but you can mix it up I love to do zucchini and summer squash this time of the year anything that you can resource from your garden would be excellent but you can really use any vegetables that you prefer and I would say this salmon filet is mm probably more like a 5 ounce I think it would be bigger than 4 or 4 to 5 ounce I don't weigh it to determine that I just kind of eyeball what size is going to be suitable for me again we heard shocking creature of habit so meal number three was either the salmon that I had showed you with roasted veggies or it's this roasted vegetable pizza on a cauliflower pizza crust the pizza crust is by outer aisle it is the plant power pizza crust regram net carbs fresh cauliflower whole cage-free eggs fresh Parmesan cheese I love it zero guilt here are the nutrition facts in no worries I will have these linked below they come in a two-pack generally when I purchase them they come in I think there's a there's three of them in the kit and then I just leave them in the freezer until I need a pizza crust I just pull it out a couple hours prior and put it in the refrigerator and then on top I have this pizza sauce right here I will link this and then we also have some crumbled goat cheese cauliflower pizza crust topped with the pizza sauce and then this is just roasted veggies left over from last night's dinner which I showed you which was salmon and roasted veggies so we have asparagus broccoli there's some green onion in there red pepper and then of course I top it with goat cheese it is so good now again if you are used to standard American diet food this may not taste that great a cauliflower pizza crust just may not taste super wonderful to someone who is so acclimated to standard American diet but give it time I love it I think it's so delicious here's your nutrition facts on the pizza sauce and again it's generally one of the two things a lot of times I will have the salmon with roasted veggies and then I save some roasted veggies so I can make the pizza the next day just to give me a little variety you may be curious as to other things that I drink on a daily basis I would say that I have at least one detox tea a day and I get these from 310 nutrition and this one's and Jasmine mint I have some originals another jasmin meant so I'm really well-stocked but I have at least one a date I don't have two of these a day but I may have another cup of tea on occasion it just really depends really all I drink throughout the day on a normal basis like on a good clean eating day is again my lemon ginger detox my 3 cups of coffee and then at least one of these and generally this is like later in the morning often I'll have it before I even eat because I like the fact that it's a detox another one that I have here is this mushroom matcha drink mix this reishi mushroom is really good as well and this is a great one more towards the end of the day so there's not a lot of rhyme or reason I don't have like some type of tea drinking schedule I just like to have at least you know at least my detox tea and I buy other herbal teas throughout the year I mean you can see back here there are some teas that you know even the kids will get into but yeah I mean she is a great drink to incorporate it will also tie you over if your intermittent fasting you know obviously if I am going to go out to dinner with friends or relatives or go to a family gathering or something you know then I'll probably have wine or some type of drink if I'm going out to dinner I may have a pre-dinner cocktail and then some wine but really on a normal day its its water coffee tea and the lemon ginger detox all right I just got done drinking my detox tea and I thought of something else if you are interested in knowing everything that I drink for health wellness and beauty I will have that video linked below as well along with the supplements and everything else that I've been mentioning you are going to hear my dishwasher in the background but I did want to share with you that if I get a real sweet tooth craving one of the things that I do really enjoy is the Lenny and Larry's the complete cookie and my favorite is snickerdoodle I have tried other ones but this is my favorite and let me share that this is absolutely delicious if you put it in the microwave for eight seconds you definitely want to take it out of the wrapper just take it out put it on a paper towel or a plate put it in your microwave for eight seconds and I'm telling you it is like it came out of the oven but I will also share with you that when I eat one I generally cut it in half and I will eat one one day or one and then the other half the next day or someone is always eager to have the other half because you have to really pay attention to your nutrition facts a lot of times these snacks are two servings and this is so if you look at that it's 210 calories but that's only for half if you eat the whole cookie this basically is like a pretty much a meal replacement so pay attention to your nutrition labels I think that gets people in a lot of trouble the other thing that I love to have as a treat is my fat bombs and I can't claim that they're mine I got the recipe from someone else but I will have a printable recipe linked for the fat bombs I don't have any made right now but I will insert a photo so you can see what they look like because I've shared them before another really great treat is this power Crunch bar right here I've had a couple different flavors of these this one is the chocolate mint if you like Thin Mint cookies from like Girl Scouts that's basically what this is gonna be like so this is a nice treat I've also had the peanut butter one and that reminds me of like a little Debbie's snack cake nutty bar I think it's called or Nutter I'm not not our butter I'm not really sure but yeah that's another great like on-the-go type of snack I took these recently with me on a trip but yeah this would just be a treat I don't have them often but again it's better than the alternative so it's nice to have them on hand I will share with you that once in a while I just do need a good carbonated drink now clearly these are not going to be good for you if I am going to drink pop or some of you would call it soda I am going to have diet regardless of what anyone else thinks it's always going to be Diet I don't like to drink my calories unless of course I am having something like a cocktail or a glass of wine or or like a protein shake or something like that but yeah once in a while I just I really need something let's just say that we got takeout pizza and I just really want something really tasty and in carbonated I'm going to go for one of these once in a while it's not everyday and it's not often but I do have them on hand and you know it's better than the alternative is how I look at it and while I'm just kind of sharing it all let me share with you a weakness of mine now a couple things about me I am NOT a chip person and I'm not like into crackers meaning I never snacked on my kids as goldfish or their cheese's I'm not gonna eat you know Quaker granola bars or rice krispies treats anything that we ever had in our pantry when the kids were little I didn't really get into that stuff my weakness would be baked goods but I'm not like if we had Oreos in the home no I'm not interested I'm also not interested in ice cream it's if I baked brownies or I baked my chocolate chip cookies which you can get to on my website I'll put those down below too but if I baked something I like that's what I like is baked goods cakey tight baked goods but why are we looking at these vegetable chips I'll tell you this you know although I'm not a chip person I love these exotic blend vegetable chips with sea salt here's the different things that are in them but not just any of those there are many there's a couple I should say brands of these but I really only like the simply nature from Aldi these are my favorite and my husband will pick these up all the time when he goes to Aldi he'll get two bags and I have ate a whole bag before he's ate a bag and I've ate a bag so it is torture to have these in the house and but yeah they are so good but I mean there's still a potato chip to me I mean this is not don't be fooled by any of this stuff and I'm not it's just they are they are definitely a weakness I do incorporate other types of supplement products in my diet but not a lad I really try to stick with whole food that comes from its natural source but there are times when I will add things in especially if I'm making a protein shake but really what I shared in this video is really kind of a typical day and that's why I didn't want to you know throw together a protein shake I can't even remember the last time I've made a protein shake but if I do I will put you know stuff in it and kind of jazz it up a little with some some nutritional you know supplements another thing that I do at least four days a week from spring to fall as I walk and I walk between four and five miles and I try again I try to do that four to five days a week I generally do it in the evening but once in a while I have to do it in the morning so right now it's about 6:45 and I'm getting my walk in which sometimes it's nice because then I don't have to do it later but that is another thing that I do I don't mark this really as exercise it's just kind of an added bonus again just during the spring to fall seasons well there you have it what ie in a typical day to maintain my weight over 45 I am 47 years old this really is what works for me it doesn't mean it's going to work for you but it works for me and the important thing is that you find what works for you the other thing that you have to recognize is that for some people it may look like I'm not taking in a lot of calories throughout the day but at my age and being in perimenopause I store body weight and fat very easy therefore I really cannot take in a ton of calories throughout the day although I'm active now even 10 years ago that was drastically different you will be changing things throughout your life as you get older you just have to accept it and embrace it that's the best thing that I can say for advice when it comes to eating you will not see really any fruit in my diet there's a reason for that I really just don't enjoy fruit like I do vegetables I'm not against fruit I just prefer vegetables to get my fibrous carbohydrates in I do not count calories or macros the reason for that is I really don't need to number one I work in the health industry I have many years under my belt working with weight loss diet health wellness so I really don't need to I kind of just know in my head what I am eating when it comes to macros and calories but the other thing is I'm in maintenance mode I'm not in weight loss mode if you are in weight loss mode and you need to track these things I strongly encourage you do if it works for you again everything boils down to what works for an individual person in my planner you will see that I have a habit tracker I do record not only my workouts but I also track my intermittent fasting days and my clean eating days this is really just to hold myself accountable it really works for me I've been doing this for years and if you need something like this I would encourage that you look into it lastly I don't prescribe to any specific diet I'm not vegan I'm not vegetarian I'm not paleo I'm not keto i really don't prescribe to anything I feel that works best for me I'm not someone that likes restriction although I'm a creature of habit and I do enjoy eating a lot of the same things I do want freedom and flexibility to have whatever I want and therefore I don't follow any prescribed diet plan now I would say if I had to pick what I eat the closest to I would probably say a Mediterranean diet but again I prescribe to nothing this is another area that you really have to see what works for you you also will not see chicken or beef in my diet again it is not because I am opposed to them even as a child I really did not like beef or chicken I always ate fish even as a child now it doesn't mean that I never have beef or chicken I never order it in a restaurant the only form that I would order in a restaurant is if I was getting let's say nachos because I love barbecue pulled pork nachos so right there would be more of a product that I don't generally eat because I'd be a pork product but even if I order tacos I always order fish tacos and I love Mexican food in general if I order pizza my favorite is Hawaiian with bacon in Hawaiian pizza is ham pineapple and then I do the bacon so clearly I am taking in again pork right there but that is really the only time I'm really taking in other than fish products once in a while I'll have ground beef I love a good blacken and blue burger if it's cooked medium-rare but I have to be really Leary if I order that in a restaurant because a lot of restaurants can't nail the medium-rare but if we are gonna have burgers on the grill in the summer time I will definitely have a good juicy burger with a little pink inside if I go someplace that has a flatbread when I'm dining out I generally always get some type of vegetarian flatbread but my husband will get like a barbecue chicken and I will definitely have a couple bites of that so that kind of gives you an idea of even what I eat when I'm dining out typically if I go out to dinner at a restaurant I'm generally going to order fish and that's a lot of times salmon or sea bass would be another one maybe mahi-mahi ahi tuna I absolutely love it's generally going to be one of those and I'm going to accommodate it with vegetables but if I'm going for Mexican or Pizza I already shared with you what I would generally order in that scenario well that covers everything I hope you enjoyed seeing what I eat in a typical day and I hope all these little tips in nuggets that I added in could be resourceful thank you for joining me I'll see you soon in the next video take care [Music]", "DEqj-CH5RfY": "good morning and welcome to another edition of bill johnson's serial reviews i'm your host bill johnson and this morning oops all berries mega berries snack pouches i'm doing this review to piss off cereal bro um you know i've never reviewed oops all berries i only reviewed red white and blue berries which is oops all berries and i was blown away by it was the first time i ever had it that was with my old co-host there the fruity rebel i forget the number i gave it but really enjoyed it um at some point i'll do regular oops all berries but today oops all berries mega berries they're just three times bigger oops all berries so in a sense basically the same cereal seven grams of sugar per pouch i had to use five pouches here so okay shout out to your mom one of my probably original followers from the very beginning thanks for tuning in jeff mc shout out to you and agent cody banks some of my favorite commenters down there there's more to come so in honor of my good friends sam serial file hashtag keep it crunchy if we're gonna piss off cereal bro let's do it all the way milk first today the first time ever that i'm pouring the milk first i don't even know how to do it that looks like a lot of milk you may never see this again for me but it's called keep it crunchy this is how cereal file eats her cereal it's milk first and a lot of people are against it so i've got a bowl of mega crunch berries here i figured this was the cereal review to do it on and we're gonna put it in i'm gonna pile it high and deep wow so the milk is in first i mean does it really make a difference when you eat this much cereal i feel like it went all the way to the bottom right i think it i think this technique only works if you use a small amount of cereal but the bowls that i eat i can already see i can already see that this might not matter but let's see so dry just oops all berries didn't do the dry test these are so big one more hey i didn't notice a difference whether the milk was poured first or last i think i don't think it matters maybe i'm wrong um this is an excellent cereal i'm gonna give it an 8.9 almost rock solid i don't know if bigger is better on these they're kind of hard to eat this way i guess that's why they were meant as a snack so i love the reese's big puffs which are even bigger than this but i don't know if it i don't know if it was needed to have them this big it doesn't matter because i still gave them a near rock solid review here's what the pouches look like i'm gonna have to say that i highly recommend these even though i think they're too big to fit in your mouth that's what she said like subscribe comment down below put that in your hand or put that on your spoon and eat it i actually think it did make them stay crunchy okay", "IOtgIqbehAo": "now you could even welcome batting your hunger the official cereal of judge duty", "7jXh3JUb05U": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to for the love of nutrition i'm sure you've heard or seen lots of scary things in the media lately related to sugar but i promise it's nothing to be afraid of once we break things down you'll see we don't need to demonize sugar we just need to understand it and figure out the right balance so in this video we're going to address why is too much sugar not such a good thing should we eliminate all sugar and how can we easily determine how much sugar is too much let's jump in [Music] so why is too much sugar not such a good thing too much sugar in your diet is associated with weight gain hyperactivity sleep and mood disturbances as well as chronic diseases including diabetes kidney disease fatty liver and heart disease keep in mind diets high in simple sugars also tend to have poor overall diet quality so it's hard to determine an exact dissociation still we do know that frequent spikes of blood sugar leads to elevations and hormones as well as inflammatory compounds in our body over time chronic inflammation can damage your blood vessels harm your circulation and hurt your vital organs including your heart your kidneys and your liver so with all these complications shouldn't we just avoid sugar altogether the answer is no think about all the healthful foods we'd be missing out on that have natural sugars things like fresh fruits dried fruits certain vegetables as well as dairy like yogurt so if that's the case then how do we know how much sugar is too much a moment ago i mentioned natural sugars these are sugars that are naturally found in the food and not added during manufacturing for example carrots beets butternut squash and pumpkin naturally contain sugars as do fruits such as bananas apples oranges and berries if we avoid these foods we'd be missing out on so many healthful nutrients fiber vitamins minerals and antioxidants that actually help prevent disease now let's compare that to added sugars added sugars are not naturally found in the food but rather added during manufacturing to enhance the flavor fresh foods will not contain any added sugars however anything that's been processed or packaged can hide those added sugars so it's important to take a closer look at the food label if you're a numbers person i always suggest trying to keep the added sugar line to around 8 to 10 grams or less or if you're looking at the picture of your whole day we want to keep added sugars to no more than 10 of our calories which is about 40 to 50 grams per day for the average adult for example let's look at this soy milk the total sugars are 6 grams and this includes 5 grams of added sugar let's look at the context of this soy milk as a product from this soy milk we're getting some good quality protein we're also getting calcium vitamin d and b12 so overall this makes for a good choice let's compare that to a bottle of soda if we flip over we can see total sugars 39 and this is per 12 fluid ounces and this includes 39 grams of added sugars so that's quite a lot of sugar overall looking at this label we're really not getting much nutritional benefit so not such a great choice one more example let's look at this granola bar so we flip it over and we can see for one bar we're getting total sugars five and those are all added if we look at the context of the whole bar we are getting some protein we're also getting some unsaturated fat and some fiber overall this bar is a good choice for a healthy snack if you're craving something just a little bit sweet so here are a couple quick tips for keeping your added sugars down limit package and processed foods overall in your diet if you can steer clear of sodas juices candies syrups jellies and other really sugary items that aren't adding a lot of benefit to your overall diet save desserts for special occasions and always try to limit your portion with cakes brownies or cookies try to set them aside in individual portions you can even freeze them that way you're less tempted to grab them right off the counter it can also help to buy things in already individualized portions pair foods containing sugar with items that have fiber proteins or fats this will actually help slow the digestion and the breakdown of sugars which prevents those steep rises in your blood for example pair an apple with peanut butter or some dark chocolate with some nuts you could also try a fruit smoothie but add in some almond butter and some chia seeds to get those healthy fats in there lastly try to buy foods in their plain or unsweetened versions that way you can control how much sugar goes in instead of adding sugar try adding fresh or frozen fruit for some nice flavor you could also try a splash of citrus or some spices like cinnamon or nutmeg often our taste buds are just looking for that pop of flavor so experiment and explore some other options remember a diet where certain foods or ingredients are demonized or disallowed is a recipe for an unhealthy relationship with food if you can't enjoy a slice of cake on your birthday or a piece of pie on thanksgiving it's time to re-examine your relationship with sugar it's perfectly okay to consume some higher sugar items once in a while just try to keep your portions reasonable and do it less frequently and remember it's all about the context of an overall healthful diet majority of the time let's try to keep those added sugars to no more than that 40 to 50 grams per day but every so often if you're really having a craving for something sweet no need to deprive yourself we all deserve a treat once in a while", "K-f7Kd9xZMU": "hi guys it's Lanie and welcome back to my channel today I'm going to share with you a two ingredient copycat recipe for the crunch candy you guys seem to really love these series of 5 ingredients or less or no bake so I'm going to share with you another delicious one all you will need is two cups of dark chocolate chips and some rice krispies take parchment paper and cover it with your APH pan and I have this cute little mat I will tell you where I got that in the description box then you're just going to spray it down so it's easier to remove then add the dark chocolate into the saucepan make sure to keep an eye in it so you won't burn the chocolate then I added some rice krispies into the mat and the baking pan and notice how the chocolates a little bit thicker then I wanted it to be so I added some shortening and that is optional and notice how silky the chocolate is make sure to use a butter-flavored shortening that tastes so much better and then all you're going to do is just pour it into the pan and into the silicone spoon I found it easier to add the chocolate using a pastry bag you can also use a ziplock bag and then just squeeze it out and that's pretty much it and what I did was kind of stretch it out a little bit so the chocolate can sink in and then I popped it in the refrigerator for about an hour and guys this was so good go right now and make some of this because it's so much better and it doesn't have all those extra additives again thank you guys so much for watching I really appreciate it and don't forget to subscribe and hit that like button if you want to see more videos like this I will see I'm NX upload bye guys", "dyRwkvHAGG4": "so many people want to know how do you know if your snack is good or not [Music] [Applause] constantly get asked this question what are some good snacks that I can go to the store that I already made and I can get that are healthy and still help me get my results I mean it's the Wild West there's so many freakin snacks out there so rather than give you a fish and say eat exactly this this this is this and it only gives you that fish for that day I'd much rather teach you how to fish so game on we are going into the store and I'm going to teach you something that I've come up with called the ten ten ten rule if it hits the ten ten ten rule and meets all three requirements or even two of the three then you're doing pretty dang good so let's get to it Oh what exactly is the 10-10-10 rule well it's basically a simple way to be able to find out if what you're purchasing is a healthy snack or not or healthy food or not all we're going to do is just look at the Nutrition Facts label so turn around there's three items on here we're going to be looking at for the ten tenten one to be able to know if it's good or not so first item we're gonna look at is it needs to be 10 grams of sugar or less so preferably less the lower the better we don't want to be crushing a ton of sugar next is we want to have approximately 10 grams of fiber now sometimes you're not really going to be able to get to the 10 grams so if you can even get 6 grams or 4 or 5 you know some around there 7 8 that's going to be great last of all is 10 or more grams of protein that's it that's the 10 10 10 will super easy to be able to remember less than 10 grams of sugar proximately 10 grams of fiber and 10 or more grams of protein you can get all three of those you're doing really well even if you get 2 of the 3 it's a pretty dang good option so let's go back to this Nutrition Facts label let's see how it does we got less than 10 grams of sugar we do not have the 10 grams of fiber or close to that and we're not ten or more grams of protein so not a good option definitely you'll find something better let's look at this one ding we got the sugars we're below 10 grams on that we are over 10 grams on the fiber and we are 12 grams so above 10 grams on the protein as well really healthy option especially only on 180 calories if your goal is to lean out and be healthy this is getting you a whole lot of nutrition for not much with calories so we are going to go throughout the store and look at a bunch of different items and quickly check out the Nutrition Facts label and see how they match up with the 10-10-10 rule [Music] [Applause] [Music] so whole food like fruit veggies you don't obviously we know those are healthy and good but if you're trying to get something that's like packaged and it's mainly a guy is it good is this is this a protein bar good if it hits the 10-10-10 rule and meets all three requirements or even two of the three then you're doing pretty dang good we're family", "gzxqTzYbVjU": "(contemporary music) - Hey Munchies! Welcome if you're new, I'm Alyssia. I have talked about sugar\nand how sneaky it can be in the past and today I'm\ngoing to expand on that and give you some visual comparisons to really shift our perspective\nabout how much sugar is in some of the foods that\nwe're eating every single day. The goal is not to demonize sugar. Sure, in moderation it's\nfine but nutritionally it does nothing for our bodies. Also, note that I'm mostly\ntalking about added sugar more than natural. Although, it's still good to\nbe aware of natural sugar. Sugar is sugar and fructose is fructose so it's going to affect\nour blood sugar and bodies just the same. See my Sweeteners 101 video\nfor more science on that and we'll touch on it a bit more later but today I mostly wanna\nfocus on added sugar. Added sugar means sugar has\nbeen added to the product. It doesn't matter if it's\ntable sugar or natural honey, it's added just the same and it will negatively affect our bodies. One teaspoon of sugar is\nthe same as one sugar cube or one sugar packet, all\nare four grams of sugar. And it's hard to know what's added with the way the US\nnutritional labels are. Soon, everyone will have to\ninclude added sugar on the label but right now that's not the case so it can be very deceiving. If you've been researching\nyour health for a while now you've probably encountered\nsomeone telling you to watch out for the sugar\nin your breakfast cereal. We've talked about it\non my channel for sure but breakfast cereal is really far from the\nworst deceptions out there. We think of breakfast\ncereals like Fruity Pebbles and Cinnamon Toast Crunch\nand Frosted Flakes, all delicious I might add, and think they must be terrible for us because of all that sugar. And you're right to think that. These breakfast cereals provide no quality fuel\nor nutrients to our bodies but neither do options like Raisin Bran. First of all, it's\nworth bringing attention to the fact that the\ncereal box serving sizes are out of whack. A half cup, 3/4 cup, come on! Give me 1-1/2 cups at least\nand I'm still gonna be hungry. 1-1/2 cups of Raisin Bran\nis 27 grams of sugar, aka almost seven sugar cubes. Frosted Flakes and Reeses\nPuffs are only five sugar cubes and Fruity Pebbles and\nCinnamon Toast Crunch are 4-1/2 for the same 1-1/2 cup serving of cereal. So why do we think choosing\nRaisin Bran is healthier? And don't tell me it's\nbecause of the natural raisins because those are coated in sugar too. Yes, I even separated the\nraisins from the cereal to show you the crazy sugar\ncoating and compare, yes I even. So, here's our starting point. You're like wait, the\nvideo is just beginning? Yep, button your pants because this is gonna be sweet, literally. We're easing into it with a muffin. Most people are starting to\nget on board with the fact that these are really\njust cupcake without icing but some people are still very surprised. Like for instance anyone who's ever bought the\nMorning Muffin at Starbucks. Sure, the blueberry muffin has an unsurprising 33 grams of sugar but that Morning Muffin, even with the zucchini and carrot inside and all of those\nhealthy-looking seeds on top, still packs in 28 grams of\nsugar or seven sugar cubes. Cue Raisin Bran. (dramatic music) Cut to Cookies and Cream ice cream. - [Deep Voice] Babe. - Whole fat dairy and\nsugar-laden deliciousness containing 14 grams of sugar\nin a heaping half cup scoop. So you could have an entire\none cup double serving of Cookies and Cream ice cream or you could have the Morning Muffin. Now here's the catch about this episode. I'm actually not telling\nyou or even trying to allude that you should choose the ice cream or not choose the muffin. I'm just bringing to your attention that you should choose-- Ice cream for breakfast anyone? Let's stick with Starbucks for a second because the sugar in these coffee drinks deserves some attention. I know, I know, you're\nnot surprised to hear that the grande Pumpkin Spice Latte contains 50 grams of sugar but what about the Cinnamon\nDolce Latte with 41 grams or Caramel Macchiato with 33 grams? Oh, but you get it with soy milk, woo! That actually adds a gram\nof sugar to your macchiato because Starbuck's soy milk in the US is sweetened with 13 grams of sugar, aka over three cubes per cup, yikes. You'd cut about 10 grams of\nsugar with the almond milk but that's still a hefty\nsugar serving for breakfast. Your 35 to 40 grams of sugar grande latte might as well buy the 40 grams of sugar contains 39 grams of sugar or almost 10 sugar cubes per drink. Okay so no to the muffins and\nto the sweet flavored coffees. Yogurt must be a healthy choice? Obviously we've got\nthe not-so-good choices like this YoCrunch that I used to beg my mom\nto get me in grade school even though she never would\nwith 26 grams of sugar or 6-1/2 cubes. Instead, how about\nsomething with more protein and health benefits? Ah yes, Fage 2% Greek yogurt with honey. (rejoice singing) 29 grams of sugar, are you kiddin' me? Even the healthier looking and\norganic brands are the same. That's almost eight sugar cubes. I could have three Reese's\ncups for that sugar price tag and again to each his own, but (munch) I'd go with the peanut butter cups. (belch) Okay, so how about bars? Bars are literally meant\nto give me fuel and energy in a small package but do they? Come on, you know the answer by now. Sure, there are some healthier\nbar choices out there but you really gotta\nread the labels to know and I'm not talking just\nthe front of the package. Those health claims are\nthere to deceive you. They are marketing this bar to you. They want you to think it's healthy. So don't pay attention to the\nhealth claims on the label. In fact, I think health claims are a sign that something is suspicious. I'm not just talking about bars here. Instead, look at the nutrition\nlabel and ingredients list. A lot of these bars, even the\nones that want you to think that they're giving you\nfuel, energy, or protein are sugar loaded, 30 grams. And take note, serving sizes\nof bars can be tricky too. Some bars contain two\nservings in a single bar. Sneaky alert. (siren sounds) So the choice is yours. Over seven sugar cubes'\nworth in a single bar or 6-1/2 Oreos. I know what tastes better. Sports bars are one thing\nbut what about sports drinks? You might be thinkin' yeah, yeah. Gatorade is loaded with\nsugar, big surprise Alyssia. But what about the healthier ones? You know, ah those, yes. I wish it were true. Those are tasty too but\nunfortunately that tastiness is from sugar, 32 grams. Cut to an indulgent, delectable, demonized Dunkin Donuts glazed donut. - [Deep Voice] Babe. - Wait, that only has 12 grams of sugar? Donut mind if I have some more to reach the same amount of\nsugar from the Vitamin Water. (bell dings) You guys, I'm not making\nthis stuff up, it's nuts! These items that are\nmarketed to us as healthy are just sugar bombs and I know, if you consume any of these right now you might wanna convince yourself the Vitamin Water is better\nfor you than the two donuts but the truth is sugar is sugar. Added sugar is doing our bodies no good, no matter what it's added to. I've got one more to blow your mind but if you've learned something or enjoyed this episode so\nfar I hope you'll subscribe and hit the bell. I've got more content just\nlike this comin' every week. Beverages are tricky. It's easy to think how could\none beverage be so bad? I guess it's just so\neasy to load up the sugar where ya can't see it. Like pre-made smoothies and juices. Yes, homemade smoothies are risky too but at least you can decide\nhow much sugar to add. (uplifting music) - [Deep Voice] Babe. - These look healthy. The packaging, the health claims. This is dangerous territory. This strawberry smoothie looks innocent but has 25 grams of sugar per serving! But wait, what's that? Two servings per bottle. So you're telling me that\nthere's 50 grams of sugar in that smoothie? Yep, 50 here. Some are upwards of 60\ngrams for a single bottle. But my favorite childhood\nobviously healthy and simple breakfast, a Pop Tart, has 16 grams of sugar per pastry. You're saying I could eat three\nof those for one of these? Yep, three Pop Tarts has less sugar than one of these pre-made smoothies. Now I must admit that it's not\na completely fair comparison because smoothies are super sneaky too. Some actually do have no added sugar. Some are made of purees or concentrates. Learn more about how\nsneaky concentrates are from my juices episode linked\nin the description and yes, I will definitely bend and\nsay I would always recommend the no sugar added smoothie even if it's loaded with\nnatural sugar over the Pop Tart, which provides you no nutrients at all, if you are on an island all alone and those are your only two options. I know you guys, it's easy\nto wish and want to believe that we're consuming healthy fruit. They really want you\nto know how much fruit is in that smoothie, but think about it when would you sit down\nand eat 3-1/3 apples, a banana, 27 blueberries, and three blackberry's worth of fruit? Or two whole mangoes, an apple, an orange, and a third of a banana? That much sugar in a single bottle is still going to affect\nour blood sugar and bodies just the same as table sugar. If we were eating whole foods, sure. Eat all the fruit. It's much hard to overdo\nit eating all of this fruit because most people just\naren't going to do it than in this little dinky bottle. And I know, some of you are gonna be mad. Some of you are gonna\nthumbs down this video because you're upset and insecure that you just watched this video while drinking one of these smoothies. I get it, it's rough and\nit's okay, and at least. - [Shouting Voice] Now you know. - Thanks again so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this\nvideo and learned something. Thanks so much for being here and spending this time with me. Please know as always I'm\nnever trying to tell you what to eat or what not to eat. I simply want to bring awareness. I want to increase your\nperspective bandwidth so you can feel more confident\nwalking into the store and picking out what you\nwant to put in your body. It makes no difference\nto me what you choose. I want you to choose what is right for you and I just wanna be here\nto help you sift through the tiring amount of confusing\ninformation that's available. Okay, I will be back here next\nweek with a brand new episode and remember, especially\nwhen it comes to sugar, it's all a matter of mind over munch.", "klkpnBFnsy8": "going everyone it's logan back with another video and we've got a good one for you today when it comes to eating breakfast foods in america a lot of individuals stick to things that are really high in sugar such as french toast smothered in lots of syrup lots of uh powdered sugar and a bunch of different things maybe they'll get muffins maybe they'll get their drink from starbucks with a bunch of sugar overloaded into it and what i thought is hmm a lot of these breakfast foods got to be pretty high in both sugar fat and calories when compared to actual candies themselves so i thought to myself let's compare some of these breakfast foods to these said candies you have probably enjoyed some type of sugary breakfast over the years whether you were going to the store and look through the numerous different boxes of cereal or browse the pastry section back in the bakery it's tend to happen just with the day and age and kind of what people are used to to do in this video is make people realize that perhaps their breakfast choices should be changed or altered a little bit depending from what they're used to i'm not saying you can never eat a donut again for breakfast but it definitely should be a mindset change that if i had that donut for breakfast that maybe that piece of cake with dinner i should kind of take away there is numerous different breakfast ideas i picked five that we're going to compare to a few different types of what people would normally consider dessert so the first thing we're going to compare is a starbucks drink and this is going to be kind of a coffee related and what we're going to do is actually look at the most popular starbucks drink out there people talk about starbucks the first thing that they come to mind is potentially one of their seasonal drinks but other than that i feel like the vanilla latte just a basic vanilla latte it's probably got to be the most standard go-to for most people so let's take a look at the nutritional info for that and let's compare it to a soda perhaps all right so looking on the starbucks website i went with the starbucks blonde vanilla latte pretty simple basic something people would have for breakfast and as we can see for the grande 16 ounces they're using two percent milk four pumps of syrup two shots of espresso and look at that nutrition well for 16 ounces 250 calories six of those coming from the fat from the milk obviously um 37 grams of carbs 35 of those being from sugar guys that's that's crazy 35 grams of sugar obviously from the vanilla syrup a little bit from the milk but 250 calories for this standard thing someone would have for breakfast so looking at the pepsi get the same amount of calories and keep in mind this is for a 20 ounce bottle that's usually like a standard drink someone would have and usually like a 16 ounce cup of coffee is a standard coffee someone would have even though they are not the standard 8 ounce drink size so keep that in mind so 20 ounces we got 250 calories and look at the total sugars 68 grams of sugar in the entire bottle that is absolutely insanity um obviously there's no protein or fat so a little bit step up in the coffee version because you have the protein from the milk um actually 12 grams of protein so not bad there but still 250 calories overall and when we're talking about maintaining weight and just overall weight loss we know that calories are the most important thing in reducing overall weight so this is super super important because people don't may not realize that hey they're vanilla latte they're drinking has as much um calories and it does have quite a bit of sugar too um so we'll keep that in mind and let's look at our next object next type of breakfast food that we're going to look into is sugary cereal sugary cereal is something that is consumed by numerous individuals throughout the lifespan but specifically young children have a kind of gravitational pull towards wanting sugary cereal for breakfast i myself really enjoy sugary cereal except i usually eat it at the end of the day as kind of a dessert but what we're going to look at is comparing it to a fruity candy and this was kind of something that was hard to think about of like what would be a good comparison but i feel like sugary cereal a lot of these um are fruity like captain crunch froot loops um numerous different ones so i was thinking let's take one of those like movie theater-sized boxes of sour patch kids and we'll compare it to a bowl of um let's say captain crunch for example and when i'm gonna talk about a bowl of cereal we're not going to go with a typical serving size because a typical serving size of cereal is usually only about three-fourths a cup usually individuals when they're eating cereal they're gonna do probably at least two servings sometimes more depending on how big the bowl is so for the sake of this video we're gonna do two servings which would be a roughly about a cup and a half of cereal um and we're gonna do one cup of milk um one percent milk also in that cereal as well as our comparison because you know i don't think it's completely fair to avoid the milk too and that will give this cereal a little upper upper hand with some protein so let's go ahead and we'll take a look at the cap and crunch with milk first and then we will look into the sour patch kids in a box and compare them so i honestly forgot that cap and crunch came in regular cap and crunch and then they had the berries version so for this purposes we are going to focus on the cap'n crunch berries version just because that does have a little bit of a fruity kind of taste um compared to what we're gonna do with the sour patch kids so this is the one we're gonna use and we'll look right into the nutritional info right now so as we can see they actually did already add a milk option for a two-thirds cup of skim milk but we're not going to use that one so we're going to focus on again a cup and a half serving which would bring it up to 225 calories just from the cereal and we would have 48 carbs with the cup and a half 24 grams of sugar 3 grams of protein and 3 grams of fat but then of course if we add on to it we're going to add a one cup of one percent milk that's what we talked about and adding that would add a couple more grams of fat so this is in total with a cup of one percent milk and 1.5 servings of captain crunch 5 grams of fat 61 grams of carbs and 11 grams of protein and the um sugar does get added bumped up a little bit with the milk however this is natural sugar from the milk so i'm not really counting that compared to the added sugar that is in the cereal so now looking at the sour patch kids if we look at the nutrition info the calories is going to be 370 calories and that's going to be for the whole box that's if you eat the 2.75 servings in the whole box which let's be honest most of us are gonna do so 270 calories versus the 325 calories in the bowl of cereal and then we have 92 grams of carbohydrates for all of it 64 grams of sugar from that uh no fat and no protein so comparing that to the cereal 61 carbs versus 92 grams of carbs and 24 grams of sugar and the cereal versus 64 grams of sugar obviously there is more sugar and more carbs in the uh candy and that kind of makes sense since there is no fat and no protein so that is one of the step ups that the cereal has is that there is a little bit of protein but that is from the milk that isn't from the cereal itself uh there is a little bit of fat that's kind of negligible on both sides the big thing here is looking at the sugar intake and there still is quite a bit of carbs when you're talking about um an overall balanced diet so comparing these two obviously the sour patch kids aren't the best but really the cap'n crunch isn't much better both of these are not going to fill you up they don't really have a lot of fiber don't really have a lot of nutrients a lot of the nutrients are actually coming from the milk that's added to the cereal so in all that's kind of the comparison between these two and we'll move right into our next topic what we're going to do is compare the likes of french toast with a hershey's chocolate candy bar kind of the original and what everyone thinks of when it comes to just chocolate so when it comes to the original hershey's chocolate bar we got 210 calories and in those 210 calories we're looking at 13 grams of fat 26 grams of carbs 24 of those grams coming from sugar and 3 grams of protein um this honestly isn't that bad of a breakdown and when you consider that most people only eat one chocolate bar at a time typically um it's not the worst kind of treat to add into your diet now here's where things get a little crazy so for the original french toast from ihop we have 740 calories 36 grams of fat 84 grams of carbs and 20 grams of protein now that's an outstanding amount of calories and fat and just overall nutrients and i'm unsure if they add the butter and syrup that most people would probably be adding to these types of foods 36 grams of fat is pretty high in my mind uh just for the french toast so i feel like they might have added the butter however i don't think that would include the syrup and most people aren't choosing sugar-free syrup they're choosing the full sugar one where it has 210 calories per quarter cup which is a lot of sugar so comparing these two you can see that um you know you might be eating three hershey's bars basically worth of calories and fat and sugar in just your breakfast alone and most of us could reason that that probably isn't the healthiest you thought those numbers were surprising the next ones might surprise you too we're gonna look at one of my favorite junk foods of all time the krispy kreme donut donuts specifically but i feel like krispy kreme just has something down especially with their original glaze which is what we're going to look at and we're going to compare that to cupcakes and i was kind of looking through a few different ones but i decided to just go with the hostess pre-made cupcakes the ones that come in individually wrapped pouches so let's get into it so when we're looking at those hostess cupcakes we're looking at 170 calories for one cake 6 grams of fat 29 grams of carbs 19 grams being sugar and 1 gram of protein and the reason why i picked cupcakes and donuts is because usually when we're eating these we'll tend to eat more than one um just because after you eat one you're like oh that was good uh it doesn't really hit you that hard so that's what we're looking at for cupcakes not overall too bad let's look into the donuts so of course the famous crispy cream glaze what everyone loves looking at 190 calories for one donut 11 grams of fat and 22 grams of carbs 10 of those being sugar and 3 grams of protein so comparatively they're actually very similar into overall calories and nutrients which is kind of my point of this is that these two things are considered different meals so donuts usually are considered a breakfast meal and cupcakes would be considered a dessert but when you look at the nutrition and the calories of them they're basically the same thing and that's kind of scary and especially in our day and age where we're over eating these things in general last but not least we're going to round it out with again two probably really famous and favorite desserts and breakfast options for you and that is gonna be the muffin and the brownie and i chose these two because they're kind of similar consistency they're both kind of cakey type items and for the most part you're not really adding icing or anything onto it so i figured they'd be kind of similar so let's look at the so i decided to go to walmart and just pick a typical uh muffin from their website so this was the triple chocolate version we're looking at 350 calories 17 grams of fat 47 grams of carbs 28 of those being sugar and 5 grams of protein and for a lot of you that have eaten them off and you know that these muffins are very very large and for most of you you're probably going to end up eating most if not all of it and that's an insanely large amount of calories when you're adding that onto your other options maybe you're having some juice and a banana with it so you're looking at quite a few calories in really something that's not overall that filling and rounding it out we're gonna look at the brownies and i chose the cosmic brownies for this uh such a classic these are so delicious and i feel like everyone's heard of these and we're looking at 280 calories for um a pack of these 11 grams of fat 42 grams of carbs 24 of those being sugar and 2 grams of protein so comparatively the cosmic brownies are a little bit less calories but keep in mind they are a little bit smaller so when you look at them per um gram you're probably going to be similar in calories and overall nutrition but again this brings me back to the point of brownies are usually a treat food muffins are usually considered breakfast food but when you look at them in the same regard they're basically the same thing i hope you enjoyed that video guys thanks for watching hopefully it kind of changed your perspective on looking at breakfast in a new way i know when i started looking at typical american diet patterns and noticed that a lot of these breakfast options are very high in sugar very low satiety as in they don't really fill you up and make you feel full and not a lot of overall nutrients that are going to provide you good energy through the day um i kind of noticed like hey that's because most of these breakfast items are actually desserts so maybe that'll kind of change your framework if not maybe it'll uh kind of steer you to have some proportions maybe have a donut instead and then have a banana in place of that other half it's kind of up to you so hopefully you enjoyed the video please leave a comment if you have

grams of fat zero I repeat zero carbs and 25 grams of protein I do wish the fat to protein ratio was a little higher in these but that's a small thing to complain about the price is $5.99 for the entire container so they are kind of on the pricier side but I think that's pretty much what you should expect to pay when you're buying cheese wrapped in prosciutto if prosciutto isn't your thing there's always the Columbus Genoa salami pnina's so if you're more of a salami fan these work great too and again these are $5 and 99 cents just like the prosciutto ones are as far as the macros go on these for the entire container all six of them 340 calories 26 grams of fat 1 gram of carbs that's for all six one gram of carbs and 25 grams of protein if you love me and you love cheese and you love cheese wrapped in meat it's a no-brainer you need to add these to your shopping list they're delicious they are a little bit pricey but totally worth it in the same section you will find these P 3 portable protein packs I think that's why it's called P 3 and not all P threes are created equal but this turkey almond and Kobe Jack one is one you want to look for because this is keto friendly the macros on this one are a hundred and eighty calories 13 grams of fat 4 grams of carbs one of which is 5 or so 3 net carbs and 13 grams of protein obviously they make a great on the go keto snack because you don't have to do anything they're already made for you they're pre-portioned out you just toss them into your book bag in your purse and your lunch box and boom they're all set and ready for work for school really for anywhere you could even sneak these into the movie theater if you wanted to and I almost forgot the price they're only a dollar so that's pretty nice too so like I said not all P threes are you know friendly this one this chicken peanuts and cheddar one is keto friendly the macros on this one 200 calories 14 grams of fat 3 grams of carbs one of which is fiber so that's 2 net carbs and 13 grams of protein and as far as the price again just a dollar on this one just like the other P 3 was so if you're looking for cheap on-the-go keto snacks these P 3s might be ones you want to add to your shopping list next up we're talking about these mini beef and pork sticks by Vermont and company these are awesome for a few reasons number one portion control they're already pre portioned out into individual packages number two because there are many in so small you could sneak these with you pretty much anywhere especially if you like sneaking things into the movie theater like I like to do and then number three just the macros on these are awesome each one of these only 40 calories 3 grams of fat 0 grams of carbs so another zero carb keto snack here and three grams of protein obviously if they are mini so they're not very big as you can see here but they are delicious really good mmm smoky salty meaty chewy mmm mmm highly highly recommend picking these up they are so good so good also the price of these pretty awesome three dollars and forty eight cents for seven of these mini sticks I just think as far as convenience goes that's totally a fair price so that original flavor is truly incredible but Vermont also makes this uncured pepperoni flavor of their mini sticks once again three dollars and forty eight cents for all seven sticks the macros on these pretty great as well each stick is only 35 calories one and a half grams of fat one gram of carb and four grams of protein honestly I've never had this flavor before but if it's anywhere close to as good as the original flavor it's gonna be amazing let's open this guy up and see what it tastes like smells just like pepperoni has so much flavor so much pepperoni flavor in such a little stick just incredibly delicious these mini sticks are they're amazing you might recognize this next keto snack idea from my Walmart snack hall that I did a few months ago and that is the planters nutrition nut packs now the reason I love these so much is because portion control I'm the kind of person where if a jar of nuts are open or around me I can eat half the jar so just having these packages prepackaged I know how many calories a meeting I know what I'm eating and I don't have the temptation of an open jar around me these are just a really great way to stay on track and not overeat when it comes to nuts now make sure you get the heart-healthy mix because there are a few different mixes and not all of them are keto friendly the heart-healthy mix is keto friendly each package is only 190 calories 17 grams of fat 6 grams of carbs 3 of which is fiber so that's 3 net carbs and six grams of protein as far as the price goes it's six dollars and twenty-nine cents for the box the box does have seven packages inside of it though so you're paying less than a dollar per package and I'm not trying to say that this is a cheap Quito snack but what I am saying is you're paying for convenience you're paying for the portion control component of this and to me those things are important so I'm willing to pay for it plus nuts are just kind of expensive on their own so to expect this to be cheap I think is kind of silly I gotta say I'm a big fan of the mixed pistachios pecans walnuts almonds it's a pretty good mix crunchy salty nutty what's not to love so that's one approach you can take to snacking on nuts in a keto friendly way but if you're the kind of person who wants to weigh out an individually packaged your nuts they do sell a mixed nut bag by Archer farms that is keto friendly as well you want to make sure that you look for this mix in particular the raw nuts mix so this mix is almonds cashews walnuts hazelnuts and pistachios it's a little bit fancier than the planters bags of nuts the macros on these nuts per serving which is 28 grams it's a hundred and sixty calories 14 grams of fat 6 grams of carbs 2 of which are fiber so it's 4 net carbs and 5 grams of protein as far as the price it's $5.99 for this bag so it's a little bit cheaper than the box of prepackaged out nuts also you get more in here than you do the box of nuts and they're a little bit fancier there's hazelnuts in here there's some fancier nuts in here then the box nuts have but what comes with that is the temptation of eating this entire bag and I'm a weak person who who die just can't be around this bag so another keto snack that you guys might remember from my last night call my Walmart haul are the birthday cake quest bars found these at Target I had to pick them up because I eat these pretty much every single day as far as I'm concerned one of the best grab-and-go on-the-go keto snack ideas you bring this to work to school sneaking into the movie sneaking it in anywhere because you know they're just so portable and as far as protein bars go I think these taste the as far as the macros per VAR i want to explain how this has four net carbs per bar because in the walmart ketose snack hall a lot of people were getting confused on how you calculate the net carbs in these bars so every bar has a hundred eighty calories 6 grams of fat 24 grams of carbs but it has 14 grams of fiber so you have to subtract that so that's 10 grams and net carbs and then you also have to subtract the erythritol from the net carb count as well because erythritol doesn't have any calories or net carbs so you have to subtract those 6 grams as well and that leaves you with 4 grams of net carbs and the bar also has 21 grams of protein as well and yes I know that the protein to fat ratio needs is a little bit higher than you like for the keto diet obviously there's more protein than fat in here but all I have to do is pair this with some almond butter or peanut butter or mixed raw nuts and the ratio is a little bit more aligned with the macro ratios of the keto diet or you could have one of these bars and just be conscious later on in the day that you have to eat more fat and less protein to end up with the ratios your macro ratios that are aligned with the keto diet it's very easy to fit this into your day and also very delicious and as far as the price goes target cells a 4 pack of these for 8 dollars so that's $2 bar pretty much everywhere you go the best price you're gonna get on a quest bar is two bucks bar even if you buy 12 them you're still usually paying two bucks a bar so to only have to buy four of these for two bucks a bar I think is a very fair reasonable price and I truly believe if you're out about you're on the go you're away from home you're looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth let's say you get a sweet craving or you're just kind of a little hungry because these really curb my hunger when I eat them not only are they delicious but they really hold me over for a really long time because there's so much fiber you should look for one of these birthday cake quest bars because they will not disappoint clearly I already know if these tastes like because I eat these every single day but I will still do a taste test for you it's absolutely delicious there's like a cream glaze on the top of the bar that has these like little birthday cake sprinkles to it and then the inside is this like chewy nougat is really good Oberto Applewood bacon smoked jerky as far as on-the-go keto snack ideas or keto snacks for travel doesn't get better than beef jerky I think not my friends and the applewood smoked bacon jerky at Target it is the lowest carved jerky that you'll find there every serving only has one gram of carbs which is just crazy for jerky as far as the entire nutritional information goes on this every serving and there's two and a half servings per bag it's a hundred and thirty calories nine grams of fat like I said one gram of carbs and twelve grams of protein and not only are the carbs great on this jerky but the price is great - it's four dollars and forty nine cents for this bag and that is really affordable a lot of times Jerky's like six seven eight bucks or more a bag less than five bucks a bag that is a great price and it's made with 100% real bacon there is tons of bacon flavor in this bag I can tell you guys that much also look at this it looks like a regular piece of bacon just in Turkey for Jirka fide Mr gum oh my god hmm that's incredible salty smoky bacon II just absolutely delicious so that smoked bacon jerky was delicious and while we're talking about cured meats we've gotta talk about deep pepperoni slices from Target the reason I say that is because this is another zero carb keto snack option the full nutritional information for every serving which is 15 slices that's a pretty good amount of slices for serving a hundred and forty calories 13 grams of fat 0 grams of carbs and 6 grams of protein those are not only some pretty awesome keto macros but some pretty great keto ratios too you have twice as much fat as you have protein so far as I'm concerned you want to do some snacking these pepperoni slices from Target a great snack option to do it with by the way the price on this pepperoni it's two dollars and 11 cents for the bag and I think that's a pretty fair reasonable price for a bag of pepperoni these pearls Queen olives stuffed with blue cheese another great zero carb keto snack idea now the macros on these olives every serving is - olives it's 25 calories two and a half grams of fat like I said zero grams of carbs zero grams of protein so that totally means you could open this jar up crush the entire thing during like in episode two or three of Breaking Bad and really not worry much about it because like I said zero carbs in all dissolves and also there's really not a lot of calories either the entire jar has just over 300 calories now the price on these is $4.99 for the entire jar so if you do decide to eat the whole jar it wouldn't be be cheapest keto snack option that you could choose but if you're just thinking about this in terms of olives stuff with blue cheese I think $4.99 for this jar it's a pretty fair reasonable price got it there's so many olives in here you can't get one out here we go I got one nope I don't the struggle is real getting the first olive out of the jar apparently finally going out that's incredible the only six words you need to know about these olives blue cheese stuffed olives are delicious that's all you need to know about them so those blue cheese stuffed olives are actually a fantastic lead-in to the next keto snack idea that I have for you from Target and that is these Queen Queen queen size these pimento stuffed queen sized Spanish olives I I don't know words I can't I just can't put words into sentences this is market pantry so this is targets actual brand and again it is a zero carb keto snack option so these are a little cheaper than the pearls olives these are three dollars and nineteen cents but then again you aren't getting blue cheese stuffed olives here you are just getting pimento stuffed olives so they should be a little cheaper macros on here for two olives just like the other ones it's 25 calories 2 grams of fat zero carb zero protein so pretty similar macro eyes but for me I love cheese and if I'm gonna eat pretty much the same amount of calories per serving I'd rather have cheese in my olives than pimento that's just me but like I said I know not everybody likes cheese you don't like cheese now I don't know if we could be friends 100% easy to get out of the jar than those blue cheese stuff all toward alright here we go alright Alti honestly if you're looking for a salty like I'm talking salty keto snack idea these pimento stuffed olives are probably the idea that you're looking for I don't think anything I've had so far has been as salty as these pimento stuffed olives these are salt to the T so the next keto snack that we're talking about is the Tillamook sharp white cheddar cheese bars I could have picked a lot of different cheese sticks at Target but I picked cheese sticks out at Walmart yes there are a ton of cheese sticks to get there but I just want to get something a little different I thought that these look really tasty I love sharp white cheddar so that excited me and also the macros on each one of these bars is pretty nice so every bar is 90 calories 7 grams of fat only 1 gram of carbs and 5 grams of protein also the price on these is great three dollars and fifty cents per 10 cheese bars that's 35 cents a bar in my opinion that is an incredibly reasonable price for something that's a little bit classier a little bit nicer than just like an average cheese stick that is cheesy deliciousness if I ever taste it this is way better than a cheese stick way better rated delicious moving on the next keto snack that I have for you is another zero carb keto snack it's also a very very popular snack in the keto community and that is parm crisps a lot of people do more than just snack on these though they use them as croutons and salads or almost like an oyster cracker in soups or you could just add it as kind of like chips to a sandwich you can make a chocolate we just did a bunch of chocolate peas on the channel just the other day add this to your chocolate and --which and you've got kind of like chips and a sandwich as far as the macros on the crisps every serving is twelve of them it's a hundred calories seven grams of fat zero carb nine grams of protein and that's four twelve crisps and as far as the price goes it's usually three dollars and ninety nine cents a bag I got this for three bucks it was on sale I guess but as you can see the bags now very vague and most of it's filled with air so I don't think you can consider this a cheap Quito snack but it definitely is a delicious one cheap though probably not just keep that in mind if you're deciding to pick some of these up so I'm definitely grabbing a few of these and stacking them up just to amplify the crunchiness it says sophisticated snacking at its finest on the bag so pinkies up hmm crunch though hmm that is delicious if you're looking for cheesy crunchy salty you gotta have these to your shopping list so original parm crisps they're fantastic but what about sour cream and onion parm crisps if sour cream and onion is your jam if you love sour cream and onion chips then you probably want to check out these sour cream and onion farm crisps as far as the macros go on these every serving is a hundred calories 7 grams of fat 1 gram of carbs and 9 grams of protein and once again that's 412 these just like the original kind also the price is the same on these it's three dollars and 99 cents for the bag so once again a delicious keto snack here but not really a cheap keto snack that is super sour creamy and super onion which I dig I think there's a technique to eating parm crisps and that technique is you have to stack them then you have to put your pinky out because it says sophisticated snacking on the package delicious did you hear that crunch so freakin crunchy and I love crunchy snacks hmm this hits the spot so parm crisps are absolutely delicious on their own but if you want to take them to the next level you want to dip them in something keto friendly I recommend grabbing some good foods chunky guacamole this stuff has no added sugar and no artificial preservatives and the macros on it are totally great for keto every serving is two tablespoons or 33 grams it's 40 calories three and a half grams of fat three grams of carbs two of which is fibers let's one net carb and one gram of protein and as far as the price goes it's $3.99 which i think is a really reasonable fair price for guacamole because let's be honest guac is always extra it's always expensive and three dollars and 99 cents for this much guacamole I think that's fair like I said the technique is always stacking the Pharm crisps going for the dip pinkies out that is some dang good guac it's rich its creamy there's a hint of lime juice in there some garlic some salt it's really delicious speaking of dipping your parm crisps into stuff the spinach artichoke thought a dip by Archer farms might be a dip you want to consider now the macros on this dip for every two tablespoons or thirty grams of it it's 60 calories 5 grams of fat 2 grams of carbs and 2 grams of protein and the price on this is the same as the guacamole it's three dollars and 99 cents for the top of it wow that is delicious the artichoke the spinach the feta everything just works so well together and just the cool creaminess of the dip paired with the crunchy saltiness of the parm crisps that is one killer combination so the final thing I think you should add to your shopping list and my final keto snack idea from Target is some super coffee so this is actually like a bonus snack idea because I think this is actually the 22nd keto snack idea that I'm doing for you guys but in my opinion it is a snack idea nonetheless even though it is liquid a lot of days I'll have one of these in the middle of the day and it'll just help me curb my appetite for hours after I have one that's why I really like this stuff so it's a combination of caffeine MCT oil and a little bit of protein I think the combination of those three things can really help in terms of controlling hunger and it helps for me so the macros on this coffee are pretty awesome there's 80 calories 5 grams of fat like I said that's all from MCT oil one gram of carbs and 10 grams of protein so this has a higher protein to fat ratio then you like to see from some kind of a keto snack product but with that being said we already talked about this guys it's not a huge idea you just add some more cream into this if you want to change the ratio of it and make it a higher fat to protein ratio or you just have one of these and eat more fat later on in the day and less protein later on in the day and just make sure that at the end of the day your ratios end up how they should be for the keto diet well that being said the only thing I don't like about these coffees is the price they're three dollars and twenty-nine cents so they're definitely not a cheap keto snack they could be a little bit less if you buy like a four pack I think that's the most you can buy at once but I wish that you could just buy one for less than three dollars if you're just buying like one of the time you just pop into Target grab one of these for less than three dollars and like pop out and just drink one when you're traveling or going to work or in school or whatever you're doing it'd be nice if it was like you know two dollars and fifty cents but three dollars and twenty-nine cents I don't think that's crazy because if you go to Starbucks or you go to any coffee shop you get a specialty coffee you're probably gonna pay like five dollars or more for one of those so that is my keto snack haul from Target I hope you guys enjoyed this video I really tried to pick keto snacks that were great for when you're on the go if you're at work or you're at school or you're just doing some travel and you're out and about or whatever and you can just pop in a Target grab some of these and pop out I hope that I accomplished that goal I'm sure I missed a few snacks though so if you've got some go twos from Target that I missed let me and everybody else know what your keto snack ideas are from Target down in the comments below I'm sure everybody will appreciate that I just want to thank you guys so much for watching I will see you in the next one", "kfPI5sihv68": "today kevin and i are gonna be trying three new items from quest now we've reviewed a lot of quest bars we actually reviewed peanut butter cups but it's been years ago it's been like four or five years ago there was a review up on the channel and uh so we're gonna try them again see if they've changed their recipe any these are the peanut butter cups this is a new gooey caramel uh flavor with peanuts candy bar and i have just one other quest protein bars this one is the lemon cake we found all three of these at the vitamin shop the candy bar was 249. the lemon bar was 279 and the peanut butter cups were 259 so ordinarily you're not gonna uh spend 2.49 on one candy bar when you can go spend 80 cents at walmart so there must be something to it we'll have to read maybe it has more protein we'll see so the quest this is less than one gram of sugar in the peanut butter cups 11 grams of protein one grams of net carbs that's why so this is for keto you would think so or protein pizza uh two cups is 190 calories so that's about the same as a bar it's actually quite a little less than hockey jesus got okay they have a little swirly on top [Applause] that's actually not bad it's not bad it's definitely not as sweet if i was on keto i could eat that there are so many things we've tried oh yeah that's horrible well especially those um i think they're the lilly's brand the no sugar added all those we i mean we just don't like them this is i actually really like that i actually really i taste the peanut butter it tastes like there is some sweetness to it a little bit yeah that's not as sweet as a regular candy bar of course but but yeah they're pretty good you know what i'm not disappointed in that at all i could eat that if i was on keto um you know yeah i'm just really really shocked i like the peanut butter in it because i remember years ago it was like we tried them and it's like oh i would never get that again because it seems like i haven't watched the video but it seems like maybe it was dry or this isn't like that at all this is totally different it's edible i mean would i pick that over a candy bar i personally would if you were wrong but if i was like though i would if i was on keto all the other ones we've tried before i would pick this one instead okay now this one is the new candy bar it's gooey caramel with peanuts 12 grams of protein three grams of net carbs stupid one gram of sugar so that's why you're paying so much for this so this one it looks like a pretty good sized bar too 210 calories [Applause] yeah that's not too bad oh it has lots of lumpy bumpy peanuts is it softer [Applause] i like the texture of that middle these are all gluten-free all three of them um that's really good that is very good it is once again it's not as sweet right as an actual real candy bar but if i was on keto i would i like that more than the peanut butter cups and i do like peanut butter well you get the texture of those added peanuts exactly i i really like i mean i like those peanut butter cups stuff i would have to buy them both and you know split it up and eat one one day and one the other day now i don't really get caramel as a flavor it's more peanut than anything but i did get some maybe a touch of cold i did get caramel but you get uh you get the the texture of those peanuts and the flavor of the peanuts that is that's really good it is good caramel wasn't like a standout flavor for me it might have been there a little bit but it's mainly peanuts yeah mostly you do there is a flavor um i think that's delicious it's good definitely if you're on if you need any of that stuff yes then go for it yes absolutely they are a little expensive but most of that stuff is i'm wondering if maybe if you buy them uh online or something and not get them at the vitamin shop i'd say that again you know but the vitamin shop is more expensive um i'm wondering if you get them online for jacob yeah this is a quest a lemon cake protein bar 20 grams of protein 4 grams of net carbs 1 gram of sugar 15 grams of fiber and it is 180 calories so it's the lowest calorie thing here sometimes i have a coating on oh it has squirrels so sometimes people um do these all kinds of different ways microwave them toaster oven them all kinds of ways we're just trying it regularly in our videos you want to hold that up in our videos we have many times we've cut it in half and we'll try half of it uh heated in the microwave and half of it unheated just to tell you which way is best this is so fresh and soft though unless you just like it warm i like the flavor though some of the things you have to watch out for that it's not chemical like a cleaner this one's actually really nice i like it too it is a nice lemon it's like a dessert it's a dessert lemon um a lot of protein bars too it they're overwhelmingly that protein flavor which really bugs me to death that has just the slightest hint of it for me but not bad at all and it's not grainy so i don't really get a really grainy feel texture no that one's actually a good relationship you know the better that's one of the better questions yeah i mean there's a lot of them that you like uh but that that is that's one to add to it uh so yes that's if you like a dessert type lemon flavor you would like that so it reminds me of a lemon pudding like a little a very yes yes i i agree with you um i have to do i have to admit i am surprised all three of these were very very successful they really were now you only have enough money since they're so exposed you only have enough money to buy one um i would say the candy bar with the peanuts yeah i'm gonna say the candy i'm gonna surprise you because i know i said i like the candy bar i thought more than the peanut butter but you know what i'm gonna choose the peanut butter cups because i just i really do like that peanut butter flavor see i was going to almost pick the lemon bar but i think i would be fuller after eating the lemon bar yeah so really for me it depends on when i was eating it if i was eating it for lunch i'd pick the bar okay if i need it for a snack then i'm going to pick probably the peanut bar right but they're all all of these are good uh because we've tried a lot with protein we've tried a lot with keto we're not on keto we don't have that lifestyle yeah so i wouldn't pick any of these but we can tell you if it's good or not and so for us to say that's good yeah so if you've been without a candy bar for a while these will be really yeah you're really gonna like them so i hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching [Music] you", "TlZuyEbkqg8": "[Music] hey guys what's going on I just want to tell you a little bit about a snack that I recently just purchased when I was at the grocery store you are Quaker apple cinnamon rice crisps I purchased the read of these so I purchased uh of course the Apple Cinnamon and I also got cheddar and sweet it was like a sweet and chilly I think it was called and they were excellent and I just opened this one and it is my absolute favorite out of the three and I thought when I saw this in the store I was like Oh Apple Cinnamon that's perfect because you know perfect for the Fall Apple Cinnamon just goes kind of hand-in-hand with that and they are absolutely delicious guys just wanna keep going out and show you guys oh maybe I should take one out what's not broken but me and my husband is damage to this bag we love it so this is what they look like you'd see like the nice cinnamon on top of here and grained in the rice cakes they are delicious and super super crunchy they are gluten free I have 11 grams of whole grains per serving and no high fructose corn syrup which is good for you and good for your kids if you're feeding this to them as a snack it's a new look same great taste so I guess this is my first time trying the apple cinnamon flavor actually I tried of course like weaker rice cakes the plain ones and the chocolate ones I purchase all the time but I just wanted to try something new and these are absolutely delicious so these are like the mini ones I also got the bigger one that you can purchase - this says 120

before February 25th 2019 but I dare you to not finish this within the week you open it because it's so delicious this is the purchase seal do not heat it in toaster or microwave which I'm glad I read that because with their bigger rice cake because you know they have the bigger sizes I always would stick them in the toaster oven and then put peanut butter on the plain ones I didn't know you weren't supposed to do that so kind of go ahead I read it and then on this side of the bag says it has 11 grams of whole greens per serving low cholesterol per serving no high fructose corn syrup no artificial flavors pops never fried full of flavor full of crunch made with corn and whole grain brown rice a convenient on-the-go snack I definitely agree with that I oh I'm like a snack clean I always bring like snaps with me like to leave them in the car more so in the winter because if it's something in the summer that can like melds like I've left granola bars on my car they melted it was horrible so in the winter sand go all like you know when it's not hot out I'll eat snacks in my car but you could leave is in your desk drawer um I think these are definitely something great that you can give your kids because they're like a healthy store healthier snack it's not like giving them potato chips like because they're popped and they're not fried so that makes me feel better about eating them too and Quaker is a great company and they've been around forever I can't tell you enough how delicious I think these Apple Cinnamon rice crisps are I just didn't finish the bag specifically so I could do the video to show you guys and tell you a little bit about it I think you should definitely try these out especially for the Fall have them with a cup of tea some water or whatever I had them this morning with my coffee and yogurt maker Apple Cinnamon rice crisps I hope you guys try it and I hope you love it thank you [Music]", "_Tdxoe80QTY": "big shout out to Michael

"it's time for a chocolate bar for the kid in you hey everyone welcome to walk into candy aisle I'm Jeff and today we are viewing Nestle's crunch bar yes this is crunch this is I think one of the last big like big popular American chocolate bars that I haven't for some reason gotten to so I'm glad I'm finally getting into it today Nestle Crunch it's pretty straightforward it's real milk chocolate as you can see here on the packaging and it's real milk chocolate with crisp rice that's right with Krispies inside it so that's that's pretty much it there's no not much else to say introduced in 1937 it's for the kitten you apparently that's what they tell me internets I love the packaging actually it's pretty straightforward pretty simple crunch is a great name for a chocolate bar little cracked it's crack sort of packaging because it's just so once applied or something I don't know packaging did recently would change to this more traditional packaging I would kind of like to crunch bar never like you know top top but in terms of like your Rice Krispies bars it is one of the better ones so look at the bottom first of all this is the bottom layer of the bar and just my goodness just look at all that all those Krispies in there and these are little Krispies right that's kind of part of the thing that makes this so crispity crunchity and then on the front crunch that's the crunch look at that this has got to be one of the first chocolate bars that I ever saw that had a full like imprint of like something something like for reals going on here then every once in a while they'll do like special limited editions of these that have like like a different kind of a picture on it and they can get pretty intricate like that's pretty good right I mean it's it's pretty um detailed I guess even though it's a simple design it really is very detailed and they can get much more detailed that's what I'm saying I guess so smells up alright let's let's give it a try hmm it's got that crunch no there's the did you hear that snap wow that is crunch horrific I like that snap it's a very satisfying sound I really enjoy eating this bar it's like a fun chocolate bar to eat I certainly I don't think I could say that it's that great I don't think the chocolates very good I think that's the problem I like the idea and I think having small Krispies is really good because in other crispy bars I think they often times make the mistake of having too big Krispies but I don't know that this is very good chocolate and I think that's a problem when you're talking about a chocolate bar you know no matter how good the design is how fun the packaging or that sort of concept is if the if it just doesn't taste that good I don't know it's not terrible banged my knee means but to me this feels like low end of Nestle's chocolate I mean they do they do some decent chocolate sometimes I don't really think that this is the case of it though but all that said you know the design is really cool the concept is cool I find it satisfying to break it apart I like the artwork I like it and I want it to be better I guess but um but it's not so that's a shame anyway breathe rate forward I guess that's really all there is to it walking in candy aisle is going to rig the Nestle Crunch bar I'm in a rated 3 out of 5 it's just you know it just doesn't do anything for me I even honestly I only give it a three because I like all those other factors around it but taste wise this is something you can pass um yeah just I don't know try something else if you're looking for crisp rice maybe jeez I don't know what's the Hershey crackle tastes like these days I haven't had them one of those in a while I should review that yeah I don't know this is not where to go though maybe the hundred grant hundred grand that's it that was pretty good if I remember rightly anyway crunch bar I know it's popular and I get why but it's not for me so three out of five it is thank you

certified personal trainer and lifestyle coach today we're gonna talk about foods that you might think are gonna help you lose weight but they're actually not all that great for weight loss these are some of the worst foods that you can eat if you're trying to lose weight we're not gonna talk about health we're not gonna talk about micronutrients all that much all we're gonna talk about is how are these foods optimized for weight loss are they optimal if you're trying to lose weight and you're trying to stay full and you know eat like a normal human being are they gonna be good for your situation or not we're not gonna talk about if they're healthy or not so let's check it out I continue I want to mention something that's really important you can lose weight eating anything you can lose weight eating Twinkies you can also lose weight eating chicken and broccoli however there's a big difference in how you're gonna feel and your body composition and all sorts of other factors that aren't being mentioned so for example if you only ate 2 thousand calories of peanut butter versus 2,000 calories of chicken and broccoli you're gonna be pretty hungry because you're not taking in a lot of food that's just one example so we're gonna be rating foods for things like calorie density you know how much does it say she ate you does it fill you up is it gonna keep you sane we're not gonna you know you can lose weight on any crazy diet but in the name you know the name itself says it's crazy so which means that it's not gonna be sustainable and you're probably gonna go back to whatever way you were eating before hands so my idea of foods that are not good for weight loss are foods that are let's just say we'll call them high-risk foods when it comes to weight loss meaning you can easily go wrong with these foods and overeat in your calorie consumption prevent weight loss that's what this video is gonna be about you can lose weight eating anything right we're also not going to talk about the health benefits of certain foods we're not going to talk about the micronutrients and stuff like that we're just gonna talk about the overall big picture of are these foods optimal for your lifestyle when it comes to weight loss what I want to do is break things down as to why people see the food as a healthy food or as a weight loss promoting food and some of the things that you really need to be careful and watch out for with this food otherwise it's gonna bite you in the ass it's gonna really make it hard for lose weight or to get weight loss or you might even gain weight even though you're eating these foods and you think that they're healthy and guys I want to make a side note I'm here sitting at my computer so I can read off my list it's a little bit less formal than some of the other videos I've made where I'm standing in front of that wall down there talking to the camera I can get information out faster this way and so you can have it more frequently I can make more frequent youtube videos and I think that's just gonna be helpful for you guys so I'm gonna start making more videos like this where it's a little bit more relaxed but I can make more videos that get you more useful information so once again let's check out these foods that are horrible for weight loss food number one is peanut butter so why some people see it healthy is it's got some protein and it has a lot of healthy fat that's pretty much it so here are the things that you need to watch out for nuts are generally really high in fact and after you process it into a butter it's gonna be even more concentrated it's gonna be a higher dose of fat and so peanut butter is mostly fat sure it has a little bit of protein but it's got way more fat unfortunately some people market peanut butter as a protein which is incorrect it has mostly fat now fat has the highest amount of calories per gram which means you don't need a lot of food you don't need a lot of fat in order to get a lot of calories and so a big mistake that people make is they think oh it's healthy this is gonna help me lose weight and they'll just way over eat peanut butter they'll throw they'll slather on their their celery their their apples whatever else it might be and I'll take in hundreds and hundreds of calories thinking they're gonna lose weight and they're actually doing a lot more harm than good and for those of you that are peanut butter freak fanatics which I am myself I know peanut butter is delicious and I'm not telling you not to eat this food all I want to know all I want you to know is the nature of the beast I want you to understand that it's not something that you can just eat as much of as you want and expect to lose weight you have to track it you have to fit it into your calorie budget so number two we're gonna scroll down the list is non Greek yogurt so those little containers that you see that are I don't know maybe like 50 cents each that are marketed as healthy they're not Greek yogurt are basically a bunch of sugar so I honestly I don't really know why a lot of people see this as healthy maybe it's because they're pre-portioned and they're small you know it's a small portion which means it's a low calorie sure it's got some prebiotics and probiotics in it but it's basically all sugar it's just a little cup of sugar that's all there is to it and once you eliminate the the probiotics you might as well be eating pudding you might as well eat a little cup of pudding because they have about the same amount of sugar in them unfortunately yogurt just doesn't taste as good so if you're gonna eat yogurt try and stick to Greek yogurt if you can yeah it's still gonna have some sugar in it but if you're going from replacing a junk food snack to a Greek yogurt snack that's gonna be a lot better Greek yogurt also has a ton of protein in it which is always great for muscle building promoting fat loss and you know we're replacing some of the calories with protein instead of sugar so not only does the Greek yogurt have less sugar it's got a lot of protein in it you know if you really want to cut the sugar out you can just go for plain Greek yogurt and then maybe add a little bit of some strawberries or blueberries in there and you'll get some healthy natural sugars in there from the berries right number 3 granola this one drives me nuts so I really don't know why people see this one is healthy yeah I might have you know some oats in it I might have a little bit of fiber in it but it's gonna be smothered in sugar and sure yeah okay it's got oats in it but if you eat regular steel-cut oats and compare it to granola you'll realize that the steel-cut oats taste like cardboard compared to granola that's because of the amount of sugar they put on the granola so here are some of the things you want to watch out for let's say you really have to eat granola make sure the portions are really small so let's say you take plain Greek yogurt again like we talked about earlier sprinkle some granola in there don't just eat a whole bowl of granola cereal or granola bars if you're gonna eat it in serial form you might as well take your favorite cereal like I don't know cookie crisp or Lucky Charms and eat that instead nutritionally they're very similar if you really have to eat cereal which I wouldn't recommend anyways but if you really want to go for something that's super high protein like one of those super high protein cereals like Kashi go lean I used to eat that at least you'll get some protein from it and it'll reduce the calories a bit from the sugar obviously also go for a lower calorie higher protein milk like skim milk just so you save some calories and you can use that down the line or down the road some time later in the day if you're gonna go for granola in a bar form just skip it all together and go for a protein bar it'll fill you up just as much probably if not more and you'll get a lot more protein out of it okay so number four will call loaded smoothies okay so smoothies are it's an easy way to make healthy foods more palatable easier to eat or in this case drink for example I hate the taste of kale it tastes like grass I feel like I might as well just go outside to my backyard and start backyard and start chowing down and grass like a cow but if you put kale and a bunch of other berries and stuff like that in a smoothie I can tolerate that I can eat kale so generally it's generally smoothies there they're high in micronutrients and that's one of the reasons why people see it as healthy it's also great let's say you have to eat some breakfast and you have your low end time for whatever reason and you could just throw a bunch of stuff in a blender and drink it on your commute to work so that's a solution for a lot of people for breakfast right so things that you have to watch out for now I'm not gonna say all smoothies are bad because they're not a lot of it's gonna depend on what you put into that smoothie and how much of that smoothie you actually drink so portion control and their ingredients so depending on what you put in that smoothie and how much of it you have it can be a calorie monster so for example some of the recipes out there are extremely extreme extremely high in sugar and fat sometimes it just has a ton of sugar sometimes both sugar and fat so for example people put all kinds of sweeteners in it like honey and just regular sugar they might use plain vanilla yogurt like we talked about earlier which isn't as good as Greek yogurt a lot of juices that are thrown in there are basically sugar water just a ton of sugar in there and then on top of that they'll throw in a bunch of peanut butter in it to give it a creamy consistency which again we talked about earlier calorie monster you want to watch out for that and you can easily make a 500 calorie smoothie that you just shove down in two seconds and you're hungry not too long later so let's talk about why you get hungry so quickly technically you know everyone says you should stay away from processed food so what is processed food it's it's any really anything that's been done to the food to break it down in a certain way or you could even call it predigested food so for example that blender has done the job of your teeth and your stomach to pulverize and puree that those those berries and strawberries and whatever else you put in that smoothie and so now it's gonna be processed it's easier to digest digest it'll spike your blood sugar blood sugar up higher and stuff like them so one of the recommendations I tell my clients is to always try and eat your calories instead of drinking them because it takes longer to eat the same amount of ingredients that you put into that smoothie then to just chunk that smoothie down psychologically through the process of eating and chewing and it's gonna take up more time of course you'll feel like you're taking in more food which will help you keep you full for longer and it's gonna potentially help you cut back on overeating in that one sitting or later on let's say you feel more full you're gonna have a smaller lunch or the likelihood of you having less food in the future is increased always try and eat the ingredients instead so for example let's say you take you put Greek yogurt and strawberries as your smoothies what if you just say it started off the day with a glass of water and then you ate the Greek yogurt with some strawberries on the side or you could put the strawberries in there in my opinion that would be a lot better okay number five dried fruit so I guess this is seen as healthy because it's a fruit like what what could go wrong with fruit fruits are good right well they're kind of processed so all of the moisture all of the water has been taken out of that fruit and we know water is zero calories water also gives food volume so you'll end up eating what's perceived as more food but you won't take in as many calories so water takes up a lot of space which helps you obviously stay full and it's one of the reasons why I get really sad when i saute a bag of spinach and it disappears as soon as you put it into the pan right it's just gone because the water evaporates out and it's it gone it's tribbles up and there's no more spinach almost and you're like where's my spinach so same thing goes for fruits when you dry fruits you're you're gonna get a much higher concentrated dose of the sugar that's in the fruit versus the raw fresh fruit counterpart it also you know makes it easy to over eat the sugar and the calories also takes much longer to feed a raw piece of fruit than it does to eat some dried pieces of fruit so for example if you're gonna compare a raw apple versus taking that Apple cutting it up and then drying it you could just you know eat those apple chips like it's nothing versus the pieces that one Apple it's gonna take you a lot longer to eat one of the rules of thumb that I tell my clients is to eat foods that are as close to their source as possible so as soon as you pick an apple from a tree you know you can wash it and then eat it right then and there where you can cut it up you know and you know and eat it right then there don't do a bunch of stuff to it because that's processing it right for example applesauce that's processed apple juice processed drying is the same thing it's just another form of processing so try and stay away from dried fruit okay so juices oh so we talked a little bit about processing and how you should eat your calories instead of drink them even if a juice is high in micronutrients it's organics manic not from concentrate whatever they however they make it however natural it is it it's gonna take it's gonna contain a ton of sugar almost the same amount if not more than soda so a lot of juices also contain high fructose corn syrup which is right in soda it's the same thing as soda so a lot of times you might as well drink soda so keep those keep those juice the juice intake low something weird I do I don't know if a lot of people do this but I do it as I I sometimes water my juice down so let's say I have a glass I'll put a quarter cup I'll fill it fill it up a quarter way with the juice and then fill up the rest with water so that I still get the flavor of the juice but my sugar intake is a lot lower but in general you know keep your killer keep your liquid calories as low as possible so instead of drinking apple juice have an apple with a glass of water and drinking instead of drinking orange juice have an orange with a glass of water so stuff like that is really gonna help a lot more and if you're really into juicing you're gung-ho about juicing and juices and you know how healthy they are for it for you not juicing like steroids not that kind of juicing like the fruit type of juicing you can still do it just remember it's not ideal it's not an ideal food for weight loss we're not talking about the best ways of getting a massive dose of micronutrients in this video if you can fit the juice in your calorie budget go ahead but personally I'd rather just eat a piece of fruit drink a glass of water and then save those calories for later maybe I can add on dessert to my dinner instead of having juice and then no dessert so that's a better trade-off for me number seven low quality protein bars so remember when we mentioned earlier how just because a food might have a macronutrient in it sometimes it's marketed as that thing so for example with peanut butter it's got protein in it it's it's seen as a team to some people sometimes it's true but most of the time it's not so a lot of companies they'll they'll say oh it's got protein in it it's got you know four grams it's a good source of protein four grams is not a lot of protein you can get more than that from a Snickers bar so a lot of protein bars that barely have any protein in them are labeled as a good source of protein they're not like I said you might as well eat a Snickers bar it's just a little bit more calories and it's a lot tastier if a protein bar tastes like candy it probably is it might have a marginal amount of protein in it maybe a little bit more than a candy bar but it's not really gonna make a big difference in the grand scheme of things so from my experience if a protein bar tastes like candy it probably is stay away from it protein bars they you know if they don't taste if they let's say they do have a lot of protein in them they'll know the trade-off is they don't taste that great or the texture isn't gonna be that great and plus it's gonna be more expensive so some of the things you want to watch out for number one the protein quality in the protein bar so you can go to a website like lab door comm I made a video about lab door comm earlier you could check that out I'm gonna leave a link somewhere up here but you'll see ratings of protein bars and their quality so just because a protein bar says it has a lot of protein maybe it's low calorie doesn't mean that the protein quality in it is good so first you have to get that out of the way next my general rule of thumb is you want at least 10 grams of protein per 100 calories so most protein bars are about 200 calories you should aim for that protein bar to have about 20 grams of protein some of my favorite brands are quest bars quest bars are really tasty I think they're pretty good and they're a good source of protein also they're high-quality something a little bit cheaper would be I go to Costco all the time and I get their Kirkland teen bars they're not they're not as good tasting but they either cheap and they have good quality protein in them okay lastly loaded salads so big fluffy salads are great foods for weight loss they contain both a lot of water in each individual leaf it's mostly water and fiber and a lot of air in that salad because obviously you'll make little air pockets between all the leafs leaves that are clumped together so both air and water of course have zero calories and what the air also helps do is make that salad big and fluffy and give you the perception that you're eating a lot of food which psychologically it's going to satiate you which is again one of the reasons why I get really sad when my spinach disappears as soon as I put it into the pan when i saute it it's like okay where did my food go so let's see also because it's fluffy it takes longer to eat which again is gonna help with overeating during either that particular meal or future overeating you're also gonna get higher doses of fiber micronutrients through the greens and other vegetables that you're throwing in and really I can go on and on about the health benefits of salads so what people have the ability to do is take something really good and ruin it and a lot of people do that with salads so they'll take you know a bunch of greens a bunch of tomatoes whatever else they put in it and they'll dump a gallon of ranch dressing in there some bacon and now that cell is ruined you spiked the calories up through the roof and you might as well end up eating a Big Mac with the amount of calories that that salad has so I'll give you a personal example the other night my wife and I we went to Cheesecake Factory and I sat down I was browsing through the salads menu and some of the calorie counts were crazy they were a thousand calories some of them were over a thousand calories which if you put that into perspective you we'll eat a Big Mac with a side of fries and you'll probably get a little bit less calories from that than some of the salads on that menu so just because it's a salad it doesn't mean it's a weight loss promoting sound once you start adding in high-calorie ingredients like bacon cheese ranch dressing all that all the calories just go through the roof and now it's not gonna be a good food for weight loss you know it's the same thing as taking a hundred calorie Apple and eating it with 600 calories worth of peanut butter like we talked about before same principle you just take something healthy and you you ruin it and now it's not the best food for weight loss salads are also a lot like smoothies that we talked about earlier it's sometimes it's not all about what you put in them it's how much of it do you eat so maybe you're just eating too much of a salad that has high-calorie ingredients if you eat a big salad that has low-calorie ingredients honestly have as much as you want nobody has ever gotten fat from eating plain salads with light dressing and tomatoes and cucumbers in it I like you you will not get fat from eating that I can't see how it doesn't matter how big that salad is it's it's mostly air it's mostly water it's mostly fiber you'll probably get sick of eating that huge salad before before it does anything so my recommendation is always go for a low-calorie dressing that's usually the biggest culprit so stay away from things like ranch one of the the dressings that I actually use is a Greek yogurt dressing and I find this in the stop and shop produce aisle where all the the salad salad mixes in salads arm it's it's got to be refrigerated so it's not going to be in the regular aisle but it's crazy low in calories it's I think it's only about 40 45 calories for ranch dressing which is incredible because you get a similar taste the same texture and they're like maybe a quarter of the calories so Greek yogurt dressing awesome you know if you want to use a dressing that's a little bit higher in calories just use less also try and not dump a pound of cheese into the salad you know use the cheese sparingly or don't use it at all focus on loading up the salad with vegetables instead of cheese so there you have it guys my top eight worst foods for weight loss again these are foods you can still eat hell you can even eat pizza if you want which obviously it's not the great food not the best for weight loss but you want to know the nature of the beast you want to know what you're dealing with and you want to be able to fit these foods into your calorie budget the downside about eating these high-calorie foods is that you're not gonna have a lot of calories left for anything else and you're gonna be hungry so watch out for these specific foods and try and focus on the rules that I kind of listed earlier in the video and you're gonna be more successful with weight loss until next time", "U4dlOc5lWEE": "good morning and welcome to another edition of bill johnson's cereal reviews i am your host bill johnson and today it's captain crunch's crunch mega berries snack pouches that's a mouthful 12 pouches 7 grams of sugar 110 sodium you know i have to just take these pouches and put them in a bowl which i've already done for you see and the thing that's cool about these is that the crunch berries are three times larger that's what she said i cracked myself up um three times larger really i don't know about that they're bigger that's for sure question why couldn't you just make these pieces bigger also another question why are you putting these in a pouch now the oops all berries one which i'll review eventually is bigger as well so what would he do it's just crap did i say crapton crunch it's just captain crunch with crunch berries but bigger berries put that in a bowl put that in a cereal i'm all in on that this is my 10th captain crunch review can you believe that i'd love to sit here and tell you that i'm going to copy and paste all 10 captain crunch reviews and put them down below but i'm not so let's check this out we all know that captain crunch cuts the hell out of your mouth that classic captain crunch taste it really is a classic isn't it it's a cereal that's never gonna go away quaker can milk it for all it's worth and clearly that's what they're doing so the cool thing about the larger berries is it sort of protects your the inside of your mouth from the sharp pieces it gives i don't know if i'm explaining this right but it kind of protects you from these pieces by because it takes up so much space in your mouth the crunch berries are huge i wish they were bigger though three times bigger berries is i think a misrepresentation anywho i'm gonna give this an 8.5 it's delicious i believe i gave this cereal with smaller berries an eight so that would mean that i enjoy bigger berries in my mouth look and you can see the reflection of the recording i recommend but i recommend it if they would just put it in a box and make bigger berries like subscribe comment down below put that on your spoon and eat it hi i'm bill johnson and i'm addicted to cereal", "ZVtP8_IiqQk": "I do guys welcome back here to another cereal review on my channel if you guys haven't already subscribed go ahead and show your support and hit that subscribe button my name is Jason today we're gonna be checking out the chocolatey berry crunch the new Captain Crunch limited edition two great flavors berries and chocolate how could you go wrong so we're gonna dive into this cereal and see how this one tastes and is it worth for you guys to go out and pick it up in the stores so here's a look at the back decadence if you'd like to taste the chocolate love this crunch who knows how long this chocolatey berry wicious treat will last so get your hands on a bowl of very fast so just looking at the serene facts here on the front 3/4 cups 100 calories zero saturated fat 160 milligrams of sodium and 11 grams of sugars first off gonna do the old smell test definitely smells like berries in chocolate so there's a look at it I mean you've got the berries from probably regular Captain Crunch cereal tastes exactly same I think this is gonna be a good one I've had some that weren't so good like that uh sour patch kids cereal that one wasn't very good this one looks like it should be pretty decent we know who doesn't love Captain Crunch and that is pretty good I mean it's not overwhelmingly chocolatey because you got a ton of berries in there so it just it tones down that that chocolate taste it is so it's not super chocolaty but just enough this one's really good do thumbs up on this I mean first off if you're a Captain Crunch fan you're gonna like this it still has that classic Captain Crunch taste with just a hint of chocolate not super overwhelming probably if I did a blind taste test on this I didn't know if I wouldn't know it's chocolatey I might pick it up if I had enough spoonfuls but maybe off one I probably just think it's you know Captain Crunch berry crunch or something but it's really good I'm probably gonna finish this whole bowl once I turn the camera off yeah this is definitely a winner two thumbs up really liked this one Limited Edition so it's not gonna be out for very long so I suggest getting out picking this one up while you Karen I think you're gonna enjoy it let me know in those comments below did you like it any other cereals out there I should be check it out I got a few more coming up in the next few days so keep an eye out for those like I said at the beginning of this video if you haven't already subscribed hit that subscribe button hit the bell so you notify every time I upload a video and let me go back to enjoy my bowl of cereal and I will see you guys next time [Music]", "gnu_MrHrfAA": "well so guys I've been back from my trips this week and I just been busy catching up on everything with work and my family and then I also rented the last of us so I've been trying to beat that game because i got it from redbox trying to finish it for cost me as much as the game costs so I wanted to review some products I'll start with the main meals so I picked up some of these um Hebrew National ninety-seven percent fat free beef franks i actually had these before when I wasn't dieting I thought they were terrible 20-something weeks into a diet and they're actually a lot tastier what I've been doing is putting them in like my egg white omelets macros on these are one fat to carbs and six protein and they're a great substitute if you just want to have a hot dog because you haven't had one in forever if you're not on a diet you probably won't like them but uh but I think they're worth it they're kind of small that's the only problem so like eating them in a hot dog bun by themselves is a little weird okay oh yeah i forgot one thing all right sorry about that what I forgot okay so I got this from target and like I said they were by now this i got from trader joes i was recommended by timothy and wickedly you can check out his YouTube channel as well it's turkey bacon but the macros on it are better than any that I've seen on any turkey bacon on the market and it still tastes like bacon it still tastes good so the macros on this as you can see is one and a half 0 and six per slice I mean that's crazy low fat so I definitely recommend trying these in fact this and the hot dog together are great pair um I post this on Instagram the other day some panera bread loaf at soup the other one was the chicken tortilla I haven't yet tried the chicken noodle but I picked it up today because again the macros were great and it was on sales like 350 for the pound which is still kind of expensive but for a restaurant brand soup it's not bad so there's two servings in here it's only two and a half that 15 carbs and 14 protein with two grams of fiber so I mean I'll probably just eat the whole thing myself and maybe add a little tortilla strips or wonton strips of something to give us some crunch all right moving on to some snacks fiber one chocolate peanut butter bar 90 calorie I had one today I do not recommend these they taste stale like even though they were fresh out of the package they just didn't taste that good I picked up the chocolate caramel and pretzel as well actually was by accident cuz I didn't nose in my car I haven't tried them yet so I'll let you know in another video this is a new flavor cinnamon coffee cake these are the little cakes the macros are the same on all of these like they're all about 318 and in less than one with five grams of fiber each for all the cakes so there's a chocolate fudge which is you know a brownie one that's been around forever everybody seems to like that one it's pretty good there's a new one which is a chocolate chip cookie it's decent but I think this is the best one I've had so far cinnamon coffee cake and I'm not a big fan of coffee but it does cinnamon it just really tastes good so definitely recommend this this is actually I haven't opened this is my second box while I was in Vegas I picked up one of these pop tarts gone nutty this is the peanut butter on peanut butter one and it was delicious like it tastes great but I can't justify six grams of fat and 37 grams for 1 popped are so I mean there's two in here so that's like twelve and seventy I mean it's crazy you know I just don't think it's worth it but uh delicious like offseason and you need to add extra carbs and you don't have a lot of time or patience or whatever definitely definitely would be worth it but even on a refeed day like I can't waste 12 grams of fat on to pastries so personally I will pass but yeah it really does taste good it's great now these these are delicious smart ones you get there basically keep them in the freezer I found this at target in the freezer aisle not near the other smart ones they're like kind of hidden in a different place they're counting near the vitae tops so uh chocolate chip cookie dough sunday just tastes so good it's only three grams of fat 26 grams of carbs and think like programs of protein it even has a no it doesn't have any fiber but you put them in the microwave for like five to six seconds and then pop it out and eat it and it's just amazing the other flavor that they have was just as good I really don't know which one is better because they both were delicious and now it's a raspberry cheesecake so chocolate chip cookie dough and raspberry cheesecake both hi I recommend both of them highly this I saw today and I had to try it so I gotta go there adoni asst Greek frozen yogurt this is flavor is a blood orange swirl of vanilla and it's 0 grams of fat 22 carbs and eight protein I had half a serving which was a decent amount one serving is 102 grams so you get in a pretty good amount of volume 100 2 grams of basically ice cream for only 22 grams of carbs and eight grams protein I recommend it I would say when you eat it do like you do when you have let's go Arctic zero leave it out for like five minutes so it can get soft and then eat it but i definitely recommend it oh yeah and then for father's day my wife bought me a waffle maker this is a black and decker I think she got it at target I would also know where'd you get it Oh Macey will they have them at target I think it's awesome I think everyone should get one as soon as I perfect a good low fat high protein recipe then I'll let you guys know make a video my next cooking video is going to be on french toast which is just the easiest thing in the world to make but some of you might not know about it so that's it this time guys I hope that you enjoyed this product review let me know if you have any questions or this anything that you've been wanting to try but you don't want to take a chance I'll try it trying to fit so alright guys remember to comment like subscribe and cue the outro", "HAaUlk-n3eM": "hey everyone so i just got back from gelson's and i took a look and chose 14 different styles of protein bars here back here this is whole foods but i went to galson's but i think whole foods galsons and probably sprouts have the in my opinion the best variety of different brands and a huge selection of different types of bars so if you have one of those three markets in your neighborhood definitely check them out trader joe's has a very small selection so galson's whole foods and sprouts markets have the best selection but you can also buy them like at costco target walmart and places like that or online as well so the goal for today was to go to this uh go to galson's and i have you know one or two maybe three protein bars that i typically rotate in and out of my diet and just keeping these on handy but i also get bored of certain tastes certain flavors certain brands so i thought you know what there's a wide selection i'm gonna grab a few that i know that i do enjoy and then i grab some bars that i've never even tried or never even heard of some of these some of these brands and just kind of take a look at what are the differences between these protein bars because a lot of my clients a lot of my athletes i have a lot of high school athletes and just parents that are always on the go and they're always trying to figure out how do i choose the right protein bar and it's hard for me to give a specific answer because one of the most important parts when it comes to these bars is what i like and what the taste and texture that i like you might not like so it's really difficult to give you a specific answer of hey this bar is is has great macros and you're gonna love the taste because you might not you might actually think all right it has good ingredients good macros whatever it is but you actually think it tastes disgusting right and this is why i chose so many of these because you got to go out and do your own reviews you might want to put some you know some basic guidelines like i want something that maybe has no more than 350 calories it's a little bit lower on the sugar side or if you're an athlete maybe higher on the carbohydrate side um you want something that has 15 to 20 grams of protein and you want to kind of hit these guidelines or have these these guy lines in place and then go and choose different brands that are very similar to what you're looking for try different flavors because even brands there's certain brands that i hate a certain flavor and i love a different type of flavor and they both have the same macros so i think it's important to even try out different flavors right if you're a chocolate person one brand you might not like the type of chocolate they use and you might like their strawberry or whatever it may be so you've got to go out and pick out i mean they're only like a dollar fifty two bucks a lot of these places have them on sales for like two for one or if you buy five you save a good amount of money so go on try different bars and when you find one one or two that you enjoy buy a few of those keep them in your backpack keep them in your drawer keep them in your bag in your car so when you have when you start to feel really hungry you have a bar that holds you over into your next meals so those are some basic guidelines of going out and doing your own research so i'm going to show you these bars we're going to take a look at how many calories they have what are the macros uh take a peek at the ingredients list and then i'm going to open them up try them give my opinion on them and then we'll take it from there so we got 14 bars to go we'll see how this goes okay so before i start the review of these bars some of the key things that as a consumer you want to be mindful of and have some awareness when you're going to choose a protein bar okay the very first thing i'll typically look at because some of these bars can be pretty big and you would assume that this is one serving but first thing you got to do is look at the serving size some of these bars the ones that i that i picked up today i think they're all one serving but i've seen some of these big protein bars that people eat not knowing that that's actually uh two servings for that entire package so you got to make sure if you're going to have a bar and you're going to use those calories and the macros that you're using them for one serving so the very first thing just you know if it's not a huge bar typically it's going to be for one one serving size but you also want to just be mindful of some of these bars are pretty heavy and those calories that's listed is for each serving so if you eat the whole thing and it's two serving you may think you're eating 350 calories but yet now you're consuming 700 calories so check your calories i'm sorry check your serving size make sure it's for one or if if it's for two then eat half of it now and then save the rest for later second thing is typically the calories right so you want to make sure that uh if you're using a protein bar as a snack kind of a bridge in between your meals that you're not going to get a protein bar that's super super dense in calories right unless you're trying to maybe bulk or if you're trying to increase your calories and maybe that's the case but we're going to kind of our context is going to be more kind of weight management getting leaner that you're just trying to find a bar that's going to hold you over so typically calorie wise i'm looking at you know something that has 250 to about 350 400 calories again this is a serving size one serving size that's going to hopefully hold you over into your next meal so a lot of these bars that i got are in that range uh most of the bars that i'm eating are about 300 to 350 calories which uh pretty much uh gets my hunger pains to go away and it holds me off until my next meal okay so we got serving size uh the amount of calories and you're gonna based off of what your goals are you gotta figure out what uh how those calories factor into your uh your your diet and your your your macros so third thing again we're looking to get a protein bar in this specific case then we're going to look at the protein so you got to be careful because some of these bars might say they're protein bars but their protein amount and the protein quantity is super low you might have a blood as five grams of protein and in my case that's not considered high protein or is a protein bar even though it has protein so typically what we're looking for i'm looking in the range of anywhere from 15 grams to about 30 35 grams of protein and that number uh ideally we want to be above 20 to 25 would be ideal because the research supports that if you're getting a complete animal i'm sorry yeah an animal source protein or soy protein because it is a complete protein but if you're getting all the essential amino acids in the form of a complete protein that about 20 to 25 grams uh stimulates muscle protein synthesis so if you're trying to try to you know maintain uh protein synthesis throughout the day especially if you're an athlete then you want to get to about that 20 to 25 grams of protein that's coming from an animal source so like a milk based protein if you're doing more of a plant-based protein you will need some higher amounts of protein to get to uh the the muscle protein synthesis that you would get from lower amounts via like a whey protein okay so keep that in mind but again you might also consume something with this protein so you might have a protein bar and have you know some cottage cheese so that will easily put you in that 30 to 35 grams of protein even if the bar only has maybe 15 grams so typically again i'm shooting for about 15 to about 30 grams of protein for myself and typically what i would recommend if the bar is a little bit on the lower side you can always combine and have a uh some type of food along with it to bump up that protein amount for that sitting now next we move on to like fats and carbohydrates and looking at sugars and things like that now these are going to be very uh it's hard to give a specific recommendation and the reason being is because it there to give a recommendation you need more information you need more uh more context so let's just say if an athlete's looking for a protein bar something that maybe you know he's he's gonna eat before going off to practice let's say then you're going to want some more carbohydrates even some sugar is going to be okay because they're going to go into that practice they're going to do some high intensity bouts of exercise so in that context that athlete might need something lower in fat right you don't want something super high in fat because then it's going to have to digest and and it might give you some issues while you're exercising so something lower um and fat and it might slow down uh your the carbohydrates getting into your body and being able to use it as fuel so something lower in fat higher in carbohydrates moderate in protein might might serve a purpose for an athlete that's going to eat this bar before heading off to practice now if you're just someone maybe sitting and you're at a desk you you have a few hours before your next meal then you might need something lower in carbohydrates and it's not to say that carbs are evil or they're bad um it's just you're not going to need that that source of carbohydrates because you're going to be sitting most of the time so you might just need something a little lower in calories a little higher in protein because we know that protein is satiating meaning it can keep you fuller it can take away your appetite and hold you over into your next meal so those are different cases so that's why it's hard to give a specific recommendation but for most people that uh that have been asking about protein bars they want something lower in sugar um because they're looking to control their weight so they want to try to you know eliminate unnecessary sugars in their diets so that's another thing that we can look at and lastly kind of what i typically look at is the ingredients list so check out the ingredients some people might want something that that has very minimal amounts of ingredients some other people might not care some people might not want uh certain things in their in their bars so they might want to have no nuts because they have they're allergic to peanuts and things like that so those are things that i don't typically look look for because i don't have any allergens but you might want to take a look at the ingredients list but what i'm looking for with the ingredients has to do with the quality of the ingredients i'm looking at what type where where's the protein coming from for me i like a whey based protein so i'm looking for that first ingredient to not say you know soy or pea i'm looking more from my whey protein source now if you're vegan then you're going to be completely opposite you're looking for something that is plant-based a soy protein is a complete protein or you might look into like a hemp protein a pea protein and other other types of plant-based proteins that serve your needs right as far as the list goes so ideally yeah you want you know try to have a bar that doesn't have tons of ingredients um and you're looking you can see through the bars and i'm going to review some of them have a really short list some of them have a longer list and again i'm not here to tell you that just because it has a long list that it's harmful that i don't buy into the fact that if you can't pronounce something that it's bad for you that's just not the case but if you're someone who's looking for minimal you know process or minimal ingredients then yeah you're gonna have to look at the ingredients and you know look for something that has maybe five or so ingredients and choose that one for yourself so again to each their own i'm not here to demonize any type of diet or philosophy or way of thinking i'm just going to give some my opinions and some guidelines into what i'm looking for so those are the things i'm looking for i'm looking for serving size i'm looking for how many calories it has i'm looking for the amount of protein i'm looking for carbs and fat and sugar they're the balance of those macros and then the ingredients less and lastly i'll throw it out there but some bars if you're an athlete you might be looking for something that has what's called the informed choice seal where it's been tested to see if it has any traces of banned substances and things like that so if you're a professional athlete and you get drug tested you don't want to make mistakes of taking some bars they might not have something that they might have something that you're not supposed to be taking and you're going to get in trouble for so i think one or one one or two bars of these has that informed choice which i'll show you all right so now let's get to the fun part for you to watch me eat all these taste all these protein bars and i promise you i'm not wasting these protein bars i'm going to open them up try them and then i'm going to seal them up in a ziploc bag and i'll have them down the road so they're not just going in the garbage all right so let's go to these protein bars okay first bar that i'm gonna try this is a new bar for me okay see if you can see it it's called grenade carb killer high protein bar okay this is one that i've never seen when i was there i was uh i was looking at all the bars and this is one that i've never seen before so it's a grenade car killer this is the chocolate chip cookie dough so the very first thing we're gonna look at like actually what we talked about what i talked about earlier if you see that that little seal [Music] that's hard to see right there okay that seal right there okay it's called the informed choice uh uh seal of approval meaning that this company or this this this type of bar has been tested and it's free of banned substances so if you're an athlete that's a professional athlete and you're going to get tested that's something you might want to look into okay the first thing that we talked about is it's one serving which is 60 grams it has uh 220 calories so the entire bar is 220 calories 20 grams of protein 9 grams of fat 24 grams of carbohydrates 7 grams of sugar i'm sorry two grams of sugar seven grams of fiber okay and again are we gonna talk about but fiber is always a good thing you don't need something that's super high in fiber but having a little fiber in a bar uh could be pretty good um so now let's look at the ingredients list so the very first ingredient is chocolate whole milk and it seems like the protein blend is from milk protein isolate and whey protein isolate okay so this is coming from a whey protein source so let's give this bar a try so this is kind of the consistency um it's actually pretty good the initial bite it's kind of chewy not at all like tough to to chew and it's actually pretty good i can definitely taste the uh i'm not a big cookie dough person but you can definitely taste that cookie dough in there and it doesn't have like a nasty kind of aftertaste sometimes you might get like a chalky aftertaste from a protein bar but i'm going to give this a pretty good good review so this is actually pretty tasty i can definitely see myself eating one of these bars in between meals or when i'm when i want something a little sweet a little snack um so yeah grenade carb killer okay really tough to see there it is um i would say taste is pretty good macros are pretty good only has two grams of sugar it does have 14 grams of sugar alcohol so if you're someone who knows that some some people have trouble with uh with their stomach with sugar alcohols i've never experienced that but i know some people that do so if you're someone that doesn't do well with sugar alcohols this one does have 14 grams so be careful with that but if you don't have any kind of issues with it then this might be a pretty good bar they're calories you got 20 grams of protein which is nice and uh that's a good balance of fat and carbohydrates okay okay next protein bar we have the think bar okay tough to get in focus so think bar let's i've had these before but i don't think i've tried the chunky chunky chocolate peanut so again first thing we're looking for is a pretty small bar so it's one bar which is 40 grams total it's 150 calories it's got 10 grams of protein so a little bit on the lower side 5 grams of fat 20 grams of carbohydrate 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of sugar and 4 grams of the added sugars onto it so and then lastly let's look at the ingredients list so this is a protein blend so they're getting the protein that's coming from this bar is a soy protein isolate a whey protein isolate so you have kind of a combo of soy and whey and a lot of bars do that as well so uh but again if you're going uh if you're looking for something vegan this is not gonna be uh this is not gonna be something you're gonna you're gonna want to choose from because it does have whey protein in it but if you're kind of uh and it has uh peanut and uh and soy so just it gives you and also another thing you can read is that like if you're again allergic or intolerant to certain things they're always lace like or they're always less that it contains for instance it contains milk peanut and soy so take a look at that if you do have some some issues with certain ingredients okay so pretty small bar i think this would be perfect to keep in like in your bag and your purse and your backpack super convenient so now let's try this bar okay so this is kind of the consistency so this is it's a little gummier when i say gummy that means like it takes a while to chew and break down with your teeth before you can swallow so this one it's not bad i don't it does have for me it has a little aftertaste something it doesn't really taste like peanut it has a different type of taste to it so uh not bad but the big thing something to think about it has 10 grams of protein so let's just say you want to get your 20 to 25 grams of protein you might want to combine this with something so you can have this and maybe some cottage cheese a greek yogurt some beef jerky other sources of another food that you're going to get you know 10 to 15 grams of protein so if you combine those you're getting about 25 to 30 grams of protein doesn't mean you have to do it but if you're looking to kind of uh to build some muscle and then if you're an athlete you want to be getting it again every three to four hours about 20 to 25 grams of protein if you're coming from a complete protein then you want to want to eat this and something along alongside of it to get to that higher amount of protein all right so this is the think bar uh not bad i think uh just a taste for me wasn't uh wasn't my thing so these are the bars right here uh again there's look how many flavors there are there's a lot of flavors even down here oh no this way even down there so there's a lot of flavors so maybe for me i wouldn't say like i'm not gonna eat this more ever but i might try a different flavor this is the chunky chocolate peanut i might try something that doesn't have peanut but it didn't taste like peanut to me all right so here we go okay so the next bar this is one of my favorites okay let's see if you can see that this is the power crunch bar and i haven't tried this flavor this is the red velvet it's a little tough so this is the red velvet i just saw this for the first time so i remember eating these a while back when i used to work at a gym and these are the reason i like these because if you drink coffee this is like a wafer texture and if you drink coffee or any warm beverage it is the best thing especially with coffee is to have one of these with your coffee it's just it's so good it almost seems like um it's too much of a treat so this is the power crunch bar so let's look at some of the again this is the red velvet they do have a lot of flavors too so first thing it's one serving size which is 40 grams 215 calories 12 grams of protein 13 grams of fat okay so a little higher on the on the fat uh fat side 13 grams of carbs so relatively low one gram of fiber and only eight grams of sugar and uh let's see and then the ingredients so here we're getting protein from uh a protein blend so we're getting from uh hydrolyzed whey protein whey protein isolate and milk protein isolate so it looks like everything's coming from a milk based uh protein okay so if you're a vegan probably not gonna work but if uh if you have no issue with uh with milk then you're good so it does contain milk wheat and soy from uh in the product okay so again this is one of my favorite especially if you're a coffee drinker uh so the macros look pretty good again it's a little higher on the fat side 13 grams compared to the other some other bars but uh only 215 calories so it's a kilo snack 12 grams of protein so again you might want to maybe combine this with maybe uh a greek yogurt or some cottage cheese and that way you can bump up the the total amount of protein okay so now dropped it okay so now let's open this thing and this is one of my favorites haven't tried uh red velvet yet so i'm going to show you it's a little tough when i bite it's probably going to fall apart but this is what it looks like it's like though it's like a wafer it's really brittle okay and again that's why it tastes so good with coffee because it like just you can even dunk it in your coffee and it's one of those things like as a kid you had those wafers that you would put in your uh and your uh and your hot drink whatever you're drinking it would just kind of like crumble a little bit it was good so let's try this red velvet i would i would say it's good as far as red velvet i don't really taste it in there it tastes more like just vanilla which is still good but not a lot of rare velvet in here that i could taste um the thing with this bar though it does the the cream on the outside tends to stick kind of to the roof of your tongue and a little bit on your teeth so other than that it's delicious it's a good little snack to hold you over i'll be in this after uh after shooting this video with some coughing and uh yeah so it's a good i i would say uh taste wise it's good just again red velvet probably uh doesn't taste like vanilla to me but they do also have a lot of different uh different flavors so 12 grams of protein not bad again maybe combine that with uh maybe if you have a glass of milk with it that might give you another 10 grams so that would put you at about 22 grams of protein which would be pretty nice you can maybe have that for breakfast so i would say power crunch definitely a good option if you're looking for something low in calories and uh again only 8 grams of sugar so that's not bad only one gram of fiber so that's not uh that's not too high either but it's not a big deal so low carb 13 grams of carbs and a decent amount of protein just a little higher on the fat so this is your power crunch bar okay next bar so this is another new one that i never i i just came across for the first time that's always tough to get the focus it's called clean there you go come ready nutrition clean so this is the chocolate peanut butter first time i've ever seen this first time definitely trying this uh it's a simple ingredients to fuel your life okay so this one is non-gmo has flax seeds and gluten free okay so now let's look at serving size 1 bar 52 grams it has 200 calories 15 grams of protein 7 grams of fat 23 grams of carbohydrates 7 grams of fiber and 10 grams of sugar now let's look at ingredients so this is a soy protein crisp so it's coming from soy protein isolate okay um yeah so it looks like this is coming the protein from this bar is coming from soy so if you're uh looking for a plant-based protein this might be an option soy typically only uh animal based proteins are complete proteins however soy is one and is the only plant-based protein that does have a complete amino acid profile so that's a that's always a plus uh but again some people don't do well with soy as well so if uh your body doesn't do too good more specifically for your stomach it doesn't do good with soy make sure you uh you look for that ingredient okay let's see what else this says uh again it's gluten free and i think that's pretty much it so it's called clean seven grams of fiber not bad 15 grams of protein not bad so let's try it okay so this is what it looks like so it's got chocolate on one side a little bit like a rice krispie treat type of texture okay let's try it it's not bad that rice crispy is pretty sweet like this bar right away it has how many that's 10 grams of sugar but it tastes super sweet like it tastes like it would have way more sugar it almost is compared comparable to like a rice krispie treat where you would think it's just packed with sugar it only has 10 grams decent amount of fiber so somehow they made this bar taste pretty sweet this is the chocolate peanut butter i would say i like the texture but for me personally i think it's just it tastes too sweet the chocolate's pretty good it's a good balance but it just hit me with too much sweetness if that makes sense and that's just my preferable my uh my my palate i don't like especially in a i'm not a big chocolate person to start with but my palate just doesn't i'm not a big sweet kind of guy i'm more of a salty so this might be a little too sweet for me but if you like something that's a little sweeter let's see if i can get that so come ready and it's called clean okay i'm sorry the lighting's not the greatest right here so i would say if you're it's actually the macros look pretty good it's coming from soy so if you're a plant-based looking for a plant-based uh protein this might be a good option and uh the macros look pretty decent 15 grams of protein you combine that with a little you know some beef jerky or again cottage cheese or some yogurt you're getting up in the 25 to 30 grams of protein but overall not bad just a little too sweet for me okay next bar this is a pretty popular bar with a lot of people it's called the rx rx bar okay and the reason it's super popular in my opinion is because they they're marketing and again not just marketing it's actually true but the way that they market the bar that it has very minimal ingredients literally it has this entire bar it says it has three egg whites three walnuts six cashews and two dates and no bs so it became popular because of the ingredients less it's very very minimal and so if you're looking for a bar that doesn't have a lot of ingredients this might be a good option for you now this is the banana chocolate walnut so let's look at the macros so this entire thing is one serving and that's 52 grams it has 210 calories 12 grams of protein 9 grams of fat 25 grams of carbs 3 grams of fiber 17 grams of sugar and let's see the ingredients i can already actually read those off but it does contain egg cashews and walnuts so if any of those don't do well with you probably not going to fit this into your uh your your nutrition but if you're looking for something that doesn't have a lot of ingredients i've never tried one of these but i know this is a popular bar uh because of those very short lists of ingredients so let's give this one a shot this is the texture okay pretty thin or actually pretty yeah pretty thin but you can just towel wrap the bat like this this just looks to me like something that was homemade like it just seems like something that if i was gonna make a protein bar it might look like this and it smells really good it has a cinnamon cinnamon banana nut smell this actually smells really good so let's try it okay first impression that is pretty dang good i'm a big cinnamon guy i like cinnamon and pumpkin type of spice and this has cinnamon in it so i so even though it says this that's what it has in it here's the entire ingredient list i should have read that out it has dates which i love egg whites cashews walnuts bananas chocolate cinnamon and natural flavors okay so that's a complete list of ingredients as opposed to just kind of basically these are the main ingredients um it tastes good i love the cinnamon i love the kind of pumpkin spice type of taste it smells good and again the very first thing like even the texture seems like something that i could make at my house with very minimal ingredients so i'm going to give this one this is my first time trying this branded bar and definitely going to try this by buy more of these but this would be something i would love to take like on a hike when i'm doing my trail runs or maybe not just maybe on a hike it has nine grams of fat so i probably wouldn't wouldn't do that but something that i'm gonna be out and about uh but i would definitely buy more of these so i'm i'm digging the rx bar but i also also think that i could probably make this at home since it has very little ingredients i would think that i could probably make my own version at home so maybe i'll try that i'm actually going to look at the ingredient list ingredients less and see if i can make my own but as far as macros taste texture i would say this is a pretty solid bar okay okay now we got this one's called the one one bar that's a big donut one okay this is the maple glaze donut so this one looks pretty appealing good packaging nice big donut in the front so let's look at the ingredients so this is one bar which is 16 grams 220 calories it has 20 grams of protein 8 grams of fat 23 grams of carbs 10 grams of fiber and only one gram of sugar and then the ingredients this is coming from a protein blend of whey protein isolate and milk protein isolate so we're getting protein from a waste source not a lot of ingredients not useless uh let's see it contains milk and soy so it's certified gluten free so again this one just kind of filling it seems pretty like rugged it seems pretty tough so my first impression this is gonna might be a little tough to chew but i haven't tried it yet so this is the one bar let's try it packaging is nice it has a pretty pretty strong aroma smells like a like a donut shot okay so this is the texture that's a little tough okay [Music] so it has a pretty strong let's see how this tastes so at first it's pretty tough but when you bite into it it's not tough at all okay not bad me again going going back to just my preference probably too sweet for me as a again how many grams of sugar only has one gram of sugar and it has five grams of sugar alcohol but again the glaze just overwhelms me my palate they just taste too sweet for me again if you're someone who likes that then this might be a good bar for you but just a little too sweet for me not bad the texture wise not not too bad of an aftertaste but just a little too sweet for me but again only has one when i say one gram of sugar and five grams of sugar alcohol so it doesn't have that much sugar so whatever they're putting in here it makes it pretty dang sweet so this is the one bar okay next bar we got this is a pretty popular bar the cliff barn okay this is uh this is kind of like my go-to when i go on hikes long hikes and uh and we're this you know i'm out there for eight hours or so and every two hours i'm trying to snack on something i usually go with the clif bar so this is the chocolate brownie it has one serving size which is 68 grams 250 calories 9 grams of protein 5 grams of fat 44 grams of carbs 4 grams of fiber 21 grams of sugar and ingredient wise you're going he's got organic rolled rolled oats soy protein isolate okay so you're getting your protein from a soy source soy protein [Music] uh let's see what else and that's pretty much it so again these have been around for a while you can tell the difference is it only has nine grams of protein so i wouldn't and again it doesn't claim to be a protein bar but i just i chose this one because i think a lot of people recognize the brand so nine grams of protein is on the lighter side so i would consider this not so much a protein bar because and it's a little higher on the carbs so it has 44 grams of carbohydrates 21 grams of sugar so again this is something it only has 250 calories but the macros are are cha have changed to this is going to be something that's going to give you some energy it's going to if you're out on a long hike this would be something you definitely want you want carbohydrates you want some sugar because you're going to be active you're going to be moving so if you're looking for something like that i would say um this would be a good choice but if you're looking for a protein bar the clif bar maybe not uh maybe not ideal okay so i'm actually um let's first i just might as well open them i wasn't gonna open because i've i've tried these before but i think that i'd give you guys uh so i'm gonna have to dean get some scores because i'm trying to open it correctly like on all the bars and it was a little tough so the texture wise probably doesn't look that i don't know it looks pretty interesting but taste-wise is good i have had these before these are good it has like a more of a dark chocolate taste again i don't like them too sweet this is why i like this bar even though it has a decent amount of sugar you know not just a higher amount of sugar than other bars it's not over overpowering me with that sweetness of some other bars so i always like this bar so i again lower in protein so not so much a protein bar option in my opinion but if you're going to be if you're like a high school athlete you want to have something an hour an hour or two before practice this might be a good bar to choose from okay or if you're a avid hiker you're outdoors person this might be these are good bars because they have a good amount of carbohydrates and just an overall good balance of macros [Music] okay next bar this is personally one of my favorites it is the promax protein bar okay i love this flavor it's a nutty butter crisp it has one bar is 75 grams so a bigger bar 300 calories 20 grams of protein that has 9 grams of fat 38 grams of carbs 1 gram of fiber and 27 grams of sugar okay so this is one of those bars where it's hitting that 300 calorie mark it has a good amount of protein but also has 27 grams of sugar a little higher on the carbs so again you have to be careful because if you're looking to kind of cut out some sugars or if you're doing some type of low carb kind of diet these taste really good but they're a little higher on the carbohydrates and sugar side so if you're very active you're you're going to go work out or something this might be a good bar but uh just got to be aware that's all i'm saying it's not saying that one thing is horrible one is uh is bad for you just you got to be aware and you got to know what your goals are and where these macros fit okay as far as the ingredients protein blend is from soy protein and whey protein concentrate soy protein isolate and whey protein concentrate so it's a mixture of both plant and animal based uh protein and let's see it's got peanuts it's definitely got some sugar in it so um again bigger a little heavier a little bigger bar than than some of the others it's got the 20 grams of protein but a little higher on the sugar uh sugar side gum so this one the taste is really good this one you can tell like for me like i'm not a sweet person but you can definitely tell that uh that this one has some sugar in it so this is a good bar it tastes really good but this would be something i would take like on a on a hike or a trail because uh it does have the the higher amounts of carbohydrates but overall pro max bar okay next bar this one has been around for a while it is made by cliff it's called the builders protein bar so as with the other clif bar it was lower in protein i think only had nine grams of protein this one i guess cliff made it specifically to be a protein bar because this one has 20 grams of protein so this is the chocolate flavored size is one bar which is 68 grams 280 calories 20 grams of protein 9 grams of fat 31 grams of carbs 3 grams of fiber uh 17 grams of sugar and 20 grams of protein as we said and then the ingredients is coming from soy protein isolate and i think yeah so everything's coming from soy i don't see any whey protein or anything like that it does contain milk it does contain milk but it seems like the actual protein is coming from a soy protein isolate again you can tell this is a pretty thick bar yeah as far as so higher again it's got 17 grams of sugar [Music] 31 grams of carbs almost 300 calories so again bigger bar i don't think i've ever tried this this variety um but let's see what it tastes like you can tell this is a dense bar it's got some uh this is what it looks like pretty thick okay like to me this one tastes like a like an old school protein bar it's thicker it's very chocolatey it's not the word definitely has some nuts in it but this is like this reminds me of like the old school metrics style protein bars um yeah i mean it has a little bit of an aftertaste i for me not a big fan of this one but it does have like a you know you're getting a protein bar okay this is the easiest way i can describe it with the the cliff boulders builders protein bar it's kind of like an old school style protein bar um not a b i i probably wouldn't get them but some of you might like it so that's the cliff builders protein okay okay next bar this is the new go slim it's the brownie crunch nope focus is not the greatest one okay so pretty small bar let's see here so one bar 45 grams one serving 190 calories so pretty low in calories 16 grams of protein 6 grams of fat 19 grams of carbs 7 grams of fiber and two grams of sugar okay ingredients is a protein mix soy crisp so it's a soy protein and a whey protein isolate you got also rice protein so it's a combination of both plant-based and a weigh-base uh protein bar so super low in sugar 2 grams pretty relatively low in calories and it's 16 grams of protein not bad so this is the nugo slim brownie crunch bar i'm always trying to open all the bars the same way because i'm gonna save them for later okay so here's the bar so pretty small pretty thin [Music] yeah it definitely has like a dark a dark chocolate taste which i love dark chocolate so at first it wasn't that good and then the dark chocolate kicked in it actually tastes pretty decent a little chewy not bad this is a good if you like dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate where it's not too sweet it's more of a kind of tart kind of a tart tarty taste that's not bad so i guess this would be something where i like maybe at night time if i'm craving something i can see myself going to so i might have a few of these on hand but i don't think this would be like my go-to protein bar but it's not bad if you're a dark chocolate fan i would say this one try it because i think you might like it so not bad this is the new go slim brownie crunch okay so not bad small enough to keep pretty portable it's got 16 grams of protein only uh got seven grams of fiber only 190 calories so not bad if you're looking for a little mini snack in between your meals okay okay so now we got the zone perfect nutrition bar the fudge gram okay all right hopefully you can see that um so one bar one serving size is 50 grams 210 calories uh 14 grams of protein 7 grams of fat 23 grams of carbs 3 grams of fiber 15 grams of sugar okay let's so this one has a pretty lengthy ingredient list um it's i don't know if it's gonna be if you're gonna see it so that's the green list all this so pretty lengthy right so it does have a lot of stuff in it it's coming from soy protein nuggets so which is isolated soy protein [Music] it does have whey powder so it doesn't seems like it's a combination of whey a little bit away and but mainly it's gonna be soy protein uh let's see so this is a popular well i don't know if it's still power but the zone diet was really really popular uh years back with a lot of people and they made these bars that would fit into their kind of nutrition zone or whatever however they they called it so i think this well this brand has been around for a while again it's a little thick a little heavy but for how many calories does this have only 210 calories so not bad so let's give it a taste the zone and kind of the atkins diet all those diets that came around super popular i believe in the maybe late 90s early 2000s so this is the bar kind of thick the initial taste wasn't too bad and then that aftertaste just took over and it just it tasted really sour yeah i'm not a fan of these again this is one of those bars where it's kind of like the old school protein bar it has a yeah the aftertaste is not the business at first it's like this is gonna be a pretty tasty bar and then that aftertaste comes on and uh so i'm not a this is definitely not a phantom i'm not a fan of the zone perfect bar i don't think it's perfect um some other people might like it so again it's one of those things try it this is the fudge graham that aftertaste just took over okay this has recently been one of my favorite bars um i don't know if i would clarify or classify as a necessary protein bar but just this has been one of my go-to's um so when i go and uh do my heights i always have one in my backpack this is uh and i reason one of the reasons i like is they have a lot of flavors but also the story behind the company this is a really like mom and pop type of company uh type of bar uh so if you have a chance look go look at their kind of story behind the go macro bar kind of cool but uh this has slowly become one of my favorites so this is the go macro bar can you see that okay so let's see here one bar is uh 65 grams one serving 280 calories 12 grams of fat 35 grams of carbs 3 grams of fiber 12 grams of sugar and 11 grams of protein okay so this is coming from let's see where is it organic protein blend of organic sprouted brown rice protein and pea protein so this one if you can see has a lot of labels here so it is certified vegan certified gluten-free non-gmo verified so it has all if you're uh if you're looking for all those things this is kind of like one of those bars not a lot of super a lot of ingredients so pretty minimal i'm again 11 grams of protein so you might want to combine this with a small another source of protein typically i like to eat this and then i'll have one or two like hard boiled eggs in the morning and i'll take them on to my drive so but i love that they have the ingredients are really good i mean the green the the the flavors are really good they have a lot of flavors i love there's one like the cherry one is from my favorite but this one is the banana and almond butter uh pretty but you can tell like it's not stiff it's it feels like like they were like made in small batches uh but this is becoming one of my favorite not just it's not a protein bar for me it's just like a snack bar that's the best way i would describe it so you can tell right off the bat if you can see it on camera it's kind of like this is something that i could see that i can make at home and my bar would look like right it's one of those things where i can see i'm going to try to make some of these and it might look just like this this is the banana you can taste the banana banana and almond butter i think it might have some cinnamon in it this is good i've never tried this um this flavor before oh this is tasty i might even put this like in the microwave for like eight seconds but this one's good i'm a big fan of the go macro bar and i'm a pretty big fan now of the banana and almond butter so definitely one of my favorites i typically would have this with again one or two hard-boiled eggs bump up the protein content because it's coming from plant-based protein so again you're gonna need a little higher amount in order for you to achieve that uh that constant state of muscle protein said this is throughout the day but again if you're just looking for a snack you're not too concerned with that then this would definitely be a good little option the go macro bar okay next up this is probably the most popular bar in the past 10 years or so or maybe even a little less than that i don't know when they came out but um this bar everyone knows about it's uh it's been around for some time a little bit of time not too like not like the old school bars but once they once they became popular everyone was buying them kind of in the fitness industry and again it's not just marketing like they're actually really tasty bars in my opinion some people don't like them because they are a little a little tough i love them but they're the quest bars double chocolate chunk these uh i'm sure if you're watching this you probably have heard of quest before i love the the whole uh the whole story behind the brand if you know uh tom baillou his uh he's like the head guy at quest um i love his mindset his uh his perspective on everything so i'm a big fan of the quest bar and uh trick is if you put this bad boy in the microwave for about i think it's like seven seconds you don't want to go too high or too long or too short about six or seven seconds so that's all you need this thing melts and it tastes really good okay but again some people don't like the the texture of this i personally do i think they're delicious this is one of my favorite uh flavors so let's try these so from the outside they do seem a little like tough a little uh they're not super soft oh i didn't even go did i go over the the macros maybe i didn't go over the macros hold on my fault so before i taste it let me go over the macro so one bar is 60 grams of uh just 60 grams of the weight 180 calories 20 grams of protein 7 grams of fat 24 grams of carbs 14 grams of fiber so a lot of fiber one gram of sugar and that's pretty much it and then as far as the ingredients go it's a protein blend of milk protein isolate whey protein isolate so it's a it's a whey protein blend with uh isolate and milk protein isolate and see so pretty low in uh in ingredients um it's sweetened with stevia so yeah so pretty pretty uh short list of ingredients but again it's a whey based protein or milk based protein all right so this is what it looks like so it's kind of like it's kind of tough right it's not the softest butt i think i just been eating them for so long they're just it's just an overall good bar i do get after a certain amount maybe i don't know three or four of these i have to rotate flavors because i started getting sick of it but good thing with quests they have a pretty uh wide list and variety of flavors so this is the quest bar it's a staple everyone knows about them they're pretty good bars and the macros are pretty solid all right so we got one more bar but i'll be right back because i gotta go grab it okay so the reason i had to go and grab this bar which is probably my favorite bar it's called the perfect bar is because it has to be refrigerated yeah so you this is kind of i guess maybe one of the limitations is you can't just keep it i mean you can i've kept it in my bag and you know it gets a little soggy uh a little oily and if you don't have a refrigerator but typically you gotta keep this in the fridge perfect bar okay so this is a tasty bar this is a rich bar let's go over some macros this is the peanut butter my favorite so this bar is one serving size 71 grams it has 340 calories 17 grams of protein 19 grams of fat okay so pretty high amount of uh of fat on in this bar 27 grams of carbs 3 grams of fiber and 19 grams of sugar okay so ingredient wise you got peanut butter where else is it coming from rice protein um i think those are the only yeah egg so dried whole egg powder non-fat dry milk so peanut butter dry milk whole egg powder and rice protein is what's making up the protein in this bar so this is again this is a rich bar this is a tasty bar it tastes very peanut this flavor of peanut butter it tastes good but it's higher on the fat right 19 grams of fat relatively high compared to the other bars but if you want like a treat if you want uh something that the you know after a evening dinner and you're still craving something pretty good you can grab the grill into the fridge and grab one of these perfect bars okay so i'm not gonna open this up because then i'm probably gonna end up eating it all but i guess i have to open it up just so you know what the texture is like so i'll take one for the team and you can just smell the uh the peanut butter so if you don't refrigerate it it gets really oily it gets very like right now it's pretty strong but it gets very welted very soft and you can kind of see the oil come out a little bit so if you have it in your bag or if it's a warm day just expect that you can probably alright you don't have to be refrigerated because you can't eat it just because of the texture i would assume so again this is it pretty thick bar tasty though this is a good bar tasty bar so i'm gonna wrap that up i know i'll eat it or after i get done filming but that was a delicious bar and that is the perfect bar okay so that wraps up i just ate 14 different or tasted 14 different bars luckily i only took small bites of them so it should be fine but i've never done something like this before so i got to try some new ones just for myself and hopefully gave in you all a quick glimpse into why it's important to try a variety of protein bars right have some you know some sort of construct of what you're looking for you know between this many calories and this many calories if it's going to be a snack or a meal replacement whatever that may be how many grams of protein are you looking for if it's a little low can you combine another source of protein and bump up that protein amount and looking for something low in fat something low in carbs something low in sugar you can have these guidelines and then go out to again whole foods gallons or tr or sprouts and find some of these bars that meet those guidelines and try different flavors and again the flavors are important because there are some bars that i don't like in certain flavors but i love in other flavors so try different flavors and experiment okay if you find a bar that you enjoy buy a few of those and then find some other bars because you're gonna typically want about two or three different bars to rotate in and out of your bullpen okay you don't want to just stick with one because for me i just get sick of it at some point so i have one bar on a you know on a on a weekday and then another one a different day one on the weekend and it just keeps my palate kind of changing and then i try different flavors as well so hopefully this review helped i didn't want to get too crazy with the uh the science of exactly how many carbs how much sugar this and that because i'm not a registered dietitian i'm gonna get a dietitian to come on and talk about those types of things and more specifically if you're an athlete if you're looking for weight loss building muscle whatever that may be because they're much more qualified to answer those questions this is just something i wanted to show you and give you a perspective that a lot of these bars right some of them might say they're protein bars but they have really low amounts of protein some of them might say they're a good snack but they have high amounts of calories so i want you to just have the awareness that all these bars are very they can be very different and depend on what you're looking for depending on what your goals are it could uh it could steer you in the right or wrong direction so my goal is hopefully to educate and inspire you you know don't just think i don't like protein bars because you tried one or two of them and you hated them there's a bunch of these protein bars everywhere try different brands and see if you can find one and again even things like making your own i think i'm going to make a video of making your own protein bars i'm going to make my own protein bars and see if i can make some of these protein bars at home with my own flavors of what i want to put into them and i think that's important too is experiment and make this you know make them with your kids make them at home try different recipes and and see if you can find some proteins that maybe you love and then give them to some friends and they like them hey you got a nice little side hustle side business of making your own protein bars okay so if you have any questions any comments if you love the video please it helps me out if you hit the like button the subscribe button and leave a comment below either saying you hated this video you love this video what's your favorite protein bar which one do you want to try out of all the ones that i reviewed doesn't matter leave a comment because it definitely helps with uh getting this video and uh helps with the algorithm of how the the platform shares the video okay so good luck trying and experimenting with your protein bars i'm coach jerry and uh we'll uh i'm gonna i'll hopefully do a part two because there's tons of these bars that i still didn't get to and maybe i'll do a part two comment below if you want me to do a part two and if i get enough people uh commenting that they want another round two of these then i'll go ahead and do it all right so i'm coach jerry hopefully got some education a little inspire inspiration of going and uh and getting healthier and taking control of your health and your fitness and your wellness and you know protein bars can be a part of that that program part of the the process of getting healthier because this might eliminate some cravings it might steer you in a better direction of eating healthier versus something that's not so healthy so uh try out some protein bars let me know what you think and until next time", "zHMahlGM95E": "what's happening captain just my latest creation ready to go Kevin twitch bars pakka crumbs", "KWwOCV9Y6FU": "today Kevin are we trying the limited-edition captain crunches I have peanut butter crunch and I have crunch berries what makes these so special is that there are three times bigger pieces which sounds awesome to us because we like these cereals anyway so we want to see like extra large frequent do you think how they look these were from Jason in Maryland they were 269 a box at a store called giant which we don't have here I can eat these peanut butter friends whatever other rooms but they don't taste as good outside oh they're good I think the things they're a milk totally good peanut butter flavor though and they are definitely bigger than the traditions yes I love the visual I love the peanut butter flavor mmm very good and uh I mean it's sweet but it's not overly sweet all right so it's not like you're eating peanut butter with with syrup or honey or something where it's super super now that you have you if people in the United Kingdom had that they would be like oh my it says oh that's one planet it's definitely sweet yeah but it's not as sweet as they couldn't it yeah that's the problem is you can't fit as many crushes on berries well I guess you can't there are gangs on the back puzzles on the back no I'm like because I'm gross things to keep you busy I'm always like the peanut butter crunch I can be a little salty why because most time you don't want cereal soggy why would you want these software cuz they're all they don't get how do you think yeah they're so hard they are that that they almost work the roof your mouth after a while you'll have to soften up a little bit they still have an excellent flavor that they're just a little off that's delicious amazing material if you like peanut butter at all you're gonna like that that's mom that's one hot hot Bob's not not the Xbox necessarily just that zero in general is like my big fruit crunchy berries yeah these are French berries sweetness Warren and as cereal 3/4 cup is a hundred calories and it looks like they have the same puzzles on the back so yeah I think they should have been different yeah yeah it's the exact time puzzles on the back oh you can get a different what color I'm sure they're all the same like vibrate just like a buried those are nice forked no they're not it yeah it tastes like a very fake bear it's good though I like French bread oh it's good they left the other one little pieces all the same size so they look like they're old Dwarfs compared to no they're dwarfed by the big truck fresh berries yeah little beanie thing would you be tempted to eat all the same color first no I just just I just shove in I don't look at anything I just go okay what are we gonna get the peanut butter did you like it better in or out of milk you know in truth I like animal softer um I was above once either way you know I think they're very good they're they're really good at milk um okay how about this those softened up a lot faster they got a lot softer long fibers and the cranberries didn't I mean the peanut butters those are good once again very very sweet you get a it's like a candy berry flavor that's that's the best way to describe it um it's off the Peterborough in every bite eating things you would want to make sure that you got some of the little corn pieces and then one of the colors and it doesn't matter what color you get they all tasted okay and I want to add another Brian the peanut bear yes now that soften up a bit it's still crunchy it's still very very crunchy very that's what I'm saying I don't like him you get mushy either well I'm just to soften up a little bit that's amazing how crunchy knows no they're good that reminds me of a like an inner an inner better yeah it's all sweet like I said it's not a sweet peanut butter flavor it's just a like a nutty flavors really more than anything it's more about peanut than a peanut butter Congress yeah okay but it's good I like it Madame's of two if you could only not being on yeah but really really good but now the better question is would you pick the extra large over the regular ones oh sure would you I mean I think it's the same difference either way so if you don't get the extra large you're not missing out on anything yeah just get the regular one but but I would just buy whatever was cheaper yeah next rate it will per box like the ounces over the ounces do each one was the cheapest of the two and get that I'm never with you there because I mean anyway you go your get 1/3 of a cup of these arthur vakha if you measure a mile cry which I just put milk on ball keep till he's all run out of milk pour on a ball and it looks good and then all I did that so but you only need one ball right see a ball used to I used to eat many balls I put cereal now and I need it and if there's no clap I put more so and the amount of cereal I'll get the licen last because I got lots of my smell but then once I don't have any milk left that were just a little bit I drink it I used to do that too I don't need more like you say so but these they're really good mother but we're good but I like the peanut better the best it's awesome so

get a lot though for 230 calories that's that's a lot of chocolate especially to take time to cut up each a little individual are like that that's a theta that's a little darker than your traditional dark salsa to revoke too bad no robot that tastes like that yeah like a that tastes like a  your CC % yeah yeah it completely outweighs the pretzel yeah there's no principle man it's too dark to now I love that's good dark chocolate but I'm not getting any salt or any freshmen right if they wanted to save some money they could just make it north on yeah I could leave out the pretzel yeah that's that's good dark chocolate no I really like the bitter and sweet yeah but today I'm gonna hot ball to target I don't like a big dark chocolate but even that's I like dark chocolate but that's probably too dark for me I can eat like a Hershey's dark chocolate which is for nothing Andrew the Hershey's the packaging is very hard like a plastic almost this is this is the pretzel milk chocolate so this is what works for this will be probably a little easier to discern that although it doesn't have a ton of front so in there well this one makes this pretzel pieces yeah personal bins pretzel in my said in this espresso that's tip that's also bit yeah one of them's just milk dark no you doesn't taste a pretzel mmm it's good almost hit a little bit more so yeah it's really good though mm-hmm it's not like it's not like milk chocolate it's not it's blacks that have a common way driver - it's like a thicker it's like a richer crunch no I'm saying it well it's not like the milk chocolate in the ivory but what he said it has a caramel flavor to me no communiques but I'm getting a normal driver but it's good their methods different takes place yeah it's very good guitar think we've disarmed it - we're the crisp rice this is gonna be more like a yeah I like the bottom you can kind of see them I'll tell you what they're thick and you definitely get a lot for your calories in these feathers I don't see anything hit him the tastes are a really good crunch more like like what I said about the other one I have the same view for this one but this one is crunchy much much brighter here this is I mean I like that one the best this one I didn't have many but I think that's what I liked about it it was the plainest yeah there was more chocolate yeah I like the crispy one food which one did you like the best the door he just got another piece of dark the principal was good then had a combo platter to the crisp our taste like a a high quality Crunch mark and I love the chocolate our was really good really creamy yellow that lizards celery is definitely don't ya dark is that definitely anger ease go to as the dark so thank you very much Liz and thanks everybody who tuned in to watch

the double chocolate Oreo chocolate candy bar the dark chocolate Nestle Crunch bar I have Butterfinger doc so these two these two candy bars were sent to us by mich Mich in Michigan she said that she bought the Nestle bar it was a dollar 25 at 7-eleven she said the milk bar was a dollar fifty at Walmart and then mine was a dog twenty-nine have Walgreens so there you go so since miss rish since us two and I had one on my own I just thought it could join the party and we can do all the Kennebec okay they're all new so yeah this is the Milka double chocolate Oreo chocolate candy bar it says it contains hazelnut paste they made that sure that they put that on the front three servings are in the candy bar five pieces are 190 calories and sometimes these candy words say pill here no that's okay that's it there we go so there was a pill here look at this one okay so don't talk pieces all day no okay so five of these are 190 you can do very soft so it should be double chocolate cookie piece first move bringing up top good sons it could be in there yeah the cookie pieces really stand out in them because then it honestly it tastes like a brownie yeah yeah exactly yeah that's exactly what it tastes like these brownie batter that is a very good game they could have called that brownie batter it's real big if you can get that travel so that's another new from Nestle it's the Nestle Crunch bar this is the dark chocolate version the whole candy bars $220 now is it actually that will pick all the french bars out there's a there's a mixed package minutes a minute rose it's like a mr. Goodbar and looks like there's a crackle or is definitely struck not a trifle okay boo boo I like that there's prepared there's this direction on the front they it looks like a mini candy bar so how much do you get 224 the whole bowl brother entire bomb mmm get the dark chocolate mm-hmm it's not super bitter of them no it's a dry chocolate yes it is I like the flavor of it but that being said it's not a go-to for me I'd never go to dark chocolate that I'd rather have a brunch for out of the regular just yeah if I was gay if I had both of them sitting beside beside I would pick the original because I like the milk chocolate flavor of it yeah and yeah I would really revert them something that doesn't dry your mouth oh no if you really like dark chocolate drop us out yeah you need to try it because it is good dark chocolate sauce it's not a go-to it's a dark dark chocolate yeah a very like dark chocolate that's breathing heavy to here is our dog we don't do you hear heavy breather Stephanie he I can hear very loud so hi this the Butterfinger dark which I'm very interested to see what this tastes like the cocaine Bart's 260 a Butterfinger is one of my favorite candy bars I mean I heard yeah just a regular candy bar that you can get anywhere butterfingers one of my favorite yeah this traditional Butterfinger on the inside I'm just gonna hide okay okay it looks like melted all over yeah [Music] hmm the peanut butter so strong and Butterfinger the peanut butter the nutty flavor and truly don't taste the chocolate not me slightly less sweet than a traditional Butterfinger yeah I really there's not a big difference in that at all do you think maybe just a touch less sweet but not maybe I mean honestly out I would get this one or the regular like this one yeah you really can't tell the difference yeah sometimes you get a Butterfinger it's weird because some butterfingers you get they're really really hard in the middle this one's kinda like that and some you can get and they're just like flaky in the middle in addition though those are awesome ones well out of the three I like the note the Oreo one yeah yeah the mocha Oreo yeah yeah this is the best bar yeah you know the the Butterfinger is not viable it's just a regular imitation arrival and the crunch bar if you like dark chocolate you would like that so so I hope you enjoyed the video I'm gonna have a picture for you at the end so you can see these close up and thanks for watching [Music]", "Zdp_C37cQ-E": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to limited-edition captain crunches chocolate berry crunch cereal this was 250 at Target in Sweden corn and oats cereal it says two great flavors so I guess the chocolate flavor and the berry and it has a word search on the back one purchase decadence if you like the taste of chocolate love this punch do notice how long is chocolatey very Lynch's treat will last so get your hands on a hole very fast it's chocolatey berry crunch is a great topping on vanilla pudding mocha latte ice cream and yogurt so they're trying to get you to think of it is besides a breakfast food cuz it popping yeah there's a topping mm-hmm oh that's good yeah but make their mother just crunch berries 3/4 cup 26 grams is a hundred calories no you could talk about something really basic they give you a lot of look like you get a lot more berries she's gonna get some areas if I belong with awesome for the sign those are good I would definitely eat down to lunch break but I like the berry more than the top header to the chocolate sauce well uh cocoa but it's not like it tastes like cheap choc yeah yeah really the berry I like that flavor it has but just like crunch berries I mean it's exactly employer corn flour sugar flour have been a while sugar cocoa powder it has strawberry juice concentrate that's the only bury us a strawberry juice comes address these get really soggy really fast by the line how do them mmm the little balls a little berries yeah they get mushy and I like them like that but they do get Commission you can eat it I think either way but I do really like the texture in milk I do too the chocolate really doesn't come through as much as I was hoping that one no I mean you get a little bit of the chocolate but it's not know you're mainly just getting buried yeah mostly berry but it's good I like yeah I you should try yeah I would definitely try this it's mainly berry then if I had to try it just one way or another I would try it and milk no because I just love that texture that once once it gets in milk it's just um there's layers to it and it's just really pleasing I think kids would like that though either way I want to give a bowl to look at no one run around the house with yeah they get dropped oh yeah you could definitely it drop but out of you know between the chocolate and the berry flavor the bear is the better flavor it is yeah exactly so I'll have a picture for you all at the end I hope you

spotted ohm so yay for Kevin these are Nestle Crunch Bars we have a white one and a hazelnut one and then these I think we're everywhere these are Nestle Smarties this is a sharing block so Christina is the biggest fan of crunch ever in white chocolate so this is right up her alley everybody's like a price it was in a pound store Poundland is where it was and we had gone to I think I want to say bath and we went in a homeland in bath and that's where Kevin spotted things I have no idea how much they cost but this is the crunch with white chocolate probably a pound there's no choice it's at all I bought coffee pops in there though couldn't refer in they were three for a pound all right you done ready oh I did it that's cool it's a crunch idea that broken okay I broke it what you got to break it you have to break it cuz we have to try but it literally it says it says crunch on it and it's really cool and it's really cool Brixton blocks or like that okay did you flipped it over no like hey that different there we'll have this piece yeah goodness no you got a smaller group at the top of the age it's very creamy that's a rich very rich watch long ago it's a very rich I got the little crunchies in there or curse out there stay now you can wrap that up and send it to her because you will like that you'll love that I don't know that's a very very nice white chocolate and we only sell there I hope that other people can't find them over there because that's that's worth trying a good way if you are white chocolates really good and this is the hatefulness and oh look at all of them oh nice lunch same thing it looks like it's this yes it says crunch on it they're really good no that's good no big pieces - mm-hmm I mean you can see a whole nut sticking out of the side over there I honestly don't think hazelnut is just as big you it is huge in Germany huge every other candy bar his name and I don't think I just hazelnut and white first and I just don't think hazelnut has hit the United States like it has another place and I don't know why so even later our biggest thing is peanuts peanuts and almonds so there's a net never catch it yeah yeah that's good that's a good I like that hazing them okay now this is the smarty Cheri mob now we have had the Smarties and I love how they put the servings on the back it says if you want to make it first one serving it ends there two servings and you divide the bar up like that Julia I think it was Julia forgive me if it wasn't and sent us some Smarties from Canada a long time ago and they're not like the Smarties we're not expected to see them through the bottom I didn't check and I don't see them I expanded it to be very colorful yeah I see a couple of red and green spots so I mean whatever this is good one was like a No it's very good I like it noise over there kind of like though the nah not even iam there's no chocolate-covered candy yeah any code of change I'm gonna be honest with you it's like a demon in bar yeah that's what I don't know they're just smaller than in memsource more tips like a Katie for a mini eminences yeah that's what it nice like here it's good it's a little bit bitter of a chocolate then you're not as sweet of a chocolate and I'll lie mr. boots good I like it quite a bit yeah it's pretty good out of the three I like this event no rule ah I'll take my spoon up you like the hazelnut Oh which one do you like no I pray like this margin too cuz I like that Chris but I like the one charm you can't go wrong with any of these I'll take a picture for you Kevin every time I

crackle bar the crunch is made by Nestle and the crackle is made by Hershey's the crunch bar is 220 calories for the whole bar and crackle is 210 per bar these were both bought at just our local grocery store and they were around $1 apiece so I'm gonna open them up and show them to you and just kind of compare how they look so this is what they look like these bars are both milk chocolate with crisp rice so you can see on the bottom there and this one is like that so I'm gonna give them this one first the traditional that one right there am okay here's the deal I don't know how to touch this I just want you playing emails over powering mint-chocolate it's good it's a good candy bar I can probably guess which one it is it's so super sweet yeah alright so now I'm gonna get the other one this is more difficult than I imagined okay hands I'm gonna give you like two separate pieces but it's the same thing that has almost no flavor at all mmm it has up almost like a cinnamon flavor job it does and I get back I've got a gas definitely I think I know which one Yeah right take off your masks I actually liked the the first one had like a little bit of an aftertaste to it the second one had an odd like season like a spice in there I show you which one did you like better I like the first one which one do you offering the first one I think person was the Nestle a crutch I think it was a car I don't I think it was brunch I think the first one was the Hershey's crackle just like the little miniatures I said traditionally I said I was gonna say it's in the traditional Hershey bar block shape but I couldn't say that sounds like it's the traditional which ones you like the most that was almost no it's funny we both thought if I were to yeah it was weird if I didn't have something in it at all but that's what we taste it yeah but yeah I said you like to drive all the best - mm-hmm although I didn't have a little bit of a base but it was it was good it was bad I probably wouldn't buy you one of them because there's so many other panting roars - chin there's not enough there but given the choice if those were the only two choices and I was gonna pick one definitely the crackle is kinda like Andy when it comes to candy bars I like the more stuff in it the better Rocket Snickers or mr. no mr. good mr. Goodbar or Butterfinger so anyway that was fun for us hope it was fun for you Jim and", "L5vhfS38oVg": "[Music] well hello there guys girls and non-binary people it's your favorite unsalted crackers

in 1980 the song i will survive by gloria gaynor won the grammy for best disco recording it was the first and only time that award was given so ironically this grammy category did not survive how about that people i had no idea well anyway guys as always it looks like it's that time it's time for another excited insane super official thought provoking straight edge food product review from youtube's only true 365 day your food product reviewer it's raining outside people can you believe that i just noticed that when i was doing the review it's like it just popped up out of nowhere kind of like the night i walked it on the ex-wife and i was surprised when i saw her taking in a big black 12-inch anyway guys today we have the nestle crunch eggs a great idea from nestle i think it's a wonderful idea i saw these and i was like you know that is very very very inventive let's make the same thing but make it egg-shaped great idea from nestle crunch um just a great idea it was uh four dollars you only get six eggs so they're rot you get you're getting robbed on top of buying it i mean six of these little things for four bucks i mean i got robbed but it's okay because it's easter easter is a special time as we all know so um they've taken easter and made it into a business of course but we all know what easter is really about we all know but anyway guys as always uh we're gonna see what these are all about give them a review and uh see how good they are see if they taste just like a nestle crutch i mean you never know it may be a little bit different you never can tell you never can tell like with the reese's eggs you know they're a little bit different than a reese's so we're going to give these a review see what they're all about and as always guys remember if you have anything you'd like read the box arch like you gotta leave a comment below if we like that comment guys might just pick it out and review your request next thumbnail they're egg shaped people great idea all right guys let's open it up and have a look inside oh yes oh yes you get six of these six of these look at that people so anyway guys we're gonna open this up and see what it's all about here we go are you ready beautiful beautiful beautiful oh it's beautiful oh it is shaped like an egg that's beautiful beautifully done way to go nestle that is beautiful it's not just it's a good size egg too man heart is it's raw it's hard i don't look like a lot of chocolate in there look at that a lot of chocolate amazing absolutely spectacular wow now people it has more chocolate than a regular nestle crunch because of the way it's made with the thickness of the chocolate and that's wonderful i mean look how thick that is people that's great very nice job from nestle um that's great so good and so fresh my heart is right it's so hard you can't back through it it's shocking there we go anyway people wow wonderful taste um wow the chocolate is so fresh people [Music] so of raw people these are very hard no doubt about that you have to really bite down on it to get up to break it off you have to really bite down hard you know i can't get over how fresh that chocolate is [Music] that's so good overall people i'm thoroughly impressed with the crunch egg it's better than a nestle crunch that's saying a lot i know but because there's more chocolate condensed into that small area you have yourselves an absolute winner way to go nestle crunch i'd rather have this than the well then the reese's egg i don't know i mean it's close but overall people it's a great idea you are gonna get robbed like i said you only get six of these for four bucks now that's if you i got these at crocker for four dollars and i thought if i didn't have my card my crocker card it would have been 450 if you don't have a kroger card so i mean it's pretty expensive it really is but overall people i'm gonna give it a solid five stars these have surprised me how good they are uh very impressed so anyway guys that's gonna be the official review as always thank you so much for watching check these out people you're going to be surprised you are and let them get a little bit well what it is is this it's kind of cold they've been in the car they've been in the car overnight i left them in the car and it got like 40 degrees last night so that's why they're hard that's why they're pretty hard but other than that people that's it so as always guys thank you so much for watching me the box arch alexa we'll see you guys as always next time give the video a big thumbs up have yourselves a great day we'll see you tomorrow i mean that's that's going a little bit overboard probably but that's great when you mix it with that ice cream and put it in here together like this you get a perfect product people this is how you make it right here this is how you do it absolutely spectacular delish yeah that's motorboating baby damn so peanut butter let's just say it's a

chocolate crunch bar um and this is what it looks like let me smell it first it doesn't have much of a smell and it's not the best smell um yeah it's not the best smell the first thing i get is that's not too sweet it kind of reminds me i don't know if you've ever had the little debbie i think it's called the nutter butter bars they're like chocolate wafers that crispness of those wafers remind me of these the christmas of this looks pretty good it doesn't make it's missing something though i don't know what maybe some saltiness or some sweetness because it's kind of just flat like the taste is flat it's not a bad taste this is kind of there with not no pizzazz kinda like you know boring it's like yeah okay tastes like chocolate and crispy what's so special about that but it doesn't taste bad it's not too sweet but i'm not crazy about the smell that smells highly processed and highly highly processed um yeah it's not bad bad but i definitely taste in my opinion like um well honestly like diet food like weight loss yeah like whether it's weight loss or not was it tastes like yeah it tastes like a weight loss supplement bar but i've had similar bars to this and they've been like way worse it's not bad you know it's it's just it's kind of bland um i give this like a 2.8 out of 10. um i wouldn't get it again um i have tried their other products and you can check out their reviews some of those other products that they they make are way better so i'm not downing the company they make some amazing products this particular one i don't like it as far as dark chocolate is concerned it tastes like dark chocolate but it doesn't taste like quality dark chocolate this is kind of there and bland which i've already said that but yeah but yeah please comment like and

"sQWeSSMpGzc": "hello and welcome to my channel today we're going to make homemade Nestle Crunch inspired candy bars they're very easy to make and the best thing is they only require two ingredients you will need one cup of a rice cereal of choice and one and a half cups of chocolate chips or chocolate chunks in a double boiler or medium heat add your chocolate I used a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate you can use whatever you desire using a spatula stir your chocolate until it's completely melted and smooth you once your chocolate is melted and smooth remove from the heat completely allow this to cool for about one to two minutes once cooled carefully remove your chocolate using oven mitts I didn't use them because my bowl was cool enough around the edges where I didn't need to next add your rice cereal and stir to coat the cereal with the chocolate evenly you now that our rice cereal is coated with the chocolate we're going to transfer the mixture into a parchment lined baking dish something like a brownie dish make sure that your parchment overhangs in your dish for easy removal later evenly spread out the mixture in your baking dish you once the mixture is evenly spread placed in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or the freezer for 20 minutes to allow the chocolate to set our chocolate has set so it's time to cut them the way you desire the only thing left to do is

time for another review so today we're gonna be looking at one of my favorite cereals growing up as a kid and that cereal is peanut butter crunch cereal so I'm gonna be comparing this to a recent healthier alternative to this oil right here and that will be organics peanut butter dot cereal so we're going to be comparing the two as well as seeing the differences between the two so stick around [Music] by you [Music] alright guys here is another situation where I grew up eating a specific cereal one of my favorites in fact and as I got older I sought out much more healthier alternatives to that cereal and over the course of time I've only come across two that's this one right here from the organics brand peanut butter dot cereal that you can get at Vons or Whole Foods I mean there's the second one which was called peanut butter bumpers that you can get at sprouts so we're gonna take a look at the ingredients of both of these the peanut butter buffers I don't have yet but for now we're only gonna compare these two since I don't have the peanut butter bumpers cereal with me so I'm gonna take a look at the ingredients for this and the ingredients for my all-time favorite peanut butter cereal I mean you have the Reese's peanut butter puffs but that's a combination of chocolate and peanut butter I only want to do straight-up peanut butter cereals for now so it came down to these two alright so let's take a look at the packaging first up is the Captain Crunch peanut butter crunch cereal some vibrant colors really kid-friendly here it shows you to try three of their different flavors on the side panel I love the packaging I love the graphics on cereal boxes really colorful course on the back got some little games cartoons and of course the nutrition facts on the side it's a well packaged cereal alright so now let's take a look at the organics peanut butter dot cereal box simple the health-conscious cereal lover no need for funding games more informational and beneficial information the most important part is the nutrition information on the side so people will know where they're eating and what would they're putting into their body alright let's do a side-by-side comparison of the nutrition facts here's the organics peanut butter dots and of course the peanut butter crunch cereal so when the organic peanut butter dots in one serving you get one in a third cup and there's 160 calories per morning the third cup for the peanut butter crunch you get one cup per serving and you get 170 calories per serving per cup let's go to the total fat you got three grams of fat peanut butter crunch you got the point 5 grams of fat organic so it has 0.5 grams of fat and zero trans fat peanut butter crunch has one gram of saturated fat and no trans fats has polyunsaturated fat one gram which is a good fat same with monounsaturated fat 1.5 grams let's go to the cholesterol organics has zero cholesterol so does the peanut butter crunch organics has 300 milligrams of sodium same with peanut butter crunch 300 milligrams of sodium now let's go to the sugars organics has 10 grams of sugar peanut butter crunch has 13 grams of total sugars alright here is the peanut butter crunch ingredients you have hydrogenated cottonseed and/or rapeseed oil the hydrogenated is one of the concerns I had with on these brand name cereals that you can get at your supermarkets they usually have harshly hydrogenated and high fructose corn syrups those are the dangerous ingredients that they put in foods the foods that we've all grown up with well as we can see it doesn't include the high fructose corn syrup which is a good thing it's just that hydrogenated cottonseed oil there's a flag for me okay let's go look at the organics peanut butter dots ingredients so the ingredients are organic corn flour organic cane sugar organic peanut butter Organic peanuts salt organic whole grain oat flour organic rice flour sea salt organic sunflower oil calcium carbonate baking soda took-off roles antioxidants to maintain freshness that's it two ingredients make a big difference when choosing the foods that I eat even the sweets that I eat but it also comes down to taste so you're gonna compare these two and the taste Department all right guys I'm gonna open this box up this peanut butter crunch cereal and I'm going to open this up the organics peanut butter dot cereal all right you want to put these studios in the wool side-by-side all right first I'm going to pour the peanut butter crunch cereal in the left bowl and next I'm going to pour the organics peanut butter cereal [Music] all right now I'm gonna try each cereal without milk alright guys so here are the two cereals in a bowl side by side as you can see the peanut butter crunch cereal is a little bit more darker more tan than the peanut butter dot cereal it's more light so I'm gonna give them a taste without milk go for the peanut butter crunch first take a close look hmm yep the seal that I grew up with can taste that peanut butter that's sweet peanut butter taste I used to eat this straight out the box okay now put the peanut butter dots there's a look peanut buttery at all so [Music] yeah it definitely has a peanut butter peanut buttery taste it's not sweet like the peanut butter crunch it's more of a peanut buttery creamy texture which I like as well all right so let's try this with milk all right guys let's do this here we got the peanut butter crunch and look stir this around a bit [Music] yeah oh yeah now I haven't had peanut butter crunch in literally years it's been a long time so I don't know if they even changed a formula or even the textures changed I do get that peanut butter flavor that's sweet peanut butter flavor it's got that nice crunch in there [Applause] I'm gonna move on to the you know bit of dots this around how light that is it's really light notice the difference right away between these two I noticed that the peanutbutter dots gets soggy easier but at the same time when you're eating it it develops that creamy peanut butter together with sogginess feeling it's not bad actually the sogginess isn't bad because you can really taste the peanut butter it's not a sweet peanut butter like the peanut butter crunch but it's a it creates a creamy texture in there when the sogginess kicks in then also the crunch is much more lighter in this one whereas the peanut butter crunch it has a hard crunch bite to it this dissolves easier in your mouth you definitely get a peanut butter flavor in this cereal as well as a creamy peanut butter texture it's quite pleasant to munch down on these puffs because how they easily dissolve in your mouth and it's not harsh on your teeth when you're trying to munch it down on these puffs now peanut butter crunch it tends to hold its crunch a little longer hmm that's good alright guys so here's the differences between the two cereals the peanut butter crunch it holds its crunch longer it maintains a nice sweet peanut buttery flavor a little Tang in there somewhere I can just taste a little Tang in there and the organics has a creamier peanut butter texture it doesn't have a sweet peanut butter flavor the way the peanut butter crunch does but it does have a nice peanut butter flavor and because of the fact that this theory gets soggy quicker it gives off this creamy texture to it so that was the pleasant part of this cereal and the peanut butter crunch yeah this cereal seems to have a more richer peanut butter flavor to it a much more sweeter peanut butter flavor which appeals to me because I'm such a sweet to youth this on the other hand it has a nice creamy peanut butter flavor but it's like I said before it's not a sweet peanut butter flavor it's pretty good don't get me wrong he's pretty good cereal pretty good alternative but for overall taste flavor texture crunch if you're not trying to be health conscious then peanut butter crunch is the winner here alright guys I recommend both of these cereals right here for the health conscious and if you just love the peanut butter Co ensuring you grew up with it like I did alright guys time to give this a score a rating for my all-time favorite peanut butter cereal the peanut butter crunch I'm gonna have to get this from a scale of one to five flames I'll give this a four point eight flames out of five this is the shirt that came out on top still one of my favorite peanut butter cereals out there in the market for this this is not a bad healthy alternative to the peanut butter crunch cereal and this is the one I will stick with if I wanted to keep on eating a cereal with more whole ingredients this did come out on top so I'll have to get this from a scale of one to five flames a 4.7 flames out of five all right there you have it four point eight flames out of five four point seven flames out of five alright guys that was the video that was the review it's a place where I try the old the new or combine the two all right guys I appreciate you stopping by my channel I appreciate I subscribe to my channel if you're new to it or leave a comment below and let me know what you

salt the peanut butter you can't taste the chocolate if you're a dark chocolate in a peanut butter those are good really good they're extremely good really you know it's more would you say it's more of a natural nor more of not like faith yeah like natural like if you were gonna go to a natural whole food store this company is watching this video they'd even make them in milk chocolate milk Chuck white chocolate locos is they make either one of them as good as that yeah they've got they've got millions they definitely have the coating on there they it would just be a pretzel with like a ether of powder or a or they would be that color did not have any kind of thing at all but they really wish I can see why they give you a small bag so but if I had to pay three bucks on right so thanks for

"1jMeQ_i9YRE": "you guys are probably seeing this bowl and think yourself spot were you eating your breakfast perhaps lunch you had a bowl of soup and you just left a bowl here the answer is no my friends this bowl is here for a reason because I've got something interesting to show you today's random spot something that I stumbled upon we're gonna be having a look at cocoa cap and crunch yes I know I was thrown off too this is a trial pack cocoa Cap'n Crunch made with real cocoa you wouldn't believe my friends where I found this wouldn't even believe take a guess take a guess no it wasn't at the grocery store no no it wasn't RadioShack no it wasn't that best buy either you guys clearly are horrible at picking places you'll see at the top it's limited edition but you'll see a little sticker here as well it's a little green and yellow sticker now if anybody watches enough these reviews or you're Canadian you usually will see this yellow and green sticker and automatically think hey wait a minute that's a dollar store sticker the answer is yes I found this at a local dollar store something else that will blow your mind is when I first grabbed the box I'm like oh they must be selling these off they can't get rid of them and then I went like this that sticker is part of the box so perhaps this is a dollar store exclusive again I picked this up at the Dollar Rama I think was at the Dollar Rama here in Canada cocoa Cap'n Crunch I've just blown everybody's mind I know on the front even Cap'n and no it's not captain it's Cap'n but you know what I see captain who cares I'm not gonna stop and say Cap'n Crunch but even the captain on the front does even know what to do first of all he's looking through his periscope or wherever he's on the threes is over here he's looking at us he's like you won't believe this man I don't believe this either cocoa Cap'n Crunch I don't know why I gave him that accent but he I know I'm thrown away too but I thought I'm gonna I want definitely wanna buy the cereal that's a given and I definitely want to consume the cereal put it in my stomach swallow it let it do its thing in my belly I thought no I'm gonna review this too because I don't know if everybody has seen Coco Cap'n Crunch is definitely rare limited edition again my friends limited time only so if you have a local dollar store and you love goat now it's not at all dollar stores I only went and saw this in one dollar store if you go out and find it do pick it up on the back no it's nothing it is absolutely nothing it's just a French version of this but I don't even know what to make of this definitely I definitely had to review this for you guys best before March 29th 2012 we're gonna be alright and open this up perhaps if you want to even call this a cereal spot I don't know I know how interesting would be for me to be reviewing cereal open this up for you guys and I'm gonna give this a try now generally I love Cap'n Crunch I love the stuff you can't get if you can't go wrong with Captain Crunch cereal I'm gonna pour this in this cereal bowl just like that turn around so you guys can see the English side and the camera that part of my fingers there we have right there I got myself some milk it's not really quite milk it's actually don't laugh it's whole grain brown rice milk I I don't know I am actually considering switching back to milk feel embarrassed when I go in to stores and I buy rice milk I don't feel like a if you don't feel like I'm masculine enough I feel like there's something wrong with me anyways though you get the same point the better Sol's Coco Captain Crunch let the milk do its work there's nothing worse than you pour milk into cereal and then you get these little dry pockets where the cereal hasn't absorbed any milk and you put it in your mouth and it's dry then there's one thing I can't stand it's dry cereal some people don't mind dry cereal like to snack on I'm the type that I like my cereal a little bit wet a little bit moist but there you go Coco Captain Crunch let's give this a try I'll give this a try I'll let you guys know what I think of it Coco Captain Crunch it's actually not bad it kind of tastes really like um try and compare what it would taste like it kind of tastes like Coco Pops what was that Coco what was that cereal Coco Puffs Coco Puffs there's a Coco Puffs kind of tastes like that it's not bad it definitely it tastes like just cocoa cookies like cocoa pebbles it's not as sweet as you would expect it to be I know okay regular Cap'n Crunch can be pretty sweet this stuff actually isn't that bad two dollars also again want to point out its limited time only hmm it's actually not bad though you guys like if you like trial cereal something new that you don't normally see and you guys like Cap'n Crunch and you guys like Coco wah do I even need to sell you on this today's random spot something a little bit different but I wanted to show you guys some interesting cereal out there today's review spa today's random spot we were having a look at Coco Captain Crunch I thank you guys for watching I'm gonna finish off the rest of this cereal and I'll see you guys next time you", "Mm-lAdz0dkE": "what's crackling everybody welcome back to the definitive cereal pyramids or each episode I Tucker grammatically that seems weird but I've been saying it every time so I'm sticking with it take a serial and rank it on a tier list from s down to F now this episode we're continuing our captain crunch spree and we're doing Captain Crunch peanut butter crunch the first one is nontraditional Captain Crunch flavor so just a reference for past Captain Crunch flavors we have loops all berries at addy which are actually putting that a deep nacht lucky charms frosted flakes down to e unprecedented move Captain Crunch is crunch berries was a C in traditional Captain Crunch as a bee and we started there that went there there there so it's getting worse each time so far so there's a chance this might end up at an e if that trend continues hopefully it doesn't because I rather neat decent cereals that will find that together let's get in give me that peanut butter crunch this watch really nice stuff don't know what happened there still opens good so no worries there juice off there is the only one of these bags that I hope that well better crunch open open easily I'm looking at this this looks like recent fine which I guess makes sense because loves chocolate peanut butter this is just the peanut butter smell it smells like peanut butter but an interesting Bayon it's not know traditional Captain Crunch pieces this is like the strawberries weren't all the circular excuse me what's all the circular bins now let's get some milk in there all right let's dig in give me that peanut butter crunch these are very hard they're meant to be this hard I guess it was an unsettling I was not ready for that tastes like peanut butter that's very light peanut butter taste it's there they're just so hard why none of the other Captain Crunch was this hard by the peanut butter chef stiff [Music] it's honestly so distracting that like it taste is just being ignored so I'm not as strong tastes like it's the sentient has a peanut butter is much more than the taste it has there's much more if a peanutbutter sent the peanut butter taste I guess that's a more eloquent way of putting it they aren't really getting soggy so salaah photograph' ocation of these are so I keep thinking it's must be like expire but it's good for another seven months six months Largent so hard whose idea was this okay starting to get coins that are a little softer Sall year you really can't get a big spoonful of these cuts just too much so so stiff my roommate was something he when he eats cereal he likes it sucking so he pours the milk in waits a few minutes and starts eating good for this cereal specifically that is the call to make I get stew that's too much like now it's okay all right but I still not a ton of tastehh it might be this peanut butters not gonna flavor by itself or it's just too weak I can't tell like there's a bit of an aftertaste of the peanut butter not during the chew it's not really yeah not much going on [Music] the milk wasn't peanut buttery it sort of has that captain crunchy taste not peanut butter now you just boring nothing happening no good tasting it's too crunchy this might be the first one to get a low-ranking and not even just kind of taste match because it doesn't have anything if peanut butter peanut butter crunch it's not bad but there's nothing peanut butter tatius isn't very strong so you're hardly getting that and the pieces are just so hard I don't know that's something I just got a weird box it's meant to be that way but it was like you wanted to be crunchy this was not there's like a whole nother category it's because that it's gonna be an e I'm gonna give this an E but not because it's I don't think it's terrible I just don't think it's worth your time and II it's a cereal that I went I don't think you should buy like a charm throughout the flakes I didn't think you'd buy it you should buy because it's just weird and not good so this one I don't think you should buy just because you could find better and peanut butter flavors and find things I'm aren't gonna be so hard why was this cereal so hard I don't understand if you enjoyed this video be sure to like it and subscribe and it comes below post your general thoughts and tell me if I'm wrong about this have you had this and had it not be hard please tell me I need to know if this was a design choice or just a weird box I got cuz it's gonna bug me if it turns out yes this was a weird box Nick maybe one day I'll come back to it but I feel like you're the only it moved up tuck indeed because it still wasn't much to taste it's weird how hard this thing is if you could this explains why did they do this why'd you do this captain what I don't want that peanut butter crunch that's pretty much how it settles out and you can tell me in the comments below or on Twitter at Target our 23 if you want that peanut butter butter crunch I don't think you do until next time stay delicious", "PVDFoJTimsI": "today Kevin are you trying some crunch and Munch these are flavored crunchy munch this is the birthday cake yeah brownie brittle and there are other popcorn clusters I found both of these at Big Lots that works 250 each we're going to try the birthday cake first pump we're gonna ruin it that way we are gonna weigh it because I want you to see exactly how much stricter your calories you can thank me later cake batter flavored popcorn mixed with many sugar cookies and rainbow sprinkles ring those sprinkles take better mini cookie pieces entire birthday party in your mouth you better believe it and they say life is a party so why not make it a birthday party don't worry we already invited all your favorite flavors no need for a 4th birthday cake flavored candy coated popcorn mixed with some mini sugar cookie bits we also added some vanilla flavored birthday cake cookies for that can't get enough cake flavor and we topped it all off with crunchy party sprinkles the only thing missing is a candle safe to say we like to make our cake and eat it too half a cup 30 grams is 140 Cal 30 grams now you might get one set because it's not as clumpy you don't be in huh yeah okay that's enough that's what you get there are five servings in the bag that's $140 right there yeah so here we go damn shine look there's three together at one Bible 6m4 6 grams that's good why three B's no that's good it's definitely has a birthday liking flavor I need cookie pieces though Oh what is it where the wolf like when it says manager cookies oh it's just something mixed in okay yeah there's nothing in the bottom of this bag it all looks like this hopper it looks like that um it tastes like a honestly I've had a lot of crunch image and it tastes like the traditional French image but with a little vanilla flavoring it accepted in the toffee flavors muscles and I don't Jim I don't get the birthday as strong as Kevin do no I'm not saying that I'm saying it reminds you of work that comes ahead of the devil it has a vanilla flavor I wish if you've been stronger it is good it's over-the-top sweet its weak it's really good makes sense watch it Big Lots but I wish it had had more but now it makes sense this a big loss because big loss usually gets it after it's been stolen stores never even saw them we never saw it in our area I know some of you in other states had this in your regular stores we never had these areas so that's not it went over very well and this is a brittle French chocolate on chocolate with a side of chocolate yes please for centuries humans have been debating if there is such thing as too much chocolate we don't think so to prove it we're throwing down this definitely rich semi-sweet chocolate candy covered popcorn we also mixed in brownie cookie pieces crunchy brownie brittle bits and some honey praline almonds for a mouth-watering crunch that's sure to satisfy any chocolate craving the only thing better than chocolate is more chocolate so you have the the brownie brittle you have the glazed popcorn you have honey praline almond and you have brownie cookie pieces 28 grand is a 30 count myself too good for each other because it sounds it's not if you speak it about what I mentioned rally yeah wait it's like roundabout 28 right there that's it exactly 28 that is that little one something that these little hunter is that just because this is bigger pieces of thing I have to and it says kids safety while popcorn is a delicious snacking choice it is never recommended for infants or toddlers as the pop pearls can pose a choking threat to their safety that's very true that's okay again it's okay it's not awesome it's okay you know it I get more of the cookie I think the chocolate cookie flavor yeah then a brownie flavor I mean I've seen where they're going with the brownie and even if you've ever had those that brownie brittle it does kind of remind you of that it can have some brownies little struck yeah yeah that's what it reminds me of it has a brownie brutal Bob so not a pan of illy gooey brownies but that thin crispy that's that's what it almost tastes bitter almost a smart yeah but that's what it remind you have so if you know what I'm talking about and you like that kind of a I like that one use the scorched because that really describes it well that's not a bad thing and it's just a it's a brownie that's fully cooked and there's no gooeyness yeah no bitterness from that from this chocolate yeah and from the scores yes absolutely so these are okay out of the two I would rather have the birthday yeah me too and this this one almost takes more I could use a cream kind of because of the darkness of the chocolate right but but I would rather have the birthday out of the two but truth be told I would prefer just the traditional French oh it's over both of it look for the good common pot I think that's what's been around for so long that's that's why you can find you they're trying new things I do too I think it is - I think that they just need to go back and make it even better yeah I think they need to move there I think they could I know they could Groupon it and if just think if they hit to the birthday they had added like a white chocolate drizzle to it or something they could have done that with both and it that would I know that adds more calories but that would have also added more flavor to it as well so anyway I hope you enjoyed the video if you've had the opportunity to traveling's let us know what you thought and thanks for watching [Music]", "YlYYDbADnCM": "today kevin and i are going to be trying some special k these are keto friendly bars i have the peanut butter fudge snack bars i have the chocolate almond fudge snackers so they're very close in price we found them at two different stores um the peanut butter were bought at walmart and they were 5.98 and i have still only seen the peanut butter at walmart because i look every time we go in at least at our local walmart um kevin's were bought at meijer and they were 5.85 so 585 598 it really surprises me honestly that walmart was more uh about 10 cents more expensive than that um you get five bars in the box you have one gram of sugar that's their selling point [Applause] you know what let's do yours first chocolate almond fudge two grams of net carbs yeah two grams of net carbs soda keto that matters okay ooh there's a tiny little thing well it's a snack ball yeah it's it's specifically labeled a side bar that's bigger than uh we've had other bars that were that were smaller i am uh well they are 100 they're snack bars but they're still 160 calories so um seven grams of protein two grams of nip carbs chocolate almond fudge snack bars uh 160 calories like i said um and then on the back they're just advertising their other snacks it's not horrible but you can definitely tell it's light on sugar yeah one gram of sugar you can tell there's no sweetness there at all no it's kind of bitter enough it just sits there you know what it's not horrible it's not the worst thing i've had it's keyed up the texture would actually be good if you if it was full of sugar hello sweetness really it's got like a crunchy um it's it's like a cookie it honestly it reminds me nobody's gonna remember this way back in the 80s they had these things called carnation breakfast bars this very much reminds me of the texture i wish they would come back out with those of a carnation breakfast bar but they were very very sweet i don't know why they they quit making those but this is not sweet at all no i do like the texture no i like it i don't um i just i would like it more if there was some sweetness behind it yeah there's nothing about that barley okay yeah yeah we're not keeping those okay but now peanut butter all i get is bitterness and gritty grain whatever that is in the middle peanut butter i like peanut butter just natural peanut butter peanuts ground peanuts this has one gram of sugar as well seven grams of protein two grams of carbs hopefully you can screw up peanut butter fudge 160 calories well the first ingredient it's peanut butter so i don't know yeah um i don't see how i would not like ground peanuts prepare to be disappointed no it does have a somewhat peanut butter kind of flavor but um it's okay i could eat that one over this one any day but still not much i genuinely like the texture of both of these i like that one that one's better feels wrong to be chewing this and not have that any sweetness no i mean none so i'm just so used to with having this texture with a lot of sweetness to back it up and it's just not there i think what i would rather eat just a tube of peanuts than that oh well of course that's what i'm saying though that's supposed to be like a peanut peanut butter bar it doesn't even have a really good peanut flavor it's just we have bought off amazon we have bought and they we've seen them at sam's club they sell them at sam's club they sell the uh single serving of just peanuts in the salted peanuts yeah and i think they're like 160 or so calories for those yes i would rather have just a package of salted peanuts than have this because that has more flavor than this does probably no sugar either this does taste like peanuts it does but there's just it's just flat just like that other one it's just a ah flavor that there's nothing else the peanut butter also has other things mixed into it that doesn't make it even a good peanut flavor that's like other stuff going on yeah like takes away from the peanut flavor exactly so it diminishes it so it's there but it's not as strong as if you just eat a package that's why i was saying you're better off just getting peanuts yeah enjoying the peanuts exactly you're not gonna necessarily enjoy that we love peanuts we love snacking on peanuts though these bars are a pass for me if i was on keto i still think there's probably better things i mean if i was really watching that sugar number for keto you might try the peanut butter because it's the best out of the two but but beyond that i don't even if i was on keto i don't think i'd buy these this is like this reminds me of the poll questions i've been asking on my channel would you rather would you rather have the peanut butter or the chocolate you have to check one you have to pick one you're you have to you there's no choice you have to pick one if i had to pick one i would pick the peanut butter post so would be my choice in the other world but i had to pick but if you had to then this would be the one to pick so i hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music] from", "DK3igT5MHgQ":

butter you can use almond butter if you want and this is actually my homemade peanut butter and the recipe for this can be found in my book full of other amazing quick essential recipes like that too next two tablespoons of coconut oil and I also add a pinch of salt now let's give this a good ol mix this can all be done in a blend if you wanted to but I just wanted to show you the sort of texture that I need you to get when making the base oh by the way my book is available to pre-order on Amazon now I didn't mention that before if you just type in vegan 100 or Gaza Oakley into the search bar on Amazon in any country around the world you'll be able to find it I nearly forgot to add a little bit of sweetness I'm adding 3 tablespoons of a gob nectar so when you get it to this texture you can see it starting to combine really well it's now time to get it into our lined loose bottom cake tin so simply just bundle it all in and compact it into the base it's using a spatula you can even bend the spoon if you've got a spoon this is to spare but using a spatula this fine and using your hands as long as they're clean and just so you know this is a 8-inch cake tin you can use it as a baking tray but it's just so much easier using one of these make sure you're pressing down the edges as well keeping everything tucked in nicely this serves well this makes around twelve to fourteen bars so you're going to make a good amount they're really rich you can keep them in the freezer for at least three months so you've got a constant supply of sexy sweet treats I need to stop saying sex once you've got it all level it's time to pop it in the freezer until we've made our caramel to go on top so I'm gonna pop this in now so to make the salted caramel we're going to be using these amazing dates which have been D stoned I'm using medjool dates and I've got 2 cups going into 1 in G cup next I'm going to add 1 cup of almond milk I've got 3 tablespoons of coconut oil 1/2 a cup of just filtered water pinch of Himalayan salt and now let's get this blended up and it'll turn into the most amazing salted caramel blitz it on high for about 1 minute let's see how good this looks oh wow look that golden goodness looks just like caramel looks amazing so I'm gonna give this a little try that is really good but because I'm calling it salted caramel I'm just gonna add a tiny pinch more of salt just give it one more blitz and then we'll get it on top of the biscuit base [Applause] so our biscuit base is mostly chilled and almost set and it's just time to get this amazing caramel on top the go thick that is that's the exact sort of consistency you want the reason why you need the caramel to be this consistency is because it doesn't freeze totally in the freezer because probably gives us a lot of sugar in the dates which is actually a bonus because you know you don't have to wait for it to defrost totally before eating them they're already nice and melted in the center so once you spoon this all over I made sure it's nice and level we want to get this in the freezer and make sure it's in there for at least three hours I'm happy with that so I'm going to pop it in the freezer it's time to get this out of the cake tin and it should just pop out like so it'll pop that on there and I'm going to cut it up into bars and then I'm going to get it back in the freezer whilst I make the chocolate and then we'll drizzle over the chocolate and they'll be ready to serve within half an hour so as you can see I've just been putting my knife in some hot water and that just helps me cut through it so all I want to do is just cut it up into some nice even bars like so just dipping my knife in each time to keep it warm so it just slices through to cut in so nicely and it's really crunchy the biscuit base I can feed it with my knife cut the rest of the bar then cut once through the middle carefully place the bars onto the tray ready to be coated in the chocolate place the tray back into the freezer for 30 minutes or until you've made your chocolate okay guys I've just got these out of the freezer so I'm just gonna put some pecan nuts over the top and as you can see the caramel remains really nice it doesn't go hard in the freezer it's nice and melted basically so you have to work quickly the pecans just add another little crunch another little bit of flavor and they look really nice underneath the chocolate so to make the chocolate all I'm going to do I've got a half a cup of coconut oil which is melted in there and I'm gonna add some raw cacao powder and it's just literally possibly about half a cup of that after really play it by sort of sight and see how it looks and you want to get that nice thick melted chocolate look and for sweetness I will add some maple syrup if you don't have maple syrup decide agave nectar obviously the caramel is really sweet so we're not going to need too much so when there's no lumps just need to add a touch of maple I know just go in with about a tablespoon give that a nice quick stir and that looks really really nice and I'm just gonna pour it over very very gently I actually like it when they're not fully coated it just adds a little bit of a rustic charm to it pour it over and as you can see it's already starting to set look how nice and shiny that is you have to move quite quickly because we've done it to melt the caramel too much I will put the full written recipe on my website and get all the good quantities for the amount of chocolate to make for the full amount of bars I just added the chocolate that was caught by this grease proof paper back into the bowl I'm just going to finally cover these to the best I can you want that nice crunch on the chocolate when they're set it's going to taste amazing so I'm gonna pop those in the freezer about half an hour and then I'll try them for you so guys here's the seven I coated it in the lovely chocolate you'll hear that crunch first look at this oh wow and look inside the car melted that is pill that I just love the shape of the pecan nut there let me give this a try mmm now it's really really good really really really good I think the only way I can really show the cameras how good these look just by cutting them open and holding them a few look come on guys come and have a look over those [Music] [Music] these just

the peanut butter our peanut chocolate crunch nut peanut butter peanut peanut chocolate crunch these were $7.99 a box at Target but you get five bars in each box the quest f bar is a sweet and savory treble sub snack made with real almonds peanuts and fruit simply delicious they were $7.99 for five this has they all have the same calories they're all 210 calories per bar and I don't know if they all the same yes they all do they all have the same amount of protein 10 grams of protein 1 gram of sugar and 5 grams of net carbs no added sugar it says quest nutrition is on a mission to make the foods you crave work for you and not against you so their packaging looks like a timer that's exactly what I'm saying that they they really make those look like a connoisseurs if you sit there I mean if you sold us sitting there in a box you would glance at that and say oh there's my condo what's that coming yeah yes yeah so this is the chocolate mixed nuts and it has almonds peanuts pistachio sea salt they use a stevia sweetener if you're like you want half of that or if you want No I love goodbye mm-hmm Oh Jim I think this is the best thing question tonight mm-hmm that's really a bowl of the nuts my kids got a good crunch of the almonds mm-hmm these these are I mean we never tried the other two yeah I'm upset calmly but going bye-bye these are gonna be very very successful it's funny the picture looks nothing like the actual wall I think the actual war has more chocolate than bar actually looks better you know the bar has more chocolate coating on it um her go that is delicious I know that you can buy these in singles so - they're selling singles because that way you could primary Volvox right but now I was at Target and I saw them and I wanted to go in and get them target is not the best place to buy eggs if you want to leave singles there they usually sell all their customers in boxes that yeah in bulk other places to get on singles Kroger's really good about having singles but I don't know if they have things have it loves to stop plink what is that Jesus the GNC places like that yeah the Vitamin Shoppe that's not good but if you would have seen these in singles at your stores let us know this is the sea salt caramel on hmm the full mm-hmm the caramel is very sweet now just that one little bite is a mouthful mm-hmm yeah you take small Exodus and just ruling yes enjoyable that would last a long time you know we're counting on that chew it quickly dumb so that you don't have to wait I love the flavor of that caramel the caramel really stands out it's very very sweet and it doesn't have that burnt corn flavor it's just us just a sweet caramel I put all those they have packed it for it would it truly these are gonna be competition for convoys that's exactly they will be calorie the price is about the same in the convoy you're all spins and I think $1 expensive for ya but you are getting tons of whatever nuts they use and I did bomb at Target they may be big anymore specific target you may be able to go in cheaper but I do think these these are completely different from anything from quests that that we've ever had most of their bars are how would you even describe those bars the kind of the quest bars they're like a chewy this nugget we've tried those requests we tried there and do the tortilla chips which I liked we tried those who support the potato chip solution all we did not like to touch ups we tried some cookies and also some pizzas this is the peanut peanut chocolate crunch no one's good it's not my favorite because it's just all one cop flavor mm-hmm when you're eating it it's just thick you're eating peanut butter almost mm-hmm it has a mouthful peanut butter it does it is all peanut it's good I do like it but there's the tropical reason is a little bitter so there's a little bit of bitterness there tip from the chocolate my hope when I buy boxes like this when I'm spending $80 a box that's $24 right here mm-hmm my hope is that when we review it that I'm gonna like it I want to like it because I want to be able to keep it and eat it and not you have to give them away because if I don't like that I'm gonna give them away how will keep all of these I will keep all of them and eat them and enjoy them yeah but work the colors into your diet you do yeah there are a little bit more calories than a traditional why nature Valluvar well to be fair the nature belly burst that I eat are 200 calories oh I see the ones I had 160 so they used to be labeled 190 and then they came out with new packaging and now all of a sudden they're like look 200 so for me going from 200 calories to 210 that's not that big deal yeah yeah if it will work in carving the peanut I really like the peanut I know it wasn't if it didn't have that bitter chocolate I would've liked it if they use the regular milk chocolate or some other kind of chocolate I would have loved it I love the the peanut flavor I like all three I like all of my favorites the sea salt caramel almonds up and my favorite is private first the person was very very good that would be a very close second I wouldn't get that just because of the bitterness I'm more sensitive to bitter though than so that bitterness really I mean I still got that bitter flavor so the bitterness for me is just just overwhelming I have to say though if you like on bars you need to try that yeah McKenna especially these first two these are nothing like the other quest bars if you've tried quest and you don't like the other ones then this is just not even comparison to those these are more comparing to kana bar so it would be interesting to me if you all know right offhand if you can get these in singles how does the head of the prices compare you know are these cheaper or are they about the same price because if you haven't tried this you should tell something unkind bars are not much less than that and you only get like four in the box I see I don't I don't think it's uh I think for all the only good for in a box right so getting five in a box is really good yeah I like that about it too and you're probably right you probably do almost awesome um video

bar there's the nutritional information just in case you want to see it and they also have the peanut butter crunch which I like peanut butter crunch even better but they didn't have those at Walmart where we got these so I'm gonna have to look for those elsewhere but I've always loved crunch berries and stuff like that so you elephant dear front look at how it happened there's the packaging for yeah no these don't have box it's a small bar I didn't have to say that for 100 covers but for a kid's snack for larger it's great but crunch berries are our yellow green yeah it's kind of a hard bar too but oh those teeth tastes like cake yeah it looks like like a rhyme about like the confetti cupcakes that's what it looks like they're good the the white part camera it's supposed to taste like milk and it's a little too for me it's a little too milky tasting it's a little too creamy tasting almost to the point where it's like frosting so I don't know if I like that necessary the bar itself is really good it's good I would I would definitely eat the rest of these kids would love these if you ate these for your kids they were absolutely a lot of these thumbin their lunch box over for us a treat or something after after they eat the lunch they'll eat these up but it if you like that cereal it has the definite cereal taste and the white kind the milky taste it too for me it's a little strong and milky taste but there's too good i won I'll definitely enjoy him and he thrust them but for kids that would absolutely go over the moon for them so if they're really good it's what I just noticed that you get eight of these they're seven now can ate one of them you get eight bars instead of a normal six in bar so that's good I always take these and put them in a different container that's what we're taking out of the box um another thing I'm coming on ice it frosting this may be the wrong word it's just a really creamy kind of flavor to it and doesn't a very strong Barry Smith taste to it too but Tammy tried one too and I think she liked it but it was it's unusual it's different if you're if you've never eaten crunch berries it's kind of odd too but um I told her don't judge crunch berries by this bar because crunch berries are are or very good and these are too but they are a little different so uh so anyway I just wanted to throw that in there if these do get a few more bars with this than you would with the with other bars and they are really good I would recommend getting", "l0WmrRBlyys": "today Kevin and I are going to be comparing the Millville fruit and grain bars to the Kellogg's nutrigrain bars the these are both blueberries the milk bill is an oldie brand they were a dollar thirty nine four eight bars at all day these were two ninety-nine Crowe a Kroger so big difference in prices they may have been as low as 250 if you think Walmart had that Walmart did not have anything but huge monster boxes did that gal they had like oh yeah you can had to buy the big family box with the Walmart Whitmer at or you didn't buy it at all I know well cheaper if you got into Walmart but not going 30 now in shape that's pretty tricky well let's compare some things on there they're blueberry blueberry and they're individually wrapped you get ain't ours let's compare some numbers on one bar is a header 1331 hundred twenty who says it'll make Grammys are more aligned nutrigrain is lower the boom on 37 grams this one's 37 grams so the new terrain is 10 calories one thing Wow the total fat is three ones thirty saturated fat is one month point Bob this trans fat is a brown road cholesterol is zero zero sodium is 90 mine's 110 it's a little more sodium on I don't know a cat trying to get him Oh laughs hello potassium is 105 I don't have potassium on carbohydrates is 24 total yeah 24 sugars is 12 right - protein is one month - and what's your doctor your father - two months three okay so there's little differences here and there Rodney is less calories and less fat yeah yours really sounds the nutrigrain sounds like it adds a little bit more sodium and a little bit more you're sad how much sodium 1:00 p.m. your Manhattan is 90 so it's on the road it would close yeah but for me for somebody if I know as me about calories you know 10 calories you know if he's always smell like food I guess you have to think about the price though as well yeah yep for them to be that close eater yeah you got if you have a family with a lot kids who go through these quickly if they want break it then that price really makes a difference okay now the millville is going to be this one and the new program is is this stuff bill bill nature [Music] okay there's what the tops look like it's a bottom there's a thickness and there's the filling so it's pretty pretty similar each other I thought which one do I smell first milvey oh it's very very soft hmm cook me oh hush I mean Mike hey girl I swear a baby could almost eat this make it count less because there's an economist missions away yeah there's just please go there it's just there's no harm texture hard edges anything like that it's all very very soft there's a lot of blueberry filling yeah the flavor is good it's not super overpowering but it's a it's a nice blueberry flavor yeah not curious if this one's gonna be stronger the textures different flawed Rory mm-hmm the texture of the nature friend wasn't it soft I mean it's still soft nice proud I'm good blueberry but the milk bill was so very very soft that round you know if that cooked for just 30 seconds longer it's gonna make the difference I don't get the blueberry flavor from the Nutri regulator though go ahead I know it does say stronger doesn't hmm the millville actually has a stronger blueberry flavor they're very close they're similar bearing edges out just a little bit take one more bite of the neutralizer at 200 they're very very similar so if you wanted to save some money I think I'll just go with a new dog and be done what yeah don't worry about the ten galleries yeah I think they're close enough to where you could say they're the same pretty much yeah really I do think Noble has just a touch more blueberry to it but but it's not by much it's just a little bit but the maybe that's where the next we think ours is coming from it could be for me they're they're so close that yeah yeah if you don't hear about galleries and most people don't let specially don't know yeah especially tan a dollar thirty minute I mean that's dirt cheap for a bar and they have all kinds of things that's quite new to Rome they have like an apple and I didn't see cherry because I love the cherry the cherry is my favorite major brain so if I could have compared them I would have compared to cherry but they think I didn't see them they're only saw at least at our Aldi I only saw the Apple Cinnamon I think it was and strawberry so you know if they have cherry in the future I would definitely get it though because I think it would be good yeah these yo so yeah save yourself some money and go to all if you have know so I hope you enjoyed the video I will have a picture for you at the end of what's left and thanks for watching [Music]", "sFWxSox-I60": "yes today I'm going to be trying some cereal recommended to my camera and these were $1 for my 5 at Kroger just one the individual serving bowl which is nice this is the captain crunch crunch berries cereal it is one container 150 cottage so you eat the whole thing 450 calories of course that's without the milk so if you add the counter for the milk it's gummy more I'm gonna use this almond breeze almond milk with vanilla flavor excellent in cereal by the way with all those people that recommend that we try this hero takes really good answer I've had it twice now I'm cereal and it's really really good and it's only 80 calories for a whole cup and I don't think you could put a whole cup in there I don't think so so you're talking about another 80 calories max so that's what it looks like you see that the berries in there and they do occasionally make up oops all berries and it's just these it's all this the little berry pieces they they leave out the plain cereal parks so I think that's cool how they do that actually may have them all the time now used to it was a special thing I think I've seen them in the store alone now and it actually gives you a line to fill it up - I'm gonna fill it up - there because I might eat it all yeah 18 cereals yeah it's go along don't know if you can see the line that died line that's where they're saying fill it up - milk will that be really good for kids to pour their own cereal means they know how much to fill up don't overfill it it's a good that's a good idea you got got plenty of berries plenty of just the regular cereal bread crunchy that's all I got attends a berry flavor like a raspberry or a blueberry mix kind of they're pretty good I've actually anything the wool balls are all the same flavor if I had to guess that's really good what does it taste like if he just ate the cereal without the berries this is the yellow part yeah the yellow part tastes like like a Captain Crunch cereal that's all it is just regular crunchy yeah this is a crunchy corny cereal you know like a corn cob cereal that's what tastes like all the flavors in those berries nothing the yellow parts are back grunts bear humming Captain Crunch tell by itself really really well done the berries just add that extra that fruity sweetness that that you really like in the cereal really really good Sara and if you've never tried this serum you like a little bit of a berry flavor and you like something really crunchy give this a try it's really good I think you'll like it so thanks

new to us they were 250 a box at Kroger I have the peanut butter chip that raspberry fruit and green bar someone's like a Kate Barker's a la keyboard I love the bar bar mother granola bar and arms like a cake mine's a granola bar in his at Ojai did not say well let's try yours first though yeah because the texture of this will be different I didn't even notice that these have no preservatives bakery fresh tastes the shelf life on a lot of bars last eight months to a year these are only generally a month and a half so when you buy these you want to try to eat on regularly their website is www.sunbeltchryslerjeepdodge.com been a little bit case these raspberry freedom grab bars are 150 calories each and I like that about them too is there not a really high calorie bars this is soft and squishy like sticky it's all hot here I don't know why they would make sticky mm-hmm new record don't love the right for your father this you know those cookies that your grandmother used to buy the oboe cookies with the circle in the middle yeah yeah yeah yeah they're uh will cookies and they have a circle of raspberry in the middle that's what that nice that's very good those are those real I like that a lot that I like it that there's a lot of the our crust to it I guess it's not crispy though it's very very soft there's like a pop tart words hard no it's very soft and then you get to the fruit on the inside and there is a thick layer yeah other than that yeah it's up there not skimping on that no not at all and for 150 calories I really do think you get off now these are peanut butter chip chewy granola bars now how many of the bar goes do you get you get eight of those they're bigger though these are there's ten of these bars they what I mean my bigger is like they're wider these bars are very compact they still hold a lot but they're very compact they are also 150 calories that's what that feels like hmm good at the inverter hmm sure dad yummy really get my phone almost like a Nutter Butter hmm Kevin's right that tastes just like an interpreter I think it's good as you never better okay yeah it would very much remind you of a Nutter Butter okay so it's got that Odie granola what kind of feel right instead of a hard cookie crunch you're getting it in a bar I think that it's awesome they're very good very soft the other tuna are very soft - they're not like a dry crunchy a very dry moist float right yeah I like them yeah this I would definitely buy those again without hesitation I like those burnt rice pyramids there asteroids were okay the respirator was a little shocked but um I've found that when I first started a box of these not this flavour in particular but it's like you the more you eat on the more you love them and I have really looked forward to you know we've tried a lot of these so we have a lot of in the cabinet and I actually look forward to eating them they're they're really really good and I will enjoy every one of those raspberry verse so how do they stack up against your yeah they're they're really not the same thing as mine has mine are sweeter first of all naturally they're um these are sweeter more nutty like a trip gold granola bar Ryan these are more sweet they really are very very very good though but they they miss I'm missing that peanut feel but I think if you added peanuts to that it would have taken away from the peanut peanut butter flavor lying and I wouldn't have liked to this one right I love the peanut better player may so for me they are both winners they're both winners that if I were if I were to run out my peanut Barb's I would probably give these no could they sell them and I needed to get someone that would probably good thing right well that's good we go well I hope you enjoyed the review

these deals on items are past their expiry dates so they're much much cheaper this expired end of January and it's beginning of March now so it's a month out of date I don't think it should be too bad let's just drop that camera a bit close it won't be too bad Pop's it's so boy fingers right Wow smells blimey smell sweet and fruity which is probably not surprising ASMR moment wow you smell so sweet be interested if any of you guys have ever tried to cut in consciousness a little smaller than I would be actually I've heard that these are like really sharp and like cut your mouth off and stuff which I think Kellogg's crave does and these these do look kind of similar how they're square and they've got pointy edges but on sale for a little one serial filler we always go and dry first certainly not off past its sell-by date or and so it doesn't taste like it is hmm they're nice very sweet they're so sweet quite crunchy and you yeah you get like a corny toast sort of like a mix

just brilliant is so crispy yeah it's like in my one the crispiest crunchy Sierra's over hat hmm that's great there's dusty one says people sweet teeth as well it's been the quencher Sarah love that miss probably the sweetest as well yeah like I say got quite a normal sort of mixed sweetened corn tastes like Corn Pops but there's a little bit more depth of flavor there a little bit more of cereal taste but in amongst all those bold cereal flavors and you get it to do injections of soft artificial mixed berry the milks been in for about two minutes now so let's see what the text looks like two minutes in it's getting a little softer but not much come on I love the sure this must be absolutely horrendous for you no look that's the all berries one that I've got in the cupboard nutritional

oats whole wheat flour unsweetened coconut salt chocolate chips you can use regular or mini and brown sugar whisk it up it's thoroughly combined then you need an oval for vegetable oil in that same cut that you have the canola or vegetable oils add your honey and you'll see that the honey is just going to slide right out send a little bit of vanilla extract with the liquid ingredients together and pour them into the oat mixture now this is a really important time make sure that you use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to thoroughly combine and coat the oats this is the trick to making perfect rinoa bars onto a Silpat or parchment lined baking machine you're going to pour the oat mixture spread it using a spatula or a bench scraper until it's about a half an inch to an inch thick you want it to be in a perfect rectangle they could 325 degrees for about 40 minutes or so just starting to get golden and another curious trick here let it cool completely before you cut it into bars

want one just give me one okay here we go and their bubbly so you see the bubbles lots of bubbles in there that's really good I think the strawberry is strong out the gate and then it just washes away into the milk chocolate that is a really good strawberry milk flavor to me yeah and the great thing about this bar is it would take you a long time reading it would take a very long time yeah well you sure thing you eat them one on the top and you get seven well I can't imagine anybody if I was to buy these all the time I wouldn't break them off individually I can't imagine holding it holding it and just taking a bite out of it well I met a guy at work and you know who I'm talking about won't you that eats when he opens his pop-tarts eat them both together yeah I know he's the first person I've ever seen do that it's weird to me but everybody else is like I've never met anybody in my life today to pop snorts together he opens it up and eats it like his language that's bizarre whoever you are that is bizarre yeah because well I just eaten one anyway now he probably would think that was weird but I was i watch Mike I know weirdest one he's not weird because I take one out ate the crust first and then I pull them apart you pull them apart the bottom from the top because I sang last both the icing over itself I'm weird too hey we all have our little quirks like when I eat a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup I take all the chocolate underneath deeply it takes a long time maybe that way like Ashley dissecting her chicken no no that's just its ring I'm done it - Ashley orders chicken nuggets from McDonald's showing all the crust off and believe it's over it's just gross didn't eat but this is what makes the videos interesting it makes them sick okay this is the caramel 7 for 170 okay I wonder if it's running for it's a big bar once again it's a pocket just like though oh yeah so I have not I don't think I've ever tried caramel that is like this like honeycomb like that not a fan to me that's like maple syrup yeah but it's I don't think it's bad it's not my favorite it's too much it's just it's too maple syrup you from Pete you remember those Canadian maple syrup cookies that were shaped like the leaves that we see I like those yeah I like those a lot so to me that's good I still pray like the mint Aero and Julia also send us a an orange one an orange bar a try so we'll be trying that in a different video okay that one wasn't was good to me now this is going to be Andrews baby Nestle dark chocolate it's 70% cocoa and 70 is a really good place to be one bar is 250 calories and it is very dark we can show you the difference between the milk chocolate and the dark chocolate there's a big difference in color that's a really good sweet dark chocolate I like the texture of it there's a big texture difference in color from milk chocolate the milk chocolates creamy and the dark chocolate has like a crispy coating on the outside very crisp it's like your your teeth are breaking through like six layers yeah you know that's not for me because I'm not a dark chocolate person but Andrew wait that up how does that compare to other dark chocolates I mean you like it okay so which did you like the best out of the three the dark chocolate hands down okay but if I had that but I definitely I wouldn't eat this with the caramel at all and the strawberry you know strawberries like strawberry milk it really is good and the caramel is not bad caramel you just have to really like that maple syrup flavor which I do so anyway hopefully you enjoyed this video and thank you Julia you're gonna see Andrew again in more of these reviews we've invited an ER to stay a little while and enjoy some of more of the Canadian goodies", "6ROflSR5yRY": "horrifying isn't it with all peanut butter flavor you always come back for more nothing but peanut butter taste in each Bunny and this part of a balanced breakfast it's to die for it's the Korean extremes in the butter", "XUlHuNg0c7s": "and for a new bar I'm gonna try one of these peanut butter bars the Captain Crunch peanut butter I had the crunch berry a couple months back and I reviewed those in another video video okay so I'll put a link for that down at the bottom these are 110 calories per bar and but we couldn't find them anywhere when we were did the original review because I network so we actually ended up finding that Walmart of course I happen to open the end that has the country's biggest the peanut butter bar Dupree small for 110 calories the early are kind of small little bar but I like peanut butter crunch cereal so I would think this would be pretty good too here's what they look like so chocolate on the bottom if you like me better crunch cereal you'll like those a lot those are really good I don't think they were strong and peanut butter as the Reese's arm the Reese's tastes a little more peanut buttery than these but these are really good have a little bit of a dark chocolate flavor too so I think they have very minimal opinion better I don't know how they can even call that peanut butter it's good there is but it's not an S to label it peanut butter that's more chocolate and it's good but it's more chocolate yeah they're not as good I think I like this crunch berry ones better but these are good yeah the French berry have a really good strong very fiber and I love peanut butter and these are really good bars but like Kevin said there's more of a chocolate tight now and they do taste like the cereal they'll be like the cereal you probably like these kids like these you", "ONnFDBCi0Uw": "hello everybody today I'm going to show you how to make these really delicious Rice Krispies clusters this is my own recipe so let's get started and you want to fill up a pot with about two inches of water then you're gonna put a bowl over top of it and you don't want the bottom of the bowl to be touching the water you just want the steam from the hot water to slowly melt the chocolate then you're gonna put the pot on the heat and I just turned it on to medium or medium low now for the chocolate I'm using candy melting wafers just milk chocolate if you want more information about what chocolate to use check out my first video on what type of chocolate to use for chocolate candies and where to buy it then I just poured 1 cup of that into the double boiler and added a second cup and you're just gonna let that melt away and you can stir it with a heatproof spatula to promote even melting when you've got it melted perfectly silky smooth like this you're done so we're just gonna turn off the heat and then we're gonna add the rice krispies so here a twist on a heat pad and now for the rice krispies you can use other brands too like crisps rice the clusters just no-name brands it's fine and you can also use any flavor you like I'm using vanilla flavour just because that's what I have open but it really doesn't make a difference and you're just gonna measure out one cup of that to start then you add that to your chocolate and you're gonna mix it in I like to mix it in by kind of folding the chocolate over other rice krispies just I think this helps stop the breakage of the rice krispies but you can do whatever you like now this is a little trick I like to do I like to kind of push the chocolate rice krispies to one side and if I still see a lot of liquidity aqil --it then I like to add more crispies but if you're into having more chocolate than krispies then go ahead and leave this last quarter cup out so just mix that in until it's fully integrated like this and now we're going to align our cookie sheet to put the clusters on and you can use baking paper or wax paper and now we're gonna scoop out the clusters to do that you can use a tablespoon a cookie scooper or an ice cream scooper and I'm using this cookie scooper here it's what I like to use it's just easiest for me and it gives the right size so I like to take a dollop of that and just put it on the cookie sheet it's really simple just keep putting clusters down until you have no mixture left I got about 17 large clusters from this and once you're done you're just gonna pop it into a cool place to let the chocolate harden and I just put this into a deep freezer just for about 10-15 minutes and you can see here that the chocolate is hardened there's also a bit of frost on it and you just gonna let this defrost in room temperature you can store this in your refrigerator or just in the room temperature because candy melts aren't gonna melt so there they are guys and these are really really delicious they taste like a cluster form of a crunch bar so give them a try thanks for watching guys don't forget to Like comment and subscribe for more videos", "VZZNdBGSUzA": "that's why i love", "J8bx3JEYCCc": "[Music] all right so today I want to share with you guys how you can make your own homemade protein bars a lot of people ask me if there's a specific brand of protein bar if I eat protein bars and honestly I only really eat protein bars if I make them myself at home so that's what I'm going to share with you guys today is a really simple recipe you don't need an oven for this it's a no bake recipe all you need is a few ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry a baking dish in a freezer and a fridge and that's it oh and a food processor or a high speed blender super quick super simple let's just get right into this so what you'll need for this is some rolled oats you could also use quick cook oats we're gonna use for medjool dates I have them sitting in a little bit of water right now to soften them we're going to use some hemp seeds some peanut butter some vanilla extract some cinnamon I'm using coconut butter but you could also substitute this for some coconut oil if you don't have coconut butter and some salt and of course your favorite vanilla protein powder you could use whatever flavor that you want whatever brand that you have access to of course I am going to be using the legal like vanilla perform protein all right so first we're going to start off by putting all of our dry ingredients into our food processor or blender if I can't have user I'm adding 1 and 1/3 cup like I said you can also use quick quick oats whatever else you got we're also gonna add our hemp seeds so I've got a quarter cup plus one tablespoon of hemp seeds hemp seeds are amazing they're great high in healthy fats and protein they're an amazing addition to basically anything but they're also really great to add into your homemade protein bars we're gonna add in some cinnamon and [Music] we're gonna add in some salt salt really enhances the flavor of anything I'm adding in three quarters okay another tablespoon at Eastman 3/4 teaspoon of salt and we're gonna add in two scoops [Applause] it's been three days stalking is Instagram same he's in a fade and we're gonna pulse this until the oats are nice and broken up we want these protein bars to be smooth so especially if you're using rolled oats you want to pulse it so the Oaks are not completely a flour texture but they're a really nice fine texture bad jealousy I think it's jealousy but help with it still occur melody I may be [Music] hot looks just about good so this is where our mixture looks like so as you can see there's still some oak pieces left in there but it's not like a complete fine ground flower all right so next up we're gonna add all of our wet ingredients so we're going to add our peanut butter our coconut butter our vanilla and our date so I have these dates soaking in some water because you could add these dates if they're really nice and soft to your food processor right away without soaking them in water but because I want the consistency of these bars to be really nice and smooth I don't want any date chunks left in there so I added just a few tablespoons of warm water and I'm just gonna match up the dates with a fork to make it like a nice kind of fine date paste before I add any [Music] so does it have to be like completely smooth but you want to be mostly broken up so just a lot they're nice and soft in the food processor can really break them down alright so I'm using natural organic smooth peanut butter you could use chunky is it chunky no crunchy chunky peanut butter you can use crunchy peanut butter - it doesn't we're gonna put in half a cup one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract oh I forgot you also need maple syrup for this recipe I forgot it was in the fridge and I didn't take it so I'm adding two and a half tablespoons of maple syrup you could also use ghave or whatever liquid sweetener you have but seeing the Canadian that I am over here we're gonna have to make a syrup I'm going to add in my date paste mixture here you could also entirely leave the maple syrup whoo if you don't want to add the maple syrup because we're already adding dates but I just find that it helps to bind everything together a lot nicer and next up we're gonna add coconut butter so for those of you that don't know what coconut butter is it's not like coconut oil where the oil is extracted from the coconut this is a blended mixture of the meat and everything so all the good stuff is in here I really like using this instead of coconut oil because you're getting the fiber in there so when you're adding this you want to make sure that it is melted before you measure it and before you add it because as you can see it's a nice kind of hardened texture so just like a coconut oil would it hardens at room temperature so I'm going to scoop up a little bit put it in a bowl and throw it in the microwave just for a few seconds to soften it up it is now a nice liquid form yeah it's nice and white and creamy it's not like clear like coconut oil but I'm going to add in this and we're going to once these are all pressed out into bars we're going to set them in the freezer for them to set up and this coconut butter or if you're using coconut oil will just help to set them up and keep them nice and firm so now all that's in there and we're just going to pulse this up so here's what our mixture looks like when you grab it should stick together like so and when we press it into a bar and we put them in the freezer it they'll stick together a lot more so now I'm going to transfer this mixture and put it into I just have a lined baking dish here and with some parchment paper and we're just gonna press this out evenly into some bars so I use my fingertips to mostly press this all in and I'm just using a spatula because I like it to be at level and pressed evenly as possible all right they're all pressed beautiful it just looks like one big protein cookie and now this is completely optional but not really I have some dark chocolate chips here that I'm going to melt and I'm going to drizzle some chocolate on top because what's a protein bar without chocolate you know when you go to the store and you buy a protein bar most people buy the ones that are covered in chocolate because it feels like you're eating a dessert ooh salted pretzel that's a great idea for an protein bar we should I should have done that instead of this should have made a salted pretzel mmm covered pretzels are the best anyways so I think I'm just going to throw this in the microwave for a few seconds at a time and stirring it just to make sure nothing burns and then we'll drizzle some chocolate you know it could be a professional like a real chef and do like the double boiler where you put the glass bowl and the water boiling underneath but you know I just don't got time for that I'm trying to show you guys how to make a quick and easy recipe most people got a microwave so use it don't be ashamed use the microwave history milla it looks like he just open that yeah look at that well because this protein powder has turmeric in it so over time your protein bars will become more and more yellow if you're using the Beebo less protein but that's just kind of the turmeric it's all good stuff all right so we've got our vegan melted dark chocolate I could just sit here are the spoon that would actually be too much for me so now do i drizzle or do i cover the whole thing up - Carla thinks I should cover the whole thing of course I know I melted waste people chocolate you never have enough melted chocolate though am i right or am i right I'm right all right we're covered in chocolate kyle is drizzling the rest of the melted chocolate on some rice cakes if you've never had dark chocolate covered rice cakes then you have not lived there the best things ever but I did it coating and now I'm gonna set it in the freezer 20 to 30 minutes just to get everything nice and hard and then we'll cut them into bars you should put chocolate all over a healthy food so so you'd eat more healthy food but doesn't that negate the effect of eating healthy food if you just cover it with chocolate no health tips you don't like healthy food cover it in chopped [Music] what is it you want to smell it's a protein bars you're like yuck not my kind of protein lady all right good here come say bye good bye everybody - protein bars are the best you should totally make them alright so I broke one as I was cutting it that's what happens I guess when you do a whole layer of chocolate but these are super simple and easy to make they don't take that long at all and you can store these in the fridge and then maybe if you want to keep them for a longer periods of time you can just store them in the freezer these are amazing for pre-workout post-workout they're even great as like a little healthy dessert travel snack yeah a roadtrip snack they're really there they're good source of protein they've got really great plant-based healthy fats in there for you and they're also a really great source of good carbs from the oats and also the dates so they're just all around a really great healthy but they don't taste healthy protein bar that layer chocolate is everything it tastes almost like a peanut butter cookie it's really good also feel free to play around with the flavors if you have a different flavor protein I think that like Kyle was saying earlier the salted Mac and caramel from people egg would work really good in these protein bars but you can also add in different ingredients to the bars I'll leave it to you guys but this is a really great base recipe I really hope you guys try it out I will link the full recipe in details in the description down below I hope you guys enjoyed this little recipe video if you do make these bars make sure to take a picture and tag me on instagram because i love seeing you guys recreate the recipes that I make on here and I also love hearing the feedback and how you guys enjoyed them how your family and friends enjoyed them so please let me know thank you guys so much for joining me today and I will see you guys really really soon if I can't have you I don't want to have anyone and if you don't be it something wrong [Music] you", "4wtF2SZloo4": "hey guys it's Rachel from rachael republic i have an omni recipe and it's how to make a matcha white chocolate bar topped with coconut flakes and freeze-dried raspberry you'll only need four ingredients and this includes white chocolate matcha powder freeze-dried raspberries and coconut flakes so first we're going to go ahead and melt the chocolate and also temper it so make sure you have a candy thermometer but if you don't don't worry just melt the chocolate icy would normally in a double boiler we're going to heat up three-quarters of the white chocolate that we have and set aside the other quarter for later when the chocolate is at 110 degrees fahrenheit remove it from the heat and then add in the extra quarter of white chocolate that we set aside and stir that in until it's nice and smooth [Music] now we're going to add our matcha powder and stir that in as well [Music] [Music] so now we're gonna add half of a quarter cup of freeze-dried raspberries that we're using for this recipe so don't add all of it just add in half and once those are mixed in we can move on to the coconut flakes so only use half of the sixth cup of coconut flakes that we need for this recipe [Music] now your mixture should be a little bit lumpy but that's okay we are going to pour the white chocolate onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper since I'm making a pretty small batch here I'm only going to use about half of this mini baking tray essentially you're just going to want to smooth out the chocolate as best you can on the surface [Music] once you're satisfied with how it looks we can go back to that 1/2 cup of freeze-dried raspberries and coconut flakes that we didn't use so just gently crush some of the freeze-dried raspberries and sprinkle that on top and then do the same for the coconut flakes [Music] now we're gonna put the matcha bark into the freezer for 30 minutes or you can let it sit at room temperature for about two hours [Music] once it's nice and solidified we can go ahead and chop it into little pieces so if we're bark you can link your like peppermint bark you can use your hands to break it up or you can use a knife that's what I did but it was a little bit of a struggle I'm not gonna lie but I think they turned out really well at the end this recipe yields about eight pieces of matcha bark but if you want more just go ahead and double the recipe you guys definitely have to try this recipe out and let me know if you do it tastes really good it's like a very nice sweet matcha bass topped with a little bit of tart raspberry and unsweetened coconut which actually adds a lot of flavor and compliments then watch this flavoring really well so I hope you guys try this out and I'll see you next time bye", "G5BfjeLgmfA": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying it some chipping dipped chocolate ear candy bars I have the milk chocolate pretzel the milk chocolate crunch and milk sea salt add almond these were $2.99 each at Marshall's and they were up at the front next to the checkout so a lot of times the frustrating part about places like Marshalls and home goods and TJ Maxx is they put all these interesting foods up front the open you'll be the impulse buy to get you to buy while you're checking out right but they put different things at each register and so as someone who is looking for those different foods unless you go up there she does which I do unless you go up there and look you're gonna miss these I would have totally missed these if I had waited in line like anybody else I would have missed them because we didn't even go to the register where these were located so what I do is I leave Kevin I say you wait in line if it's a long line you wait in line and then I go up and I'm the little lady that's saying I just want to look I'm not trying to cut in front of you so that's me because I want to see these things so we actually bought I think seven of these candy bars so we're gonna be doing a review of the four remaining candy bars next so you'll see that one probably tomorrow so you got four big like squares like that this is looking 200 then in the back it's got you can see where it has the pretzels I want chocolate and I've never heard of this Brian oh there are those kind of threats like a Snyder's and these are actually made in Huntington New York and there are $2.99 each but there you get two and three four servings per bar so 30 grams it doesn't tell you how many pieces you get 30 grams is 161 calories but you did get four and Foursquare three three four four it's good it's a pretzel in the chocolate it is I like that mm-hmm oh now it's for the lower salt in the pretzels but beyond them that's only a small complaint mmm like the salt I really like the chocolate itself to know chocolate is very sweet yeah but the pretzel is good the pretzel adds French dirt there's a little bit of that pretzel leaf lavery nomicon bread slicer yeah but it's really good and it makes a difference I'm sure will notice the difference um and this one with it not being there but now this is called milk chocolate crunch this is handmade all-natural non-gmo and there are three there's three walks on four let me see what it was oh okay so it's a two and three four servings per bar thirty great it would be interesting to know went to one of those weighs 30 grams is 168 calories I don't know that is that we're gonna be the same because like this one have more cereal on this side this one doesn't have as much cereal so well it's an 82 gram bar mm-hmm Danny Graham yeah sorry yeah we're trying to figure out how many it's about half a little mixed sense is this two and a half circle are somewhat Jimin 3/4 ounce so you're thinking you can about the ones less than half no 468 galleries come on yes first square but I mean the first where's Madame either hundred sixty-eight galleries isn't much when you're thinking about a candy bar you know like a Snickers bars usually what 240 years ago we read the whole wall and that's what I'm saying so you could eat more of that but because this is so rich I don't know I don't think you would be tempted I mean I guess you're always gonna be tempted to eat a whole one but he's so rich I don't know that you would want to it would probably give you a stomach ache if you ate the whole bar at one time because it is it's so good it's so sweet that's the thing about it too it's it's really good chocolate but it's it's sweet chocolate so and I like the crunch what did you think of the crunch it's good it's a syrupy so did you like the the pretzel better I like s0 a little better the crunch you did yeah the pretzels were adding much yeah I just I like that crunch of the pretzel so I mean I like them both but I like the pretzel better okay now this one is milk C salted almonds yes I have to say oh there's only a few ons like there's 1 2 3 4 5 and this other half for literally didn't have let me say I'll take this one well there's one within home I want you to try how did that I don't think there's this one has the most calories this is three servings per bar so I guess is 175 euros no one another I did get no didn't make it different some flavor one it just had a texture no that one also out of the bunch this part that at least I roll I did get some almond in the bite that had on them but for me yeah it was it was my least favorite out of the three yeah doesn't lever who's the chocolate and the chocolates not bad I like it this is kind of a crumbling chocolate when you bought it to the kind of crumbles rumbles up yeah I really do like the chocolate it's good and I love the what would you call that the impression of the ordinary to me that looks very old-fashioned it looks old school like back in the the 1920s or so rounded edges and the chunky look of it I bet the look of this bar really appeals to me it says it screams old-fashioned I like the chocolate though I would pass on the almond just because for me it's not a big deal but either one of these the crunch or the pretzel I think of area yeah I like the front one it's just I know that after this the crunchiness of it and the other one and pretzel now ah whatever the only bad thing is for us in our area we've only seen them one time in Marshalls and I guarantee you if I went back today Marshalls they would not have though so I'm assuming since they're in Huntington New York I'm assuming this is a northeastern brand so you'll have to tell me if these are in our common in all grocery stores like do you have these and just Rick are they sold in Walmart or in the New York area you know let me know that piston that's interesting to me the website is www.pevs.com just like the night which was the hot thing it is an odd name that's what I'm it got my attention so that's good so I'm gonna have a picture for you at the end of each one of these and thanks for watching [Music]", "-i9AW4keKgI": "i'm the

nova scotia though you've never been you'd never want to be here now i bet it was pretty when the snow falls oh after you i think i oversold this one when i when i talked about it being the best or almost the best after actually having a bowl when i'm sober like not high i was like okay like it's it's good but not insane [Music] i wouldn't say it tastes the best but the smell is this is what gets me i like the smell a lot i wish they'd do more of you know the actual cabin crunch the way the the bits look why can't they just use those with these flavors instead of flavor then like this yeah like have those little chests like the captain crunch does yeah i think this is actually captain crunch to the core taste too i'm thinking way too hard about this but this is such a good cereal like seriously watch the cereal fall out of nowhere oh yeah all right let's see oh he's got the crime scene yeah the crime scene bowl look at that that's called control your before out of nowhere milk it looks like a waterfall from that now what's your favorite cereal right now i'm honestly really digging the um the oatmeal cream pie cereal for some reason not not a lot of people like it but i like it i got a box i can show you i'll be right back [Music] did you not get the cereal yet oh you see it does look good yeah yeah yeah where's the cream at is sprinkled on them apparently it's uh on the outer like it's a coating they have a vanilla captain crunch i like vanilla in my cereals like vanilla flavoring or like vanilla almond milk that's what i have is vanilla almond milk that's why i don't enjoy cereals as much now just having regular mouth okay it's more of a thicker milk that's why i get soggy too quickly man i love eating this cereal but this is i don't know i mean hello halloween crunch was disgusting this this is this is okay i would say it's better than halloween crunch oh 100 and christmas crunch is just like captain crunch with berries i know like seriously really take your advice because i feel like some of the stuff that you like i like like having another bowl this this crunch realized you're kind of saying yeah it's okay and actually i'm saying it's okay too it's not amazing [Music] are you gonna try the milk which milk in the cereal bowl like go drink it you know i i'm not finished yet no already i'll have a little more yeah oh my god it's a hard cereal but it doesn't have the sharp edges so it's not it doesn't cut you up right right yeah maybe they did this way because people were complained about it they're like well to keep those people liking cabin crunch and not complaining about cutting their mouth up they can try their flavors oh my gosh it's insane um i think a few weeks ago i think i posted it on on my my instagram story they're making like those mega sized boxes what would you rate that cereal out of 10 points kevin out of 10 yeah overall like giving all all things considered yeah i'll say a six [Applause] a little bit above average okay and the milk how's the milk i'm just seeing you take that yeah that was delicious you're spooning it huh i can kind of taste a little pancake flavor there oh yeah it needs more butter like that buttery flavor is get the cookies and ice cubes get them out get the captain crunch mouth take them out [Music] freeze it and then have pancakes the next night and then just [Music] like let it melt on top of a hot pancake hey two bowls of that stuff i'm going to give that out of 10 points an 8.5 does it does recreate the taste so anyways man thanks for uh thanks for this again

creamy milk chocolate almonds and toffee chips this was recommended by Natasha and Eric and Rachel a lot of people have told me that I need to try a symphony bar and then they Nestle chunky bar I don't know that I've ever had one of these it is milk chocolate with peanuts and raisins chocolate yeah I did not know it even had raisins I've never even had that and then Kevin and I did a review on the regular Twix and the peanut butter Twix then Heather contacted me and she said they have redone the Twix Kevin and I did not like the peanut butter flavor in the Twix bar it did not taste like the peanut butter that we remember from our childhood so Heather says they come out with it again it says new recipe on it it says creamy peanut butter the old ones did not say that so I'm trying it again because other people have said I'm surprised to even bother trying I'm trying it again because this is the new recipe hopefully this is the one from my childhood so which one do you want our first I'm the champion now key in key piece of information neither mom or I like raisins well that's her taste bunch of died away and you know what I was gonna try to open this so carefully because I try to get a good picture for the end just now if the pictures horrible it's not from lack of trying because I'm trying to open this and all the information is getting stripped away there might not get a picture at the end okay so it's four little squares divided like that yes that's not oh let me give you calories I'll break can you break it the calories in there's okay 190 calories that's not bad now what was on the front I don't think like a bad one hello eyes like johnboll chumpies I've never had one it's nothing special I didn't get rifle oh yeah poison - no you're clearly not he's raised in it my piece didn't everybody's good never isn't oh wow what just fell thing you know I had no razor but I thought it was it's a good name just like any reason it it's not a very strong chocolate but it's a good chocolate yeah I don't know that I would get it again there are other things I'd rather have and not have to dodge the raisins it's not about the raisins for me they were just like she said there are other cameras that I would just rather high but it's good it's just yeah it's something special okay the symphony now this is the one with almonds and toffee chips it is 220 calories for the entire ball like the packaging it says lift and pull here hold this we're just turning into me I'm just trying to read the directions l because I don't want to tear it up this is the way they all know okay this looks it's not broken up in the traditional Hershey bars or whatever they're calling a herd of commercial reason I'm talking about well you can take a bite look this is the bite what is this coffee milk chocolate almonds and coffee cherry almond that's my taste that's good it's better than out it's creamy it's not something I would get all the time flavored oh I think it's the toffee but it's gonna bark something got scorched in there yeah that's not something I would get I'm gonna I like it it feels rich it feels like definitely if I wasn't eating it for the video I can make it last a long you could somehow fix it up for a long time I disagree with you I don't think it tastes burnt let me get that I think it takes like toffee and almonds that's the coffee flavor because I eat plain almonds from the bag like I'll buy a bag of almonds and eat them I think it tastes like almonds so do you like that I don't know if I get all the time like there are other things I'd rather have it's not a thing for this one said it's rich to me I like it a lot but you always looked at those brown eyes over some reason thought they were white chocolate this cuz the color of the packaging I don't know what I've always talked about okay and now we have the new peanut butter Twix oh I'm sorry the calories to 250 calories and it looks oh wait wait oh god no is this gonna be the good peanut butter the original tricks is better that's good I like that I like it better like after I think a regular clicks is better yeah knock the caramel better when you prepare out to a regular twigs this is no flavor Wow all you can really taste is a peanut butter it's kind of weird really doesn't taste like the peanut butter how'd you taste it it's yeah I think when you compare it to the one that Kevin and I tried in the previous video that one had a chocolate cookie with the peanut butter which is totally not how it's supposed to be it's supposed to be just a regular cookie this is much much closer to the original peanut butter Twix that's good so for people who commented and said don't know why you tried it it's terrible try this one and see what you think and then leave me a comment because I would like to know if you think this is closer you know it only costs $2 to give it a try and if you don't like it you can give it to somebody else so out of these three would you buy any of them again I'd have to be in the mood for it like I wouldn't want one of these a surprise he go but this one I might not a symphony you like yeah yeah mmm I would probably buy the Twix again I mean I would buy the symphony again I like it but I do like the peanut butter twits but I'm a peanut butter person I am too but I'm like I would rather take a normal Twix and dip it in peanut butter and then eat it calories calories so anyway hope you enjoyed this I know we did so thanks for watching", "TCynzbSiVLs": "today Kevin and I are gonna be reviewing three nestle guard story these were all sent to us from a cabin in Canada so we have some Canadian candy bars for you the this is the white arrow bar this is the new dark cherry truffle bar and this one is a coffee crisp stick but it is it's salted caramel salted it's written in small letters it's salted caramel salted caramel so we're gonna try the white bar first it says to fill the bubbles melt it is white chocolate Center with milk chocolate shells sorry I couldn't write variable arrow bars are usually 1g but you might know by your tongue to do it yes now I thought it was gonna be this is the chocolate coming oh dude it's a chocolate other than white chocolate it's white chocolate Ginza okay so the bar looks like this on the inside it is white and the entire bar is 230 calories Hiro's good they're not they're not well consider the chocolate they're not the better than nestling yeah yeah they're not the best one but it's a good song no but it is good you honestly I'm tasting mainline milk chocolate how did you I was a little bit of uh-oh I was really hoping to get a white that white chocolate Center I was hoping it would be really powerful white chocolate and it's really not and the the milk chocolate so strong that you know for kind of overrides that white it's still a good candy bar but not my favorite aero bar it's the new wow that's looks so good that cherry this is the new truffle it's a dark cherry trouble bar it's a hundred and ninety calories for seven seven of these pieces like that it is milk chocolate Center with dark chocolate shell and cherry flavored milk chocolate truffle filling it's like in the wolf's don't bark those little chairs out I just I got Sonic over Jay so does dorm taco mm-hmm you really get that that dark chocolate but it's not it's a little bitter but it's not enough to turn you away from enduring know about it's very good you definitely get the bitterness from it yes the cherry group it's a nice cherry flavor it's good that's very good it's not one that I would buy all the time you know how sometimes when you eat dark chocolate it kind of leaves your mouth filling dry kind of dry yeah and that that leaves your mouth did you do yeah cuz the back of my throat clap yeah it leaves your mouth filling dry so that's not one where I would eat a whole bar I don't even think I would eat seven segments of that I just think I think one piece of that I don't know that this is gonna be something I would buy I don't know that this will stay around because it does and I'll come apply to it yeah yeah okay not bad though okay this is the coffee crisp sticks in salted caramel it says for both bars mmm smell that coffee both bars are 160 calories so not bad at all it says makes a lot a nice light snack yeah hundred sixty calories but at all the bar that's away from there like a nutty bars on that's my favorite that's delicious the probably is not there to although that's awfully coffee it's incredibly sweet very very sweet I got a salt I didn't get the salt until I was hit swallows no seven and then I had some salt left in my teeth are you gonna call me later yeah I knew I got coffee all through it but then when I got ready to swallow it that's what I tasted the salted caramel I love that I think that is so much good mama am i huge fan of a dark black coffee do that can I do the dark black coffee but it's better in milk chocolate so I mean for me I think it's it's just very very sweet I like it how they put the maple leaf on there and let you know it's Canadian well out of the three that would be probably the one I would eat too although I like the white arrow just doesn't had a good chocolate flavor the cherry one how it actually liking a lot better if it is a milk truck and milk chocolate instead a bit of milk everyone said that was my back I liked that cherry yes I totally agree with everything you said sounds of chocolate school little it is a little dark for me right my great thank you so much to Kevin for sending these to us we really appreciate it I'm gonna have a picture Bri at the end to my Canadian friends if you've had these bars and you agree or disagree let me know in the comments below because you all know I love hearing what you have to say and thanks for watching [Music]", "w1xPE89msqY": "no you don't [Music] oh [Music] crunches crush", "583PN1204Gs": "yo news welcome to the ultimate vegan ice cream this is an incredible ice cream this is a treat for you most vegan ice creams often are based around sorbets that are all from coconut milk they're often underwhelming this is a party this tastes incredible genuine is we've got a we're using cereal milk which might be new to you might be not we used to love this as kids all the soap cereal we're making with this we're making a homemade Nutella that's pamela free it's class and we're putting roasted hazelnuts truth yeah and it's based on a simple emotion based round of cereal milk incredible delicious and here we go first step we're gonna make is our cereal milk this was a cool invention but a book called Christina Tosi she kind of formed this really famous cafe in New York called milk bar so what we're gonna do is we have 100 grams of cereal of choice as kids rice krispies is always a treat for us but whenever your cereal your sentiment is genuinely rice krispies this is Rice Krispies okay so I have 100 grams of rice krispies I have five milligrams of simply unsweetened soy milk and it goes and it's quite important to use soy milk consumed or soy milk naturally has soy lecithin it so multiplied so much important to use this rather than rice or older almond leave that soak for 20 minutes our serum milk has soaked for 20 minutes we have a bowl we have a sieve and we're gonna drain off the cereal we just want the milk so our milk is gonna reduce from about 500ml dent approximately 300 mil so it's gonna reduce significantly but it's gonna be infused with that wonderful note of cereal so clearly it's delicious this was something we loved so much as kids yeah just give it a good squeeze and it adds a certain flavor that you just wouldn't get it's just really really good so we're just giving it a squeeze just to kind of extract as much of this lovely milk as we can okay cereal milk just make sure you 300 mil so if you only end up have 150 ml just add in 150 ml of soy milk next step we're gonna roast our hazelnuts I have a hundred grams of haziness just pop them in a preheated oven 180 degrees roasting for 10 minutes okay while they're in the olden time to make our emulsion so we have our blender okay take out your blender pop in your 300 mil of cereal milk super infuse flavor really flavor very nice and that time to make our emulsion so take the top off your blender like that we're gonna squeeze in juice of half a lemon and this doesn't have to be a high speed blender any blender works just make sure to take the little lid off so you might be gone lemon is inappropriate in ice cream but lemon is what encourages the seizing or the emulsion to happen without lemon it's the active ingredient without if it doesn't happen you see what I mean like when it happens okay now we've equal part soya milk to oil weaves artistry hundred mill of sunflower oil you want a neutral tasting law so sunflower works really well so I'm starting this rolling at a slow speed tasty report before that in slows so look at this look so just to show you exactly one of the most is it so it goes like a mayonnaise like texture that's what it goes like this is a cereal milk emulsion which is gonna be the basis of our ice cream ice cream ultimate ice cream egg step I don't know the liquid sweetener we're gonna use maple syrup 100 ml and it goes you give a lovely maple II kind of caramely undertone now special ingredient this is gonna give the chocolate flavor we have one tub 180 grams of our own homemade chocolate spread if you want to make it yourself and got a video which we shot up how to make it sort but it's very easy to make just follow up so this is about 200ml question if I don't wanna make my own pretty just use any kind of chocolate spread yeah so perfect 200 grams of chocolate spread of choice yeah very nice okay and that girl is this yeah we're now just Lenny blendy mmm it's good recipe this is one of Stevie's recipes yeah yeah why look at that serious so serious it's a serious because you end up getting this serious creamy delicious almost like custard really serious like a chocolate mayonnaise but that a present if you're any owner you could try that look and it's like a custard I'll go game yeah you'll oh my god but that's just boom mmm okay there's nothing in the oven ten minutes let's whip them out so you'll see they roasted lovely why do you like the hazelnuts which is great as it gives a nice variety of texture to the ice cream so if you didn't wanna use hazelnuts you could use chocolate chips if you all want to really make this decadent and so we're gonna this is how to dscan them and how to smash them up easily just pour them into a clean tea towel just wrap them up like that give them a good and this is just an essence they're banging off each other and you're taking the skin age any other ones that you don't like to look I just give them a little rub jeez the works really well there so what do I want me to do now next step well this is the lazy way to chop them up just make sure get rid of that that husk my daughter may love to put them in a little plastic bag and bang them with a rolling pin but I'll show you another lazy way this is the fun that this is a bit so this is a bit if you're angry or you're feeling a little bad just wow did didn't know that's nice so we got a variety texture there looking pretty good demonstrating here we know we're gonna use an ice cream maker obviously not everyone has these at home if you don't want it at home just put it that I put in the freezer and once it goes solid take it out blitz it up but you're gonna have to chop it up blitz it up this what happens is if you put it in the freezer right now as is there will be crystallization it won't form this beautiful creamy texture so you're gonna have to put it in once it sets or it's a three-quarter set take it a blend it again break down those crystals put it in again and then only then mixture the hazel [Music] and okay well it's move we're gonna add in our hazelnuts so this is 100 grams of toasted hazelnuts that my brother politely bashed just add them in they're gonna be slowly mixture Eldin as they go and frozen it's nothing he does she said really killed like it mixes it really slowly in voila there you are that's 60 minutes 17 frozen you got a beautiful so we're serving this with about -10 it's amazing bein told you do it I can't touch that seriously good ice cream mmm I cannot as little my favorite ice cream was always pistachio and then it's just reminds you of us so it's not chola it's like a chocolate really really really good it's rich its creamy it's got being its texture its father okay comment below what's your favorite ice cream which genuinely love to know this is definitely our favorite it's taken Steven and his daughter may developed us and it's really good um thanks for watching dude said he loves love and let us know what you think in this ice cream cheers bye", "44L6jokx6B8": "It's really light and fluffy. Oh, amazing. Hello and welcome to\nin the kitchen with Matt. I am your host, Matt Taylor. Today, I'm going to\nshow you how to make homemade glazed doughnuts. Oh, yeah, \nI love homemade doughnuts. These doughnuts are very \nsimilar to the ones that you get at Krispy Kreme, \nthat popular doughnut place here in the United States. So yummy. Really easy to do. Simple ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it. Before I move on, make sure to \nsubscribe to my channel and hit that notification bill so you \nwon't miss out on any of my new videos. Let's get started down below in \nthe description, but you'll find a link where you can print \nthis recipe out on my website as well as a list \nof the ingredients. Now, I'm going to begin with \none half cup of whole milk plus one tablespoon. And I heated it up \nin the microwave. Or you could do it on the \nstovetop and you want the temperature to be pretty warm. So in between about 100 degrees \nFahrenheit and 110 Fahrenheit, that's just going to be hot \nenough to activate the yeast. And I'm going to\ntake some of my sugar. I have one fourth cup of sugar \nhere and I'm just going to put a teaspoon in the milk. It's not totally necessary \nbecause the milk has some natural sugars in it already. But I just want to have a \nlittle bit of food for this yeast and then to\nadd one fourth teaspoons of active dry yeast. Or we could use like\nthe rapid rise or the instant yeast. And I'm going to just put my \nfork in here, just agitate a little bit. All right. And I'm just going to let this \nsit for about 10 minutes until it gets nice and foamy. And if after 10 minutes it's \nnot foamy, then that means the milk wasn't hot enough or maybe \nthe yeast was bad or old. And you'll want to \nstart again. You want to make\nsure it gets really foamy. So, you know,\nthe yeast is good. All right, until it gets nice \nand foamy just like this. And then when I'm going to do \nis I have a big bowl here and normally I would just \nuse that bowl. But for the sake of filming, \nI use the smaller bowl for the yeast. We only just put hot\nmilk in this big bowl. And then I'm going to\nadd the rest of this fourth cup of sugar. I'm going to add one large egg and then I have three \ntablespoons of butter here and I'm going to just melt this in \nthe microwave 30 seconds or so until it's nice and melt it. Or you can do it \non the stovetop. We don't want it to \nbe really hot. Just barely melts. OK, if it's too hot,\nit's going to cook that egg. All right. So I'll pour the melted butter \nin with the egg and the sugar and the yeast, the milk and \nwe'll take a risk and just give us a good risk. Excellent. And now in this bowl, I have \ntwo and one fourth cups of all purpose flour. I'm going to add three fourths \nof a teaspoon of salt and one fourth \nteaspoon of nutmeg. Nutmeg gives you that \nawesome flavor and will come in here \nwith a whisk. It's whisk that together. Back over here to this mixture \nwe will put in. About a third of the dry \ningredients first and we'll take our whisk and \nwhisk this together. All right, I'm going to put the \nwhisk away now because it's going to get too thick to use \nthe whisk or switch over to a silicone spoon, or you can use \na wooden spoon to put some more of that flour in there. You don't want to you don't \nwant to just dump it all in. Make sure to do it\na little bit at a time. And a little\nbit more in their. And then once it comes together \nlike that, I'm going to dump it all out. I'm going to save this\non to the side here. I need it all. So I just dump it\nall out, take some of the leftover dry stuff. Just push it over here \nin this corner. We want this\ndough to be fairly. Sticky, it just produces \na lighter doughnut. When you do that. All right, so I'm just\ngoing to take it all together. Start kneading the dough. We're gonna need it for \nabout ten minutes. So you'll just fold it over, \npush out with it so it stretches and then it's going \nto start to get sticky instead of adding the rest \nof this flower. You may not need that. So that's about two \ntablespoons left over. I don't want to \nadd that anymore. So I'm just gonna take \nsome oil, just some vegetable oil, and then I'm \ngoing to need my the dough with the oil. OK. And then when you're done, \nit's going to be nice and soft and smooth. And what we want to\ndo is take a bowl. And I just put a\nlittle bit of oil in there. And just go up around the sides \nand drop your dough in there and just kind of move it around \nso it gets coated with that oil, and then we\nwant to just cover this with, like plastic wrap or a damp \ntowel and then set it somewhere warm and let it rise. We want to let it\nrise for quite a while. So about an hour and\na half to two hours. And so it's like two to\ntwo and a half times its size once it rises. All right. So onto that step. All right. The Dow has risen beautifully \nand it's nice and soft. And I want to take\nit out of the ball here. Very soft, though, and that extra flower \nthat we have. This flower, that surface and will rule out that No. Not a quarter inch thick \nsomewhere around there, and then they have special \ndoughnut cutters that you can get. I just had my biscuit cutter \nand I'm going to go right down on the edge like this. And then you can use a pastry \nbag tip if you want to go right in the middle for the whole. Now, come right out the door. Well, and that could be, \nyou know, doughnut hole. I also have this other ring, \nbut I think it makes the hole a little bit too big. But you can still use it if you \nwant a little bit bigger hole. You could do that. Well, if you're going to \nmake doughnuts, like all the time, you might\nwant to just get a specific doughnut cutter. Maybe just going to make them \nonce in a while, I wouldn't bother with anyone. All right, and then what I want \nto do is I'm going to take this dough away. And we should be the role that \ndough together, sometimes it kind of falls apart and it \ndoesn't work that well. And so a lot of times I'll just \ntake these pieces and just fry them like this. So they look kind of\nlike a weird shaped doughnut, but that's totally fine. And then I just have a little \nsheet pan here with some parchment paper, and then I'm just going to. Put my doughnut shapes \non their. And then I'm going to cover \nthese and let them rise for another hour, the doughnuts \nhave risen and they look fantastic. Now let's head over \nto the stovetop. All right. With about 20 minutes before \nthe doughnuts have were done rising, I took a pot and I \nput it I put some oil in there, about an inch, \ninch and a half deep of oil. I am using vegetable oil. You can use canola oil, \npeanut oil, any high heat oil. And now we can take these \ndoughnuts and fry them up. And so what I will do. Just drop them in like that and \nwe will cook these up and then you want to just do a couple at \na time, you don't want to overcrowd them and we are going \nto let these cook. I have the oil heated up to \nright around three hundred and thirty degrees Fahrenheit. Three twenty five. Three thirty. And so we want to go. About that much I want just \nturn over and use a fork. You could use like one of the \nspider ladles if you want. That nice golden color, \nwe'll just do that until I get nice and golden brown. Take about thirty or\nforty five seconds per side. And then when you take \nthem out, just go ahead and put them on a wire rack\nand so they can dry. I'll do a bunch of the donut \nholes and just be careful, the oil is going\nto be hot, of course. So just go ahead and fry \neverything up and then for the glaze, I have three \ntablespoons of butter that I melted and I have about a \nquarter cup of milk and I'm just going to add some\nof that milk to it. I'm not going to add it all, mixed it up a little. Then I have two cups \nof powdered sugar. Had all the\npowdered sugar in it, and now it's just getting it to \nthe consistency that you want, if you want to think you can do \nit thick, if you want thin, you can do it thin. All right. I want to add just\na little bit more milk, but another tablespoon. There we go. Nice Ronnie Glaze, and you'll \ntake your doughnut and just put it right in there, take your \ndoughnut and put it right in there and just turn it around, \nmake sure it just gets covered and just placed it on\na wire rack to dry. So I'll just dip all these the \nrest of them, all right, and we'll just let the \nglaze dry, I'll take 15 to 20 minutes somewhere around there \nand once they have dried, they are ready to be eaten. I'm going to break one open and \nshow you what it looks like on the inside. Mm hmm. It's really light and fluffy. Oh, amazing. All right. The homemade glazed \ndoughnuts are done. Turned out fantastic. Really easy to do. If I can do it, you can do it. One thing to keep in mind is \nyou can reuse that oil, just cool it down completely, \nput it back in its container, and then you could use it again \na few more times for doughnuts or bananas or \nsomething like that. Just don't use it for \nanything else, like chicken or meat or something like that. I mattila this has been another \nepisode of In the Kitchen with Matt. Thank you for joining \nme as always.

And.", "KIropBaDQuA": "welcome to peep this out\u00a0\nreviews with Ian K stay frosty what's going on everyone welcome back to\u00a0\nanother high quality foodie feature for you\u00a0\u00a0 here on the channel where i'm back on over at\u00a0\nkfc for another look at their all-new chicken\u00a0\u00a0 sandwich and this time we're going in on the\u00a0\nspicy variant and spicy it most definitely\u00a0\u00a0 looks guys feast your eyes on the spicy chicken\u00a0\nsandwich here at kfc and again a very lovely\u00a0\u00a0 situation in the size of the chicken patty\u00a0\non this this is just looking flat out amazing\u00a0\u00a0 starting off just like the last time we've got\u00a0\nthat classic brioche style bun lightly buttered\u00a0\u00a0 and underneath it we've got a huge chicken breast\u00a0\nhere guys marinated in all the kfc goodness that\u00a0\u00a0 you know and love hand breaded in store 20% larger\u00a0\nand double breaded on top of it and i gotta say\u00a0\u00a0 it looks pretty fantastic underneath we've got\u00a0\nthe usual pickle action and in this case instead\u00a0\u00a0 of mayo we have spicy zinger sauce so that's\u00a0\ndefinitely looking to deliver some extra heat to\u00a0\u00a0 this one and i gotta say the fried goodness that\u00a0\ni'm smelling in my car right now is so apparent\u00a0\u00a0 because this is made ultra fresh hand breaded\u00a0\nin store says a lot about the quality already\u00a0\u00a0 and again guys the lovely situation of the size of\u00a0\nthe chicken patty is amazing on this so let's not\u00a0\u00a0 waste any more time it's the all-new spicy variant\u00a0\nof kfc's all-new chicken sandwich let's do it love that crunch that is crazy good oh\u00a0\nlittle bit of heat actually a lot of heat\u00a0\u00a0 that's actually really good i got a nice end\u00a0\npiece of the chicken patty along with that\u00a0\u00a0 zinger sauce and again with a little light\u00a0\nsoftness of the brioche style bun no pickles\u00a0\u00a0 in that first bite but man pretty amazing\u00a0\nlet's go for another bite we'll give you a\u00a0\u00a0 close-up on this one but guys another beautiful\u00a0\nsituation this is really a banging sandwich you know just like the last time around with\u00a0\nthe classic chicken sandwich here at kfc that\u00a0\u00a0 i reviewed take a look at that review popping up\u00a0\non your screen right now if you haven't seen that\u00a0\u00a0 one just yet the pickles go amazing with this in\u00a0\ngeneral but when you pair that up with that spicy\u00a0\u00a0 zinger sauce a lovely situation and as you can\u00a0\nsee those lovely situations just continue across\u00a0\u00a0 the board with this one guys because the flavor\u00a0\nof the chicken patty is really selling this one\u00a0\u00a0 on top of the crunchiness of those pickles a very\u00a0\nvery great combination together and even though\u00a0\u00a0 this one doesn't have the creaminess of that\u00a0\nmayo which ultimately is not really my favorite\u00a0\u00a0 all the other flavors on this are\u00a0\nreally singing very very nicely\u00a0\u00a0 the flavor of that zinger sauce i got to admit\u00a0\nis really nice in terms of the spice department\u00a0\u00a0 it's got a creaminess to it a little bit\u00a0\nof heat but really the star of the show\u00a0\u00a0 is going to be that chicken patty and\u00a0\nman is it the star it is really amazing\u00a0\u00a0 and the fact that it's double breaded and\u00a0\n20% larger overall you can really feel the\u00a0\u00a0 difference when you bite into this and again\u00a0\nthe same $3.99 price point as you'd expect\u00a0\u00a0 from the industry right now considering that's\u00a0\nreally the going rate for a chicken sandwich\u00a0\u00a0 that's what it should be at a bare maximum to\u00a0\nbe honest considering the bars set by the other\u00a0\u00a0 guys you all know who they are right but guys a\u00a0\nvery lovely situation again let's keep going in man that is so worth the wait so worth the wait\u00a0\ni like the combination of that spicy zinger sauce\u00a0\u00a0 with the pickles it's got just the right amount of\u00a0\nzip the creaminess is there and the heat is there\u00a0\u00a0 but none of that overpowers the flavors of the\u00a0\nchicken which is a beautiful situation you really\u00a0\u00a0 get the classic kfc goodness with this one and\u00a0\nthe fact again that it's double breaded plus 20%\u00a0\u00a0 bigger guys it's just great across the board\u00a0\nand again $3.99 i keep coming back to it you\u00a0\u00a0 can't hate on it for that price point it is really\u00a0\nreally awesome okay so let me go for one more bite\u00a0\u00a0 of this one we'll wrap it up after the rating\u00a0\nbut this is another winner when it comes to the\u00a0\u00a0 chicken sandwich wars right now and especially\u00a0\nfrom one of the kings of the chicken game\u00a0\u00a0 this is absolutely a banging variant of their\u00a0\nall-new chicken sandwich pretty awesome let's go\u00a0\u00a0 well i was biting into this one pretty\u00a0\nheavy guys we're a little bit past the\u00a0\u00a0 halfway point of the sandwich but let's just go\u00a0\naround here and give you a look at everything\u00a0\u00a0 nice and crispy nice and crunchy again all\u00a0\nthe classic kfc flavor that you know and love\u00a0\u00a0 just on steroids and overload with the flavor\u00a0\nof that zinger sauce i think this is gonna be\u00a0\u00a0 my favorite version of the two and i gotta admit\u00a0\ni am absolutely loving it again the pickles are a\u00a0\u00a0 showpiece along with that chicken lovely situation\u00a0\nso just like the first kfc chicken sandwich that i\u00a0\u00a0 just put out recently this is going to be very\u00a0\neasy to score with everything you've seen and\u00a0\u00a0 heard me talk about in this review i'm going\u00a0\nto have to give the spicy variant of their\u00a0\u00a0 chicken sandwich here at kfc a well deserved\u00a0\n10 out of 10 guys it's another perfect score\u00a0\u00a0 it's the same sandwich as the last time out with\u00a0\na beautiful amount of heat to go with and i gotta\u00a0\u00a0 admit again those pickles are amazing with this\u00a0\nyou really want to ask for a few extra on the side\u00a0\u00a0 the quality definitely stands out i think kfc\u00a0\nknows what they're doing in that department\u00a0\u00a0 because they're noticeably different from the\u00a0\nother guys again the 20% larger chicken patty on\u00a0\u00a0 that is amazing the fact that it's double\u00a0\nbreaded you have a lot to look forward to\u00a0\u00a0 trust me okay so i've got one simple question for\u00a0\nyou when it comes to all these fast food chicken\u00a0\u00a0 sandwiches out there right now do you prefer\u00a0\nthe classic variant or the spicy variant what's\u00a0\u00a0 your go to drop some comments down below and\u00a0\ndefinitely let me know and with that this is Ian K\u00a0\u00a0 closing out another high quality foodie

"1AGRLpMGIsM": "welcome to peep this out\u00a0\nreviews with Ian K stay frosty hey everyone welcome back to another high quality\u00a0\nfoodie feature for you here on the channel where\u00a0\u00a0 this time i'm back on over at wendy's because with\u00a0\nfish season in full swing it looks like they've\u00a0\u00a0 brought back their annual menu favorite for a\u00a0\nlimited time only only this time it's getting\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit of an upgrade yesir and i gotta\u00a0\nsay it looks pretty good too feast your eyes on\u00a0\u00a0 the crispy panko fish sandwich here at wendy's and\u00a0\nalready i'm digging the presentation of this one\u00a0\u00a0 guys i already love the thickness of that fish\u00a0\nfillet looking pretty dynamite so let's break\u00a0\u00a0 this one down starting off with a nice shiny\u00a0\nbrioche bun and once we pop it you're going to\u00a0\u00a0 see there is no shortage of dill tartar sauce a\u00a0\nvery lovely situation there looks like we've got\u00a0\u00a0 about three dill pickles to go with on top of\u00a0\nthat and that's all riding high on top of one\u00a0\u00a0 large piece of lettuce and i'm really digging\u00a0\nthat but separating the lettuce from the fish\u00a0\u00a0 itself appears to be a slice of american cheese\u00a0\nso not too bad underneath it you're going to see\u00a0\u00a0 the actual new upgrade that we've got here right\u00a0\nnow no longer is this the north pacific cod we've\u00a0\u00a0 been upgraded to wild caught alaskan pollock guys\u00a0\nso a lovely situation there because of the crispy\u00a0\u00a0 panko goodness on the outside it's breaded up\u00a0\nnicely and fried to a crispy golden brown and\u00a0\u00a0 not that there needs to be any more tartar sauce\u00a0\non the bottom because there isn't it's all on the\u00a0\u00a0 top guys but still the presentation is killer\u00a0\non this and i have to admit that bread crumb\u00a0\u00a0 action is smelling beautifully fried guys a lovely\u00a0\nsituation so without further ado let's see exactly\u00a0\u00a0 how this is going to be this is the all new crispy\u00a0\npanko fish sandwich here at wendy's let's do it mmm crunchy first off the crunchiness of the\u00a0\npickles with the lettuce dovetailed right\u00a0\u00a0 into the crispiness of the fish guys and then\u00a0\nthe dill flavor is coming through on the tartar\u00a0\u00a0 sauce this is pretty lovely so far and the\u00a0\nflakiness of the fish you're about to see\u00a0\u00a0 is pretty awesome let's go for another\u00a0\nbite guys very tasty very tasty indeed yeah this fish is pretty tasty guys and if\u00a0\nyou look very carefully at the pickles riding\u00a0\u00a0 up above it there you're going to see that\u00a0\nthe thickness is not too far off from that\u00a0\u00a0 i think that's from getting a lot of the snap\u00a0\nin the crunch because those pickles are awesome\u00a0\u00a0 the dill tartar sauce has got a nice tanginess to\u00a0\nit so that's adding to the overall experience but\u00a0\u00a0 guys those panko breadcrumbs are definitely a\u00a0\nstandout a very nice fried situation right now\u00a0\u00a0 and i have to admit a very tasty fish sandwich\u00a0\noverall so far too and you know what it also\u00a0\u00a0 helps that we're on this nice little shiny brioche\u00a0\nstyle bun because guys the softness is awesome\u00a0\u00a0 it's super fresh there are no cracks to be found\u00a0\nhere and just to kind of prove that to you again\u00a0\u00a0 very very fresh i've had actually some\u00a0\nexperiences in the past where the bread\u00a0\u00a0 is obviously less than that but this is super\u00a0\nfresh all around so far let's go for another bite yeah that dill tartar sauce along with the\u00a0\npanko is easily standing out now above and\u00a0\u00a0 beyond the pickles believe it or not guys\u00a0\nthere is so much of it on here right now\u00a0\u00a0 i'm really surprised nothing is leaking out\u00a0\nthe back i guess maybe that has something to\u00a0\u00a0 do with the cheese kind of holding everything\u00a0\ntogether which admittedly i'm not tasting the\u00a0\u00a0 cheese at all i don't think it really needs to be\u00a0\nthere maybe for advertising it looks kind of cool\u00a0\u00a0 but honestly cheese doesn't really need to be\u00a0\non something like this at all especially with\u00a0\u00a0 the flavor of that dill tartar sauce delicious\u00a0\nstuff guys delicious and speaking of the dill\u00a0\u00a0 real quick and more specifically the dill pickles\u00a0\ni am really glad that there are three nice size\u00a0\u00a0 slices on here guys they really add just the right\u00a0\namount of accent and flavor but the thickness is\u00a0\u00a0 on point so when you bite into this you're\u00a0\ngonna feel that crunch right away then the\u00a0\u00a0 lettuce and then right into the fish guys and\u00a0\nof course it's housed by that brioche style bun\u00a0\u00a0 that catcher's mitt goodness to get this into your\u00a0\nface in general is another nice round out for this\u00a0\u00a0 one because the quality is very very high on it it\u00a0\nreally is so for about $4.49 here in my neck of the\u00a0\u00a0 woods this is not a bad deal let's go for one more\u00a0\nbite we'll finish this one up after the rating\u00a0\u00a0 but guys another fish sandwich that i've tried\u00a0\nfast food wise and i'm slowly being converted\u00a0\u00a0 to kind of enjoy fast food fish more often\u00a0\nlet's go for one last bite we'll finish it up\u00a0\u00a0 all right so let's go around the world with this\u00a0\none and as you can see again no shortage of tartar\u00a0\u00a0 sauce goodness guys that dill is a real stand\u00a0\nout with this particular version i'm definitely\u00a0\u00a0 digging that there the panko breadcrumbs around\u00a0\nthat alaskan pollock is a lovely situation\u00a0\u00a0 but again that cheese is just non-existent it\u00a0\nreally doesn't need to be there except maybe just\u00a0\u00a0 to hold it together but flavor-wise don't expect\u00a0\nto taste it just digging this overall guys a very\u00a0\u00a0 lovely situation indeed you know i'm trying to\u00a0\nthink back to when i reviewed the north pacific\u00a0\u00a0 cod fish sandwich here at wendy's to kind of\u00a0\nremember if i really liked it or not i don't think\u00a0\u00a0 i liked it as much as i'm liking this because\u00a0\njudging by the thumbnail you're probably seeing\u00a0\u00a0 on the screen here right now my facial expressions\u00a0\nprobably giving it away but even still regardless\u00a0\u00a0 of how i felt about that sandwich then this one is\u00a0\neasily something i'm gonna get again over here at\u00a0\u00a0 wendy's guys because it really is a nice quality\u00a0\nfish sandwich it really is so with that said i'm\u00a0\u00a0 gonna have to give the all new crispy panko fish\u00a0\nsandwich here at wendy's a rock solid 9 out of 10 like i said all throughout the review\u00a0\nthere is no need for cheese to really be on\u00a0\u00a0 this right now because you can't really taste it\u00a0\nbut everything else is an amazing situation guys\u00a0\u00a0 the softness that brioche style bun houses all\u00a0\nthe goodness on the inside and again the panko\u00a0\u00a0 breadcrumbs on that fish fillet that wild caught\u00a0\nalaskan pollock really does stand out flaky\u00a0\u00a0 not super dry but just a lovely situation guys\u00a0\nand it's fried fish how bad could that be right\u00a0\u00a0 all right so i've got just one extra question\u00a0\nto ask you outside if you're going to be giving\u00a0\u00a0 this one a shot is wendy's your go-to when it\u00a0\ncomes to fish sandwiches this time of the year\u00a0\u00a0 is that like your all-time favorite fast\u00a0\nfood fish sandwich drop some comments down\u00a0\u00a0 below and

Crunchie Bars Hi Bold Bakers! Since airing my No Machine\nHomemade Ice Cream video, I've had a lot of requests to show you how to make honeycomb.\nI'm happy to do this because it's really easy, impressive, and also my mom's favorite! Also\nI'm releasing a new video tomorrow as part of a collaboration with Entertaining with\nBeth so make sure you stay tuned until the very end of this video to get a sneak peek\nat what's to come. So let's get baking! In a heavy bottom sauce pan, add in your sugar\nand your golden syrup or honey Gently let these two ingredients melt but\ndon't let it simmer yet. When all the sugar is dissolved turn up the heat and let it simmer for 3 minutes when you get this lovely maple syrup color. At this point you want to have your whisk\nready to go. As you can see, the caramel has gotten darker.\nIt has a really nice smell to it. So we're going to go really quickly in with our bicarbonate\nsoda. We're going to whisk and stand back. Look at that. Amazing! Look at all those bubbles.\nNow take it off the heat and pour it immediately onto your prepared\nsurface. Take care not to touch the mix until it goes\ncold. Look how lovely and bubbly and caramelly it\nis. As you can see, this recipe happens really\nfast so make sure you have your surface oiled before you start, all your ingredients weighed\nout, and your whisk and spatula ready in hand. Honeycomb is like caramel lava but it's not\njust for mixing into your ice cream. I'm going to show you another tip of what you can do\nwith it once it goes cold. If you haven't already done so, now is a really\ngreat time to subscribe. And for mobile and tablet viewers, the subscription button can\nbe found right here and if you like what you see the like button can be found right here. When your honeycomb goes cold, lift it off\nthe surface and break it apart into pieces. When you crack your honeycomb open, you can\nsee all the beautiful airy holes on the inside. And this is why they call it honeycomb. Break your honeycomb into the sizes that you\nwant. For those of you who have ever had a Crunchie\nbar, that is exactly what this tastes like. Mmmmm. Honeycomb is a great treat by itself but even more delicious when you mix it into my homemade ice cream base. So that tip I was telling you about earlier We are going to dip our homemade honeycomb\ninto melted chocolate and we're going to make our very own Crunchie bars. To make your homemade Crunchie bars, take your broken honeycomb dip it in your lovely melted chocolate. Give\nit a toss around Let all this chocolate drip off Then take it out and let it dry on a wire\nrack. When the chocolate sets you will have your very own BIG & BOLD homemade candy bar! Now you know how to make your own honeycomb\nfor ice cream and for Crunchie bars. Make sure to come back tomorrow where I'm collaborating\nwith Entertaining with Beth to bring you a beautiful Butterscotch Pudding and Beth is\nmaking a Tortellini Pesto Salad. Don't forget to subscribe to my channel and\nI'll see you for the next episode of Bigger Bolder Baking.", "2dhKMZC7AJ4": "remember Popeyes viral chicken sandwich KFC now has its own we gotta go we're going off to the KFC run came out today we can't wait any longer to see if it's better than Popeyes off to the store and we're going it's so important I want to know what it is it looks the same just when you thought Orlando couldn't get any better they bring to us exclusive fried chicken sandwich right now the new sandwich is only being doesn't for a limited time at 15 Orlando area locations is it only in Orlando yeah you got DMS on Instagram about it yeah they're like yo we know you live in Orlando let's go it's a combination KFC Taco Bell yeah we can get Taco Bell too bad the Popeyes and a KFC weren't together they're not even advertising it how is anyone gonna know there it is they are advertising for it does it say its name I don't know maybe that's not the new one yeah we should pull that up on the screen crispy kernel and then the classic chicken sandwich how do they compare in the first place they're completely different one doesn't even come on a brioche what does it come on look just a regular bun and it doesn't even say it's new there's nowhere where it's boasting that as new this wasn't supposed to be a conspiracy it really was it I just want to taste the news they win but this article says it starts Tuesday in today's Tuesday so we're here why would an article say it starts on Tuesday when articles written on Tuesday it should have said it starts today so Tuesday must mean next Tuesday which means we don't have the new one yeah I'm brioche is on a brioche yeah oh no that's that's a spicy one and the competition starts now KFC versus Popeyes KFC 399 Popeyes 399 classic KFC much larger spicy KFC not as large spicy Popeyes larger there's still time card on size the size Thai toppings mayonnaise pickles chicken brioche there this same KFC pickles Popeyes pickles okay I'll see pickles pickle ridges no ridges difference it's a pickoff KFC drive-thru not as busy Popeyes drive-thru pretty busy calories doesn't matter you're eating a chicken sandwich it's she day the last thing is taste don't do anything but bite it and think looking at me that's creepy can I eat more of it yeah you didn't I buy it there's a good chicken sandwich pretty sure that's Popeyes but Todd you the hurt did you get a bone there's so much breading I don't think I eat any chicken oh no colonel maybe he just bit a bad part hey just breading came over on is this it yeah we're sharing the same sandwich hope that's okay all right how do I bite it you got it oh oh it's like too crispy I didn't know too crispy would be a thing you got original recipe extra crispy and then too crispy I'm curious to see how much different this is gonna taste where do I bite into it was a good spot you just eat the sandwich night and day butter Popeyes you win so hard on this but what about the spicy sauce we have to see if that makes a difference mmm Oh every level of gum super creamy spicy breading flaky and kind of burst in your mouth it's so disappointing yeah that one you can barely taste the spice on there Popeyes sauce is so much spicier and it's like more full flavor I feel like once you get into the okay MC chicken sandwich smells bad I've never in my life tried to things that look so the same tastes so incredibly different this case the chicken doesn't even have the 11 herbs and spices happen no I don't taste any of it it's just like a really crispy crispy crispy fries and sandwich the Popeyes Chicken is like more tenderized and like it's literally twice as thick this chicken is has a thicker breading for sure you know they went a little bit old warm KFC sauce not a spicy same price similar pickles appearance a little nicer Popeyes was more succulent more flavorful and kinder on the mouth so if you guys are in the Orlando area go give the KFC chicken sandwich a try and let us know what you think and there you have it folks KFC vs. Popeyes and Popeyes is deftly victorious how do you mess up a chicken sandwich when what you make is chicken maybe this isn't the new sandwich we just read online that there's a new chicken sandwich that you guys have is that the one I just ordered and the classic also right that one lady said that it wasn't new but everyone else that it was I was wondering what when did that new chicken sandwich come out this is the new sandwich it looks like all the pictures so maybe this isn't the sandwich maybe if the weight and the week I think it is it does look like all the place is the new same way okay well either way it wasn't that good", "2igrMxVG-xE": "wait hey everybody you guys almost thought that I wasn't gonna post a video today right I usually post that too and it's hurry through p.m. and that is because I was going to do a livestream so I knew I had a little more extra wiggle room and uh yeah

quick you only need two ingredients and we're gonna get this going already so first things first you guys are maybe hearing my super loud stove here and all I'm doing is I have like a was just like a bain-marie or whatever it's called where I have water in my pot double-double boil I think it's called and then I just have a plain and empty bowl sitting right on top of it we're gonna heat up our water and we're gonna toss in well I'm gonna first let the water boil here and hear what's going on I'm getting an error message from my stove here we go um so wait huh wait oh darn I'm getting an error message for some reason let me see if I can grab another pop if that works maybe the heavier pot would work this is not usually the stove that I use is my cooktop here up in the set area so I think this one works yeah I think the pot was just not heavy enough or something I don't know what's going on it's one of those induction cooktop it's crunch time yeah it is all right so all right let's put this water that's what it was the problem was the pot apparently now is just floating so I'm gonna keep it up a little bit I don't want it to touch those all right so Wow our water is gonna start boiling up I'll be talking to you guys how are you guys how are you all doing hi from Ecuador hi how are you thank you for joining me you're joining us let's see making the stake right now all

because it's like it's it's good enough it doesn't mean as long as it's hot that's all we need for our chocolate to melt doesn't necessarily have to be boiling I'm going to be using some enjoy life no I'm not sponsored this is enjoy life mini chocolate chips and semi-sweet and these are dairy free and you can sit down from here and these are dairy free I find these at Target the only place I find dairy free chocolate is that target and this this recipe is oh okay this recipe is really nonspecific like as far as measurements there's like eyeball it I do like to say a cup of mini chocolate chips and we're just gonna mix it up it's already melting so you just want to stir it all up so I can melt into double boiling thing Mia could you please not sitting there here remove or install another thing you can do if if you don't feel like doing this I've done this in the microwave and it works out fine and this is one of those perfect little snacks for if you just wanna if you're just like creating something at night are you like I wish I had some chocolate and whatever it came each other way over here we give it arm over so high some artists are cute way no I don't know I can't even pronounce that can later be bartering barking I'm sorry I'm so bad at pronouncing certain things oh thanks Byron yeah Byron just posted the link to my second channel which I have become way more active on oh I actually just posted a new video because everybody's always asking me I just threw in one of the little serials ahead of time so I'm actually going to turn off my heat because all my chocolate is melted and you can see really fast really easy I posted a new video on my second channel just yesterday I'm talking about like how I deal with non vegan so here we have some like the Rice Krispies cereal any brand really is fine and then you're just gonna eyeball it I like to make it so it's like a lot of it so it looks like it's to look prettier like oh I think I'm gonna add a little too much so yeah I have a new video there I already filmed like two more videos for that and that's going to be going up so I'm going to be posting a video or two every week I'm kind of gonna see how bad low comes along with the two video situation all that because for this channel because so far I feel like oh I put too much I put way too much so you like I put way too much cereal but since this is still nice and warm what I'm gonna do is shoot over a mixture and then toss in a little bit more of the chocolate and then the chocolate cement really quickly yep already melting we have no no dairy chocolate and our supermarket in Florida where is it Publix I know uh well that's like the only supermarket I know of any any pieces are gonna thank you saying so oh yeah so Oh another thing is I I'm taking requests for the second channel if you guys have any suggestions for the second channel as far as like questions and there's like this new series that I'm doing called what the what's so it's like any kind of questions that I come across that you guys may ask me in my streams or that you guys ask me on Instagram or Facebook I'll put on my what the what series where I just sit down and discuss a topic it could be anything like literally anything across the board you know I'll talk about that hang on me I can't let it go so I love you too love you too so yeah this mix and mix and mix in alright and here we have it so basically this is what it looks like it looks like a bunch of chocolate with whipped cereal yeah it looks like it looks like chocolate rice krispies pretty much all right and then what we're gonna do turning this off trying to make less noise you know what I'm gonna play an a so it's not like super loud Olaf from Philly Olaf from Philly right back at you so be careful alright so I have a little ziplock back here and I'm gonna do is put in our chocolate is a little ziploc bag and if you guys you know are against the ziplock bag situation then what you can do is you can place it onto a plate or a baking tray and use some person paper or a wax paper anything that will keep it from sticking while it dries up and then you can once it dries you can cut it up

and um yeah I'm Byron thank you as always thank you so much for helping out", "2tW-LbZAVMY": "hi there everyone welcome back to another video I have a great topic today and I actually was inspired by someone that left a comment on one of my youtube videos this person had asked if I would do a video sharing my beauty and self-care routine like a schedule of when I do things for example haircuts color nails and I thought genius I love this I would love watching a video on that topic by other women so it really inspired me to do that I actually squeezed it in because I just didn't want to wait I just thought this is so great so I just want you to know I love when you guys share what you want to see because it's inspiring to me I mean there are so many things that I can do videos on it's endless but once in a while someone will come up with something and I will just be like that is genius I love it so thank you so let's talk about that because I am a routine person I live by a pretty tight schedule and I'm just a regimented type of person in general all the things that I do really are pretty much on a schedule and I'm going to share a few tips along the way I'm going to break it down into categories but the very first thing that I want to say is we are all busy I know for me I am hustling all the time and I don't say that negatively I say that positively because I love what I do in every area I love being a wife mother I love being a working mom I love being a career woman and I love running my own business so I'm loving the hustle I think it's when you don't love the hustle that's when it's a problem but when you love it it's just I don't know you just love it but I'm very busy and it's hard to make it to everything so one of the things that I do and I highly recommend this is stack your appointments I tend to get my lashes filled on the same day I do nails or nails the same guy do hair whatever there are there are some days that I have three Beauty appointments all in one day and yes it can be expensive but if you budget like I do and I have all of those videos out there including Tracy's little luxury envelopes it'll be easy it's a no-brainer but stack your appointments to save time it saves gas it saves time you're already out a lot of these days you're not wearing makeup because who's gonna wear makeup if they're getting their lashes done so pay attention stack your appointments and if you're someone who's always looking way in advance like I am I I have my appointment scheduled for probably the next two three months for pretty much everything so highly recommend doing that in another way that you can do that is always have your calendar with you when you make appointments and make sure that at your appointment you're making your next one or two for example when I get my hair done I make my next one or two appointments if I know I have to get in let's say two months from now I know I have to get in and I could be working around a couple obstacles like vacations I'll book my appointment two months out when I do my med spa appointments I have lashes in there and I have hydro facial and I'll talk about when I do those in just a moment but I booked all of those appointments about two months out because some people are really client heavy and if they are you're not gonna get your sweet spot time because you're competing with other people especially if you have to do evening or weekend appointments that's gonna be really tough because many women work and they need those appointments as well so let's dive into what I get done and what my schedule in routine is for beauty and self-care starting with body ride Russian that's a biggie and I do have a blog post that talks all about dry brushing I try to do that every single day exfoliating I always do this when I'm going to self tan if I'm not self tanning currently then I would say I exfoliate my body about once a week and let me just share that all the products that I use or recommend like maybe if it's something I've used in the past but I'm trying something new now so I recommend something I'm going to have links to everything I'm not gonna take the time to show all the products I have all of that in other videos this is really a routine schedule but all the products will be listed in the drop-down and I always encourage you to click that top link which takes you to the corresponding blog post because I can give you a lot more information there but yeah exfoliating I do that at least once a week shave is I shave daily but let me share that I did have laser hair removal well I was pregnant with pips when I was going through it so it would have been like maybe um between 13 and 14 years ago I had laser hair removal so there are certain areas of my body that I don't really have to shave every single day but my legs I do and then the areas that I can go a little bit longer it may be more like once a week I moisturize daily so that would really be everything that has to do with the body other than that I really don't do anything I don't get massages I've never really gotten into any of that sticking with body let's move on to self tan I used to self tan your around but I have switched that to more just spring to fall because it's so much upkeep and I'm not gonna go into the whole routine of self tanning I just did a video last week and and I'll have that linked up here you can click up here but it'll also be in the drop down so if you want to know my products and routine and how often I self-tan all of that is in that video and again its current I just did it last week moving on to hair I do have some gray and I really could probably go about every four weeks to cover my gray but I stretch it to five so I get a color cut in style every five weeks and again I schedule that next appointment when I'm there or the next two I have been going to the same hairstylist for it'll be 26 years in October believe it or not no one else has ever done my hair it'll be 26 years I do have videos with her that talked about my cut my color all of that I'll have those videos linked but I go every five weeks for color cut and style now if I want to add in highlights I always make sure I make that decision when I'm booking my next appointment and I would say if I'm doing something like that I wait till every third time that I go so that would be like every 15 weeks if I go every five weeks it would be every 15 weeks and sometimes I don't sometimes I wait until spring and summer and lighten up a little bit I did book doing some added highlights in my next appointment when I go in June so that's kind of how that works hair masque or deep conditioned I would say about every third wash and remember I don't wash my hair very often so I go every probably four to five days between washes so I would say about every third time I will put on more of a hydrating or nourishing masque I love this one by Garnier I will have it linked I talked about all the time that's been my favorite lately but I always have a couple that have been sent to me that I'm trying out as well so I'll link a couple hair masks that I do like the other thing I want to mention is because I go so long between washes I changed my pillowcase every time I wash my hair so I have a whole stack of pillowcases in the drawer in the the side table next to my bed in that drawer I have a whole stack of pillowcases so I just always know I'm here washing days I put a fresh pillowcase on because I wash our our sheets probably every two to three weeks so obviously then my pillowcase would get would get changed let's move on to skincare I do I'm a heavy hitter with skincare you know I have an aggressive routine I I just really have a great routine and I really believe it makes a huge difference AM and PM religiously I don't deviate from that you know I mean deviates from some things I need slack on dry brushing or I may slack on exfoliating the body some of those things self tanning I may slack but I don't ever slack on skincare I would go without makeup before I would go without doing my skincare routine so I would say that's my biggest priority of skincare I shaved my face which I have a video on I'll have that linked below as well and I shaved my face about once a week I will put what I'm currently using to shave because I think I was using that between goals or whatever twinklers in that I really just like using a razor but if you want to know more about face shaving watch the video because how I do it when I do it that's all the same and I think I also talked about the brows which I do have micro bleeding done but because of all the skincare that I use they're kind of faded that's that's a big upkeep what if you skincare like I do masking is big for me once a week is mandatory sometimes I will do twice a week that's another area I just don't slack in my LED light therapy I really try to do that once a week but I'll admit that I do slack in that area at times as well and I'll put the videos where I talk about the LED light therapy below but I love that people ask me what do I really recommend it I do I do I think it all makes a difference I mean it's hard to see it's one thing I think it's a matter of doing like everything but I think it's I think it's just being aggressive about it yeah I think it really makes the biggest difference so and I just recently did a video sharing my skincare journey like my whole childhood teen yrs and then what my skincare routine is now in my favorite products those are all new videos those will be linked as well you can get to at least one of them by clicking up here let's talk about skin care procedures in treatments because I am a heavy hitter in this area as well and this is gonna be very splurge II I would say that I'm in a phase in my life now I wasn't always in this season I spend a lot of money on my skincare with products procedures treatments I do that's where I put my money some women put their extra money towards clothing accessories some women like to have a nice car and they have a hefty car payment I do not I we all have our thing there's no right or wrong where you put your extra money but I don't put my extra money where many women do I'm not a shopper I don't like a lot of things I'm not a makeup hoarder skincare it's really the skin and it's it's the treatments and procedures I will admit I spend a lot of money a year at my Med Spa no shame really that's where I put my money I do Hydra facial I have a video I talk about all the time I think I even have something in an Instagram stories on Hydra facial I do Hydra facial every four weeks religiously and I upgrade and use the growth factor yes you pay a lot for that growth factor but I purchased this at a special that is offered at my Med Spa twice a year I purchased this at one of the two times of the year that they offer this special I purchased the whole year it's a lot of money but I save a lot of money by doing so and when you budget the way I do I always have that money I always have thousands of dollars that I can put into something because I've saved up to take advantage of those specials so you know budgeting is huge and I budget for this big time moving on to Botox I do that about every four months what I do is when I go in to get my Hydra facial done at about the four month mark I will have one of the nurses in there or the owner tree so you just kind of take a look she'll just have me sit in her chair so take a look and she may say let's schedule for your next appointment or she may say let's wait you know six weeks because I'm in there every other week and we'll get into that a little bit more so hide your facial at the Med Spa is every four weeks and then if I need some fillers I tie it in when I'm already there for Hydra facial or lashes which we'll get into lashes I do cheeks once a year and then I do lips about every four months and I don't do a lot in the lips I have and I just didn't like that as much it's more just like lifting that upper line giving a little pop I like those two little points to have a little pop with them and once in a while in between we'll hit those two spots too so I always having them look and see where I'm at of what I need tweaking with when you go to a Med Spa religiously they get to know you they know what you like and you can it's just a great it's a great it it's a great relationship there's no better way to put it I would recommend building a relationship to any of you that are that are on a maintenance program which I am let's hope on the beauty and nails i tweeze my brows when would my makeup so if I see a hair I tweeze if you know if I see two or three I tweeze then if I do my makeup two days later and I see something I tweeze so I'm constantly tweezing I shaved my face about once a week and lash fells I do every two to three weeks so that explains kind of the med spa appointments I will do my lash fill and then two weeks later it'll be lash fill and hydro facial and then two weeks later lash valve two weeks later Nashville hydro facial and again during those times is when I'll pop in have the owner Tracy check me or Landreth a nurse whoever say does it look like I need buy Botox what do you think and then if I do need to schedule any type of injectables or or the Botox I will schedule that for one of the times that I get my lashes done in my hydro facial for my nails I do acrylic fill these are my nails but I do acrylic over top with shellac and I go every two to two and a half weeks I could go three but I don't like the growth but I'm loving shellac but I have to do acrylic otherwise the polish won't stay on so I have no issues with it it works for me but they are my nails sometimes people go are those your nails yes they're my nails they have acrylic on them but I don't have tips or anything I want to just chime in make sure you're washing your makeup brushes I wash my beauty sponge which I'll have linked below it's not the Beauty Blender it's won by I think Sonia Kashuk or something but I'll link it I washed it every time I do my makeup and I also wash my concealer my under-eye concealer brush so if it's anything that is put in a liquid it gets washed every time I use it every day but keep up with what washing your makeup brushes I think it's very important you younger girls are really bad at that make the time schedule it in you know I schedule everything teeth whitening I just did a video on teeth whitening you can get to that video up here or in the drop down box as well I do it daily and I talk about the process in there I do it daily and once a week I do an extra step but I'm not gonna go into that here because it's all in that video I get my teeth cleaned every six months I added that and and then a couple little added things that have to do with beauty self-care whatever is I work out five days a week and that's cardio in weights so five days a week religiously year-round there's never an offseason I mean once in a while if I'm on vacation I'll go a little bit longer in fact we are leaving today to be gone for the long weekend I won't get a workout in for the next three days so that so I probably won't get as many and maybe next week who knows usually it's it's five days per week unless it's you know once in a blue moon because of a vacation I'm also on a walking pro program I walk spring to fall three to four nights per week with my daughter Kirsten my oldest daughter and we walk between four and five miles and that's just it's like a program we call it our walking program spring to fall supplements daily and I do have videos talking about that they'll be linked oh here I put an example of my walking so I walked 14 times in April so that's an example because I do you know I track everything I'll link my planner below as well because the habit tracker is in there but 14 times in April so yeah supplements are daily I have videos on that I do a three-day fast generally quarterly and that's a fast it's a water fast so no food no supplements nothing I have videos on fasting intermittent fasting prolonged fasting you name it they'll all be linked you're gonna have a lot of videos to choose from I just recently started incorporating a three-day juice cleanse and I'm going to be trying to do that quarterly and I shared on Instagram stories if you go to my Instagram story called vibe well I share my last or my first and only that I've done so far three-day juice cleanse and I'm getting ready to new it do another one so that wasn't bad at all physical I go annually mammogram I go annually I'm very religious about that I talk about all of that in a lot of my videos I have menopause videos you name it check out everything in my library make sure you're subscribed tell women about me there's not a lot there's some great YouTube out there don't get me wrong but I don't feel really with every area that I hit there's really a lot out there I do think it kind of sets me apart so tell women about me and whoever the person was that recommended this video thank you I thought it was awesome it was fun I wish other youtubers would do it because I don't watch much YouTube and I certainly don't watch much in the beauty department but this would interest me to watch from some of the women that I used to used to watch their videos so alright thanks for joining me and have a great weekend it's it's a long weekend as Memorial Day weekend so anyway we will see you next Monday on YouTube alright take care have a good one [Applause] [Music]", "5vc0gJmrXgU": "what's up six-pack ABS calm its Thomas de Lauer your lead nutritionist and today kind of raining on your parade a little bit I'm gonna tell you all about peanut butter and I'm going to tell you that the peanut butter you've probably been eating is actually not too good for you and I'm not just talking about from an arterial side of things like with your arteries and with your veins and everything like that I'm talking about just in general but it could be slowing down your progress so the first woman I want to talk about it's just the general regular peanut butters when we have peanut butters I really like to break them down into three different classifications we've got the basic peanut butters the skips the jiffy's the main big stream mainstream ones okay then we've got the natural peanut butters okay the ones that call themselves natural but if you look at the ingredients they've got some things that I'm going to point out okay then we've got what I call the real peanut butters the peanut butters that quite honestly are just peanuts and salt okay that's it but let me break down the reasoning and we break down what you should be leaning towards and I also want to give you some alternatives okay so when we look at regular peanut butters basically they are containing something known as hydrogenated oils now to add insult to injury I'm going to explain the hydrogenation process but these are usually hydrogenated soybean oils okay and we're not talking about good-quality soy we're talking about low-quality soy that is an extremely extremely phytoestrogen ik property that's gonna cause you to have lower testosterone levels and higher estrogen levels which is going to make it so that's much much more difficult to burn fat it's gonna make it very very difficult for you so that's problem number one problem number two is the hydrogenation process in and of itself so hydrogenation looks something like this you have a fat molecule normally you have a few hydrogen atoms that are in a fat molecule to make a fat saturated it has to have a bunch of hydrogen molecules every single seat at the table every single hydrogen bond needs to be totally occupied with hydrogen so basically it becomes saturated well what ends up happening with the hydrogenation process is you end up having this artificial hydrogen that's added into the mix or it's a real hydrogen as its artificially added so I want you to think of it like this you have a dinner table in this dinner table has multiple seats at it okay and you have every single seat occupied with a hydrogen that means there's no room for anything else to get in it's just a saturated fat okay but if a fat doesn't naturally have those hydrogen seats occupied we're basically manufacturing it and adding them in that is my friends a definition of a trans fat and a trans fat is metabolized very poorly in the body so you might be thinking well I'm young I don't really care about trans fats because I don't care about my arteries right now well let me tell you something it has more of an impact than just that a regular fat takes about 18 days to completely start breaking down in terms of like a it's called a cyst fat C is basically if it's a regular diglyceride or even a monoglyceride it's gonna break down in that period of time but a trans fat is actually significantly slower to break down the body it takes 51 days for just half of that fat to break down in your body you see trans fats end up stopping enzymatic functions that allow us to break down fats we'll do the math that's not exactly good for fat loss right it's not just about the fact that it clogs up your arteries it's actually slowing things down so we've got the estrogen it properties plus we've got the trans fat hydrogenation properties just a no-go okay regular peanut butter it doesn't matter how much of a budget you're on spend a couple extra bucks and get the good stuff okay then we have the natural peanut butters here's the thing with the natural peanut butters they're better okay they don't contain the normal hydrogenated things but they still have a bunch of sugar and they still have palm oil palm oil by itself is not that bad but what ends up happening with palm oil is something pretty interesting when it's refined when it's refined it actually becomes a carcinogen which means it's causing cancer not a good thing we don't necessarily want Kat right yeah that's problem number one and you may not be worried too much about that one right now so let's talk about problem number two with the natural peanut butters okay when you combine this palm oil with the refinement process or anything like that you create something known as a glistening fatty acid ester these glistening fatty acid esters are what is called a GNote auxin a gino toxin is something that harms your basically your genetic code basically being able to write scribe DNA and RNA that may not sound like much but our DNA and our RNA dictates how much muscle we build or how much fat we burn so if you have something that is a toxin to that area of the body that can really mess things up and really screw you over okay but that's not the only problem natural ones they still have monoglycerides and they still have diglycerides now a monoglyceride is a fatty acid molecule that is bound to a glycerin a diglyceride is two fatty acid molecules that are bound to a glycerin now get this you ever hear of a triglyceride yeah we never want them elevated doing when we get our blood work done our doctors say your triglycerides are high bad things well guess what monoglyceride diglyceride only one step away from a triglyceride and guess what the FDA doesn't care if it has a mono or a diglyceride in it they don't have to call it a trans fat even though it's only one small step away from becoming a trans fat any scary stuff so you definitely want to be avoiding those two or at least make sure you're reading the label so when it comes down to it you're left with basically the organic peanut butters you're left with ones that on the label say they've got peanuts in them and they've got salt in them it doesn't matter what the other brands say if it has more than that in it you typically don't want it that is it you want the benefits from the legumes you want the benefits from the oils okay you're trying to get the right balance of fats omega-3 and omega-6 don't add the palm oil that's been refined don't add the soybean oil why it's just slowing you down and triggering inflammation so flat out if you want to be able to recover from your workouts you want to be able to get in good shape you need to just spend the extra dollar to get the organic stuff that just has the peanuts and just has the salt and if you're looking for alternatives almond butter is a great one just be cognizant of the almond butter and try to get one that's a smooth almond butter because the last thing that you want is to be ingesting chunks of almonds that are extremely hard to break down because the phytic acid which I've talked about in other videos so as always six-pack ABS thank you for keeping it locked in here on this channel and be sure subscribe be sure to comment and head on over to six-pack ABS

today I'm very excited to share with you three unique flavors that are sure to make your tastebuds dance I'm going to show you my amazing barbecue flavored popcorn an incredible coconut curry popcorn and finally peanut butter popcorn that you have to taste to believe once you're done watching this tasty video be sure to check out my brand new episode of mobile meal makeover where I'm sharing my recipe or sweet and spicy sriracha popcorn I promise you will not be disappointed now let's get started with our classic popcorn recipe now you could do this with plain microwave popcorn that would work but if you want to be a popcorn purist the best way to make it is on the stove so getting started by heating up some canola oil in a large sauce pot on the stove it's really important to make sure that your canola oil is well distributed across the bottom of your pan you don't want your popcorn to burn the best way to know your oil is ready is to add two kernels to the bottom of your pan do get ahead of yourself come on our friend so all I'm going to do is cover the bottom of my pan with my popcorn kernels then I'm going to put the lid on my pot and wait till I hear the popping to get once you hear the popping start you want to shake your pot every 5 to 10 seconds until the cooking is complete as soon as you don't hear any more popping you want to take your pot off the stove that means it's ready for our barbecue popcorn we are getting started by melting some butter in a small saucepan to that I'm going to add lots of tasty flavor with chili powder some ground cumin and some garlic powder I'm also going to add a good helping of salt finally I'm going to stir in the barbecue sauce I'm using the store-bought kind that you could definitely use homemade if you wanted to what I like to do is pour my sauce all over my popcorn put the lid on and shake it until everything is well coated then I pour it onto a baking sheet and let it dry out for 10 to 15 minutes so I don't end up with soggy popcorn and voila this stuff is amazing on its own but if you really want to take it to the next level also add some barbecue flavored potato chips to it next up we are making my super flavorful coconut curry popcorn now for this popcorn I'm actually using coconut oil instead of butter but you could use butter if that's what you had on hand to that I'm adding some curry powder a little bit of ground ginger and some shredded coconut I'm going to finish it off with a zest and juice of one lime and a handful of freshly chopped cilantro going to pour this yummy mixture all over my popcorn give it a good shake and then let it dry out this stuff is unbelievable finally today I am very excited to share with you my recipe for peanut butter popcorn now it should be said this is a tad indulgent getting started with a small saucepan on the stove into that I'm going to add some honey and some sugar essentially what we're doing is creating a caramel sauce resist the urge to stir this you don't want to stir your caramel until your sugar is completely dissolved once the sugar is dissolved completely we are going to add the new natural peanut butter I'm going to whisk all of this goodness together and then it's just a matter of tossing it with my popcorn until it is a very well covered just be sure to let your pot cool completely before you ahead and give your toppings otherwise you run the risk of burning you can make this popcorn even more decadent by adding some peanuts or some chocolate chips or even some pretzels how amazing would that be but I can't resist eating it just as it is I hope you'll give these tasty recipes a try and if you do be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you know and love seeing what you're coming up with in your very own

of my videos that i post are for promo purposes only i do not resell so this is why i don't wear gloves however you should wear gloves if you plan on reselling or feeding this to anybody now we're going to pour our melted chocolate into each cavity of our mold and we're going to tap it just to make sure that all the chocolate gets in each corner of the mold [Music] now that we're done with that part we're going to go ahead and add all our rice krispies treats making sure that they're nicely centered inside our mold now that we're done we're going to go ahead and throw this in the freezer for about five minutes the reason why i put it in the freezer is so that the rice crispy treat doesn't rise up when i'm putting my chocolate on top all right so now we took it out of the freezer we're going to pour the rest of our chocolate on top [Music] and just a heads up i did use a pound of chocolate for this video i was able to get six complete rice krispies treats out of this and i had a little left over to make my two roses that went on top of my rice krispie treats that you'll see at the end of this video so once we're done filling all the cavities with all the chocolate we're going to go ahead and pop it in the freezer for about five minutes and we're gonna tap it just to release all the air bubbles all right now we're taking this out of the freezer it's been in the freezer for about five minutes and we're going to gently pull back the silicone mold to release each rice krispie treat [Music] oh it's so pretty [Music] i'm gonna torch the top of my chocolate and apply edible glitter if you don't have a torch that's totally fine if you had some leftover chocolate you can drizzle some chocolate on yours or create a cute design on top or even spray some edible glitter it's just not going to stick very well [Music] and again i'm using my torch i'm using it just to warm up the tip of my cookie scrub if you don't have a torch you can use hot water and what i'm gonna do is make a hole on the top of my rice krispies treat so that i can insert the stick [Music] contour poppy paint we're gonna pour some poppy paint in the dish that we had and we're gonna grab a brush and dip it inside our paint and gently tap on top so that some of the paint that's on the brush will end up on your chocolate [Music] [Music] now we're going to torch our rice krispie treats this is going to soften up the chocolate so we can add sprinkles on again if you don't have a torch you can do a drizzle with chocolate and then apply your sprinkles onto that and i wanted to show you guys how i packaged my rice krispies treats i'm using a 4x6 bag i will link all the products that i use today in our description box so make sure to check that out these bags are available at craftycakeshop.com and i'm just tying it with some ribbon i don't really know how to tie a bow so i'm making it work with what i do now [Music] and that's how you make rice krispie treats using the rice krispie treat

together with me the much-anticipated assassin hunting pre-workout by a politician with their sub brand honor collapse listen people I don't think I don't think I handle the channel any P work either there was so much anticipation for the review and mostly because the label on this thing is by by far the craziest label we've ever seen a pre-workout this we workout test the definition of a stim junkie I'm gonna take you through the label here and I'm going to tell you what's in it and why you should care this is not just a bunch of steams you're gonna see it in a second then I'm gonna share with you my personal experience using this one and I did take one full scoop most of the time I did try it one time half scoop I'm gonna share that experience with you then right towards the end of the video I'm gonna give you my final verdict who is this really for me because this is obviously craziness who is this for should you buy it if you buy it when should you use it how did I use it how am i planning to use it let's get right into it okay so the reason assassin hunting got so much buzz going around it and a lot of people are waiting for this review is because one the other key labs by Apollo Nutrition first generation of assassin which was DMA a base this is this is was an amazing free workout and a lot of you guys just loved it and Eddie for muscle players reviewed it on the channel I think it is still his favorite DMA a pre-workout ever super super super super hardcore stim junkie pre-workout assassin untamed the new generation this one this which is yellow as is coming out and really trying to live up to this claim here of being the strongest pre-workout out there now Apollo Nutrition I reviewed a couple of their products here or reviewed who legal pre-workout which with 600 milligrams of caffeine was really one of the strongest workouts out there I will be there posting to workout enigma there BCA a chainsaw anyway a lot of product and I interviewed the owner here on the channel really great company doing the right things going to the right places anyway assassin untamed ultimate pre-workout let me take you to the label here and sit down please promise me you're sitting down and also promise me we're not gonna judge as I go the label here what is this craziness for just wait for my experience and my actual verdict at the end of the review so let's go it is 20 servings in this thing each serving has and I'm gonna go through like the pumps and in doing this first and then I'm gonna talk to you about the actual thing these things so you get LC training at 4 grams there you go admitting at 1 gram so already you have a super solid pump formula so even though this is totally a stim junkie pre-workout you don't need a prompt solution together with it you're gonna get 4 grams 4 grams of l-citrulline one gram of admitting you have Bethany 3.2 tingling and some muscle endurance and now we're getting into this huge freaking list of ingredients for stimulation and money and focus and mood and the amounts the amounts are gonna blow your head off so I'm gonna put the label here carry on with me guys caffeine 500 milligrams on top of that we have also D caffeine mallet at 100 milligrams so that's gonna yield around 75 milligrams of caffeine so about 575 milligrams of caffeine with immediate it we did on anhydrous led caffeine mallet gives you that you know prolonged effect anyway is a lot of caffeine but this is not even where it starts DMH a 300 milligrams 300 I think the most I've ever seen was 225 300 milligrams of DHA on top of the almost 600 milligrams of caffeine 300 milligrams of variety renesis that's gonna help with focus with mood elevation together with the DNA chain the caffeine that is a lot of stuff then you have tier clean at 125 milligrams again that's gonna help you that's like think about like caffeine with a prolonged effect okay when you get weightless used to it you develop less tolerance then you have a gentleman which is another stimulant at 75 milligrams and then you have cinnamon at 65 freakin milligrams I think the most I've seen was 40 milligrams 65 milligrams and then you get your him Bing not alpha yo so chill chill it's not gonna kill it's not the side effects for the side effects your human being for 4 min ago so that's gonna help with Genisys and just that feeling of stimulation anyway if I go through this through this craziness 600 almost 600 million hours of captain then you get the tea apron then you get 300 milligrams of DHA 300 milligrams of variety renesis oh my god hi gentlemen say nothing you're human this has to be I mean if guys comment below if you've seen anything more loaded than this I did see by the way I can tell you already don't talk to me about the King pre-workout all that this is  labels it doesn't have what it says on the label in it if you've seen any actual real products from a real respectable company that has so much  in it complete the pillow anyway obviously this is craziness so you have to ask yourself what is this for who is this for right what is this how is this gonna be different it's more equals better let me take you to my experience first and then I'm gonna share with you my verdict as far as the as far as who is it who is this for and how I would use this and how I'm acting using it and yeah let's start with the flavor so the flavor I have is pineapple mango the flavor on the original assassin was so-so wasn't that good the pineapple mango is actually good flavor is it is it like amazing like I want to drink it throughout the day no but for all the stimulus that it has here this is totally tolerable and okay like so I'm not not concerned about the morning-after to actually go and try this pre-workout so this is let's get flavor out of the way seriously who cares this is that you're not buying this to drink throughout the day let's talk about the experience so listen guys I try this for the first time with after school because even though I'm a stink junkie and I double scooped errors and I can do right still like I look at the label here saying oh my gosh this is this is a lot right so I took half scoop and this was as far as an experience as on a half scoop from a stimulation focus energy please as good as an experience as any of the top rated pre workouts out there like so if you if you like errors if you like wild if you like pre stock if you like oh yeah if you like galvanize so this would give you the same on the half scoop I'm talking a half scoop from a focus perspective from a mood elevation perspective from an intensity perspective you would get a very similar experience on half scoop you will get of the tingling which to me is annoying so half scoop of this for me like really misses half like 1.6 grams of beta-alanine and you definitely get less of the pumps so you get the super stimulation if effect but with less of the other stuff anyway let's talk about the full scoop because you guys are here for the full scoop so I did take full scoop let me tell you tell you guys up front some of you guys might not be able to take it on foods good yeah it's not for you if you guys like if one full scoop of areas or wild or pre stacked blows your hand off you start feeling bad then one full scoop of this is gonna be way too much for you guys if you tried hooligan by Apollo Nutrition and it was too much for you then this is too much for you this is really designed full scoop designed for people who can take the amount of stimulants here that's for sure like if you're I know a lot of people that over two hundred milligrams of DHA is just getting headaches and stuff like that so first things first make sure that you're able to take all that stuff I can take it I've went with other pre-workouts I drank two two cans of bang straight right that's 600 milligrams of caffeine if you can go for it so as far as the experience on full scoop so listen guys here's here's where here's where it's really interesting when you look at like all these changes now is this is gonna be better first things first if you're one of these people like myself that a lot of these steam junkie pre workouts the traditional was it's cold in now like the like I mentioned the air is the wall whatever there you love the experience they feel really good but it's fades off for you relatively fast like take 45 minutes 60 minutes into it it just fades out and I've get I get messages like that and I know for me it's about the same like I feel really good that I'm in the zone and then it just starts fading away really fast I miss my workout is like an hour and a half because I do Carly or whatever I miss that effect if you're one of these people and obviously you're still your skin want your tolerance to stimulant is very high and this is this is really where anarchy labs assassin would come in what you would get on a full scoop is really interesting on the full scoop you won't feel way way stronger like the experience won't be two times as strong as with half the scoop no it's not it actually is very close to half a scoop but listen to this this will keep you wired for six hours seriously and I've tried this four times like this will keep you wired forever so if you like the stimulant effect you want to be in the zone you want to care you know you want just want to go at it really hard but you're one of these people that it fades away too fast for you people I took this at 4 a.m. because I work out and I think to this facet by the way so yeah one full scoop of this faster which I don't recommend to a lot of you guys right full scoop fasted I take it I'm in the gym for an hour and a half I'm like totally in the zone and focused intensity all this stuff you like from the image every workouts I met one of my friends 7 hours after I was still freaking wired wired and I'm not talking buzz I'm talking wire you know like that spider-man feeling where everything is in slow motion because you're just wired you're alert alert seven freaking hours so here's here's here's what I would say if you're training like me like it's a six seven pm that's gonna be very hard unless your tolerance is even higher than mine if you're one of these people though that are looking for the steam steam junkie effect you'll love this thing junkie effect but the regular stuff just fades out a bit too fast for you and you want something that would keep you alert and like in the zone for a long long period of time this is the one for you people I just don't know anything else that can keep up for so freaking long and I'm talking everything like the intensity the focus the feeling of stimulation the alertness is just sick sick the alertness your Uptown spider-man alertness anyway anyway so bottom line I would say this like would I take this every day I think this is would be even for me this would be a bit too much to take it every day this is too much too much stimulants I'm gonna burn down my internal gland this is not like Eddy from ISO protocols it's safe for a daily take it's just too much right and I don't necessarily want to keep crazy spider an alert for seven hours every day so I would say this is definitely a one that you either take like half a scoop and then you just have like your normal steam junkie pre-workout from quantities perspective because really half a scoop of this is three hundred meters caffeine almost 300 you have 150 milligrams of the MHA 150 Araya and no cinnamon 30 literally this is like on par with the regular steam junkie pre-workout but if you're one of these people that want to Mord some in some cases or you can take this or you don't feel the other stuff this is where assassin comes in it's not that more equals better for the hour an hour and a half whatever that the other P workouts are really good this is gonna be as good it's not better than Ares titanium or wild or oh yah or whatever in the hour and a half for Christa it just keeps on for seven freakin hours that's the difference and for some of you that just don't feel the other stuff this is the one this is the one listen people as far as where you can get it you can get it on retail stores and on the Apollo nutrition site what I did I talked to the guys there and we got you guys a 20% off thing it's going to be only available for the next I think 48 hours probably by Monday and then that coupon is not gonna be available anymore so you can output the Lincoln 4 on our site on Fitness dnews below so you can go find the coupon and use it this is like a pre-order thing I think the product only launches officially online in on Monday oh I do know that the guys have limited quantities also these things so I'm not sure how much is gonna be available with this pre-order and you know if you are real steam junkie if the rest of the stuff just doesn't feel good anymore or you need more and you ready for a hell

I know I need to eat, but there\u2019s no time! Do you have anything\u2026healthy? *laughter* Hey Munchies! I\u2019m Alyssia if you\u2019re new, welcome to the channel! After my recent 3 healthy Chipotle bowls video, where I went into the nutrition facts pretty deeply, I had LOADS of requests for other restaurants, so I decided to compile that into one GRAND video where I share a healthy meal choice at EACH of these 10 FAST FOOD restaurants, that ARE NOT salads, even though there may be a side salad to bulk. Meal qualifications: I tried to keep choices between 300 and 500 calories, which can mean some of these are more of a snack than a meal, but sometimes we just need to get something small at these restaurants to stay on track. We don\u2019t have to be left out of the experience, but we don\u2019t have to over-indulge, either. I also looked for choices that are around 20 grams of fat, at least 15 grams of protein, and under 1000 milligrams of sodium\u2014 not to say that you MUST stick to those macronutrient frames at a snack or meal, but I had to have some kind of guidelines and structure here, and that\u2019s a pretty common caloric meal goal. 1000 milligrams of sodium is actually quite a bit for one meal, but sodium is just one of those fairly unavoidable things when eating out that we need to be aware of, and I discuss that more in my Chipotle video. Before we begin, a quick disclaimer for the haters: Let\u2019s get to it! McDonalds: Instead of a regular Egg Mcmuffin, grab an Egg White Delight Mcmuffin to save on fat and calories while keeping protein high. That English muffin is still made with refined flour, but there aren\u2019t any whole-grain options so that\u2019s a sacrifice we\u2019ll have to make. Remember, ONE meal with LESS fuel won\u2019t make you fat, just like ONE healthy meal won\u2019t make you skinny, so don\u2019t beat yourself up too much if you can\u2019t find the perfect meal, just be honest with yourself about your overall diet. I\u2019ve also added apple slices and a mandarin orange for some extra volume and healthy fuel-filled carbohydrates. Total meal: 310 calories, 17 grams of protein, 41 grams of carbs, 8 grams of fat, 750 milligrams of sodium. Burger King: It may be surprising, but a regular cheeseburger could be worse. It\u2019s moderate in sodium, and actually has LESS calories, fat, and carbs than the grilled chicken sandwich, which to many would seem like the healthier choice. I\u2019m adding a side salad for volume and some nutritious fuel, and keeping the fat-free ranch dressing on the side so I can be in control of how much is used. Remember, salad dressings can do a LOT more damage than people realize. Total meal: 370 calories, 17 grams of protein, 41 grams of carbs, 16 grams of fat, 1195 milligrams of sodium. But remember, you likely won\u2019t need that entire dressing packet, which is a sodium bomb. Wendy\u2019s: Wendy\u2019s offers some pretty fancy salads, but most of them are specifically damaging when you account for the dressing. Luckily, they offer items other than classic sandwiches, too, like wraps! This grilled chicken wrap has moderate stats, although it IS on the small side. I\u2019m adding apple slices on the side for volume and nutrition, although notice how little fiber the apples actually add because the serving size is so small. Total meal: 305 calories, 20 grams of protein, 33 grams of carbs, 11 grams of fat, 620 milligrams of sodium. In-N-Out: The west coast chain\u2019s \u201cnot-so-secret\u201d menu offers a great option to lighten the load\u2014 a protein style burger, which replaces the bun with a lettuce wrap! The only problem: In-N-Out doesn\u2019t offer sides other than fries, which are obviously high in fat. Instead, I opted to get a regular hamburger. Now, as-is, this would be 19 grams of fat, but if you replace the special spread with mustard and ketchup on a burger, you cut 9 grams of fat! Nutso! Total meal: 310 calories, 16 grams of protein, 41 grams of carbs, 10 grams of fat, 730 milligrams of sodium. Taco Bell: I LOVE Taco Bell, but one of the hardest things to deal with nutritionally is that most of my favorite items are SUPER high in sodium! I ended up going with a Gordita Supreme with Chicken. It\u2019s moderate in sodium and fat, and offers protein. Yes, it\u2019s made with refined grains, but that\u2019s pretty unavoidable. The power bowls were something I considered, but that sodium content was just too high. Instead, I added a side of black beans to my dish for added volume, flavor and nutrition, plus look at the nice fiber boost! Total meal: 340 calories, 20 grams of protein, 41 grams of carbs, 10.5 grams of fat, 740 milligrams of sodium. If you\u2019re finding this information useful, don\u2019t forget to subscribe and hit the bell so you\u2019re notified each week of new videos. Chick-Fil-A: Chick-Fil-A is the place to go to eat more chikin! Who knows why the C is missing from the chicken? Admittedly, many of the menu items use FRIED chicken, which is a tough sell when it comes to providing fuel. For that reason, I went with the grilled chicken nuggets, which are made of leaner breast, and they\u2019re obviously grilled instead of fried. It\u2019s NOT a sandwich, meaning I get to skip the refined grains and capitalize on more protein for less calories. I went with the zesty buffalo dipping sauce, because as is the case with the dressings, dipping sauces can be pretty detrimental to the overall meal macronutrients, too. I also added a fruit cup, and a side salad with the light Italian dressing\u2014 this was the ONLY dressing I could justify because most just have TOO much added sugar! I wanted to add the superfood side salad because it sounded SO healthy with the kale and broccolini, but it had 18 grams of sugar and that\u2019s mostly added from the dressing. Bummer! Total meal: 340 calories, 30 grams of protein, 24 grams of carbs, 14 grams of fat, 1730 milligrams of sodium. Wowza! But remember, the dressing AND dipping sauce are the sodium bombs and they are on the side, so you don\u2019t NEED to eat the entire packs. If you consume HALF of each, you\u2019d be at less than 1000 milligrams for the meal. Subway: Subway lets you know which sandwiches are from their \u201cFRESH FIT\u201d selection to make healthy choices easier, which is nice because it can be JUST as easy to make a nutritionally damaging choice here, too. I went with the 6\u201d rotisserie style chicken on wheat bread, which is moderate in calories, sodium, and fat, and high in protein. That also includes the basic toppings of lettuce, tomato, onions, green bell peppers, and cucumbers, which is great for a bit of actual fuel. Keep in mind, NONE of the bread loaves at subway (even the 9-grain wheat) are ACTUALLY whole grain. All of them include refined grains, and that\u2019s probably why they taste so good\u2026 I also passed on the chips and added apple slices. Total meal: 385 calories, 29 grams of protein, 54 grams of carbs, 6 grams of fat, 660 milligrams of sodium. Panda Express: I haven\u2019t eaten much Panda Express in my day, but upon researching I found calories and sodium can add up pretty quickly at this chain. The string bean chicken breast was a moderate choice, but I figured it might not be enough food on it\u2019s own, so I added a side of HALF brown rice, and HALF mixed veggies, offering some extra fuel and volume. Total meal: 440 calories, 20 grams of protein, 64 grams of carbs, 11.5 grams of fat, 870 milligrams of sodium. Starbucks: The \u201cgourmet\u201d feel can fool you into thinking their choices are healthier, but beware! Some of those sandwiches are just the same as other fast food joints. The reduced fat turkey bacon and egg white breakfast sandwich was a decent choice, even though it contains refined grain bread and isn\u2019t a particularly large serving. I added some whole-grain oatmeal to supplement, and I like that Starbucks provides plain oatmeal with toppings on the side so you\u2019re in control. I also got a grande caff\u00e9 Americano\u2014it IS Starbucks after all\u2014 but this drink requires no added sweeteners or sugars. Total meal: 405 calories, 22 grams of protein, 59 grams of carbs, 8.5 grams of fat, 700 milligrams of sodium. Dunkin Donuts: Doughnuts may be refined and packed with sugar, but many are surprised to find the doughnuts at Dunkin Donuts aren\u2019t nearly as bad as some of those breakfast sandwiches! The egg white veggie flatbread is a decent choice, at least. The \u201cmultigrain flatbread\u201d contains MULTIPLE GRAINS, which does not mean multiple WHOLE GRAINS, rather it means multiple TYPES of grains, many of which are refined\u2014SO sneaky! I also added a medium coffee with a splash of milk rather than sugar. Total meal: 340 calories, 19 grams of protein, 34 grams of carbs, 14 grams of fat, 580 milligrams of sodium.

When you are new to the\njourney and are trying to immerse yourself it can be pretty intimidating\nas it is. You're doing your research, you're watching videos it is so much information to take in and\nprocess and then you hear people blabbing about macros like it's a common word. Macros, SAY WHAT?! So macros are simple but we could talk forever about them. I'm going to do\nmy best to extremely briefly break it down. Macros are macronutrients. Macronutrients\nare nutrients that provide calories and energy. Macro means large, so macronutrients\nare nutrients that are needed in a large amounts. The three\nmacronutrients are carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Each macronutrient provides\ncalories but they provide different amounts. Carbs provide 4 calories per\ngram, protein provides 4 calories per gram, and fat provides 9 calories per gram.\nIf you look at a nutrition label and a product has 10 grams of carbs you know\nthat about 40 of those calories are from carbs because 10 x 4 = 40.\nIt doesn't always work out exactly but it should be close. So\nyou'll find quickly that channeling your middle school math teacher will be\nuseful in the nutrition world. Let's tackle the biggest category and my favorite category first carbohydrates. Thumbs up if you're a carbs fan! So carbs are used as fuel and energy.\nThey're mainly found in fruits, vegetables, starchy foods like greens and\npotatoes, beans, and those are healthy examples of carbs. So why do carbs get\nbad reputation? Not all carbs are created equal. Without getting too detailed it is\nimportant to understand that there are simple and complex carbs and even within\nthose categories they aren't all the same. Simple carbs are made up of\njust one or two sugar molecules. They are the quickest source of energy and they\nare easy to digest. So table sugar, honey, syrup, candy, and fruit. That's where it gets\nconfusing. Most simple carbs aren't things we want to make a bulk part of\nour diet but fruit is and we shouldn't be afraid of the sugar in fruit. Complex\ncarbs are made of a string of sugar molecules and those take more time to\ndigest because of the fiber and they also offer vitamins and minerals. You know\ngreens, whole grains, oats, starchy vegetables like potatoes, corn, did I already say\nbeans? Lentils. So what to take from this macro wise is that there are different\nkinds of carbs and we need both we want to make sure we're getting the most food\nfor fuel types of cards and within carbs there are sugar and fiber which is why\nyou see them indented beneath the cards on a nutrition label. A lot of people\ndon't realize that sugar and fiber are carbohydrates. Now also you do need large\namounts of fiber to function properly and remember macro means...large. Very good. So a lot of times people think\nfiber was a macronutrient but fiber is something that your body actually can't\nbreak down and used for energy so it doesn't technically qualify as a macronutrient. Got a little bit technical there. Moving on to\nprotein. Protein is a part of a balanced diet. It helps with growth, immune\nfunctions, preserving lean muscle mass. It is found in meats, poultry, fish, cheese,\nmilk. Less amounts in fruits and vegetables. When we eat these foods our\nbody breaks down the protein that they contain into amino acids which are\nessentially the building blocks of proteins. Some of these amino acids are\nessential which means we need them from our diet and some are nonessential\nmeaning our body can make them on its own. Protein from animal sources has all\nessential amino acids and most plant-based sources of protein do not.\nMost not all. That doesn't mean that you need animal products to get all of the\nessential amino acids but it is an easier way to do it.  This not a video to\ntell you to eat or not eat meat I'm just giving you the facts and let's move on\nto fat. So fat also gets a bad rap but we do need it. After all it is a\nmacronutrient for a reason. We need fat for growth, development, energy. It's\nactually the most concentrated source of energy, vitamins, and minerals. So this is\nwhere we get many of our micro nutrients as well. It's also good for cushioning\norgans, maintaining cell membranes, blah blah blah. Fat is found in meat, poultry, nuts, milk, oils, fish, grains.\nAgain there are few different breakdowns here. We have saturated, unsaturated, and\ntrans fat. Now trans fats are the ones we want to pretty much avoid completely.\nSome animal products contain naturally occurring trans fat but most trans fat\nis formed through hydrogenated oils so baked goods, snacks, fried foods, doughs,\nmargarines these all often include trans fats and if it says trans fat on the label then you\nreally want to have it not be a part of your regular diet. Saturated fats are\nalso found in animal products and we want to limit our intake but they are\nnot nearly as bad as trans fats. Both trans and saturated are the fats were\nalways hearing about that can lead to heart disease and raise cholesterol if\nwe consume too much. Unsaturated fats are what we always hear as healthy fats.\nThey're found in olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, and these are shown to decrease the risk\nof heart disease but we still need to be aware of our overall consumption. Which\nleads me to the most dreaded part that I hate talking about. How much of each\nmacro do we need? I cannot tell you that. I can share the recommended amount which are\nvery debatable but sharing anything else would just be my opinion which is not\nwhat this is about and different lifestyles and different\ndiets promote different ratios. You really have to find the one that works for you. A basic guideline and starting point\nwould be those recommended levels. What I want you to keep in mind is those\nnumbers that we talked about at the beginning. So 4 calories per gram of\ncarbs and protein 9 calories per gram of fat. So this means fat is almost double the calories per gram which is why we have\nconsume less of it especially if we're consuming larger amounts of other\nmacronutrients because at the end of the day our calorie intake does matter. As a\nhuman you only need a certain amount of energy in calories and that number can\nvary greatly by person based on your history, your fitness level, lifestyle,\nmetabolism, genetic predisposition, but it still does matter. I'm not here to argue\nwith you on which lifestyle is best, #redefinehealth if you're saying \"well people that are\nketo eat large amounts of fat\" that is absolutely true but they also eat\nminimal carbs. So they're getting their calories from the fat and the protein instead\nof the carbs. All these different lifestyles can work for different people\nbut everyone who has found success on them has some sort of balance with their\nmacronutrients that allows them to eat that certain amount of calories. So there\nis no high protein, high carb, high fat diet that works that I know of. Also I want\nto know which macronutrient is your favorite to eat: carbs, protein, or fat? I\nhope you learned something about the basic breakdown of macros if so please give\nthis video a thumbs up. I dont wanna tell you how much to eat and I don't want you\nto be consumed with eating a certain amount of calories or tracking your\nmacros unless of course it's something you want to try but understanding what\nthe macros are will help you make better choices as you learn more on your\njourney. I know I personally have changed my mind many times on my journey as I learn more and\ntest out my body to see what works for me. I've tried higher fat, lower fat, higher\ncarbs, higher protein it's going to be different for everyone and that's okay.\nThat's why I'm doing this series to help spread the word that we can all coexist\nwith our different lifestyles. We can support each other along the way. AaAaAaa. Have a great day and remember it's all a matter of Mind Over Munch.", "1Okz5oG_dE8": "hi guys today's video we're gonna be making some healthy little snacks with rice cakes and these are one of my favorite things just to munch on for something lighter and you can really do a lot with them and mix it up which is fun alright so for this first one here I'm gonna be making an avocado rice cake so basically I'm just gonna take half an avocado and then I like to cut it up into little cubes almost just to make it easier to spread on top of the rice cake and then I like to top it with fresh tomato some chopped onion as well as some lemon juice and then I'll also just sprinkle a little bit of pink salt and that is a really really delicious stack next up this one's really really easy to make so you're just gonna grab a spoonful of hummus and I just have a garlic hummus here I find it just adds a nice little flavor you're gonna top that on the rice cake as well as topping it with some peppers I'm just going for some green peppers here and that is another very easy thing you can do for the third one I'm just gonna start off by slicing up some cucumber and then I'm gonna take some plain coconut yogurt that's just unsweetened and then top the rice cake with that then once that's finished I'm gonna top the chopped cucumber on top as well as a little bit of fresh dill that I've already very finely chopped up here and that is it for number three you can also squeeze some lemon juice on here which is really tasty as well [Music] number four is a pizza inspired rice cake so I'm just taking some tomato sauce and spreading that on the rice cake and then I'm gonna top it with some fresh spinach as well as a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese and then I'm also going to pop some onions on there as well and voila a little pizza inspired rice cake for number five I'm gonna start by frying up an egg on the frying pan and then I'm also gonna toss some spinach in there to cook up as well and I'm gonna put a little bit of balsamic vinegar into the spinach just to add a little bit of flavor then I'm gonna top the spinach and the egg and some fresh salt and pepper onto the rice cake and that is number five now I also wanted to share some sweeter inspired rice cake recipes so for this one I'm starting off with some sliced strawberry I'm gonna place that all around the rice cake and then I'm gonna top that with some fresh blueberries and a drizzle of honey on there as well for a really great sweet treat for number seven I'm gonna start off with some nut butter I'm just using some peanut butter here and then I'm gonna slice up some of a banana and I'm gonna top the rice cake with the banana as well as some nuts so any kind of nut would work here I'm just using sunflower seeds because that's what I had so a nut or seed whatever you want to do is the perfect topping for this little one right here for this next one here I'm going to grab some fresh raspberries and then just mash them up completely and then what I'm gonna do is take that and top the rice cake with it and then I'm gonna top it off with some dark chocolate chips so we have a nice chocolate raspberry flavor I absolutely love this one number nine I'm taking some chocolate coconut yogurt here and I'm gonna spread that over the rice cake slice up some fresh strawberries and place those on top and then I'm also gonna top it with some dark chocolate chips again so we got an extra chocolaty strawberry dessert here last but not least I'm going to grab my nut butter again so this is just the peanut butter here and then I'm gonna chop up some of an apple and I like to chop it up into cubes I find that's just easier to place on the rice cake and to eat as well so I'm gonna sprinkle that on top there and then I'm also gonna top it with some cinnamon and that is it for the rice cakes hopefully you guys enjoyed these little recipes and you're wanting to try them for your next snack and let me know if you do and how you enjoy them and I'll see you guys in my next video", "-MQD3WUWjxo": "hello welcome to easy gluten-free today I'm making a melting your mouth homemade dark chocolate that I first saw on the squishy monsters Channel but today I customized this decadent dark chocolate with some nuts and dried cranberries to make it the perfect addition to a holiday dessert table now to start in a medium microwave safe Bowl I've got a 1/2 cup of unrefined coconut oil and unless it's the summertime it'll be solidified at room temperature so to get it liquefied microwave it for about 30 seconds add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and 3 tablespoons of honey and if you don't think it's sweet enough you could always add a little more or you could add an artificial sweetener to make this a low-carb chocolate toss in a quarter teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon if you want to give it a festive Flair then whisk until the mixture is well combined smooth and glossy now for the stirrings I've got a 1/2 cup each of pumpkin seeds pecans and cranberries and once everything is nicely combined for a thinner bark pour the mixture out onto a baking sheet lined with parchment and for a bark with thicker more defined edges you could pour the mixture into an 8x8 pan line with parchment now just sprinkle over some more fruit and nuts to garnish if you want to so people will know what's in there now add a light sprinkle of grey flaked sea salt if you're a big fan of the sweet and salty thing then refrigerate the bark until it sets and it'll take about an hour and once it's hard you can cut it into whatever sizes you want and then you can dig in my friends and you won't believe the gourmet quality of this one if you're a dark chocolate lover you just have to try this recipe but keep them refrigerated before serving since they melt quickly this definitely isn't a chocolate that can be mass-produced in some fact and if you need a printed copy you

Foods and Drinks\" that you should try to AVOID if you're on a low\ncarb diet let's get going Hey carbdodgers! My name is Dr. Dan Maggs, I'm here every Tuesday with new videos about how to successfully live a low\ncarb lifestyle. I'd love it if you'd subscribe to my channel. Just hit the\nsubscribe button down below this video and hit the bell to get notified\nwhenever I release a new video every Tuesday. In my experience of helping\npeople become successful low-carb dieters I found a theme of common\nmistakes that people make when starting out. Whenever someone is having a problem on a low-carb diet it's usually one of the following foods that after digging\nthrough what they've been eating is usually one of the problems. So stick\naround to the end of the video to find out all the carbs that you need to dodge\nso that you can be successful on your low-carb journey. So the 'first group' to\navoid is of course the obviously, sugary foods and drinks. Now I'm including these\nhere mainly for completeness its not to insult anyone's intelligence just bear\nwith me I'm gonna rush through this one as fast as possible. So I'm talking about\nthings like candy sweets donuts, cakes, jelly, cookies & jams. Adding\nsugar into your food or drinks stuff where you're obviously consuming sugar\nand the same goes for drinks such as sugar sweetened beverages, soda, sports\ndrinks and energy drinks. Remember the average can of soda has over nine\nteaspoons of sugar in it. Now these are all pretty obvious sources of refined\ncarbohydrates but it's the hidden places that sugar seems to get into that catch\nmost people out. Added sugar is hiding in three-quarters of packaged foods. The\nnext few things are some places where people often get caught out. Sauces and\ncondiments... now some sauces are pretty obviously\nsweet, for example ketchup, barbeque, teriyaki and hoisin sauce so you're\ngonna pretty easily spot these and you might think a list\nbut is okay but these sources can be seriously loaded with sugar and tastes\ncan also be deceiving because even though if they're not obviously sweet\nthis doesn't always mean that they're sugar free. Thankfully many of the hot\nsauces are very low in sugar but beware of sriracha\nwhere sugar is 2nd listed ingredient. Commercially prepared sources are often\nladen with sugar to boost the flavor think about things like tomato sauce and\nbolognese sauces. Number three is salad dressings. Now salads are a classic\nhealthy food and for good reason and they're great for low carb and ketogenic\ndiets but be aware of what can go into ready-prepared salad dressings that you\nbuy from the supermarket be especially careful of glazes. By the way, it's really\neasy to make your own salad dressings just mix three parts of olive oil with\none part vinegar and you've got a basic vinaigrette with no hidden sugars. Be\nespecially aware of salad dressings that are marked as low fat, as they often\ncontain lots of sugar. In fact, let's make low fat products in general, number four.\nSo fat equals flavor and when fat is removed from foods that are supposed to\ncontain fat then they generally taste awful. The food manufacturers often get\naround this by adding sugars to replace the missing flavor\nmeaning that foods that are being marketed as diet or low fat or healthy\nare in fact full of sugar and there are low-fat versions of lots of foods. I've\nalready mentioned low-fat salad dressings but in particular be aware of\nlow fat yogurts. I'd always give these supposedly healthy options a swerve and\ngo for the full fat natural versions. So one of the questions I get asked a lot\nis, \"how do I know if I'm eating hidden sugars?\" I'm sure most people would\nrecognize that glucose and fructose of sugars if they read them on a food label\nand sucrose is of course the chemical name for table sugar. Many of you will\nalso recognize high fructose corn syrup as being a sugar like substance and\nyou'd also be right to be suspicious of other chemical sounding names such as dextran, dextrose, maltodextrin, Socceroos and\nmannose which are all sugars but they're even more tricky than this and they use\nnames such as cane juice crystals, corn syrup solids, corn sweetener, carob syrup.\nThese are all just some of the names that can be used for sugar in foods and\nthere are lots more. So, how do you know if you're eating a hidden sugar? Well for\nthe most part you don't! So, how can you avoid hidden sugars? Well the easiest way\nto avoid hidden sugars is to eat real food and buy real food I mean food that\nisn't processed. If it hasn't got an ingredients list then it's not being\nprocessed and it hasn't got any of these hidden nasties in it. Let's move on to\nnumber 5, natural sugars. Now, we're talking about things like honey\nI gave nectar, raw cane sugar and coconut sugar and this is a common one that I\nhear when people say... \"I thought if it was natural then it was okay\"... well yes it may\nbe a naturally occurring sugar but it's still very high in carbohydrates and\nshould be avoided which brings us onto the controversial topic that is fruits.\nNow, fruits are often labeled as healthy but fruits can have a wide variety of\ncarbohydrate contents. For example, the average banana has the equivalent of\nnearly 6 spoons of sugar whereas the same size portion of watermelon contains\nless than 2 spoons but compare that to the same sized portion of strawberries\nwhich has less than half a spoon of sugar in it. So when it comes to cutting\nthe carbs we can't just lump all fruits together and say they're their low carb\nyou have to learn a bit more about the different carb contents of different\nfruits. In particular, I just urge you to be aware of the more tropical fruit such\nas bananas, mangoes, pineapples that kind of thing. Be especially aware also of\ndried fruit such as sultanas, raisins, apricots and dates. These can be a really\neffective sugar delivery system. The lack of water content in these means it's\neasier to consume a lot of carbohydrates really really fast and fruit juices\nshould also be avoided on a low-carb diet. In a similar way to dried fruit,\nfruit juices in fruit smoothies also allow you to consume large amounts of\nfruit very rapidly. This 200 milliliters of apple juice which is less than a cup\ncontains the same amount of sugar as a can of soda. Number seven grains &\ncereals. This is of course a well-known area to avoid on low carb diets but\nthere are still a few mistakes that I commonly see in this area and by grains\nand cereals, I'm talking about things like wheat, maize, rice, oats, barley etc\nthe things that are used to produce things like breads, pasta and breakfast\ncereals. These all contain a lot of starch and starch is just long branched\nchains of glucose molecules all doing together and these chains break down\ninto glucose eventually so starch is just another form of carbohydrate. The\nmost common mistake I see in this area is that people cut out the white breads\nand pastas and the obviously high carb breakfast cereals but will instead\nchoose the apparently healthier whole-grain alternatives thinking their\nlower carb. Let's take bread for example, this slice\nof white bread has the equivalent of 3.7 spoons of sugar whereas this slice of\nwhole-grain bread has the equivalent of 3 spoons of sugar it's less definitely\nbut two small slices of this whole-grain bread is still the equivalent of 6\nspoons of sugar and the same goes for apparently healthier breakfast options\nsuch as muesli, porridge or oatmeal. So even if they appear to be or are\nmarketed to be healthier options all grains and cereals really should be\navoided on a low-carb diet. Before I move on to the next section, I just want to\nmention something that is a grain but many of us think about as part of\nvegetables and that's sweet corn the clue is in the name really. Sweet corn\ntheir typical 80 gram portion will give you the equivalent of 4 teaspoons of\nsugar which is 20 times the amount you'd get\nfrom eating the same amount of broccoli. Number eight is gluten-free products.\nThis is kind of related to the last one but by avoiding grains most people who\nare living a low-carb lifestyle are naturally gluten-free, but I've seen\nplenty of people get confused about gluten-free products naturally assuming\nthat they are low-carb. So just be aware that gluten-free\ndoesn't necessarily equal low carb. In fact, many of these products are actually\nquite high in carbs. Number nine it's a big one starchy vegetables. So people often know to avoid potatoes on a low carbohydrate diet. The average hundred and fifty gram serving of potatoes has the equivalent\nof nine teaspoons of sugar. Other starchy vegetables to avoid would include sweet\npotatoes and parsnips which have similar carbohydrate contents to potatoes but\nalso cassava or yucca which has about double the carb content of potatoes.\nNumber ten is legumes. Legumes are a family of plants that are made up of\nbeans, lentils and peas and whilst these are a great source of protein and the\ncarbohydrates from these are absorbed quite slowly by the body if you're\nreally cutting back the carbs then most of the legumes need to be off the\nshopping list. There are loads within this group so I'm not going to go\nthrough all of them but the ones that commonly catch people out are chickpeas\nand chickpeas are very high in carbohydrates compared to garden peas\nwhich are much lower in carbohydrates and can be eaten in moderation and all\nbut the most restrictive of low carb diets. Number eleven is the pseudo grains\nwell pseudo grains include things like quinoa, buckwheat and wild rice which\ntechnically isn't actually a rice at all. Now I think of these in the same way\nthat I do legumes they're a lot better and more\nnutritious than grains and cereals but there's still pretty high in carbs and\nshould be avoided. Number twelve is cashew nuts. Cashews nuts are an exception\nwithin the nut family which are really pretty low in carbohydrates\ncashew nuts have three to five times the carbohydrate content that most other\nnuts and this can be especially problematic as they're really easy to\nconsume in large amounts especially if they're salted. Number thirteen is milk.\n Milk contains lactose which is of course a sugar and lactose is rapidly converted\ninto glucose in the body and therefore should be considered high carb. Remember the lattes, cappuccinos and other drinks that are prepared mainly with milk\nshould be avoided. If you're drinking a small splash of milk in two or three\ncoffees a day then you should be fine but if you're using like loads of milk\nin seven or eight cups a day then you're probably consuming a fair amount of\ncarbs just from the milk itself and I definitely recommend getting full fat\nmilk rather than any of the reduced fat stuff you need far less of it to do the\nsame job and I just think it tastes way better and last but not least and quite\nobsessingly in at number fourteen, its beer! Now, any alcohol is always going to\nslow down or stall weight loss on a diet but there are definitely some alcohols\nthat are higher in carbohydrates than others a particular note is beer which\nquite rightly has the nickname of liquid toast and of course there's hundreds of\ndifferent brands of beer that all have varying amount of carbs within them and\nyou can by all means find low carb beers but they all taste pretty awful. So\nthat's it that is my top 14 list of food and drinks to avoid when you're on a low\ncarb diet. Now it's gonna sound like you pretty much can't eat anything but I\nassure you that really isn't the case and if you want to find out some more\ninformation on what you can actually eat then check out the recipes over at carbdodging.com and while you're there you   can check out my free challenge which we\nrun on a regular basis which is going to take you through everything you need to\nknow in order to be successful on your own low-carb journey. \nI really appreciate you all for watching if you've enjoyed this\nvideo then please give it a thumbs up \ud83d\udc4d If you've been caught out by any of the\nthings that I've listed in this video then please let me know in the comments\ndown below or drop me a comment if you think I've missed anything so that I can\nadd it into a future video.

So let's get to it. First we have 2 ingredient Nutella lava cake\nand for this you will need Nutella and two eggs separated. I will put all of the recipe quantities on\nthe HowToCookThat.net website for you in grams and ounces and cups. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks and then\nin a separate bowl whisk together the Nutella and the egg yolks. Now that mixture will be very thick so just\nwarm it slightly in the microwave to make it a bit thinner and then mix through one\nthird of the egg whites to lighten it. Add the rest and then fold it through until\nyou can't see any more streaks of white. Take a bowl and brush the sides of it with\nmelted butter, then add some sugar and swirl it around the bowl and tip it out. This just helps to stop it sticking. Wrap some baking paper around the outside\nof the bowl to stop it flowing over when we bake it and then tie it firmly into place. Pour the mixture right up to the top of the\nbowl and then bake that in a hot oven until they are risen. Remove the baking paper, add a scoop of icecream\nand some icing sugar on top and then scoop down to get that hot Nutella lava. Next at number 2 we have 2 ingredient Nutella\nmousse and for this you'll need Nutella and cream, this one is super easy. Add half of the cream and then mix that together\nwith the Nutella and then add the remaining cream and whisk that on high speed until it\nthickens. Now you are essentially whipping the cream\nhere so you don't want to over-whip it you're going to end up with a grainy mixture so just\nwhip it until it's thick and you can see the sort of pattern of the beaters on it. Then pour that into serving bowls and refrigerate\nit for about 4 hours before serving. Coming in at number 3 we have Nutella truffles,\nagain two ingredients for this one. Take a silicon ice cube tray and fill it with\nmelted chocolate. Tip it over and then shake out the excess. Now make sure you do temper your chocolate\nor if you don't want to do that you can use compound chocolate instead. Then smooth out the tops and let that set. Pipe some Nutella into each chocolate and\nthen top it up with more chocolate to seal it and smooth it off. And once that is set you can just turn it\nover and push them out of the mould. And you can of course use milk or dark chocolate\nfor these instead of white. At number 4 we have Nutella star bread. Take some bread dough that has been risen\nonce, and I'll put the recipe that I'm using on the website. Knock it down and then form it into a ball. Cut that dough into three, then roll each\nportion into a flat circle. Make and impression with a plate and then\nspread some warmed Nutella into that circle on the first one. Add the next layer, some more Nutella and\nthen the top layer. Put the plate back on top and cut around it\nto make a circle and then use a cup to make a smaller circle in the centre. Cut from there to the edge in 4 places and\nthen cut each of those in half and then cut each of those in half again. Now take one of your pieces and twist it twice. Take the bit next to it and twist it twice\nin the opposite direction and continue to do that the whole way around the circle. Now a shout-out to Uccia3000 who was the first\nYouTuber to do a video on this star in October 2013 and now it's everywhere. Take two edges and join them together and\ncontinue that with the rest of them. Slide that onto a baking tray and leave it\nin a warm place for about 15 minutes until it's risen and spread out. Then bake it in the oven until it's baked\nthrough and warm and golden with Nutella streaks all the way through. At number 5 we have Nutella Pastry Star. And this is my cheats way of making the bread\nstar. Cut three circles of puff pastry and spread\nthem with Nutella and stack them just like we did for the bread version. Cut it and twist it in the same way and then\ntake 2 pieces that are next to each other and join them together by pushing down with\na fork. Bake that in the oven until it's puffed and\ncrisp. At number 6 we have Nutella icypoles and for\nthese you'll need Nutella, cocoa powder, corn flour, milk and vanilla. Put the vanilla, a little bit of the milk,\nthe corn flour and the cocoa into a saucepan and whisk it until there are no lumps. Then add in the rest of the milk and the Nutella. Heat that over high heat, stirring it continuously\nuntil it starts to bubble and then keep stirring it for another minute so that it thickens\nup nicely. Pour this mixture into icypole moulds and\nof course you could just use the mousse that we made with the cream and the Nutella for\nthis but these are a little bit healthier with the milk instead of the cream. Then add your 4 sticks and freeze those until\nthey're solid. At number 7 we have a Nutella mug cake and\nfor this you'll need milk, Nutella, cocoa powder, egg, sugar, baking powder and plain\nflour. Place the flour, baking powder, sugar and\ncocoa powder into a bowl and whisk it to get rid of any lumps. Add in the egg, milk and that Nutella and\nwhisk it until it's just combined. Pour that into two cups so that they're both\nabout half full and microwave it for 70 to 90 seconds depending on the wattage of your\nmicrowave. And then sprinkle that with icing sugar and\nserve it immediately. Number 8 we have 2 ingredient Nutella soft\nserve. And for this you'll need 4 bananas. Peel your bananas and slice them up into a\nplastic container and repeat that with all of them. Then put that in the freezer for a few hours. Once it's frozen put the Nutella and the bananas\ninto a food processor and process it until it's thick and smooth. Place it into a piping bag and pipe onto the\nicecream cones. Now it's the banana here that makes these\nthick and the Nutella that's making it sweet and creamy. Number 9 we have yummy, crunchy 4-ingredient\ncookies. For this you'll need flour, Nutella of course,\nsugar and an egg. Add all of the ingredients into a bowl and\nstir them together and you'll end up with a thick, crumbly mixture like this. Place tablespoons of that mixture onto baking\npaper and then slide that onto a baking tray and bake in the oven until they're crisp. At number 10, my favourite, we have 2 ingredient\nNutella brownies. And for this you need some warmed Nutella\nand eggs. Place the eggs in the bowl of an electric\nmixer and whisk on high speed for about 5 minutes or until they're thick and foamy like\nthis. Mix one third of the eggs with the warmed\nNutella and mix them together well, then fold in the remaining eggs, making sure you don't\nover mix this, we want to keep lots of that air in here. Pour that into a baking tin and bake it for\n10 minutes. Yum, look at that.

3 eggs 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour 1 cup of milk chocolate in a large bowl add 3 eggs and going to whisk it very well next add the all-purpose flour and mix until you see no lumps then you're going to set this bowl aside in a saucepan on low heat add the chocolate and you're going to melt it until it's nice and smooth and it has to be smooth guys because you don't want it lumpy or you don't want to burn the chocolate so just make sure to keep an eye on the chocolate and just keep mixing within 30 seconds the chocolate on the bottom the one that's touching the saucepan will melt first so just keep mixing and once you're done you're going to remove the saucepan from the heat then you're going to add the egg mixture to the chocolate and mix very well then take your cupcake pan that's lined with six cupcake liners and make sure to spray it and add the batter into the liners you're going to bake this at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 to 18 minutes so once it's done you can remove it from the oven and serve immediately I literally ate it as soon as I took it out of the oven guys it was so good and it was not on the sweet side because I didn't add any other sugar and I love this

milk chocolate not too bitter in that sense the almond tastes great and smoked chocolate guys it's pretty good i'm used to the really thick milk chocolate covered elements but i'm not entirely missing it because the milk chocolate here does taste pretty good definitely down with that dusting and cocoa very truffle-esque ron's giving this one 8 out of 10. and for the dark fan and pretty well the exact same look that nice dusting of cocoa a dark chocolate covered almond i'm a little curious this is going to be too aggressive with the cocoa taste with the darker chocolate usually when they say darker chocolate it's still pretty sweet and not what i consider dark chocolate i love the combination in the last so let's check this one in dark chocolate oh i really like the richness of that chocolate not necessarily less sweet it's just very rich this even has more of a truffle vod not too aggressive with that cocoa and the tasty almond really shines in this one i think i prefer the dark i find the more intense flavor makes up for the actual lack of chocolate it has a strong truffle vibe but at the same time it kind of makes more room for the almond taste to come through ron's given the dark chocolate nine out of ten i'm really down with this one i found these at sobies across canada you should be able to find that sophie's as well another quick round reviews and see you guys next time you", "3NYdkZKmiC4": "hi guys after sharing the video on how to select oats for weight loss I got a lot of questions on what to look for while buying healthy muesli granola or cereals so in this short video I'm going to show how to make this process simpler I'm in one of the super stores and this is a cereal section you have so many variants to choose from chocolate paths to berry flavors the multigrain instant cereals etc and finding the right one is certainly difficult opt for these kind of cereals for example this is shredded wheat and if you see the label it only has 100% whole grain wheat dip them in the milk and have them these are filling and healthy the second wedding comes along with the pram and it's better than the first one as it comes with gran which is an outer layer of the weight betta Bicks is the same variant of another brand but Weetabix usually comes with added sugar hence I prefer post brand over Weetabix the third pack is from Kellogg's you might pick this as it's a is made with 100% whole grain with no artificial colors and flavors so now I'm going to show the label and you'll be surprised to see then it has gone icing sugar glycerine and gelatin hence obviously skip it this shows how important it is to read the ingredients this one is all brand parts from Kellogg's although it reads bran and looks so healthy but if you see the label sugar is lying second in the list which makes it a complete No now this is the fifth back it says all bran flakes from Kellogg's I thought this to be healthy but no I was wrong sugar and malt extract are in the list I'm not for or against any brand here but just like you own even I considered Kellogg cereals to be healthy just because they are the pioneers in making seasons and have been making from a very long time but trust me after knowing the ingredients when Kellogg's has turned out to be the worst there were many more on the Shelf like Oreos Oh Kellogg's Honey etc but they were terrible I didn't even wanted to pick them so if you're buying a pack of breakfast cereals skip those which have sugar fructose dextrose corn syrup etcetera added to them now I'm at the granola section muesli and granola have the similar contents like oats grains nuts and seeds but mutually is an unbaked or uncooked version of these ingredients they both have breakfast and snack food granola has sweeteners added to it by default so I usually don't recommend these however by checking the label you can still choose something which is healthy for you like the first bank I have is almond vanilla granola though it has sugar it's brown sugar and it does not contain textures of fructose so you can pick something similar to this now the second pack is from Quaker though it contains brown sugar but it also contains raisins coated with sunflower oil and coconut oil moreover this pack is nutritionally low compared to other cereals hence I don't recommend these next one is from Kellogg's dark chocolate and coconut variant skip it as it has lots of sugar we don't need this much sugar in the morning so just avoid it I don't know why they will to spoil such beautiful human bodies by injecting so much of sugar seriously this pack has honey almond granola it has brown sugar but still a good pick next pack is from Kashi this is honey almond Flags it's a seven green and seed blend canola and instead of sugar they have added dried gain Sarah it has Drive cane sugar which is not as bad as refined sugar fructose or consider you can certainly choose this one now this one is another variant of the same brand though it contains seven whole grains but it also contains lot of oils like canola sunflower etc plus on the top a corn flour and baking soda hence I do not recommend this variant at all now I have muesli from Alton it has whole grain wheat raisins and brown sugar so still a good pick and the last one is ancient grain cereal everything added to it is organic also it has organic honey added to it instead of sugar so as per me this is the right pet buy something like this or 100% whole wheat shreddies that I suggested earlier for a healthy life I don't really prefer you to have oats for good health look for muesli with no added sugar cause granolas are usually sweetened if you know any brand or if you're using one which is healthy and without sugars then do mention the name in the comment section so others can benefit as well I also have a video on how to choose the right pack of oats and my channel the video link can be found in the description box and at the end of this video I personally only buy oats and shreddies I don't buy muesli or granola so even I had to hunt to find a good one for you hope you like my effort with this short video to help you make a better choice please share this video and subscribe to my channel and I will see you soon with a new one till then remember to buy healthy to stay healthy bye bye [Music]", "4nqTrnxAbWM":

value so floor are you sure you'll be satisfied with two boxes for us two bucks normal person just one bro probably you really got with the trend no because I'm everybody doing what I call her the one boxes are I think he started it I think they may have yeah give it up first and talk about because you know how sometimes some places Taco Bell KFC are together on the same roof [Music] okay see I'm waiting for Wendy to do it now you'll probably ever probably because the hotdogs y'all thought that was pretty satisfied probably reminds me of Lego a ballpark hotdogs the basic one that's still eat this double cheeseburger basic double cheeseburger that's good I need some pickles oh yeah I really eat cause you hear much but hey I might have to reconsider [Music] [Music] they forgot the pickles

bacon burger I'm pretty sure they got Swiss cut fries they could have made some that have cut fries or Frank pickles or something like that yeah the brunch team Makani yeah switch it up like it got really redundant flavor-wise and taste wise you want a little variety yeah like if I had five bucks in my pocket I'm going to toggle Go Go and get their $5 box because you get you get it but there's a triple box and then you get two tacos with it and one of them Doritos local yeah half-known of homes it's a really yeah they they know wassup they switch enough like that and even their the KFC five dollars for the box like three piece chicken tenders you get a biscuit and decide mashed potatoes or mac and cheese they allow you to switch it up yeah but like you said maybe they're just getting rid

ultimate baking series with me chef of class today I'm going to show you a very exciting recipe of a pea cake so let's start I'm going to take a large bowl in which I'm going to see whole wheat flour as I'm making it more healthy I'm going to add one cup of whole wheat flour into the seeds with that I'm going to add one cup of refined flour with that I'm going to add one cup of powdered sugar that I'm going to add half a teaspoon of baking soda - teaspoon of baking powder as I'm making it eggless I'm going to increase the quantity of baking powder then I'm going to add 1/4 teaspoon of salmon powder as we all know the combination of cinnamon with Apple is really divine when you see all this together nicely [Music] I'm going to give this a nice mix then I'm going to set this aside next I'm going to peel the apples [Music] when you talk that bit of leaf [Music] when you add this to a mixer job it is very important to query the Apple at this stage and we don't want them to turn black and then I'm going to blend this go find you read so once the Apple purity is done I'm going to take a big bowl to which I'm going to add when you add one cup of apple puree then I'm going to add 150 grams of melted butter [Music] and one cup of skim milk [Music] makes all this together nicely [Music] and then I'm going to start adding the refined flour mixture one third first I'm going to fold this nicely [Music] and then I would add the remaining 2/3 of the refined flour mixture and fold this completely so now that a batter is ready finally I'm going to add a tablespoon of oil to the final mix and now the batter is ready to go into a cake tin so you have already greased the cake tin with butter and refined flour now in goes the batter if there's a tap and now this is ready to go in a preheated oven at 180 degree Celsius around 30 to 35 minutes now you see apple cake has nicely baked and I've got it down to the room temperature now let's dim all this now I would cut this [Music] it is still hot but you need to bring it down with room temperature and then cut the cake you can see it is nice moist soft from inside so here you go healthy nutritious apple cake without any eggs just

don't have high cholesterol I use these foods because they're exceedingly healthy and convenient I do try to follow you know and practice what I preach I try to eat Intel food plant-based diet so I do favor beans and greens and nuts and seeds and fruits and vegetables and whole grains whenever I can but like I said I'm not perfect I'm not a vegan I don't ask my patients to become vegans I eat steak from time to time I just don't do it every day so it's really about being better you don't have to be perfect you can just better", "6FQlIslZYAM": "you're going to be surprised at just how simple it is to make your own rock candy today welcome to Todd's kitchen who doesn't love rock candy it's so simple yet delicious but let's put a little Christmas Ben on it so join me today as make my version of rock candy and also don't forget to check out Todd's kitchen com for my merchandise store now to start off with I have a pot on the stove on a high heat so today I'm going to add 3 and 3/4 cups of sugar then to that I'm going to add 1 cup of corn syrup or glucose syrup then 1 cup of water and finally a few drops or dissin out of red food coloring being a Christmas theme so it just can't - keep on stirring this over high heat until the sugar is dissolved and it comes up to a boil okay so once it's come up to a boil I'm going to turn it down to a medium heat now and just keep on stirring it just another minute or two just so it doesn't burn the bottom of the pot so basically at a medium temperature this is going to a simmer away for about 40 to 45 minutes you want a nice and slow you don't do it too fast and what I highly recommend is to use a candy thermometer now these are very cheap they're probably about 15 dollars and we want to go for the hard crack stage which is 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about 150 degrees Celsius so basically what it does it just sits on the side of the pot like so with a thermometer just inside and that will tell you the temperature that's that your sugar is currently acts so remember the low and slow is best because you want to make sure that all that water is evaporated and but give it a chance for that sugar to warm up nicely till we get to the hard crack stage so you want to add some peppermints for their Christmasy taste or we can add strawberry it's really up to you you can use any flavor that you'd like for this candy but being a Christmas version you want to try and keep it more Christmasy so I'm going to add some peppermint extracts and keep it as a red color so remember low-and-slow gonna should take about 40 to 45 minutes give or take okay so just got to the hard crack stage so I'll turn the heat off and I've also taken it straight off the heat you don't want to overdo it otherwise you can burn the mixture so what I have here is just a shallow baking dish and I'll just line with some baking paper so basically all we have to do now is just pour on our candy mixture on to our shallow dish now try and get as wide as you possibly can or as big as you possibly can possibly can so it's not overly thick and once there that's all you do it so it's simple as that just let that rest and sit there and cool down for a good two three hours and then it's ready you don't have to put it in the fridge or anything it is really that simple now as a tip with the pot just simply fill it with water and over the course of a few hours the water will simply dissolve all that leftover sugar and candy and you will be left with a perfectly clean pot so you won't have to worry about trying to scrape or break off any candy that's hardened on the pot okay so as you can see it is now completely set so you should another piece of baking paper here and I'm just going to place that just on top and just on the rolling pin basically just going to shut it see also start to break up like glass [Music] okay so I'm just got a bowl now I'm just going to put some powdered sugar icing sugar just going to place that into the base now because this is going to be very sticky so I got to coat it in the icing sugar so you see it just comes off the pot comes apart just like so and we just break it up and cover it in the icing sugar there's any really sharp pieces if you have kids around just make sure you just try and break those little bits off you can even eat the little bits if you like so this way I'll just prevent it from being all sticky so we have our candy and there we have our special Christmas edition rock candy no of course you can make this at any time of the year you can use any color that you like any flavor that you like for any season whatsoever because rock candy is so simple to make but it's also versatile so just by adding superb Mint and making a red for Christmas I've made it into a Christmas edition but the sky's the limit and rock candy is pure sugar so you do want to have it in moderation but honestly no matter what flavor that's use what color that you use rock candy always tastes simply delicious", "4-R_k2zUrLY": "what everybody welcome to that's fella who Sheldon's of Christmas 2017 we got special guests and this would be our first out of 12 food challenges of

"NdqK1t9uMHU": "today Kevin and not really trying the Kellogg's strawberry krispies these were 250 at Meijer they are a new flavored with other natural flavors colors and flavors from natural sources it's funny they have to make a big color sources I know Wow when you're in America you usually get you know it is strawberry flavored sweetened rice cereals and rice krispies is something that I would never eat as a snack by itself but let's just see what the very red Oh smells wonderful very strong yeah this is not something you would normally mmm not that tastes like a rice crisps between it's good though I bet that would make some really good right stress injuries be different marshmallow strawberry yeah that would be really good it has a strong strawberry flavor he says that talking to the snap snap crackle pop it is talking it says the cereal by itself one cap 32 grams is 120 calories and I'm not gonna give you the calories with milk because people use different milks so just know the hard way calories you really tasted a strawberry drop like without milk once you added the milk you know it's still there but what decreased a lot I couldn't agree more that's exactly what I want sad but that's there I mean it's greatly greatly diminished you can taste it the strawberries so much more when it's dry it does have a recipe on the back for the original rice krispies treats and it says strawberry krispies and milk similarly genius so those only one more make these will yeah yeah because the unmilled version is much stronger flavors that we've really good anniversary tree I still like them oh yeah that's so good it's nice yeah I'm strong right now it does but if you really want to taste the strawberry yeah you know when to eat it yeah well yeah put them in yeah rice krispie treat about a line and it does turn the milking pink I wonder if the milk will just taste like strawberry probably one but Rice Krispies are one of those cereals that and they're probably in my top three I love rice krispies and they used to like years ago I would sit down and eat like three bowls of them I mean with your sugar bowl in front of you yes I wasn't going to say that part of it okay yeah that's a bit by the time you're done you got about this much sugar in the bottom of your bowl and then you get to enjoy that myself a little milk but yes I love Rice Krispies anyway so these are still good they still have such classic crimes the same texture and it baby just added some strawberry to it and then does have a like stronger cleric gone completely it's just just no strong right I wish it was a little stronger on the milk but it is still fire so worth trying worth having something a little bit different I think so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "46ljKK5sd9U": "hi guys it's Lanie and welcome back to simply baking's today i'm going to be sharing with you a quick and easy no big recipe three ingredient cheesecake this recipe is really delicious and it's so easy you guys will be making this everyday let's begin in a large bowl add softened cream cheese and you're going to take your handheld mixer or your stand mixer and you're going to mix it at this stage just because if you mix it in with anything else sometimes there's going to be small clumps of cream cheese next take a can of condensed milk you're going to add it to the cream cheese and you're going to continue mixing until it is well combined and to get the complete recipe head over to my blog assembly baking calm and once you're finished mixing let it sit in the refrigerator to allow it to thicken while you make the crust so for the cookie flavor is the first one I picked was this frosting filled cookies peanut butter Oreo cookies and coconut cookies so I place them in separate bags and then I took my rolling pin and then crush the cookies so for the crust you don't want the cookies so crumbly this is actually how you want it to look like so I grab some jars and then I took about a tablespoon of the cookies and pressed it into the bottom of the jar then I separated the cream cheese into three separate bowls I took the cookies that are crushed and then I added each of them into the separate bowls make sure you know which cookie is which because the frosting filled cookies and the coconut cookies look very similar also if you don't want to mix the cookies in the cream cheese you can almost layer it or place your cream cheese into the jars and then sprinkle a bunch of cookies on top of the cream cheese in the jar and once you're finished mixing all the cookies you're going to add the cream cheese mixture into your jars the cheesecake is best served when it's chilled so just keep it in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve if you want me to try more flavors let me know in the comments to garnish the cheesecake take some of the cookies and place it on top of the cheesecake also if you don't want to do that you can always crush the cookies and then sprinkle it on top if you don't have jars you can always use cups you can make it in a tray you can use those little small cups however it tastes so much better I think when you make individual sizes let me know in the comments what is your favorite flavor of cheesecake happy baking thank you guys so much for watching if you like this video please give it a thumbs up this helps spread the message to other people who want to learn how to bake and just so you know I upload two videos a week on Mondays I upload all about cookies and Fridays it's desserts

really interesting spiraled cereals click the link down below there is a footnote down below a footnote usually is an asterisks that is attached to something else oh I know what it is I've just figured it out as quickly as I as quickly as I asked I found it out si si si si style it says curiously strawberry with a little asterisk above the Y that means there's something else going on in this cereal so take my glasses off say some catchphrase I'm gonna look down below flavor well it looks like this berry was wild after all I don't know that's absolutely ridiculous you look at also 7.4 grams of sugar 3.1 grams of fat 1.1 grams of saturated fat and 0.34 grams of salt the I don't know but these bits of cereal almost look like cinnamon toast crunch another cereal that unfortunately I don't you think we get any more in Canada on on some on the side excuse me it's good to know some nutritional facts provided by Nestle and on the back oh no what's going on here first for a second thought I thought all these pieces of cereal we're drowning in milk it turns out that they're not they're more scared about this rabid this rabid cereal bit that's about to be engage them and devour them it's probably gonna be like World War Z he'll bite one of the cereal pieces and then like 12 to 15 seconds later he'll turn as well that was an awesome movie by the way it is recommended that we eat at least three servings of whole grain each day a bowl of curiously strawberry provides 1/2 of a whole grain serving Nestle guarantees that all of our cereals provide a minimum of one half a whole grain serving for more information you can go to as for the read-up curiously strawberry we wouldn't help but agree with the crazy squares a curiously strawberry would be a good idea so we've covered our crunchy whole-grain squares in strawberry swirls that taste like no other pour yourself a bowl today before another curious soul gets their hands on them you can become a fan at facebook.com forward slash curiously cinnamon what's going on here maybe it is cinnamon toast crunch that's been invaded or infected perhaps by this bite of cereal here infected by strawberry the only way we'll know we'll put that right there obviously we'll bring in a bowl reaching off-camera I got myself a bowl right here bring the camera down slightly and let's get these cereal opened up love trying other cereals from around the world you know what perhaps is a little bit of interactive segment to review you guys can let me know down below what is an interesting named cereal that you have fried that was not part of your local defining local stores the pieces themselves are not quite as decked out as they were in the cereal box there's one pieces right there kind of looks like it's tattooed it could be Cybertronian I don't think so though it is dusted with what looks to be sugar let's give this a try find out what it's like and then we'll add some milk let's give this a try mmm it's that it's whole-grain but it's got a nice dusting of sweet sugar on it and then you can taste that strawberry it really pops and makes the cereal quite nice I would say though consistency wise and almost flavor wise excluding the strawberry it does kind of have that same texture and flavor as cinnamon toast crunch without the cinnamon and then substituting cinnamon for strawberry let's pour ourselves off some spies quickly realized I have not opened the bag nearly enough there we go pieces are stuck in the bag all right there we go and reaching off-camera you can't see it but I'm reaching into my black hole and I'm pulling myself some milk just a little bit of milk to get that cereal moist anytime I get the opportunity to say moist you know I'm gonna use it now let's get this cereal slightly moistened moist moist alright let's give this a try with milk the curiously strawberry cereal let's go just a try no almost by adding the milk I've gotten rid of some of the flavor of the strawberry um it's there near the end but essentially what I'm eating first is I feel like I'm eating just a cinnamon toast crunch but without the cinnamon I think the strawberry comes in there later but it's not there initially it is good Cyril oh is it is actually really really good Cyril if you'd like to give this a try spots gonna provide the link down below to British corner shop today's random spot

"8LrrSpFKRg8": "there are no other foods i think as unique as cereal in the in the child-like breakfast mine i want to say two words to you and get your reaction you ready yeah count chocula yeah yeah i never never had that in the house you bastard count chocula for those who don't know was a breakfast cereal i don't even know if it's still made maybe it is we had little chocolate marshmallows and little chocolate you know pieces and and your milk would get chocolatey like a lot of other cereals but it just had a quality to it but i think we didn't have that in the house because i didn't like it i i just don't like marshmallows very much you're killing me you're killing me hang on like cocoa pebbles way better than count chocula what about lucky charms you didn't like lucky charms marshmallows no i did not like lucky charms cocoa pebbles cocoa pebbles terrific cocoa pebbles was my favorite cereal because it had it had the added benefit of really being two meals you had the
