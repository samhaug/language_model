first cookbook nerdy nummies cookbook the basic recipe and I wanted it to be perfect so every week I would do another batch of cookies and go hmm this one needs a little bit more salt this one needs

satisfies all my friends regardless of their cookie texture preference the ones who like more chewy love it the ones who like a little crunchy love Fame this is love and if you like to watch baking videos don't forget to give this video a thumbs up click subscribe and ring the bell to receive notifications every time I'll post a new video now let's make the best chocolate chip cookies ever let's get started for this chocolate chip cookie recipe I'm gonna be posting all of the ingredients and their measurements in the description down below so if you want to follow along at home ya KN all right first step to making these cookies very simple we're gonna mix together some dry ingredients in a medium bowl you're gonna combine your flour baking soda and salt so they're salty then whisk together until well combined alright it's well mixed now I'm gonna set this off to the side next in a big mixing bowl we're gonna cream together our butter sugar and a little bit of vanilla extract protip you want to make sure your butter is at room temperature it makes a big difference you want it really soft when you're creaming together your butter and sugars we're putting it two sticks of butter Steen tablespoons Oh worth it at granulated sugar brown sugar which is the most important ingredient when you're making chocolate chip cookies if you're not using brown sugar it in my opinion is not a chocolate chip cookie it just doesn't have that richness to it that like caramel II that like it's a sweet sugar with Sol this is what you want if you don't have this don't come to my house with chocolate chip cookies I mean I probably will have a few bites cuz I like cookies but I love brown sugar and a little bit of vanilla extract then you're gonna cream together until your mixture is light and fluffy I'm gonna be using an electric hand mixer just makes it a little bit easier than doing it by hand I'm gonna mix on a medium speed fun factoid side bar a road ramp the reason brown sugar is brown you know there's light brown sugar dark brown sugar is because it's made with molasses which is why it just tastes so good cuz molasses is what you use to make gingerbread cookies which are like one of the best cookies in the entire world and they just have that rich flavor it's almost just like caramel II like it's so good so light brown sugar has a little less molasses and then dark brown sugar has more I'm gonna get back to mixing here I just have some rogue brown sugar clumping together which it loves to do it's a little stickier so I'm just ready break it those up so I could get some light fluffy butter come on Molly this one's stubborn he's toss out the brown sugar never never I need every chunk of molasses I can get there was our molasses area it when you play candy cane that game molasses Mountain molasses Valley molasses let me know in the comments below if you know this your maybe will be Mike or Molly here they're looking it up on Google when you're playing the board game Candyland well is that little Mole this area called on like the original who's a molasses swamp swarm up with a guy named blobby oh he's terrifying bloppy looks kind of poopy I remember all of them being so cute he's a scary button what does he think moly show me a picture of this one licorice it's not interesting to you let me see gloppy looks adorable look at him he's cute

face I'm not saying Moe had bad taste in men I'm saying there weren't a lot of options available oh yeah I'm done I'm done oops I'm done spilling the tea and the cookie dough so let's get to mix it now Malik we get back to baking or whatever looking good look how light and fluffy this looks like a brown sugar butter cloud yeah I want to bathe it our sleeping a cuddle huh okay this is looking good also one more tangent I promise little baby gray is learning how to bake and it is so adorable so go check out my sister's Instagram it is so cute he's like one and a half and he's already making like little cupcakes and stuff he's baking with Grandma so cute it's adorable he's like a little baby Baker at the making and I love it okay so go check it out I'm keeping distracted by cute babies okay back to cookies back to kisses this is important now we're gonna add and mix in two full eggs the yolk and the egg white one at a time so you're gonna add one mix it up add the other one mix it up I did a double handed a crack because I don't want to mess these up at all hi Mike it's not worth the risk yeah you can't be too safe no one in time when time oh my gosh oh my god my nonno pilot oh my gosh I get to cracking eggs and you just can't stop me I'm just like Adam that was a close call I almost messed up my perfect cookie recipe thanks Mike oh my gosh here we go yeah honestly I gotta get that white in there a little bit of white fill in there buddy here we go again I'm gonna do a scrape down as well cuz I'm not messing around with these cookies for getting all those ingredients [Applause] this batter is looking great on a little speed while you're mixing slowly add in the dry ingredients I'm gonna do this with a little measure cup I'm not measuring anything I'm just using as a little scoop while I'm mixing just keep going until you've added all the flour and it's well combined well scoop mix it in this is to get the perfect consistency I also promise this is the only part in the recipe where you have to be a little patient but there's no decorating or anything so I think it all evens out well then our chocolate chips folding our chocolate chips folding our chocolate chips folding or chocolate chips so if you haven't guessed the next step is this is last step is to fold in our chocolate chips so just pour all of them into a big bowl then using a spatula or a large mixing spoon you're just gonna fold them in here's how you fold it's a little bit different than mixing we don't want to chop up our chocolate chips we want to keep them whole so we fold more gently so you're gonna take your spatula and go underneath the batter and then bring it over like so you and turn under over turn now you just keep doing this till all the chocolate chips are in the dough oh my gosh this smells and looks so good I just want to eat this Oh eating fresh cookie dough is one of my guilty pleasures I am restraining myself right now I'm not gonna do that today but I also have a delicious vegan cookie dough recipe and it's made so you can just eat them as little cookie don't Molly you remember that recipe oh they're so good yeah I don't want to blow my cup but Mike was like oh I don't want any vegan cookie dough that's not gonna taste good and he had one what blow him up oh my god okay I I was trying to say I didn't want to blow you up but oh my gosh so anyways I wasn't gonna blow my Cup but I'm doing it boom a little bit right now is I made vegan cookie dough and you're supposed to eat it in the little ball forms and Mike ate one he was like I guess these are okay I was like okay they're delicious and then I go to the fridge the next morning all twenty of them that I had in a little bag in the fridge gone Michael Beauty you ain't a half-eaten boss I don't even think that counts and I was like where did all these cookie balls go and Mike's like uh and I was like oh you loved him and he was like okay I liked him I liked oh my god might like to vegan recipe well don't worry Mike there's gonna be play more where that came from in the future but today classic the best chocolate chip cookies ever made so you'll just have to settle for this oh my gosh what happened here get in the bowl we can't have this yeah what did you guys think I said blow my gut we need a replay we need an instant replay like a referee like in sport games we need to really review the footage did I say I don't want to blow my cup but or did I say I don't want to blow my gut but I don't want to blow my cup but blow my cup but you guys are messed up okay I don't think I said that I don't think I said that we all miss her d twice well you know what then it's just like my fault like I can't talk like my communicating is so bad that you don't actually know what I'm saying we were like perfect give this girl baking show we can't understand her oh yeah our chocolate-chip cookie dough is totally ready to bake now we're gonna scoop 2 tablespoons of the dough onto a baking sheet and woah I usually don't do this but we're gonna be scooping them onto an ungreased baking sheet now I want to emphasize that these are nonstick sheets if you don't have non-stick sheets I would advise putting down a piece of parchment paper but because these are nonstick sheets no grease needed these cookies have enough butter they grease themselves and I love it I scooped 2 tablespoons about 2 inches apart leave some room because they will expand also this recipe makes about 3 dozen chocolate chip cookies and it makes so many because everybody wants one and you run out anyways you make this and then everyone's like well where'd all the cookies go and I think that's a great question y'all where did all the cookies go so that's why I've made so many of this one cuz it's good the scoop that I'm using is 2 tablespoons so I just scoop it up and get off the excess cuz I don't know about you but in our house if someone got a bigger cookie than someone else it's a big deal alright got our little quickie you're just gonna fill up your tray boom Minnelli's delicious cookies are ready to bake you're gonna heat your oven to 375 degrees and bake for about 7 to 9 minutes they bake fast so keep your eye on them and every ovens a little bit different you want to watch them and as soon as they turn a little bit golden brown they're ready once your cookies have baked you're gonna let your cookies sit on the tray for one minute to cool and while they're on here they're gonna continue to bake and you'll see a little bit of color difference over here this is the perfect color that you your cookie when you remove them from the oven you'll see it's a really light brown then as they cool like over here they get a little bit darker it's all about timing in my oven these cook for nine minutes but it really depends on your oven ovens are so different different brands how they're set up how they're ran so just keep your eye on it when they turn this color in the oven between seven and nine minutes perfect they have a little bit of crisp and softness you'll get the best of both worlds and they also deflate a little bit you'll see that they poof up when they bake and then as they're cooling they kind of just go down a little bit and tada there you have it the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe a big thank you to you guys for suggesting a simple delicious at-home

sorry cuz these are delicious", "wyuec0PPz68": "so what makes an ideal chocolate-chip cookie what ingredients and what techniques today I'd like to answer that question [Music] explain them very briefly and I'm gonna get right into the first thing is melted butter not cream none of that other [ __ ] melted butter that leads to a chewy cookie the second thing is an added egg yolk the egg yolk adds richness and fudgy Mnet's and now you've got fuzziness and chewiness and then the third thing is to rough chop a chocolate bar rather than using chocolate chips because chocolate chips are complete [ __ ] my opinion you get tiny little bits of chocolate it's it's it's not fun when you chop rough chopped your chocolate you get a beautiful sort of like chocolatey marbled look on the top and then you get random little sporadic bits of just like pure molten melty chocolate in the set I mean come on yeah that's a given if you want to use chocolate chips that's fine I'm not gonna judge you I'm just saying that it's not as good sort of a weird sort of cookie hack that I recently learned called the pan bang method well actually I'll just show you further down in the video because I can't give it all the way gotta get that full YouTube watch time you know understand so I hope you guys will be able to forgive me for that couple day hiatus that I had but I am back we're gonna go ahead and start with 200 grams or wanted a half cups of all-purpose flour three grams or a half a teaspoon of kosher salt four grams or a half a teaspoon of baking soda and then you're just gonna whisk all of that together to combine thoroughly take seven ounces of a dark chocolate bar breaking into large pieces and rough chop that bad boy another term rough-chop comes across little vague so I'll try and explain but you don't want it too small you definitely want it larger than a chocolate chip especially considering all the [ __ ] that I was just talking about chocolate chips next we're gonna take 112 grams or half a cup of unsalted butter and all you got to do is melt it down but don't forget on the stove like I almost did now here I'm using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment but you could totally use a bowl on a whisk a totally fine and you're gonna add in 200 grams or 3/4 of a cup plus 2 tablespoons of packed brown sugar and then 112 grams or half a cup of white granulated sugar start your stand mixer on a low speed to thoroughly combine and add in your melted butter once that's combined your gonna go ahead and add a whole egg increase your speed to medium low and add an egg yolk 6 grams or 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract now I'm very indecisive about my mixer speeds I ended up liking medium fest so you know do that now what's that's done you're gonna go ahead and add in oh oh yeah don't do that anyway add your flour mixture and any remaining flour that you find on the table below to your mixture now a lot of people like to fold in their flour but I just mix it in the stand mixer anyway it's gonna rest so it'll be fine next you're going to fold in all the chocolate chunks that you chopped earlier making sure that they are evenly dispersed next to use the world's most annoying saran wrap to cover your dough and place in the refrigerator for about 30 to 45 minutes to rest and chill or you could do this a day ahead and let it chill overnight up to you now when you're ready to bake you're gonna go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit there are two ways to approach this now the first would be my personal favorite which is to use an ice cream scoop for a cookie scoop to make gigantic cookies now the downside of this method is they will take longer to bake and you're only really gonna be able to fit about four cookies per tray so obviously with that note make sure that you space them far enough apart and then of course the other way would be to use a traditionally sized cookie scoop the choice on that end is completely echt to you but my vote will always go to the now once you've scooped all of your cookies onto a parchment-lined baking sheet you're going to bake them in an oven for 12 to 15 minutes for the large cookies and 8 to 10 minutes for the smaller cookies now here's the interesting tricky hack yep you're just gonna drop the pans it is called the pan bake method I discovered it off of a blog called the vanilla bean now I know it may seem strange at first but it totally makes sense you're basically just going to pick up your pan slightly about an inch and then drop it back down onto the grates you're gonna do that about two to three times the first time after the first six minutes and then the second time about two or three minutes after that the whole purpose of that is it basically interrupts the rise and drops the dough back down pops all the bubbles that the baking soda is developing in there and it ends up making a chewy and more sort of like dense cookie but in a good way totally up to you but it's a really interesting cookie hack that does actually make quite a nice cookie and it gives a cool label of fact on the cookie so now you didn't think I'd skip that b-roll part did you [Music] alright guys and that is it just do it the way that I told you to do it and you will always have beautiful cookies or most the time unless you don't space them far enough apart and they melt into each other and then you sob under your cookies and your cookies are soggy and then that's definitely not something that's happened to me before but anyway as usual if you enjoyed this video please leave like subscribe and hey let me know what kind of recipes you want to see what kind of videos do you want to see what do you want to see what do you want leave comment and let me know but either way I will see you next week [Music]", "f-M3JN_7LGU": "- A chocolate chip cookie is\nthe best as far as cookies go. With it crispy outer edge, and soft, ooey gooey center, it's\nthe ultimate treat. Today I'm gonna be sharing\nmy work contest winning chocolate chip cookies\nrecipe that I'm sure will be a winner in your house, too. So I'm gonna start my browning my butter, and what that does is\ntoast up the milk solids, and it gives our cookie\nthat depth of flavor. You'll notice it very\nsubtly in the cookies. And if you're wondering, yes, the type of butter does matter. I've made so many chocolate chip cookies, and the best one by\nfar that I've ever used is this one by Kerrygold,\nit's pure Irish butter. This is not sponsored at all,\nbut I just really recommend using quality ingredients so that you get a really, really delicious cookie. So what I'm gonna do is add\nhalf a cup of unsalted butter, or eight tablespoons of\nunsalted butter into my pan, and I'll just let it melt\nslowly on medium-low heat. This butter's a really rich yellow color. You'll notice that the\nbutter's starting to bubble up, and the milk solids are\nstarting to sink to the bottom. That's when you have to keep\na really close eye on it, as it'll turn into brown\nbutter very quickly. The butter will start\nhaving smaller bubbles, and you can start seeing through the butter a lot more clearly. So our brown butter is a\nbeautiful golden hue like this, and it's gonna provide so\nmuch depth in our cookies. And if you the bubbles like\nthis, it's not a problem at all. I'm just gonna transfer\ninto our mixing bowl, and let it cool down\nfor about five minutes before I add in the\nrest of our ingredients. If it's too hot, it tends to\ncreate a pretty greasy cookie. For the perfect chocolate chip\ncookie with a crispy outside and warm, soft, chewy inside,\nI'm gonna be using two sugars. Half a cup of white sugar,\nand half a cup of brown sugar. So the white sugar will give\nour cookie that delicate crisp, while the brown sugar\nwith the molasses in it will provide that extra chew. And then with my spatula,\nwe'll just mix, mix, mix. (upbeat instrumental music) I'm gonna mix it until the\nbutter is fully incorporated, and the sugars are nice and fluffy. Then I'm gonna add one\negg at room temperature, and mix it again. At this point, your batter should look kinda like slime. (chuckles) With this lava-like consistency. And what I like to do\nat this point is add in our vanilla, salt, and baking soda, and mix it thoroughly before adding the flour and chocolate chips. This is so that everything is\nfully incorporated and even. I like using coarse kosher salt here. I always aim the baking soda into the pool of vanilla extract\nso that it can activate. And again, just give it a really good mix. If you guys want the specific\namount in ingredients, be sure to check in the\ndescription box below where I've written it all out for you. What I love about this recipe is that you don't need\nany fancy equipment. I don't need a big mixer, a hand mixer. Just my arm strength and a spatula. Now I'm gonna add our flour and chocolate chips in at the same time. This way it mixes evenly, and I feel like it doesn't create any\nunnecessary clumping or mixing. For the chocolate chips, I like\nusing really dark chocolate. And I like the chocolate\nchips to be pretty big, like, these rounds are fairly large. (smooth instrumental music) For me, I like to mix it until I don't see any white flour left in here, meaning that it's fully\nincorporated with our batter. Just like that. Now on a baking sheet\nthat I've already lined with parchment paper, I'm gonna\nuse my large cookie scoop, some may call this an ice cream scooper, but clearly you guys\nsee what I use it for. I'm gonna scoop large dollops, six of them, onto this baking sheet. Our cookie dough is\nnice, soft, and pliable. And then after each\nscoop, I just kinda like to clean up the edges a little bit. I'll space them about two inches apart, since they will flatten\nand spread quite a bit. At this point, you have lots of options. For me, I like to sprinkle a little bit of Maldon sea salt, which is fleur de sel. It complements the semisweet\nchocolate really well. I'm gonna take a tiny pinch and\npress it into my dough ball. Just a few of them. So, I tend to like my\ncookies flat and round, because it creates those\nbeautiful crisp edges, but if you tend to like\nchocolate chip cookies that are more like a mound,\nnot too thick, not too thin, go ahead and pop it in the fridge for about five to 10\nminutes so that the butter can cool down and hold its\nstructure while it bakes. I'm just gonna keep it as\nis, and pop it into the oven at 350 degrees, and bake\nit for about 12 minutes. (chill instrumental music) (sighs) If only you guys could smell this, it smells incredible. But now, I'm gonna let them sit for five to eight minutes\nto finally cool down until we can handle them\nand dunk it into some milk. Mm. Mm. That crispy edge. I can't tell which part is my favorite, but dunked in a glass of milk, this combo is just perfection. The center is soft and buttery with those chocolate chip nuggets in\nthere, it's so decadent. And the outer edges have that slight crisp to it, but not too hard. It's delicate, it's everything\nyou would want in a cookie. If you guys end up making this recipe, be sure to tag me on\nInstagram @honeysuckle. I love seeing your creations\nand re-sharing them. Thank you so much for watching. Comment below and let me know how you like your chocolate chip cookies, and if you guys have\never seen a better one. Thanks for watching, I'll\nsee you guys next time. Bye.", "uJwekkbGPns": "How can anyone possibly resist a freshly baked drop cookie especially with a glass of ice cold milk but now we have to start with the basics the classic chocolate chip cookie. I'll start by measuring out half a cup of butter that's 4 ounces by weight And I find it's easier to measure by weight then put my butter into a measuring cup I've got exactly four onces there. I judge a good chocolate chip on that balance of crispy outside, chewy inside sweetness to dark chocolate chips and it's all about those nuances. I find, to get just that right amount of sweetness I need half a cup granulated sugar and also half a cup of light brown sugar. It's easy enough to make drop cookies by hand. But an important step is this process called craming. Using your spatula and rubbing against the side of the bowl the butter and the sugar to cream the butter an sugar together. And that lends structure to the cookie so  they'll hold together, they wont crumble apart. And as soon as you see this creamy consistency, then you can add an egg. Because my butter was at room temperature it's a good idea to have your egg at room temperature. At the same time, I'll add a teaspoon of vanilla and just blend this together. Okay Now, for the dry ingredints I'll ad a cup and a quarter of all purpuse flour. And now, I'll share with you my signature ingredient to add to chocolate chip cookies a tablespoon of corn starch. I am a big fan of cookies that are crispy on the outside but chewy on the center. This addition wil ensure they will stay soft in the center. Now, I'll add half a teasppon of baking soda Half a teaspoon of salt And I'll just sift this through and then just combine until blended. You don't commonly associate the work of a pastry chef with something simple, like a drop cookie. But honestly, in my profession, I've made thousands of drop cookies. So you really get a lot of practice in there. There we go, I've got the flour blended into the dough And of course, where would a chocolate chip cookie be without the chocolate chips? I am using chocolate chips, that are made for chocolate chip cookies. And they hold their shape they also set up nicely after they've cooled. I find that a cup and a half is the perfect amount. You need to have a bit of chocolate in every bite That being said, if you're big fan, a little bit extra is just fine. I also like to add a cup of chopped, toasted pecans. So of course the idea here is to make sure that the chips and pecans are really worked into the cookie dough batter. You can really tell by this dough that every bite is going to get more than one chocolate chip. Okay, now it's time for scooping and dropping the cookies The simplest technique is to just use a measurement of about two tablespoons quickly roll it in your hands into a ball shape. A question I get asked often about chocolate chip cookies is why you can make the same particular recipe but they bake out differently. Sometimes they spread, and sometimes they hold their shape. It's the room temperature butter you start with that impacts the way that bakes. To fix that, simply preshape your cookies like I am now and then pop the dough in the fridge for an hour When it sets the dough no matter how you started with your cookie recipe they will always bake out beautifully. Now I fit 24 cookies on this one tray Not that I'm going to bake 24 on one tray but it takes up less space in the fridge when I chill them. I'll just pop these in the fridge to chill for an hour and I have a tray that's already spent an hour in the fridge. As you can see, these are quite firmly set now so I know, they'll bake off evenly. A great tip to get ahead on your cookie baking is to actually make your batches chill them like this then you can actually pack them up together in resealable bags and freeze them. You need emergency cookies after a really bad day at school? Pull out two or three let them thaw for twenty minutes on the counter before baking and you've got freshly baked cookies on the spot. So now, of course  I have to make room for the cookies to bake So I'll put twelve on each tray It's a good idea to leave about 2 inches space between each of the cookies in all directions. Here we go, evenly spaced. I've preheted my oven to 355 and the cookies take between 15 and 18 minutes to turn a nice golden brown just around the edges. I let my chocolate chip cookies cool on their tray before removing them so they set up a little bit I have a tray that's just cool That is the hardest part about making chocolate chip cookies waiting for them to cool just a little bit. But you can see! Chocolate, this is still soft and melting. And the cookies are chewy all the way through Every bite is gonna have some chocolate chip and a little bit of that buttery pecan.", "4kP0v0rXqfA": "in this video I'm going to share with you one of my favorite chewy chocolate chip cookie recipes and at the end of the video I'm gonna show you a way that you can freeze that cookie dough that way you can make fresh baked cookies whenever you're craving and I'll also show you how we store these cookies that way they stay nice and fresh and soft even days after your baking [Music] what's good everyone if this is the first time we're meeting my name is Philip Lemoine and I'm actually a full-time cinematographer but I love to cook before I jump into this recipe I just want to quickly plug my youtube channel aside from all of my vlogging and business book I also post a ton of cooking videos with honestly just great tasting tried and true recipes for dishes that I make not just weekly but even on special occasions there are even a couple of videos where I share some of my favorite dishes made with my mom I try and post a video a week so if you want to catch more then make sure you spank that subscribe button so there's like a million chocolate-chip cookie recipes on the internet and I swear to you I've tried every single one of them including BuzzFeed tasties perfect chocolate chip cookie although I think all of them are great a few of them just had some of those extra ingredients or extra steps that I just didn't think we're necessary and I always kept coming back to this recipe that I found on all recipes mom I think that all chocolate chip cookie recipes are kind of the same but what makes them big and chewy is the way that you incorporate those ingredients and the ingredients where these chocolate chip cookies are going to be 2 cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 teaspoon of salt 3/4 cups of unsalted butter about a stick and a half and you're going to want this melted 1 cup of packed brown sugar 1/2 cup of white sugar one tablespoon of vanilla extract 1 egg and one egg yolk and 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips or a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips the first step is to preheat the oven to 325 degrees next you're going to sift together the flour baking soda and salt then set that to the side the secret to making the chocolate chip cookies chewy is that we're gonna melt the butter we're gonna end up mixing everything in the butter so I'm just gonna melt it right into my large bowl [Music] so once the butter is melted I'm just gonna go ahead and mix in both the brown and the white sugar and I'm gonna keep mixing that up until it's all creamy and all together [Music] [Music] next you're gonna beat in the vanilla egg and egg yolk until it's light and creamy after you'll mix and sifted ingredients until just blended so at this point I added all the dry ingredients and you don't want to over mix it you just want to mix it to the point where your forearms on fire and then I think you're pretty much good show the cookie dough should look something like this [Music] so now I'm gonna go ahead and add one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and then we'll go ahead and mix that all together you're gonna want to make sure you use a wooden spoon when you do this [Music] sometimes it's helpful to use a spatula to sort of get everything off of the wooden spoon and what I like about this spatula is I got these little rubber like into it and it kind of forms to the bowl that way you can kind of work all the ingredients in together and kind of work everything off the bowl and back into it so so now that the cookie dough is all ready to go what I did is I went ahead and I lined a cookie sheet with some parchment paper and I have this one ounce ice cream scoop that I'm going to be using I think this is like a good size for not too large cookie and you can fit a few I think you can fit about six to eight on this cookie sheet I'll be sure to put a link in the bio for one of these I think they're great I use them for a lot of my recipes and one ounce seems to be the magic number for a lot of the things that I use it for so so I'm going to go ahead and scoop out a few of these cookies I'm gonna put them on this baking sheet [Music] you want to make sure to keep these cookies just a couple inches apart because they will spread when you bake now that I got these all ready to go in the oven you're gonna let them bake for about 15 to 17 minutes just want to keep an eye on them and once they start to get golden brown around the edges that's when you'll want to pull them out and let them cool so anytime that I make these cookies what I actually like to do is I'd like to make a huge batch usually I'll triple the recipe that I put online and what I'll do is I'll scoop out a bunch of individual cookies and I'll place them close together on a piece of parchment paper and then what I'll do is I'll throw this into the freezer and I'll pour freeze these I'll let them go overnight in the freezer and then what I'll do is I'll take them out once they're frozen and then I'll put those into a bag and that way whenever we're craving cookies we don't have to go through the whole process of mixing everything together we already have a bunch of individual cookies frozen in our freezer I wouldn't recommend baking them directly out of the freezer what I would say is maybe at least let them thaw out maybe come to room temperature before you throw them in the oven and then just bake them like you normally would at 325 degrees for about 15 to 17 minutes so once the cookies are done you're gonna want to go ahead and let them rest on the cookie sheet for a little bit before you transfer them over to a cooling rack cooling rack isn't super necessary but I think they're really great I mean aside from just cloning out cookies I do like to place other things on here so that it cools off quicker as well as doesn't get soggy for example when I fry things I like to put them on the rack that way the oil can drip down and it's not sitting on like a napkin and a plate or just getting it soggy sitting in its own grease so I highly recommend one and I'll put a link in the description I mean I probably just grab [Music] and there they are folks my favorite chewy chocolate chip cookie I'm not really sure how I could show you they're chewy maybe I could break one in half [Music] take a look at the inside here I'm going to take a bite breach so if I could describe the texture of these cookies I would say that the outside has a nice soft crunch to it but the inside is a really dense chewy middle and that chew is sort of like a caramel like the type of chew so it's really chewy and that's even the flavor to a nice current caramely chocolaty cookie flavor so I think what really got me hooked to these cookies was honestly like a day or two later they're still chewy and they're still nice and soft and they still have that same crunch and I feel like most cookie recipes that I've tried in the past you know once you bake them and you put them away like next day they're brick hard and you know they lost that like nice soft fresh-baked texture and I feel like these stay true to their texture and their chew even days after so I actually like to store these cookies in these food saver containers and what they do is they actually vacuum seal these and it sucks all of the air to these containers which lets them last so much longer I think a lot of people avoid purchasing a food saver mainly because they think that they have to use those resealable bags but honestly I use mostly in mason jars and these reusable containers to store most of our food because of the different container sizes you can store different types of food in different amounts of food and I really think that this thing will pay for itself over time because there's so many times we've bought food in bulk and it just went bad before we can eat it all I really wish this video was sponsored by food saver but it's not and even though it's not I mean still would highly recommend one it's something that we use daily it sits on our countertop and like I said we've saved so much food which in turn saved us so much money so I'll be sure to leave a link in the bio for where you can purchase one in Amazon there's a bunch of different models this one is the fancy one that feeds the plastic bags which I don't think it's necessary like I said we mainly use the reusable containers as well as mason jars so thank you guys so much again for watching if you

and my life Aloha [Music]", "rEdl2Uetpvo": "- [Narrator] Let's be honest, chocolate chip cookies are always good, but when you have a really, really good one, it's life changing. We pretty much bought all the chocolate chips in New York City. We baked, we tested, we ate, and now we have the ultimate chocolate chip recipe for you. We're gonna ball out with a few extra flavors, but really all you need for cookies are sugar, flour, fat, eggs, and chocolate, and on our quest to find the best, we had to test out what all of these ingredients do to a cookie, and how we can use their best properties to come up with the ultimate recipe. Let's talk sugar. So we've got white sugar, light brown sugar, and dark brown sugar. Really the only difference is the addition of molasses. Light brown sugar has a bit of molasses, and dark brown has a bit more molasses in it. For this test, we wanted to see what just using one sugar in each dough would do to a cookie. With all white sugar, spread the most, didn't have a ton of flavor. Light brown sugar was a little bit chewier, spread a little bit less. Then the dark brown sugar was really overpowering in its flavor, and spread the least, and visually you can see a big difference too. And what we found was, you really can't get that classic flavor just using one. Next thing we had to tackle is flour. So we've got all purpose, bread flour, and cake flour. Really the only difference here is the amount of protein and therefore gluten in these flours. Just think about it like this. Bread's like really nice and chewy, has a great texture, great structure having that gluten and protein, whereas cake you think of it as tender, it's light, it's airy, it's gonna have less of those things. What it really comes down to is taste and texture. All purpose gave you, you know, standard cookie. The bread flour led to a significantly chewier cookie. The cake flour was the one that really spread the most, it was pretty delicate. And then similar to sugar, we decided that in order to get the best result, you gotta use a combination of two. So on to fat. We wanted to see the difference between softened butter and melted butter, and then we wanted to see what would happen if we switched it out completely and used coconut oil. Between softened butter and melted butter, visually they look pretty similar. The melted butter spread a little bit more, and then taste we didn't notice a huge difference either. Tested with coconut oil and it worked, it was a cookie, but it lost that great oomph you know, that butter brings to all baked goods. So in the end, we definitely prefer using butter. Eggs, we went pretty simple with this one. Just an egg and and egg yolk contributes to more of like a fudgier, richer cookie. Obvously we're making chocolate chip cookies, we have to have chocolate chips, but we're also gonna add a little bit something extra with some chunks of dark chocolate. Cut it with a serrated knife into little chunks, and add that to your dough. It's really nice, 'cause you have a variance of flavors and textures throughout. It's really just a few fundamental ingredients and learning how to master their properties, in order to get the best result that you're after. And finally, after all that testing, we came up with our ultimate recipe. Here we go. So we're gonna start by sifting out the flour. We're gonna do all purpose and bread flour. Salt and baking soda as well. We really liked the chew factor of the bread flour with a combination of all purpose, to kind of give us best of both worlds. And then we're gonna move on to the butter. So we're gonna do melted butter, but we're gonna take it one step further and brown it. All you need to do to make brown butter is throw it all in a sauce pan, and get it to a boil. After a few minutes of boiling, the milk solids in the butter are gonna start to toast, and turn a really gorgeous brown, nutty color. Keep stirring it to make sure that the butter is browning evenly, and once you can see the really dark brown bits on the bottom, you're gonna pour it off, ideally into a liquid measuring cup. This is gonna do two things. One, it's going to quickly cool down the butter so it stops the cooking. You don't want to burn it. And then also we wanna make sure that we have a cup of liquid when it's all said and done. So while making the brown butter, you do end up boiling off a good amount of liquid, so we're just gonna top it up with a bit of water until we reach one cup. Just let it chill out a bit, let it come to room temperature before you proceed. So we found that we really need a combination of white and dark brown sugar to get that really great flavor that we were after. So add the vanilla at this point, and the espresso powder. Espresso powder is one of those little flavor boosters. Again all about those contrasting notes that really work well with anything really sweet. And then you're gonna add in that liquid gold, oh my gosh, so nice, and cream those together. That's another reason we want the butter to be a little bit on the cooler side. It incorporates really, really nicely with the sugar. When we were testing, if you add the brown butter when it's too hot, it can make the dough a little bit greasy. Then, in go the egg and the egg yolk. And the smell that comes off this thing, oh my God, it's pretty much like the best smell you can get from cooking. And then go the flour. We like to do it in about thirds or so, just so you don't have flour going all over your kitchen, and just beat it until you don't see a ton of extra flour. It doesn't need to be totally incorporated, a little bit of flour that's not incorporated is actually good. You'll finish incoporating the rest of the flour when you fold in the chocolate. The nice thing about using these chunks is that you get some small shards of chocolate that kind of get everywhere, mixed with the chopped up chocolate chunks, and it's kind of like, oh, so good. And that's it, that's your dough. Try to not to eat it all when its raw. Alright, so if you're an A+ student, you can go ahead and put these in the fridge to chill overnight, and you'll get the best flavor that way. But if you have no self restraint like me, you can bake them off right now. The nice thing about this dough is it has so much flavor that we've built into it, that they're still gonna be really, really good if you bake them right away. If you are gonna be amazing and put them in the fridge overnight, we do recommend scooping them first and putting them on a baking sheet, then putting them in the fridge. It's just so much easier than trying to scoop a really hard dough from the fridge. Cookies are kind of the equalizer of all baked goods. There's so much fancy stuff out there, but honestly is there anything better than a perfect chocolate chip cookie? Just look at that. You've got these pockets of chocolate from using those big chocolate chunks. It's got all the cracks and crinkles that you want in a chocolate chip cookie. The center's ooey gooey. The outside is crunchy. It's just got kind of like all the flavor and texture that you could possibly pack into one little cookie, and you'll never go back to another recipe again. Here's a list of top five smells in the culinary world, and I'm pretty sure butter comes up number one all the time. This is just a list I made up, but. (laughs) - [Male] I was gonna say, what. - [Narrator] It's a top culinary list. Ask anyone, oh my God, brown butter, oh, so good.", "17lp_x27_RI": "[Music] think about chocolate-chip cookies is that you know everybody's eaten one everybody has an opinion there are the people who want them super crispy wafer like soft and chewy raw cookie dough in the center standing up off of the baking sheet and the things that came out most of all were crispy chewy having like a crisp edge but that feeds into a little bit of like a gooey chewy Center so that's what we tried to achieve here and chocolate chip cookies in particular they're like snowflakes at the end of the day like they're all a little bit different for recipes where they are a very well-known thing usually what we try to do is have a really long development process the reason being that what I like to do is from the beginning I'll cook recipes that are very well reviewed just to see what's out there and what we liked about each one to try the Rick Martinez ones oh yeah well I'm very familiar with the Rick Martinez chocolate sort of toffee chip cookies I love that recipe honestly like this takes probably most closely after that cookie as its inspiration we worked you know over a period of like several weeks you know I had people trying these I went through multiple multiple multiple rounds of development even with my own cookies once I understood the direction I wanted to go in but I knew from a flavor perspective that I wanted at least some brown butter in this cookie so that is the starting point we're gonna take this to the stove and we're gonna take it from there so here's the thing about brown butter and cookies when you use like a liquid fat there's no need to cream out the butter and the sugar which is amazing because in this instance you don't need to use a stand mixer or a hand mixer for that matter for this recipe you know we're asking very little of you in terms of equipment what we are asking is that you brown your butter so just let it kind of all melt together over low heat so I'm starting to get a little browning that's great I just want to make sure everything stays moving that nothing sticks to the pan so that's the kind of color I'm talking about I'm gonna transfer that kind of quickly so I can stop the cooking I added the rest of the butter right away it might kind of start to foam and spit a little bit and that means that you're driving off the water content of the butter which is what we don't want to do so I'm just gonna do a little tester with one piece of the butter just to see if it's cooled enough yeah a lot of people were very insistent in wanting grams for this and you know what they're absolutely right we heard you and we republish the recipe with grams you know just to take into account your needs and wishes honestly there's no reason why we should be not publishing grams and our baking recipes so this is dark brown sugar which has the highest molasses content molasses actually has a good amount of acidity to it and that acidity is what is going to react with our baking soda which is you know our only leavener in this cookie aside from our egg so brown sugar is going in along with 1/4 cup white sugar as you can see this is gonna stay super grainy because the fat does not want to dissolve it however the sugar is more or less smooth from the standpoint of there are no huge lumps here I'm going to mix my dry ingredients just so that they're ready to go so this is one and a half cups of all-purpose flour I'm putting in 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda and then one and a quarter teaspoons of kosher salt I'm just gonna incorporate these just a little bull make a difference you need to do this in the smallest Bowl possible only using one whole egg for this recipe and part of the reason for that is egg whites act akin to water in terms of how they interact with the proteins and the flour so I didn't want to introduce too much liquid from the standpoint of having a dough that was too loose to work with what I found was that what had the biggest impact on the flavor of the cookie but also helped control spread and gave like kind of a cool kind of glossy Sheen was the yolk so I've got one whole egg and then I've got two yolks from large eggs here so one whole egg plus two yolks going in here and this is the point at which those sugars are gonna start to dissolve it's gonna take on this like nice kind of almost matte Sheen so you don't have to go crazy whisking but that's the vanilla going in but you definitely want to see that change where it goes smooth on you so here we have guitard 70-percent bar chocolate so it's like really you know kind of assertively bittersweet you get that fruitiness and that kind of like that brightness from the acidity of the chocolate I chop these into like pretty rough pieces and what's nice about the bar is like you can do it like relatively quickly and what's cool about breaking down the bar yourself is that you get these lovely irregular pieces you know you get some like big fat chocolate moments and then you get these like little kind of chocolate shards that was an aesthetic to that that I really really liked I felt so much better about putting a chocolate chip cookie out into the world that like got like it had a little bit more of a modern look to it with those kind of graphic regular chocolate pieces so now dry ingredients are going in folding these together there's not really much of a danger of overworking this certainly not by doing it by hand you know you definitely want to work all of that flour into this mixture just in the last like 30 seconds it went from being like fairly loose to like loose but stiffening by the second so for anyone who felt like their first pass might have spread too much I would say like this is the point where you know once a chocolate goes in you could rest this dough just kind of room-temperature even for five or ten minutes that shouldn't make like a pretty big difference in terms of the getting the flour to hydrate and and stiffen this dough up so chocolate is going in there is gonna be a lot of spread with these this is about the consistency that it should be you know it should be able to stand up on the the baking sheet hold that detail the cookie scoop just allows me to know exactly how much I'm putting into each one and therefore how much space I need on the cooking sheet so I find like eight cookies on a sheet is about all you can do you know so you do need two cookie sheets for this one person was like quite irate that this recipe was only yielding 16 cookies at the end of the day wouldn't you rather have like 16 like dangerously close to perfection cookies than like 24 smaller you know compromise cookies they can these at 375 which is you know kind of on the higher end for a cookie part of it is that we want the heat of the oven to really set that edge give it a little bit of color and a little bit crispness but once the heat kind of sets the edge we want it to kind of spread out to about yay big or so once that edge is set and baked it's gonna kind of arrest the lateral spread of the cookie and make it want to spread up a little bit so anyway here goes nothing I like to stagger them a little bit on the baking sheets just to keep the air circulating around so eight minutes you want to reach should we look at some reviews oh yeah we wait let's read those relocating reviews let me grab my computer all right and figs of Montreal honestly the best basic cookie recipe I've ever used these are definitely a few notches up from regular chocolate chip cookies the brown butter added great flavor made mine pretty large and still had 24 cookies that seems wrong now let's get to some of the bad stuff not sure what I'm doing wrong these cookies turned out really runny for me anyone have suggested made these cookies using the new weight measurements provided they spend quite a bit so I ended up with a thinner cookies gonna usually prefer but the real issue I'm having with these is how greasy oily they feel when you're eating them I mean that's like that's something that's kind of interesting to me you know the comments about like grease eNOS because like when is grease butter and when is grease eNOS butteriness not to skip ahead here but just for the sake of argument there is in the texture like a lot more kind of like richness forward quality but in terms of like you know like grease eNOS like I certainly have like more chocolate than butter on my fingers right now so I don't know what to chalk it up to if it's like you know a different brand the flower that's hydrating in a different way different amount of protein you know that's not you know so it's not like kind of like activating this similar amount of gluten to like what we're developing with here like this is far from over or it's like if there's anything and that Guns N'Roses has taught us is that like it's never over you know Never Say Never Axl can reach out to / they can get back on the same page you know they can make you know their next album happen and you know look like there's a lot of people who reached out to me on via you know DM like on Instagram and I feel like I responded or reacted to the vast majority of them I tried to diagnose issues where I could I also frankly saw like a lot of great looking cookies and you know at the end of the day like there is gonna be a tremendous amount of variability just between ovens users ingredients and all the rest of it into it as you can see like even between the two baking sheets these have a little bit more kind of cracking across the top these have a little bit more of a ripple to them same same dough same oven same time but snowflakes I feel like this is my Everest I feel like this is something that you could work on and refine your entire life I will never be done with it I am it and it is me and yeah it's it's very intense putting this out into the world you know so anyway fly they're so beautiful I know you know I I see that too you know yeah no way because every time I said it my parents would reward me for speaking oh yeah another cookie oh yeah no duh great future food editors unite I mean that's like yeah that's hot that's hot perfect yeah that's nice I don't know if this is something people have noted there's a seabream into the cookie there richness of the chocolate the bitterness the like the texture the whole thing it is a real delight all right cool All Right see ya wow they're beautiful are these bees best their ba is tried real hard the crisp yeah it's trying to get those two things happen at the same time that's that's that's tricky gets almost like that like crumbly crispness like the edge will do that and you have the Center bends that's the world I'm living in take the journey with me yeah make cookies be happy that's all I have to say I'm done engineering our own school we're good it's cool my mom said I needs to I need to smile more in my videos anyway so Andy's uh and he's on target with that", "oXamQySpYsg": "- Today I'm gonna show you how to make one of my favorite treats,\nchocolate chip cookies. These ones are filled with toasted pecans, and I think they strike\njust the perfect balance between a cookie that is\npuffy and cakey on the inside, and those cookies that are\nlike, crispy and crunchy. Personally, I like a crunchy cookie. But, not everyone is like that. So, these are the best compromise you could possibly imagine. And they're so easy to make. Let's get started. Into a bowl, I'm adding\ntwo-and-a-quarter cups, or 270 grams of all-purpose flour, just weigh that out, one teaspoon of salt, and half a teaspoon of baking powder. Just whisk this up really quickly. Distribute those ingredients. Set aside, and now we're\ngonna whip that butter, and do our sugar, egg situation. So into a standing mixer fit\nwith a paddle attachment, I'm adding one cup of unsalted\nbutter at room temperature. I'm using unsalted because\nevery butter manufacturer uses a little bit\ndifferent amounts of salt. And you wanna have a consistent recipe. So control the salt by\nusing unsalted butter, and then adding the salt in yourself. Okay, into that bowl. Now let's cream it up. I'm adding in a\ncombination of regular old, plain granulated sugar, and then light brown sugar. If you add in just plain sugar, you will spread out, be really thin. If you add in a lot of brown sugar, it will be kind of puffier\nand closer together. And it will also have that caramel taste from the brown sugar. But I like to add a combination. You could go back and forth, depending on how you\nwant your cookie to be. So, half a cup of\ngranulated sugar, mix it up, and then one cup of\npacked light brown sugar. This one I'm actually gonna\nbreak up a bit with my fingers, because there's a couple of\ngiant sugar chunks in there. Much easier to do this than\ntrying to make your mixer do the work for you. Tenderly adding those\ncalories in just for you. It smells so nice. This reminds me of the ice teas I used to make myself when I was little, like those Lipton Ice Tea mixes. It's like sugar, a little ice\ntea powder, water and ice. Oh, the 80s. Whip it up until it's\nfluffy, incorporated, you know what to do. (upbeat music) That went over for like a second or two. Now let's tap this down. Things got a bit crazy in two eggs. I like it. Now we're gonna add in\ntwo eggs and our vanilla. Just add one egg, let it mix, add the other egg, let\nit mix and incorporate, otherwise it gets a bit messy. (upbeat music) Two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Okay now you have that nice\nbeautiful buttery paste that you're used to from cakes. I could totally just eat this, like as is. I'm disgusting like that. But I won't 'cause I have a recipe to do. Now we're gonna add our flour mixture, and mix it until just combined. Don't wanna overmix. And then I'll hand-fold in\nall of the other ingredients. (upbeat music) I'm very excited. I have to tell you something though. I love a burnt, crispy cookies. I like roasted Brussels sprouts. I like bitter things. Yes I love desserts, but I\nlove like a burnt cookie. I'll often accidentally burn something. My husband, however, only\nlikes those soft, pillowy, fluffy, cloudy, cake cookies that I hate. So, we'll see how these turn out. That is, a couple of\npockets of flower in there, but we'll deal with it by hand. Now it's time to add in\nthe two magical ingredients that will make this cookie amazing: One, a cup of toasted, chopped pecans. You could also use toasted walnuts, if you have a nut allergy,\nor you don't like nuts, you can skip it too, and there'll\nbe chocolate chip cookies. The other one is gonna be two cups of semisweet chocolate chips. Once again, maybe semi sweet's\na bit too sweet for you, you could add bittersweet\nchocolate chips in, or if you don't like chocolate, why are you watching this video? Okay, so one cup of\nchopped, toasted pecans. If you wanna toast pecans or any nut, 350 on a baking sheet, spread 'em out, and then bake for like five minutes. Take it out using an oven\nmitt, don't burn yourself, then move the nuts around, put it back in for like\nanother five minutes. Those outer nuts will always\ncook first, or toast first. All right, in you go, one cup of chocolate chips. All right now, here's\nanother hint for you. If you can get a metal spatula, doesn't have to be copper,\nbut metal, this will work. Because if you make cookies a lot, and you're folding those\ningredients by hand, you will snap the wooden ones. It's happened to me. I went right back to the\nstore, got an exchange. (upbeat music) I'm adding the cookie dough\ndirectly onto my baking sheet. I'm not bothering with chilling it. You could chill it, make\nahead, keep it in your fridge for a special treat. They won't spread out as much. They'll be a little bit puffier, but you and I know, I\ndon't like those cookies. My actual dream cookie, which\nI wouldn't make for you, because it's too specific, would be this thin, like super flat, crispy, crunchy, caramelized. Okay, right on there. My worst nightmare, those\ndisgusting oatmeal cookies. Oh, yuck. My mom actually, hasn't\nmade them in years, but she makes this amazing oatmeal cookie. It's like paper-thin, super crispy, I made that recipe. That's a good video. Make sure you give these guys space, because they will be spreading out. I'm using a one-and-a-half\ntablespoon ice cream scooper. It's really nice for getting\na nice, uniform cookie, and not getting too messy. (upbeat music) Okay, our first batch is ready. And we're gonna bake\nthese at 350 Fahrenheit, or 177 Celsius, for eight to 10 minutes, or until golden brown on the outside. They'll still be soft on the inside. It's kind of up to you. You can burn them if you want. All right. Our of the over, just\ncool enough to handle. And I have bad news. I did not really burn any. I was hoping like, on the corners, they'd be like really caramelized. But this is the best we're gonna get. It's fine. The sacrifices I make. Okay, I'm very excited to cut into this, especially since I haven't had lunch yet. God I'm so hungry. All right, what? So nice. Mmm. That is like very, it's nice\nand chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside. If you wanna make these\nthe flat, crispy cookies that I would like, just\nuse the regular sugar, skip the brown sugar, and then burn 'em. (laughs) All right. Thanks so much for watching. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments below. If you like my videos, don't\nforget to hit that like button and subscribe. And thanks for watching.", "QgzjiR32q7M": "- If the best brownie ever and the most amazing chocolate\nchip cookie came together to make the perfect dessert, it might just be this\nchocolate chip cookie bar. Fudgy, gooey, crispy, crunchy. (chuckles) It has it all, including that brown sugar, that butter, that chocolate, the works. Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These cookie bars are\ngonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started. First off, prep your\neight by eight inch dish by lining it with\nparchment paper, or foil. I like parchment paper better, because it just fits so nicely in there. Look at this. Perfectly in there. You can lift it right out. Nothing's gonna tear either. Okay, set that aside. Now let's whisk up the dry ingredients, starting with 2 1/4 cups, or\n270 grams of all-purpose flour, one tablespoon of corn starch. Using a teaspoon of salt here. I want it to be nice and have a good bite to contrast with all the sweetness of the chocolate and the sugar. Now, one teaspoon of\nbaking soda for leavening. 'Kay, whisk it all up, set it aside. And now for the wet ingredients. We've got some other parents coming over for a combined play date, so I thought these chocolate\nchip cookie bars would be the perfect easy snack\nto have hanging around, in addition to some coffee. (chuckles) Into a large bowl, I'm adding 3/4 of a cup, or 170 grams, of a melted butter, 2/3 of a cup, or 133 grams,\nof regular white sugar, and then one cup, or 200 grams, of brown sugar, lightly packed. 'Kay, you can mix this up. It's gonna form kind\nof a thick slurry now, a butter/sugar slurry. If you have lumps of brown\nsugar, just mash them up. Now I'm gonna add in one tablespoon of a nice vanilla extract and aromatic. Oh, I love it. And then two room temperature eggs. Switch to a whisk. And yes, you could do\nthis in a stand mixer or with an electric mixer, but if I'm making\nchocolate chip cookie bars, I don't mind getting a little exercise in. Whisk it together. Try not to eat this right\nnow, because it is just like heaven on a stick. I don't know what to say. It's delicious, but control yourself. And after it's whisked together, you're gonna dump in the dry mixture. This is so easy. It's like, \"Hello, why isn't this every day?\" And I'm gonna use my\nspatula, just to fold it in. You could use a whisk. I just think it'll be a little bit easier. And to be honest, I like the way it feels. It's so like, ahhh. It's bringing me some\nrelaxation vibes. (chuckles) And once this gets to a point\nof being mostly incorporated, we're gonna add our chocolate chips, And you have choices here. Just chocolate chips? Sure. Add some more things? Why not? So you could add in\nhalf a cup or a full cup of chopped toasted pecans,\nor walnuts, macadamia nuts, whatever you like. And then for the chocolate itself, yes, you could use semi-sweet chocolate. If you're following along on a blog, But today, I'm gonna mix it\nup and use half-and-half, semisweet and bittersweet. So, the only thing I'm gonna tell you is take the handful of chocolate\nchips and set them aside. This is so you can just dot\nthe top of your cookie bars with some nice clean chocolate chips, the same that you would do with cookies. So, set those aside. And now toss the rest in, and fold 'em in. If you want, you could\nuse M & M's in here, or butterscotch candy. It's really like whatever\nyou enjoy eating. The only thing I want\nyou to do is just try and distribute the chocolate\nchips fairly evenly, so that one bar has one chocolate chip and the other one is\ncomplete chocolate chips. No, you wanna have it be fairly even. And here, you see, in this step, we're just finishing up\nwith the mixing as well, so any little pockets of the dry mixture are gonna be worked in there. This is ready to transfer to our prepared eight inch baking dish. You could use a nine\ninch baking dish as well. That'll just be a bit thinner, but that's still totally delicious. 'Kay, plop this in here carefully. Plop. Actually, (chuckles) doesn't have to be carefully. This is reminding me of my brownie recipe. You can click up here for that. Oh, my God, that brownie\nis like the fudgiest, most delicious thing in the world, with that nice crackled top. Ah, it's amazing. 'Kay, just smooth the top out. This recipe is seriously the\neven less fussier version of a chocolate chip cookie, 'cause there's not worry about anything, anything at all. (chuckles) You're just dumping\neverything in, mixing it up. And now, I can take my\nreserved chocolate chips, and just dot the surface with them. I'm gonna just have some\nnice glossy chocolate moments all across the top, and you're gonna get that the best way if there's no cookie batter. One last thing before I forget, and this is totally optional, is you can take some flaked sea salt, and just sprinkle it on top. Just a little bit of\nthat crunchy, salty bite with the chocolate and the brown sugar, you're gonna love it, unless you don't. In which case, skip that step. It's up to you. All right, now you're gonna\npop this into the oven for 30 plus minutes. It kinda depends on\nhow done you want them. Do you want that kinda gooey, delicious, fudgey moment in the middle? Then 30 minutes. Do you want them baked that are a bit more set up? Add an extra five or 10 minutes on there. It's really your personal preference. I'm currently intoxicated by\nthis amazing cookie bar to be. Look at this. Do you see? What? (laughs) It's so good. Oh, my gosh. All right, this is now\nfirm enough to remove without it crumpling. You just wanna let it set. Remove that paper. Do you see how amazing this\nparchment paper situation is? It's one of my favorite things. We're just gonna cut these up into bars, and they will go in a flash. It'll be so quick. You can go big or small\ndepending on how you feel. I don't know. Let me know in the comments if you want the edge piece, or the middle. I'm conflicted myself, so\nI'll have both. (chuckles) Oh, my gosh, look at this. This is like a crime scene of chocolate. Molten chocolate inside. Look at that. If you could smell this,\nyou would be in heaven. I wanna just have this\nwith a bite of ice cream, or some milk and go to sleep. (chuckles) No one's gonna notice if I just sneak one. If you like this recipe,\ncheck out my cookie playlist, all of my favorite cookies, and you're gonna definitely find your new favorite there too. Okay, time for a bite. Oh, my gosh (chuckles), I got like palpitations. (chuckles) This was so good. It really is the cookie\nversion of a brownie. You've gotta try this recipe. The vanilla, the brown sugar, everything is working together, and it just works.

Big thanks to Simple Health for sponsoring this video and for\ntheir continued support. Now today, I'm going to be making an interesting version of cookies. In fact, they're actually\nnot cookies, technically, but I'm gonna be calling them, chookies. It's another spoonerism. (laughs) It's another reversed food. If you missed my reverse grilled cheese or the crilled gheese --\nI'll put the link down below and up above -- where\ninstead of having the cheese in the inside, I had the\ncheese on the outside. There's a similar thing\ngoing on here today. I'm going to be making a\nreverse chocolate chip cookie. So instead of the chocolate chips, I'm going to have baby pieces\nof cooked cookie dough, and instead of cookie dough,\nI'm gonna have chocolate. Doesn't that sound phenomenal? Why haven't I had this yet\nin my life? I don't know. So let's go ahead and make it. (laughs) So when I got to thinking\nabout how I would do this, I remembered I had this book. Remember this book? This is \"Not Your Mother's Cookbook\". And it has very uncanny, strange recipes. And this was sent to me by Jeffrey. And on this page, dan da da dah! Look, it's the cookie chip chocolates. So I'm making a coconut chip chookie? I'm making chookies today. (laughs) I'm gonna be following this recipe and this dough requires\nsome refrigeration. So I made it ahead of time. So let me walk you through those steps. So in a large bowl, take six tablespoons of room temperature butter, and add six tablespoons of sugar and cream that with a hand mixer until it's nice and light and fluffy. To that, you're gonna add one egg yolk and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Cream that all together. And then you're going to sift in one and a quarter cups of flour and a half teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of salt. So mix that well. So I found this dough to\nbe very, very crumbly, even when I squeezed it\ntogether with the plastic wrap, it wasn't holding any kind of shape. So I went ahead and added the egg white along with the dough, and that seemed to kind of bind everything together. So then dump the dome in some plastic wrap and then wrap it well, flatten it out, and place this in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. So I've got my refrigerated dough and it says to leave it\nout at room temperature a little bit to let it soften, just a bit. So that long rest time has\nallowed the dough to hydrate. So it's much more dough-like\nthan it was when we started. And what we're gonna do is form logs 'cause now we're going to\nbe making our cookie chips. So I'm gonna roll this into a log and cut these into small pieces. The recipe says you can\njust make little squares or you can extrude these\nand have these to be little cylinders, but I want these to actually look like chips. So I'm gonna actually go\nto the extra length of forming these into little chips. So I'm gonna roll a little tip like that and then kind of just folded over. So it looks a little chocolate chip. (metal clanking) Make as much noise as possible. In a parchment lined baking\nsheet, we're going to take our little cookie dough chips, place them on there. And then we're gonna\nbake these at 350 degrees for eight to ten minutes, or until they're cooked\nand golden on the bottom. The recipe says that these\nwill not spread much, which is good because we want\nthe chips to look like chips rather than little blobs,\n'cause we're taking a lot of effort to make these into chips. Make them pointy, and then\njust tip the little hat over; place them onto the tray. (pleasant music) All right, my lovelies, I've baked my little cookie chips. They're so stinking cute. (pleasant music) And now we're ready to make our chookie. Two cups of chocolate chips into a bowl. Now we're gonna place\nthis into the microwave in 30 second intervals until everything is completely melted. Here we go. If you don't have a microwave, you can also do this\nover a bowl of hot water. So while that's going, let's give one of our little cookie chips and taste. Some of these are a little\nbit more golden than others. I'm gonna taste this one right here. Alrighty, here we go. Itadakimasu! Mm! Delicious little sugar cookie: Buttery, vanilla, delicious. Little bit crunchy. That's gonna be great. I'm gonna eat another one. Mm hm hm hm hm! Hm hm hm. Definitely more like a sugar cookie though and less like a chocolate chip cookie, but there's no chocolate in this, right? Duh. Alright. Let's check on our chocolate -- and we definitely don't\nwanna burn our chocolate. So stir it, pop it back in the microwave, melt it some more. Microwave! And on the side here, I've got a tray lined with some parchment paper. So we're gonna put our\nchocolate blobs, right there. \u266a La la la la la la la. \u266a \u266a Nothing like waiting\nfor chocolate to melt \u266a \u266a La la la la la \u266a \u266a I'm not a singer \u266a \u266a I'm not a singer. \u266a \u266a I'm not a singer at all. \u266a Okay. Oh, puh puh puh. Oh that looks so good. So I'm not gonna bother\nwith tempering this at all. This is a chookie recipe, but chocolate is notoriously finicky and tempering chocolate\nis finicky. (laughs) I'll... I can attest to that. I once made a chocolate bar\nout of a cocoa bean. Hm. That was quite the effort. Okay, don't fall off the edge. These are semi-sweet\nchocolate chips by the way, because that's what I like. If you want them to be sweeter\nand more milk chocolatey, then use milk chocolate. If you want a nice dark chookie then you can go ahead\nand use bitter sweet. Now I want my chookies to be evenly sized. So I'm using this large ice cream disher. Take a scoop of this. That seems pretty generous. And I'm going to plop\nit right on to the pan. Ooh, that's gonna be a big one. Now, while this is still molten, we're going to place our chips into the blob of chocolate. That looks amazing. Boop. And to make this a little bit\nmore of a believable cookie, I'm going to put these\nin at a bit of an angle. And then I'm gonna cut a\ncouple of them in half -- kind of have them protruding\nfrom the side, you know, a bit. So it looks like they're\nkind of in the batter a bit. You know, like that. A bit of an illusion. Okay so let's continue\nmaking our chookies. Looks like I'm gonna get\nlike four big fat-os. Ooh yeah. Ooh, that looks gorgeous. Again, work quickly here. (pleasant music) Stick 'em in. Cut a couple in half. Put them in on the sides. (pleasant music) Whoops. With your fingers in between. Okay so, oh, that looks so good. So now we're gonna allow\nthese to cool completely so they harden up and then\nwe can taste our chookies. I can't wait. \u266a They look amazing. \u266a Alrighty, see you in a little bit. Alrighty, my lovelies. I am back and here are my\nreverse chocolate chip cookies. Aren't they great? (laughs) And they actually turned out\na lot better than I thought. They're nice and poofy and fluffy. And they look a lot like a cookie, but they're actually more of a chocolate. Alrighty. Can't wait to give them a taste. (upbeat music) So now we've come to the moment\nthat I'm always waiting for, which is the big taste test. What will these taste like? Ooh, the reverse chocolate\nchip cookie. (laughs) I am imagining this is gonna be divine because I am a chocolate fiend and this is mostly chocolate. So let's eat this. Alrighty, here we go. Itadakimasu! (upbeat music) (laughs) Mm! Mm, mm, mm. It's a chocolate bar. It's a semi-sweet chocolate bar. So it's a little bit bitter. You've got these little\nbits of cookie on top that are crispy. (upbeat music) Mm hm. Mm. Mostly all you taste though is\njust very intense chocolate. I mean, this is all chocolate pretty much. And you get some of that\ncrunch from the cookie, a little bit of that\nvanilla cookie flavor, but that's certainly overpowered by the sheer amount of chocolate (laughs) in these chookies. They're delicious. And very, very intense though. Mm hm. Mm! Hm hm hm hm. Hm hm hm hm hm. Mm, mm hm. Mm! Okay. Mm hm. (laughs) So if you take a few of\nthese little cookie bites, it shifts the balance a little bit more so this is more, a little bit like a dark chocolate Milano cookie. You got that buttery vanilla cookie flavor that goes along with the chocolate. Having said that I am still super pleased with how these turned out. They are (laughs)\nsimultaneously ridiculous and amazing at the same time. If you love chocolate,\nintense amounts of chocolate, consider making these. And if anything, they're\nreally fun to make, and I think that'd be fun to present to someone as a gift or a joke. (laughs) At any rate, there you have it. The coco-late chip chookie (laughs) or the reverse chocolate chip cookie. Big thanks to all of\nthe beautiful lovelies who suggested this in the comments. Let me know in the comments here if there are any other reverse things you'd like me to test out\nor try or attempt to make. I'm all ears. I think it's a fascinating\nidea.

i'm going to mix these until they're combined and then we move on to the dry ingredients okay at this point we're going to add dry ingredients flour baking soda and salt it feels good put it in all of it all of it and then the chocolate chips i really like using chocolate chunks for this but it's not the thing that i always have on hand but semi sweet chocolate i'm going to take my trick you're doing great that's a great trick but semi-sweet chocolate chips is something i always have on hand and it just works really really well i actually wouldn't use milk choc chip here because they're a little bit too sweet and you need to offset all of that gooey sweety sweet like nuttiness with some summer sweet now we're just gonna get out of there [Music] you're supposed to have a cup of chocolate chips give or take a quarter cup ouch all right now this does have to go in the fridge for a few hours before you bake them we love these so much right we put the vanilla in fine you put everything in um oh i know i always have a bath while i was gonna get my water yes i always have a batch of this cookie dough ready in the fridge at all times because that's how much we love it no we don't need oil why uh because we already added butter remember it's oily so what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna go ahead and take my dough that i already have in the fridge i'm gonna take it out of the fridge let it come to room temperature for like 10-15 minutes preheat my oven at that time at the same time it needs to be preheated to 350 and then we will scoop and we will bake and these are going to be baked today tomorrow morning thank you and anna yeah baby it's from the show is it from hey gabby yeah um and she sings that song what's the other song that you like to sing from that show uh [Music] [Music] one oh okay i'm gonna go pop this in the fridge covered and then we'll get the other stuff out cookie dough came out of the fridge about 10 minutes ago um just so that it can soften a little bit makes it easy to scoop oven is preheated to 350. as per usual sous chef left me she's like you know what i did my job i'm not washing dishes but call me when the cookies are ready so that's fine um i've got a baking sheet with some parchment paper i like to use a large ice cream scoop for this it's the equivalent to three tablespoons you can also use a regular size cookie scoop or whatever but i mean honestly with these ones i feel like go big or go home but also not just because i'm greedy and i like a lot of cookie but they just get a much better texture when they're a little bit bigger you just get a gorgeous like chewy crumbly incredible flavor and texture it's kind of really hard to put in into words but having said that i do make some smaller ones because otherwise sous chef would eat multiple large cookies and i cannot handle the sugar rush okay just can't so i'm just gonna make a few really big ones um and then just because i want you to see them in all of their glory and then i will bake some smaller ones to keep on hand because you know they're cute they're delicious they're kind of like her and everybody loves them so i'm gonna pop them into the oven i like to bake my cookies on my lower third um rack and i'll leave them in there this size will take about 12 minutes smaller size you take about nine to ten minutes so i'll show you what they look like when they're done these babies were in the oven for exactly 12 minutes and they are perfect i like the bottom to be oh look at that they're like they're still warm so they're still very gooey but i want the bottom to be lightly golden i have a small other batch in the oven that are smaller for sous chef and when they come out you want to hit them with just a little bit of sea salt it makes the biggest difference salt in baked goods is the same thing that it does in savory things it just kind of makes the flavor really come out but these are still warm so you have to give them a minute but look at this look at that i mean they are not cakey they are gooey oh chewie they are the best cookies you'll ever eat go to lorry on the kitchen.com get the recipe make them you'll agree with me let me know on ig how much you will love these because you will hopefully enjoy spending time with me and sous chef and we'll see you next time bye you", "qYYoswV-Q3Q": "everyone it is Jessie from the tasty team and today I'm a baking up 5 celebrity chocolate-chip cookie recipes see which one is actually the best I'm sorry is line up we have recipes from Martha Stewart Snoop Dogg Kourtney Kardashian Michelle Obama and the rock himself we measure everything is the recipe stated to keep things fair and we got three of our friends to taste them in a blind taste test so who is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe find out first up is Martha Stewart she starts by combining flour baking powder baking soda and salt and whisk him just until combined set that aside then in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment combine butter white sugar and brown sugar and beat that until nice and fluffy scrape that down to that add two eggs and vanilla extract scrape that down and slowly add your dry ingredients half at a time just so it gets completely incorporated and bring in an insane amount of chocolate chips this is 4 and 1/2 cups which seems like more chocolate than actual day forcing it out using a scoop I'm popping in the oven there you have it Martha's classic chocolate chip cookies thank you our deepest smells like chocolate chip it looks like a chocolate chip cookie like very classic this feels good this feels like it should I wanted to be a little gooey er but I like the like I like the weight this is a weighty cookie breaks apart really beautifully it's very um feels under baked there's there's chocolate and everybody firm on the outside gooey on the inside that's really important in a cookie but my hands are like a little oily which I don't really like that much it's not my favorite I'm gonna be honest with you I like a more crispy crispy cookie up next is Snoop Dogg he starts by combining flour baking soda and salt in a bowl and mixing it up until combined set that aside bring in another bowl and add butter and peanut butter white sugar brown sugar and beat that up with a hand mixer until nice and fluffy scrape that down and add one egg and vanilla extract and mix it up one more time just until combined bring back your dry ingredients add those and slowly mix that in fold in your chocolate chips and scoop it into balls onto a baking sheet uses a tablespoon so these are a bit smaller than Martha's pop them in the oven and there you have it Snoop Dogg's Rolls Royce peanut butter chocolate chip cookies this cookies a lot

just gonna say that much peanut butter this cookie has peanut butter in it I hate peanut butter and I know that's a strong take but it is what it is so I'm probably not look at this cookie cutter hop whoo this is not a good cookie experience this is like just falls apart it's not a cookie this is like a granola plop and butter it's good it's good good not great I think I'm like a chocolate chip cookie purist like not my my favorite I wouldn't eat it again but if you like peanut butter I'm sure you'd love this next cookie next up is a recipe by Kourtney Kardashian she starts by combining melted coconut oil palm sugar vanilla extract and pumpkin puree and mix that up until smooth takes a good bit of mixing just to get that melted coconut oil completely incorporated set that aside and in another bowl combine the flour baking soda baking powder cinnamon nutmeg and salt and mix that all together so it's nice and evenly distributed bring back the wet ingredients and add your dry to it mix in half just so it's not too clumpy at first and then mix in the remaining so it's nice and smooth that add dairy free chocolate chips stir that up and the dough is good to go roll them into one tablespoon size balls and place on a baking sheet the dough is a bit greasy so my hands got a little shiny pop them in the oven and there's our cookies this looks like a little nugget it's now the right time to tell you that I'm allergic to this whatever this is I'm allergic to it this is like the dome peanut butter cookie I was talking about cinnamon like I mean this feels to me like it's it's not a cookie like this feels like it's like a salad trying to be a cookie there's not a lot of chocolate but that's fine for me right off the bat I smell cinnamon this might be an oatmeal cookie which is even more disturbing than the actual shape of it these days how they it's just weird I'm gonna try a bite wow this is awful I don't know what's in this cookie all scared there's this everything that was left over that you just put into a bowl and made cookies out of like was that what this was you want a cookie and like this this is not the one who's gonna win your heart I I feel like there's like a vegetable in here if this is what your ideas for a chocolate chip cookie just don't bother like why just eat like a celery stick or something up next is a recipe from Michelle Obama which is actually Sasha and Malia's godmothers recipe but it's Michelle's favorite she starts by combining all-purpose flour baking soda and salt in a bowl and telling the other side in another bowl combine two sticks of butter with Crisco brown sugar and granulated sugar and vanilla extract and using a hand mixer mix that all up until fluffy add two eggs fully mixing them in with the hand mixer before you add the next one scrape that down and to that you're slowly gonna add back your dry ingredients to create a dough little at a time just so it doesn't get chunky to that add chopped walnuts milk chocolate chips mint chocolate candies and white chocolate chips and stir that all up until combined [Music] using around a tablespoon force them into balls and pop em in the oven I'm nice looking normal cookie thank you oh this looks nice see this is getting closer to a cookie I like oh one of these cookies this is like like everything but the kitchen sink cookie it has this kind of laziness it's thin it has a crisp enos to it oh it's like crunchy and flaky I love this is like my ideal cookie not heavy enough oh my god it's peppermint this has meant there's a mint enos coming off of this one I don't that's just me yeah too much stuff not enough cookie there's a lot going on in this cookie but I'm very much about it this is a cookie for people who like love drama I like the cookie part I don't know why it has a mint flavor to it which is not what I want when I'm diving into a chocolate chip cookie this is definitely a holiday cookie it's crazy I want to make this so that I can give to my family last but not least is a recipe from the rock he starts by combining butter granulated sugar and brown sugar in the bowl and using a hand mixer and beating it all together until fluffy to that add vanilla extract and two eggs and beat it one more time until it's combined scrape that down and add flour two and a half cups of oatmeal that's been pulverized into a flour salt baking soda and baking powder and mix that up until a dough forms add chocolate chips chopped walnuts and a grated chocolate bar and mix it up one more time until it's combined looks a little dry but we'll see roll them into balls and pop them in the oven and there you have it the rocks favorite chocolate chip cookies Oh God it's cookies like to perfect it looks delicious and it looks like it's going to be a little soft in the inside but still like crunchy which is what I like it seems like the kind of cookie that would be out for like a open house on an apartment you want to live here because this cookie lives here too this is not what a job chip cookie looks like this is a an abomination of chocolate chip cookies ooh like a little pool there the chocolate it looks pretty well baked nice job Conger on the outside soft on the inside but still like a little crunch it's okay I was suspicions that this is healthy in some way this is a good cookie I changed my mind this is a good cookie I think there's some salt it's not terrible it has a definitely a nutty flavor this is like a very elegant ladies cookie like I think if you brought this to the Upper East Side this would crush it still tastes like a chocolate-chip cookie it's okay another five cookie said I just tried I think that number five is my favorite the reason why is because there's a lot of textures it was a beautiful cookie to look at and it just tasted delicious like I said everything kind of just melted together and it was all like well distributed there at the cookie like I wasn't tasting like a big chunk of something a big chunk of chocolate number one was my favorite hands-down I'm a cookie purist that was the best one it wasn't a salad it wasn't a real estate agent cookie it wasn't a classy lady cookie it wasn't a drama-filled cookie it was pure it was doughy it was intense it was like it was like had density it had depth that had volume it was a it was a good cookie I love cookies can't remember I basically just destroyed all these cookies and there's nothing that remains I think number well the first one probably was my probably the best I guess it's presenting as a chocolate chip cookie and delivering that we're talking about chocolate chip cookies this one is by definition I think closest to that definition the rock Dwayne the rock Johnson have you given you eyebrows and cookies I mean god bless her that does not surprise me oh I'm not surprised I'm not surprised there you have it Martha Stewart has the best chocolate chip cookie recipe what dress we should retest

Thank you for watching", "oMmHmHtirFk": "welcome friends today we are going to\nmake something that is the meeting point of two things that I really enjoy and\nthat's chocolate chips and potato chips this past Christmas and over the last\nlittle while I saw a lot of people making this type of cookie and I thought\nwow that's ingenious I really love that let's give it a try see if we can make\nit ourselves so in the stand mixer I put some butter and we're just gonna\ncream that until it's nice and fluffy now once the butter is nice and soft\nwe'll put in some white sugar and some brown sugar and we'll just keep\ncontinuing to cream that well that's creaming together just take\na moment and prep your flour so I have flour and this is baking soda and you\njust want to mix those two together you'll also notice it I'm not gonna put\nany salt in normally in a cookie like this you'd put salt in because that just\nsort of regulates the flavour balances it out but we're putting in the potato\nchips and don't get the low salt potato chips get the regular salty greasy\npotato chips and they're gonna bring a loads of salt to these cookies one of\nthe one of the tricks I found is don't open the chips too early because if\nyou're like me you'll snack on them and there won't be enough to actually make\nthe cookies so you need about 200g of chips and you want to crush them not\ncrushed to dust but you know crush down too but the same as the as the chocolate\nchips that you're gonna put in okay this is good we're gonna put in a little bit\nof vanilla maybe just a little bit more and the first of two eggs and we'll beat\nthat egg in before we put the second one in okay so far pretty straightforward\nregular chocolate chip cookie recipe this is creamed together really nicely\nand I'm just gonna slowly spoon in the flour a lot of people are gonna tell you\nthat you have to do this with a wooden spoon because you don't want to make\ngluten bla bla bla bla bla bla bla spooning it in like this is not a\nproblem as long as the mixer is on low enough so that you don't spray flour\neverywhere which is something I often do you're gonna be just fine\njust don't over mix so you put the last scoop in mix it in just until it's mixed\nand then turn the mixer off of course an important step along the way is to\nscrape down the bowl sometimes a little bit I'll get stuck up at the top or at\nthe very bottom and you just want to make sure that you've got everything\nincorporated evenly okay so we are down to the point where we're going to put in\nthe chips and the chocolate chips and you could do this with a rubber spatula\nor probably better to use a wooden spoon I'm just going to give it a scrape with\na spatula first and I'm gonna put the chocolate chips in first this way we\ndon't crush the potato chips too much before we put them in the oven and I\nwill switch to a wooden spoon at this point because the dough is pretty stiff\nso the last of the chocolate chips and in go the potato chips so I'm using a number 50 ice cream scoop\ntoday to portion out these cookies I think the 50 is just a touch too small\nand I can't find my number 40 it's lost in the equipment room somewhere I think\nnumber 40 for me anyway 40 is the size that I I really like so I'm just gonna\nportion these out I don't do anything special with the\nwith the cookie tray or the baking tray a lot of people like to put down\nnonstick spray or parchment paper I never do I don't know I never have\nproblem with them sticking and I never have a problem cleaning the trays later\nso I just leave them bare and once I get them portioned out to me I think a\nreally nice little touch is a sprinkle of sea salt on top just to give that\nlittle extra salty explosion of salty sweet when you eat them now into the\noven okay so moment of truth now on the\nsurface they look really good nice spread still a bit of a dome top they\nlook mmm super crispy around the edge but still chewy in the center I really\nlike that um I'm pretty impressed with these cookies it's interesting you don't\ntaste the potato chip I can still see a little piece of potato chip in there and\nthey're adding something but they're not adding a flavor they're kind of adding a\nbit of a texture and it almost feels like they're lifting all of the other\nflavors really interesting addition a little bit of salt on top it really adds\nto it as well so if you like chocolate chip cookies and you like potato chips I\nthink you should give these a try I really I'm really going to enjoy these\nthanks for stopping by see you

ones should be left on the trash pile of history we're not necessarily history I don't think any of these products are gonna make history but if there is one product out there that is guaranteed to make history it's the one that I've got in my hand we're going to be doing another edible review today and my heart of hearts my favorite of favorites Kanak oh that's right guys we're back with another Kanaka review we are reviewing their chocolate chip cookie today and I'm really delighted to see that these have are already compliant with the new regulations they've got this little sticker on here saying ten the ten milligrams scored pieces per package so that means they're good to go with the regs theoretically so that hopefully that means they'll be in more areas soon hopefully that means that you guys can find can't go play in your dispensaries and start enjoying the products as well now um if you've never seen a can't go review before I heart them I love them they're my favorite edible manufacturer in the world I've got no doubt some thinking this one's gonna be great this one here is a hundred milligram variety as you can see from the sticker on the top lovely packaging as always from Kanak oh nice box nutrition information on the back just great great stuff to see love it as always so let's go ahead and open it up and give it a taste here it is in their traditional sort of teal greeny packaging for their 100 milligram varieties and I'm interested to see how its scored to be ten different ten milligram pieces of course this is wheat so we're eating the whole thing not just a single piece oh wow yeah this is uh this is their idea of look it's ten different it's ten different pieces because it has ten different little cut marks on it fine by me fine by me better than Corollas mini cookies which you have to eat so many of I'd rather just have one big cookie that's sort of haphazardly scored into ten different pieces scored let's go ahead and get a taste it smells great oh my god it smells so good let's give it taste here it's great oh my god no cannabis tastes really good cookie I'm most vibing eating this quickly I'm gonna enjoy I'm really truly a.m. Wow they're miracle workers I don't know what else to say I didn't know what else to say I do actually matters it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and if I have any guess it's gonna make me feel pretty good but you guys will have to wait a couple of hours well actually you guys just have to wait us a couple of seconds I have to wait a couple of hours to find out but through the magic and Wizardry of editing you guys will know in just a couple of seconds whether on highest buck or not thank you for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a few

doing what I just saw oh I just saw I Tania and woo I'm not sure what to say about that but here's why I am sure I want to say Jericho's chocolate-chip cookie while it's ridiculous they're split into 10 pieces strategy is the little preposterous it's still as amazing as it ever was and hopefully always will be because even at 100 milligrams I'm I'm like a seven five maybe and it tasted delicious couldn't recommend it more highly and I picked it up my dispensary at a discount I believe for an average of nine bucks I say average because I got two for a discount see that's how good Kanaka is is I'm trying to explain my math of purchasing to you all you need to know is buy it if you see it you're really gonna like it just don't split it into tenths just eat the whole thing you'll be happy ok

chocolate chip cookie okay i know that's not everyone's goal but i think that is one of the things that we all love a delicious moist but crispy but gooey in the center but not too gooey chocolate chip cookie i used to work in a camp kitchen for years and would make hundreds upon hundreds of chocolate chip cookies in a large mixer made them so often that over the years i'm not gonna lie when i say for the last probably 15 17 years i have been messing with the recipe changing it adding this adding that tablespoon up tablespoon down to make the ultimate chocolate chip cookie my favorite chocolate chip cookie and they're good they have a few extra ingredients that are kind of odd they have a weird mix and ratio of things but they work and they are so good if you follow the steps buy the kind of odd ingredients you were going to have the chocolate chip cookie kids are gonna love it adults are gonna say what yeah it is that good so to start like a lot of cookies we're gonna put some butter in there and we are doing a large batch but the thing is to make these right to make them bake correctly and have the right look we make a large cookie so even though it's a large batch it doesn't come out as much as you think so after the butter we're going to add the sugar and it has both white granulated sugar which you kind of just need for the right it gives it the right texture and also the right structure as it's baking but then you also need brown sugar and the brown sugar gives it kind of that more the caramelly notes but also that gooey kind of thinner texture so you need that mix of both the white and the brown sugar so once that's all in there and you can see it is gonna is gonna be a big batch but like whoever complained about a big batch of cookies no one we're gonna start mixing that up and cream it until it's well creamed and that means like three to five minutes no one does that long enough actually creaming it to mix in the air which is needed now when it's well mixed you can see that it really is clinging to the sides it's kind of getting a little bit airier texture to it which is what you want you want that butter and sugar to become extremely well combined so when a recipe has minutes on there it can make a difference because if you do it and don't do it fully the butter isn't fully mixed in so i'm just scraping the sides so we can make sure as we keep adding ingredients they mix in evenly you know the smell of this just that butter and the brown sugar and white sugar it it smells like grandma's house growing up because often we would go over she would make a chocolate chip cookie with us it may not have been quite these but there was nothing wrong with grandma's chocolate chip cookies so you instantly kind of get that smell which i love so one at a time i'm going to add some eggs i don't always do it one at a time but we wanted to mix well in and mix evenly and incorporate the right way doing it one at a time can make a difference so i'm going to turn on low get them going and once this one's mixed in i'm just going to add the next one until i'm all in so after that's all incorporated really well we want to add of course our vanilla classic in here the thing is we're adding a healthy dose why it's a healthy dose of cookie you have a lot of butter in there you have a lot of sugar and you really want that vanilla to come out because it's part of a chocolate chip cookie and then a little odd ingredient here some molasses now we're not doing a ton of molasses these do not become a molasses cookie what this does is add that undertone of caramelly caramely almost butterscotchy just like a deeper flavor it's kind of upping the little bit of molasses that could have been in that brown sugar this is to me where you get that undertone of flavor that especially adults will pick up on and say whoa these are these are good chocolate chip cookies kids are gonna love them either way it's definitely needed so i'm gonna mix that vanilla and the molasses in and then we're just gonna put all the dry ingredients right in there in between these steps i do just like to you know make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl that's because you know these mixers sometimes the divot in the bottom can get a little bit under it and you want all these ingredients to mix in well otherwise you might get a cookie or two in the end when you're baking them that kind of get weird and soupy and don't bake right because they weren't evenly mixed so flowers no yeah i said multiple i had that plural because we're not adding just regular all-purpose flour so about half of it is all-purpose flour what we always are used to using you know no questions asked and i honestly think other flower isn't going to be that odd but there is a lot of flowers so i am splitting it between all purpose and then we're going on to some bread flour now that's going to sound really weird but the thing is so flowers when the differences between bread flour pastry flour all purpose is the amount of protein in it so bread flour has one of the highest proteins what that means is it gives it more structure it holds up more and in these cookies it does it makes a difference so just that little bit of switch between the two different types of flour it makes a difference in the outcome and it's one of those things that well the cookies be good either way sure but will they be exactly like mine are no well they look just like mine are no it's gonna be those things that when you ask can i do this can i do this sure you can do whatever you want will it be different very possibly so after the flowers we're gonna add some malted malted milk powder again okay no you probably don't just keep this in your pantry i do i actually keep it my freezer because then it stays for a lot longer what it is is it's some dry milk it's some malted barley it's some wheat flour extracts and it adds a delicious flavor again we're not putting a lot in there we're putting in just enough but it does it adds flavor it adds kind of that i hate to use the word malted but it adds that flavor and yeah it makes a difference if you leave it out will it fall will be awful no will it be as good no this is i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you this these cookies take a couple extra steps they do but are they worth it i wouldn't give this recipe to you if they weren't so i'm adding in some baking soda we're just i mean it's needed in cookies baking soda helps brown them it gives them the right as they bake texture we're gonna add some salt the salt in this one is extremely neat since we are doing so much dough in there you definitely need the salt to kind of balance everything out so we're gonna start this on low because yeah we've all done that where the flower goes everywhere may even have to pulse it depending on the size of your mixer and then we'll mix it up and add the best part all the flowers mixed in there it smells i know i always say that but guys it really does it smells delicious you know that raw cookie dough you can't really go wrong with it and no i'm not going to tell you to eat me because you know we shouldn't eat raw egg that smells good so chocolate got two types i'm not gonna make you chop up whole chocolate from like a block which gives you great outcome but i do like the big you can find bigger chips which as they melt in are just wonderful and i like to mix it i know it's one of those recipes that it's not just one and done i like some semi-sweet gives you that little bit more chocolatey a little bit more not bitter but you know stronger chocolate flavors and then some good milk chocolate now the two of them mixed together the milk chocolate is that classic chocolaty goodness and you want really to pump up the chocolate in these these aren't just chocolate chip cookies they aren't just oh my neighbor's chocolate chip cookies no no these are the chocolate chip cookies you might as well make them good gonna do a couple mixes just to incorporate them into that dough then all we need to do is put it into a bowl so i'm gonna put this into a bowl i'm gonna cover it and then i need to chill this overnight so okay yeah i get it what you're gonna make me chill this yeah this isn't for the faint of heart this isn't for the one and done quick i want to be make these in an hour no this is for i want the best chocolate chip cookie that i can enjoy that everyone that will have one is gonna say what yeah that's what these are so as they sit overnight something important happens the flowers and all the all the ingredients actually hydrate evenly and it makes it completely different when it bakes and i've tried it both ways if you bake them right now they're going to be flatter they're not going to be like that gooey inside crispy exterior no they're going to be a little bit just more soft almost cakey but if they sit overnight in the fridge and i like a good 24 hours if i can they're a completely different cookie they bake up and have a great little dome that then falls once they're baked they they pillows slightly it you can tell i am in love with these cookies so it is important for them to sit overnight so i'm gonna put in this bowl i'm gonna cover it we're gonna put them and chill and then tomorrow we are gonna actually bake the best chocolate chip cookie and you're going to see what i mean i know your mouth is watering mine is two the cookie dough has sat overnight in the fridge and yes it is an essential part to make these the ultimate chocolate chip cookie these are my favorite and i just love to make them so the next day usually about 24 hours after i'm gonna start making scoops and as you can tell i'm making generous sized cookie scoops that's exactly what you want because if you make them too small they just make more of a mound but the right size dough will make them get nice and kind of big but then also still have that rich dense center that stays gooey now my grandma when she made her chocolate chip cookies sweet thing ever she would count the chocolate chips in each cookie i think hers she made a smaller cookie i think there was like six chocolate chips and so sometimes as an homage to her but also just because i do like that if you end up having a round and you don't see chocolate on the top i will put a chocolate chip from the dough right in there just to just so as it bakes you get that nice chocolate yeah grandma would do that and she she didn't necessarily tell people she did that but she did and you know why because it's that extra little steps in care that is just love for people so you know what that's what these cookies are they take a few extra steps but they are love in a cookie so i have one pan done and they're gonna come out now when they come out they look you know a little bit um lofty they haven't fallen yet but as they sit and sometimes i even let them bang on the counter a little bit to make sure they fall and they're way too soft but you can tell then after they cool about five to ten minutes i take them off the pan put them on a rack and you get that gorgeous cookie you can see the ripples of how it falls down how it finishes baking it gets that golden brown around the outside that chewy center so let's guys let's just do ah yes look at that you get that gorgeous texture and this is what i love you get the crispiness on the edges so it holds really well it's crispy but then you get that kind of gooey sauce center that was the best to me of both worlds we all have a different nostalgic presence of what the perfect chocolate chip cookie is which means this encompasses a lot of them crispiness gooeyness soft not cakey lots of chocolate tons of vanilla flavor it's exactly what i want in a chocolate chip cookie and then little bits of depths of flavor with that little bit of molasses which you don't know is there the malt which you don't know is there that's all adding to that ultimate chocolate chip cookie and i love i love it i hope you see that these one these are fun because they're different there's something you probably haven't made because they take a few different extra steps a few different extra ingredients but when you put them together you make them you're going to have this beautiful perfect looking chocolate chip cookie i hope as always that you try these but mostly i hope you share them around because when you share them around it helps everyone see how fun it is how easy it is but also how it can be to just to like have fun in the kitchen and that's what this is all about so make these cookies share them around check my website wiseguy.com for this recipe other recipes there's a printable version of

more cookies but also eating these cookies so i hope you enjoy them and now we can share and have the ultimate chocolate chip cookie together you", "9OWbLG5Hstw": "So I have been searching high and low\u00a0\nbaking cookie dough after cookie dough,\u00a0\u00a0 eating cookie, after cookie looking for the\u00a0\nInternet's chewiest chocolate chip cookie.\u00a0\u00a0 And I believe I found it and it includes my secret\u00a0\ningredient. You're not going to want to miss it.\u00a0 Start out in a nice big bowl. Into this I'm going\u00a0\nto add in room temperature butter and if people\u00a0\u00a0 ask me all the time, what type of butter do I use?\u00a0\nI try to use Irish butter or Kerrygold when I can,\u00a0\u00a0 but I always use salted butter why?\u00a0\nBecause that little bit of salt as\u00a0\u00a0 extra flavor to all of your baking, it\u00a0\njust makes everything super delicious.\u00a0 So now you want to cream your butter, or I'm going\u00a0\nto use an electric hand mixture and you can use a\u00a0\u00a0 standard mixer, or you can do this step by hand.\u00a0\nYou're just going to need a lot of elbow grease,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's totally doable. So I'm just going to\u00a0\ncream this on high speed and just let it get nice\u00a0\u00a0 and fluffy. Just takes around 30 seconds or so.\nSo this is looking good, into this I\u2019m going to\u00a0\u00a0 add in my Brown sugar, and this is really\u00a0\nimportant in your chocolate chip cookie\u00a0\u00a0 recipes. Cause it gives you that kind of lovely\u00a0\ncaramel tones and it makes them really gooey in\u00a0\u00a0 the middle as well. I'm going to follow\u00a0\nthat with a little bit of white sugar.\u00a0 Okay. Now for my secret ingredients, duh,\u00a0\nyou're not going to believe this, but it is\u00a0\u00a0 olive oil. So here's the deal. Olive oil adds\u00a0\nextra moisture to your cookie dough. That\u00a0\u00a0 extra moisture gives you a chewy chocolate chip\u00a0\ncookie. This has also loads of flavor. I just\u00a0\u00a0 use regular olive oil, nothing too crazy strong.\nIt's naughty. It's a little bit. Salty. It has\u00a0\u00a0 loads of flavor. And trust me is just catapults\u00a0\nthe flavor of these cookies to another dimension.\u00a0\u00a0 I did try this cookie dough with regular\u00a0\noil and it didn't have the same flavor. So\u00a0\u00a0 trust me on this, go with the olive\u00a0\noil and you will not be disappointed.\u00a0\u00a0 So for your olive oil in there, turn back\u00a0\non your hand mixer for doing it by hand\u00a0\u00a0 on a high speed.\nAnd we want to whip these up\u00a0\u00a0 really well for roughly four to five minutes and\u00a0\nlet them get nice and big and light and fluffy.\u00a0\u00a0 So, like I said, I did test this recipe using a\u00a0\nvegetable oil and although it did make it nice\u00a0\u00a0 and chewy, you didn't get the same flavor that you\u00a0\ndid from the olive oil. If you at home, want to\u00a0\u00a0 use a natural oil, coconut oil, whatever your oil\u00a0\npreference is, feel free to use the same amount.\u00a0 And that's totally fine. But trust me, olive oil\u00a0\nis far superior. So a lot of you already know\u00a0\u00a0 my best ever chocolate chip cookies, and those\u00a0\nare kinds of goofy ones, but they're not chewy.\u00a0\u00a0 So these are different. You're definitely going\u00a0\nto want to try both recipes. So this is lovely,\u00a0\u00a0 nice and light and fluffy, just the way I want it.\nSo when I enter this, I'm going to add in my eggs.\u00a0\u00a0 And I also going to add in a nice big tablespoon\u00a0\nof vanilla extract. Now that is not a typo. I\u00a0\u00a0 wasn't supposed to say teaspoon, tablespoon,\u00a0\nthe vanilla in these cookies. Just make it so\u00a0\u00a0 delicious. So don't be scabby with the vanilla\u00a0\nextract. Okay. And then what you want to do is\u00a0\u00a0 just cream, all of these together, again,\u00a0\njust for a few seconds until they combine.\u00a0 So once your eggs and vanilla are in there and\u00a0\ngo set that over to the side, I'm bringing in\u00a0\u00a0 my flour. Now into my flour I am going\u00a0\nto add in a little bit of baking powder,\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit of baking soda and of course,\u00a0\nsalt. And then just give those a stirrup.\u00a0\u00a0 So I'm gonna put the flour over here and\u00a0\nnow I wants to talk to you very seriously.\u00a0 It's my serious tone about chocolate. Now let\u00a0\nme tell you some of the best chocolate chip\u00a0\u00a0 cookies you've ever had, have not been made with\u00a0\nchocolate chips. They have been made with a big\u00a0\u00a0 old bar of bittersweet chocolate. Now this is\u00a0\nwhat I like to use because you get big chunks,\u00a0\u00a0 little chunks, little speckles, all the way\u00a0\nthrough out, but this just melts into your cookie.\u00a0 With chocolate chips, they stay the same\u00a0\nshape. You want to get a nice big bar,\u00a0\u00a0 preferably around 72% cocoa solids of\u00a0\nchocolate. Then just chop this bad boy up.\u00a0\u00a0 Leave some big chunks in there. Nice and\u00a0\nrough. And this is what you want to add\u00a0\u00a0 to your chocolate chip cookies. It's\u00a0\ngoing to make the world of difference.\u00a0 Trust me. So you check that out. I'm not sure I'm\u00a0\ncoming across cupping chunk of chocolate melting\u00a0\u00a0 in your cookie. I mean just absolute heaven.\u00a0\nOkay. That's looking good. And I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 bring back in my cookie base. I'm going to add in\u00a0\nour flour and our dry ingredients, and then I'm\u00a0\u00a0 going to scoop it. Had our chocolate all in there.\nIt's delicious. There we go and spatula and let's\u00a0\u00a0 mix this all together. Okay, so this is our dough,\u00a0\nbut here's the thing. We added an olive oil here,\u00a0\u00a0 so we made it extra wet. As you can see, it's a\u00a0\nvery soft dose. So this has to go into the fridge\u00a0\u00a0 for at least four hours. Let it get\u00a0\nnice and cold before you bake it off.\u00a0 What I like to do is age my dough, and\u00a0\nI've written all about this on my website.\u00a0\u00a0 It means putting your cookie dough into\u00a0\nthe fridge for one, two, five, six,\u00a0\u00a0 seven days. I do it all the time. What happens is\u00a0\nyour cookie dough just gets more flavor and just\u00a0\u00a0 makes for really delicious cookies. Delicious.\nI strongly recommend taste the raw dough and\u00a0\u00a0 you're going to know what kind of\u00a0\ncookies you can Look forward to.\u00a0\u00a0 Right now, I'm going to cover this\u00a0\noff and pop it into the fridge.\u00a0 When your dough is cold and ready to go. Scoop\u00a0\nbig tablespoons of dough onto your cookie sheets.\u00a0\u00a0 Give them a little bit of space in between\u00a0\ncause they will spread while baking.\u00a0\u00a0 So another little sneaky trick for the\u00a0\nchewy chocolate chip cookies. Bake them\u00a0\u00a0 at a high temperature for a short amount of time.\u00a0 So bake at 375 degrees fahrenheit or 190\u00a0\ndegrees Celsius for around 12 to 13 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 Just a short amount of time to get crispy\u00a0\non the outside and chewy in the middle. I\u00a0\u00a0 don't want you to go anywhere though, because\u00a0\nonce these come out of the oven, I'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 show you the best cookie trick to give you the\u00a0\nultimate bakery style chocolate chip cookies.\u00a0 Amazing. And they're fresh out of the oven. I\u00a0\nneed to do a pan bang straight away, but I've\u00a0\u00a0 got a baby sleeping in the back of the house.\u00a0\nSo I'm going to have to improvise. So I've been\u00a0\u00a0 baking a lot of cookies and this is not the first\u00a0\ntime I've used my front porch to do a pan bang.\u00a0\u00a0 So Sarah Kieffer invented this.\nAnd it's a fantastic trick.\u00a0\u00a0 It pools the chocolate. It kind of just makes this\u00a0\nlike flow. And then it also gives your cookies,\u00a0\u00a0 this lovely crinkle. So come here, check these\u00a0\nout. I am beyond delighted about how these\u00a0\u00a0 turns out they look perfect. And while they're\u00a0\nstill warm, they are definitely best enjoyed.\u00a0 So Kevin, come on in. Alrighty. So I'll have to\u00a0\nadmit, I've tried about a dozen of these and they\u00a0\u00a0 keep getting better every time. Chewy. Lushy\u00a0\nall that nuttiness from our secret ingredient.\u00a0\u00a0 Chewy chocolate bakery, style cookies. I mean, the\u00a0\nfact that we're going to be able to make things at\u00a0\u00a0 home now you're never going to have to leave the\u00a0\nhouse again. Check out all my other baking videos.\u00a0\u00a0 I've got tons more and we'll see you back here\u00a0\nreally soon. Thanks for everyone. It was so good.", "-oJldMRvWjE": "hi everybody welcome back to my kitchen i'm amy from neurotic mom bakes and today is the best day ever because number one it's christmas eve for some of you it might even be christmas morning number two is i this has been so hard i don't know why it's a basic chocolate chip cookie but to get the perfect one boy did i have a lot of trial and error with this one um i scoured the internet and just kind of just looked and compared different recipes and they're all basic same ingredients right butter flour sugar eggs stuff like that but there were so many variations like do i melt the butter first do i keep it cold is it unsalted butter should i use salted butter baking soda versus baking powder or a little bit of both there just were so many factors some recipes called for chilling for two hours some wanted to chill for 24 to 48 hours i'm not a fan of chilling dough especially chocolate chip cookies because when you're in the mood for cookies you want them now you don't want to make them and eat them tomorrow because yeah you want chocolate chip cookies now so i have tweaked and tweaked and tweaked again and again so many times i can't even count to get the perfect consistency the perfect flavor perfect texture for this just you know basic chocolate chip cookie everyone's favorite so merry christmas my gift to you perfect chocolate chip cookie all right let's start so i am going with salted butter you can use unsalted butter i have tried this um salted butter just adds a little bit more flavor i am not melting my butter in fact i want it slightly cold not cold from the fridge but not melty at all so i'm going to put this in the defrost in the microwave just until i can barely barely press my finger into it barely barely soft now in here i have two thirds of a cup of granulated white sugar and then i need three quarters of a cup of brown sugar packed brown sugar there's a half and a quarter the other thing is is i like my hand mixer better i just have more control over how much things get mixed which is also very important now to get this butter to incorporate just right and easier is i will kind of cut it up into like eight chunks this is a half a cup of salted butter i'm going to use my hand mixer this takes a minute but you want to get it until it's fully combined all the butter is combined with the sugar again this just takes a minute more because that butter was kind of cold but it's worth it trust me you want the colder butter all right i think we're about there it just starts to come together there we go it just has come together you cannot see any chunks of butter at this point we will add one egg [Music] and two teaspoons of vanilla [Music] now here's an important step and this is don't over mix the egg that will make for a stiff cookie just get it until it's just barely creamed together there we go that's where i want it let's talk about measuring flour there are lots of different ways to measure flour you can scoop it you can weigh it however the best most accurate way is to kind of fluff your flour with a spoon and then spoon it in and that's what i'm going to do for this recipe i need two cups of flour because if you kind of pack it in there you're going to have more flour than you than you want and it's going to make a dry cookie two okay now in this recipe i'm going to use baking soda and baking powder so baking soda they are not the same thing not even close baking soda will make the cookie spread a little bit more which you want you want it to spread a little bit baking powder will give it some rise and make it fluffy so we're going to do a half a teaspoon of each of those baking powder and baking sodas is my half and a half a teaspoon of salt okay this you do not want to over mix you want to get it just mixed you'll see it'll be like a crumbly texture okay that looks really dry right very crumbly very dry that's what i want because here is my secret you're going to add one tablespoon of milk two if it's really dry maybe you over measured your flour just a little bit but one tablespoon of milk it'll just start to come together that's what i'm looking for stop right there because you're going to do the rest by hand but you can see it just start to come together you can handle it but it doesn't stick to your fingers now we add the good stuff after all this work use a high quality chocolate chip i have the ghirardelli just you don't have to but it really does make a lot of difference you can add nuts you can add white chocolate chips you can add butterscotch chips peanut butter chips whatever you like you can get like a really nice candy bar like a symphony bar and chop that up that would be really good i have done that before when i ran out of chocolate chips okay i think maybe a few more okay now the beautiful thing about this is you do not have to chill when a dough calls for chilling i'm i'm out especially chocolate chip cookies now we're ready to uh scoop them onto my tray i like to use an ice cream scoop you just get a nice round portion and they're all equal but totally feel free to get your spoon and spoon it onto here you can do a greased cookie sheet or use parchment paper i like parchment paper because you can reuse it three or four times and then you don't have to clean the pan just because i can't stand when my cookies run together or touch each other when they start to bake i'm only gonna do eight but they're gonna be nice big cookies and i'm actually going to after i do that i'm gonna kind of shape it a little bit more round and place it exactly where i want it so they don't run together and sometimes if it looks like it needs more like chocolate chip i'll stick another one in there a little bit more dough on this one these will go into a 350 degree oven for about 9 to 11 minutes now here's the other trick you want to take them out just a hair before they look done if you take them out when they look baked all the way through you've overdone it and they're going to be too crispy because they continue to cook on the cookie sheet so when they're just barely still wet in the center take them out and just like the tiniest hint of color on the outside take them out okay there it is my perfect chocolate chip cookie at least this is how i like them they're just thick enough just chewy enough full of chocolate chips just barely brown on the edges and the flavor that salted butter just makes all the difference that is so good so i want to know what you think i want you to give this a try give me

chocolate chip cookies but would really prefer them to be all chocolate so these are for her it's coming up next on the sugar geek show [Music] so let's go ahead and start making our double chocolate chip cookies super easy most importantly we want to start off with butter melted butter and our cocoa powder and we're going to blend those together and what this is going to do is help hydrate the cocoa powder so it doesn't taste dry raise your hand if you've ever had a dry chocolate chip cookie or a dry brownie dry it's the cocoa powder it just wants to suck the moisture out of your mouth doesn't that look yummy much better all right we're going to put that into the bowl or stand mixer and we're going to cream it with the sugar until it is light and fluffy but it's not going to be white because chocolate brown sugar white sugar and [Music] mix [Music] don't forget to scrape the bowl make sure all the butter and everything is combining well now we're going to add in our egg and we're going to mix this for another one to two minutes make sure your eggs are room temperature which means when you put your finger in here and you feel the egg it's not cold shouldn't feel hot or warm if your eggs are cold you can take this bowl of eggs and put it in a larger bowl with a little bit of water and just two minutes and then it will bring it up to room temperature [Music] so once it is you can see a lot of air has been whipped into this it's nice and light and fluffy that's perfect so now mixing on low we're gonna add in our vanilla our salt and our baking soda and then we're gonna mix in our flour and our chocolate chips just until combined oh yeah you know when the mixer starts to struggle that you've got a lot of chocolate in there alrighty then so then you could scoop these up and bake them right away no need to chill or anything like that but if you want to reduce the amount of spread that they have it is good to let them just kind of hang out for 30 minutes and that just allows the flour to absorb the liquid that's in the eggs so they don't spread out as much while you're baking you can put it in the refrigerator if you want to but that's just going to even make the cookies spread even less so just kind of depends on you know if you want a thicker taller cookie you could refrigerate and hydrate for 30 minutes or if you want more spread but still not super thin then just do the 30 minutes at room temperature all right so it's been 30 minutes i'm gonna scoop my dough with my handy dandy cookie scoop and just press that right on there they might run into each other they might not we'll see it's like little ice cream scoops i love it okay so now i'm gonna take some more chocolate chips and i'm gonna put them on top because hello these are show stopping cookies and you need some chunks just magically on top of the cookie so that when they bake you know it's not just a flat brown blob right now whenever you see this on pinterest you'll be like ah the more chocolate the more better all right so we're gonna go ahead and bake these in the oven at 350 degrees for exactly 10 minutes let them cool for five minutes or so just on the pan and that's going to continue to bake them so they might seem like they're under done but they're actually still baking and then you want to transfer them to a cooling rack let them fully cool and they're going to set up even further and make that super soft moist perfect texture and crumb time to taste the cookies my favorite part avalon come here look what i made for you look they're like a different color and they're usually a really light color and these are really dark yeah because usually they're chocolate chip cookies but these are double chocolate chip cookies chocolate and chocolate and chocolate i can't remember do you like chocolate [Music] do you want to eat one yeah good seriously it's like a brownie with extra chocolate on top so that's it guys that's how you make double

They have the perfect\namount of everything. They're basically fool-proof. And I don't know if you can\nsee, but there's this sparkle of giant flakes of sea salt on top and it is making all of your\ncookie dreams come true. You gotta believe me on this. Okay, let's get started. First off, we're gonna\nsift the dry ingredients starting with 2-1/4\ncups or about 270 grams of all-purpose flour. There we go. It's close. 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda. I'm adding in 1/2 a teaspoon of salt now, but we're gonna garnish this cookie with beautiful flakes\nof sea salt at the end so you will get a nice, salty finish. Sift it up (upbeat music) and give it a quick whisk. Okay, now we can set that\naside and get onto the butter, and peanut butter, and\nall that gooey goodness. Into the bowl of my stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment I'm adding in one cup, which is two\nsticks, or about 230 grams of unsalted room-temperature butter. In you go. Cream it up for like a few seconds. Now we're gonna add in a cup and 1/2 of smooth peanut butter. And I will give you some advice. Use the regular, like supermarket brand. It has a lot of emulsifiers\nand other ingredients in there that'll make it a bit more stable. This is gonna be a little\nsoupy, but it'll all work out, so don't worry. And by my measurement, a\ncup and 1/2 of peanut butter is about 260 grams. Okay, mix. I would eat this just like that, like with a spoon. That is some delicious business. Okay, so thanks to my\nglass bowl, you can see there's a little bit of\nbutter at the very bottom. Just scrape it down. This recipe uses 3/4 of a\ncup of light brown sugar, so just tap it down. You're actually packing it a little bit. Lightly packed brown sugar. And then 2/3 of a cup of granulated sugar. So in you go. You might know this, but white sugar will make the cookies spread out more and the brown sugar will\nmake it a little bit (sighing) cakier. No! (off-air beep) Cakier. No one saw that. Mix it. It'll get a little bit\nlighter and fluffier. The peanut butter is\nweighing it down, though. If you make peanut butter\ncookies, you know this already, but adding more peanut\nbutter will increase the peanut butter flavor\nand also make them, like, just super crispy like they're\ngonna dissolve in your mouth. Less peanut butter,\nclearly less the flavor, but the cookies will\nbe a bit stronger, too. Less crumbly. (mixer motor) Okay, take a look. A little bit lighter in color. Little creamier. Mm. Now we're gonna add in two\nteaspoons of vanilla extract, one large egg to start. Mix 'er up and then we'll\nadd in the second large egg. Gonna scrape the bowl down really quickly and then we can add\nour dry ingredients in. And this cookie's almost ready to eat. Now, add your dry ingredients in. You can do it, you can do it all at once. Good. Mix on low until you're confident bad things won't happen. Okay, look at that. Now it's a dough. But what could make this even better? How 'bout some chocolate chips? I'm adding a cup and 1/2 of semi-sweet chocolate chips in. If you want to use milk\nchocolate, that's on you. I will have the dark. I'm gonna mix this for like a few seconds and then fold it in by hand. (mixer motor) (light-hearted music) Okay. Oh my, this smells so good. In fact, let's take a little test. Oh man. It's so good. So good! Oh, okay. This will be delicious. And I'll be right back with the swap out that I made yesterday. All right, back with my chilled dough and I'm using a regular-size\nice cream scoop. I'll measure it out in a second in grams in case you're a Virgo like me and you like things to be exact. Just scoop out the chilled dough, pop it out, and then\nwe have about 50 grams. Look at this. Where are my chocolate chips? They're all hiding inside. But don't worry. We're gonna fix it and\nmake it look really cute. Just continue. You want to space them out. They will be spreading. So I like to do kind of\nrows of two or three. So these cookies are a mixed bunch. Some of them are covered in chocolate. Some of them have almost none. I want them to be uniform\nand look really pretty, so pop in a couple of\nchocolate chips to the top, maybe like three to\nfour, and just put them in different orientations. You can press a few in. The main thing is that you're gonna have some of the chocolate that's fully exposed and not covered with any batter, so it'll look nice and\nglossy once they bake. And no one ever sad, \"Too\nmuch chocolate,\" right? These cookies are looking way better, but for my final blogger\ntrick, I'm gonna use some Maldon sea salt. I'm not getting paid for this at all, so don't worry, it's not sponsored. But this salt is bananas. It has huge crystals in\nit which look beautiful on all sorts of dishes. Look at that salt crystal. It's like a giant roof\nshingle that's in this bag. And the science teacher in me loves seeing the crystalline structure. It's a, it's a, it's a pyramid. (chuckling) That's what it is. It's a regular, old, square pyramid. Okay, anyways, now we're\ngoing to gracefully add on just a sprinkle on top. The salt will not melt, so you'll have some beautiful flakes. And the other thing I like about this is it's paper thin. So even though the salt crystals are huge, you're not biting into\na giant chunk of salt. It really is a perfect\ncompliment for this recipe. All right, this is gonna go into the oven at 350, about 177 Celsius, for, mmm, maybe 13 to 15 minutes\nbecause you want them to start setting but not be fully baked. They're gonna spread out\nand they'll dome a bit, but once you take them out\nof the oven, they'll flatten and be a beautiful cookie\nwith a velvety finish. It'll be magic. Let's make this happen. But wait, there's more. Mm mm. (chuckling) I told you that if you\nuse more peanut butter, you get more flavor, but it is more, it doesn't have the structure. So it's a trade off. These are delicious, but they\nwill start falling apart, especially if you just\nhit them with a heat gun right before this shot because\nyou wanted the chocolate to look extra glossy in the closeup. If you like this video, check\nout my number-two-by-a-hair, these would be number\none, favorite cookie, chocolate chocolate chip. So delicious and good.

Crunchy on the outside,\nchewy on the inside, with lots of gooey chocolate? Today's your lucky day. My oatmeal chocolate chip recipe is super easy and foolproof. Hey, you're watching \"Preppy\nKitchen,\" where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These cookies will be\nready before you know it, so let's get started. First off, one cup of all-purpose flour, 120 grams into a large bowl. My scale has a delay, so you can't be too\ncavalier with the pour. You could have actually\nused a medium bowl. Half a teaspoon of salt, half\na teaspoon of baking soda. The baking soda is gonna react\nwith the acid in this cookie, which is the brown sugar. Just in case you were wondering. Give it a quick whisk and set aside. If you're wondering like, \"John, where's the\nsubstance of this cookie? It looks like you're adding\nnothing to this bowl.\" It's the oats. We're using a ton of oats in here and they're gonna be so\ncrispy on the outside, nice and chewy in the middle. It's gonna be amazing. I can't wait. This is one of my favorite cookies. I don't know. I have like a whole bunch. It's one of the top cookies I like, because it's like just that\ncrispness on the outside, but the inside has a\nreally great chew to it. Set the scale aside. It's time for your mixer\nwith the paddle attachment, or hand mixer in a big bowl. To my mixer, I'm adding half a cup or 113 grams of unsalted\nbutter at room temperature, and plop this down, lock it off and beat it up a little bit. Now, drizzle in a third of a cup of sugar, white granulated sugar,\nplease, like 66 grams. We're going to add in two-thirds of a cup of lightly packed\nbrown sugar, in you go. Mix it up until it's nice\nand light and fluffy. After about a minute, time to pour in two teaspoons of vanilla and add in one room temperature egg. All right, once it's looking\nkind of silky and ribbony just give that bowl a quick, quick scrape. And we're going to dump\nin that flour mixture. Dump it in. Mix it until it's almost combined. There's still some flour\nhanging out hither and thither but we're going to add in our\noats and chocolate chips now. To this delicious concoction\nof butter, flour, and sugar, I'm adding one and a\nhalf cups of rolled oats also known as old fashioned oats. So they'll have like\na lot of bite to them. And, one and a half. See, now we're adding a lot of mass in. So many oats. So kind of up to you, you\ncould add no chocolate chips, if that's what you want to do, or you could add in the full cup. I'm adding a cup but reserving\na good handful for later, we pop them on top, make the\ncookies look nice and pretty. So add the remaining semi\nsweet chocolate chips in and now we're just gonna stir it together. Do all the work for me, machine. There you go. So now you see you have this\nreally nice rich mixture of oats, and you can just\nuse your spatula just to like make sure everything's distributed. Give it one final mix. And now we're going to\npop this into the fridge for about an hour. You could make this a day ahead. They could live in the freezer\nand you could defrost them. There's tons of options. I'll go over the freezing part later. That's kind of fun. Time to put that sleeping cap on and go night night in the refrigerator. See you soon. My cookie dough was\nchilling for about an hour, so it's time to pop off that\ntop and get to scooping. You want to have like heaping\ntablespoon-sized pieces. It could be a bit bigger\nif you want a mega cookie but you will also increase\nthe bake time, just by the by. Quick roll, if needed, and just pop it on. I'm using a silicone lined\nbaking sheet, but a parchment one will work as well. You want to space these\nout at least two inches, give them some room to breathe. They will be spreading\nout in the oven a bit. These are ready to go into\nthe oven at 375 Fahrenheit for eight to 10 minutes,\nthe edge will be set. The center will be not set yet but it'll continue to do so after you take them out, so just be aware. Just by the by. (beep) Don't think I forgot about\nmy reserved chocolate chips. Of course I didn't. So just pop a few on the top. It's really optional, but I\nfeel it makes them look pretty. Pop a few chocolate chips on there, not on the baking sheet, on the cookie. Okay.

(upbeat music)", "DPMUZAeI7no": "hey what's up i want to be clear before we get started here that this is not just another chocolate chip cookie recipe no this is gonna be the last chocolate chip cookie recipe you'll ever [Music] need so the perfect chocolate chip cookie is going to start with a stand mixer into that i'm going to measure 220 grams or a whole block of nice butter behind that 100 grams of granulated sugar and 200 grams of dark brown sugar i'm gonna throw the paddle attachment onto this mixer and beat everything together for two to three minutes to start the creaming process i'm using a product here called plugura this stuff is kind of like a performance butter a lot of pastry chefs use this in their croissants and baked goods where the exact amount of fat in the butter and the flavor of that fat matters a lot i picked this up from the grocery store by the grass-fed butters by like where the kerrygold is which is also going to work if you can't find this stuff i want to call out here too that in doing research for this recipe it seemed that a lot of the big dogs out there like america's test kitchen serious eats they all browned their butter including christina tosi and bon appetit and i tried it it was good brown butter flavor tastes very dope but for me texturally the thing that i love about a cream butter cookie is that you get chewiness and crispiness at the same time that's kind of hard to achieve when you melt the butter and for good measure i asked my pastry chef friend sarah osborne who's a total bad girl what she prefer and she goes cream butter too so that's good enough for me halfway through this creaming process i'm gonna make sure to grab a spatula and scrape down the sides of this bowl as you can see there's a bunch of unwhipped sugar butter stuck to the sides and that's gonna weigh the cookies down later if we don't mitigate now i'm gonna throw this mixer back up to high speed for about three to four more minutes of creaming after about six to seven minutes of creaming that butter and sugar it should look like this they're really well combined and now we're gonna crack in two whole eggs one egg yolk and four grams of vanilla extract i'm gonna return my mixer to about medium speed and i'm gonna fold this together and whip it up just for about another minute we're just looking to combine we don't want to whip in too much air if you do that you run the risk of them puffing up in the oven and then collapsing like i did here in batch three just something to be aware of now i'm gonna set this stand mixer aside for a second and get involved with the chocolate part of these chocolate chip cookies that i have two four ounce bars of 70 percent cacao baking chocolate this is ghirardelli gear your hedeli this is a reputable brand for sure and you should be able to find it in most grocery stores if you can find velhrona another mostly restaurant level chef brand that is really popular for pastry chefs use that stuff it rips i'm gonna lay these out on my cutting board and give them a rough chop into large chunky pieces this is a second detail that i want to call out starbot chocolate chips are great for cookies and i have no issue with them but for grownups who have a discerning palette we need something more flavorful less sweetened and more importantly something that's going to give us more contrast what i mean by that is store-bought chocolate chips have compounds in them that prevent them from fully breaking down and melting into a cookie chunks of nice baking chocolate that are roughly chopped are going to integrate way more organically into this thing and give us a lot of different types of chocolate bites throughout the entire experience once these bars are chopped up into roughly half inch sized chunks i'm going to do something totally insane here and grab my salad spinner and i'm going to scoop that chocolate into that now we're going to gently sift this to remove not all but most of the really fine chocolate particulate this is an attempt to maintain that contrast having a ton of chocolate shavings in there is not going to give us pops of delicious chocolate flavor it'll be a little bit homogenous and just not pro but don't throw this stuff out it makes a great topping for brownies or whatever you got that needs just a little kiss of chocolate now to finish up this cookie dough we're going to measure in 330 grams of all-purpose flour a half teaspoon of baking soda a quarter teaspoon of baking powder and finally seven grams of salt i want to call out my scale doesn't work for stuff under a gram so a volumetric measurement for stuff like a half teaspoon baking soda is actually more accurate and that is pretty much the only time you will see me using that instead of a scale now we're going to pedal all these dry ingredients into that butter mixture but we don't want to develop a bunch of gluten and potentially make a tough cookie dough so we're only going for about 30 seconds on low speed here just to get things combined like this next goes in the chocolate and i'm gonna reserve about 15 to 20 chunks of that or so for well you'll see in a second then using rubber spatula i'm going to stir all these chocolates in there gently i'm going to fold and turn everything until it's well distributed and there look at that this is some very handsome looking cookie dough now we're going to shape these things and for that we need a little baby sheet tray and scooper this is a four ounce lunch lady edition mashed potato scooper i'll definitely link to it down below because it works wonders to create evenly shaped cookies but a scale or a half ounce measuring cup will work pretty similar to shape these things we're going to pop a few chunks of that reserved chocolate in there and then grab enough dough to fill the scooper definitely make sure to press all that dough into the scoop this way the cookies are evenly balanced mass wise and they don't slide sideways when they go to bake in the oven from there we're going to squeeze that out onto a sheet tray and now you can see this is why we deserve that chocolate it's sitting right on top as a garnish so when we bake these we're gonna have a beautiful melty chocolate piece in the top of every cookie and it's also gonna give us some lightly caramelized chocolate flavor on top so this is a classic win-win this recipe makes enough dough for eight truly king size r rated cookies that are roughly four ounces each once all eight are portioned up we're going to pop them in the refrigerator overnight this allows the butter to firm up but it also lets the flour fully hydrate so plan ahead for a minimum of four hours but preferably do this overnight the next day it's cookie time now i'm gonna preheat my oven to 375 degrees and check out these cookies they're all hydrated they're properly firmed up and they're ready to go to bake these now we're going to grab a sheet tray and throw some parchment on it but this is important make sure that it's a flat and straight half sheet tray if you have a well worn one that's a little bit concave it's not going to be great these cookies being so buttery and rich are going to spread out into the middle and they're going to touch tips a little bit it's going to be a little bit weird and that's not a huge deal but for me there's no touching allowed we're basically going to lay down four balls and space them as far apart as we can so we can get the most even browning edge to edge and you could probably do five sneak one in the middle here but i only want four i'm gonna throw the rest of these in the refrigerator for four to five days and bake fresh cheese when i want them the final touch here is a healthy topping of flaky salt this is maldon salt it's available at whole foods maybe trader joe's it's crunchy and of course super salty it's going to provide us that perfect pop of saltiness right on top to balance all that fatty sweetness regular kosher salt can work here by the way it'll be a little bit less dynamic but that saltiness is still going to be great once these are all covered in that mauldin now we're going to load them into a 375 degree oven and bake them for about 18 minutes this is of course going to vary widely based on whatever oven you have in your house but i'm looking for brown edges here those are going to bring the contrast to that gooey tender chewy somehow squishy center and it's going to give us the perfect cookie but a lot of different times and temps can work here it's up to you about what you like whatever you want to do dude you're the king after 18 minutes check these out these cookies just have they have so much of whatever it is that the human mind wants at its most primal level it's scratching that itch man it's there it's like a cookie in 3d they're chewy and crispy and salty they're sweet they're super buttery from all that nice butter and i ate like 10 to 12 of these things leading up to this moment in r d and i am still so stoked to grab another let's eat this thing [Music] before i get out of here i just want to say a huge thank you to everybody who supports this channel on coffee kofi i made this recipe seven times before i shot this video and that is a lot of very expensive butter so thank you guys see you in the next one", "ToGFgE5Q9Uw": "hey what's happening guys it has been a little while since I've done a keto cookie recipe on the channel let alone a keto chocolate-chip cookie recipe on the channel but the other day I saw that Disney posted their chocolate chip cookie recipe online for everybody to make and I was just like okay I have to make a keto friendly version of Disney's chocolate chip cookies so that's what we're doing today these cookies are absolutely straight fired they're soft they're chewy they're so tasty tasty and when you take a bite of these I swear you think you are in Disney World or maybe Disneyland if that's your fantasy but Disney World is my fantasy cuz that's where I was when I was a kid but I'm telling you these cookies are incredible they don't taste low carb or keto at all absolutely oh good that's up let's get right in the good stuff and make some low carb keto chocolate chip cookies all right the first thing we want to do is preheat our oven to 325 degrees then we're going to get out a wire strainer and some almond flour and we're gonna sift the almond flour into a medium sized bowl having said that for today's quito chocolate chip cookies recipe want to sift 1 and 1/4 cups or a hundred and 40 grams of almond flour into the bowl so once we've done that we're gonna add a half a teaspoon of baking soda and a nice pinch of salt to really enhance the flavor of the cookies then as you're seeing here we're going to use a wire whisk to combine those ingredients and then we're gonna set that bowl aside now in an even larger Bowl we're gonna add 5 tablespoons or 70 grams of some softened butter and yes it is super important that the butter is softened before you add it to the bowl then once we've added that we're gonna add a heaping third of a cup or 80 grams of brown swerve to add some sweetness to our keto cookies without adding any carbs or calories now having said that we're also going to add a heaping third of a cup or 55 grams of confectioner swerve as well and this stuff again doesn't have any net carbs or calories so it's perfect for keto anyways once we've got those added to the bowl we're gonna use a hand mixer to cream the butter and sweetener together this should take you about three to five minutes to do thoroughly and you'll want to be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl down the spatula throughout the process so once we've done that we're going to add a large room-temperature egg to our bowl and then mix that into our ingredients then when we've thoroughly mixed that in we're going to add a teaspoon or three to four grams of vanilla extract to our bowl and mix again anyways once that's looking good we're gonna add half of the dry ingredients into the bowl and give everything a mix with our spatula then after we've done that we're gonna add the rest of the dry ingredients and mix again so now at this point we're going to add our chocolate chips and to keep the carbs as low as possible I highly recommend using these zero net carb semi-sweet ones from Lily's having said that for today's keto chocolate chip cookies recipe we're going to fold in 1/2 a cup or 85 grams those chocolate chips into our dough so once we've got those folded in we're going to refrigerate the dome for 30 minutes then once we've chilled our dough we can use a cookie scoop to form 12 equal sized cookies by the way don't crowd your cookies on the sheet I actually had second thoughts myself and I ended up transferring half of my cookies to a second baking sheet okay so now that we've got all of our cookies added to our pans we're going to bake them in the oven for 3 minutes then we're gonna flatten the tops of the cookies with a spoon and bake them for another 5 to 7 minutes now the cookies will be and should be extremely soft when they come onto the oven so it's really important that you let them cool down on the pan for at least 30 minutes after they're done cooking however once they cool down they'll set and they'll turn out like this they'll be incredibly soft and chewy and oh so delicious and that my friends is how to make Disney's chocolate chip cookie recipe keto friendly as always for more information on today's recipe check out the video description below and I hope you're having a great day", "sJsXDi26b-Y": "so let's bake lemon this is chocolate chip cookies very very easy you don't

give it enough space for air circulation during baking space social distancing or physical distance cookies but also how to practice physical distancing even for your cookies one recipe can create

"DHVO4KeFCXY": "[Music] whoa how is it you like it [Music] hi guys I'm here and I'm Ilana and today we are on our way to start our journey to find the best chocolate chip cookies in New York City so there are so many places in New York City to get and we narrowed it down to four top spots based on internet research word of mouth and a little bit of personal experience and I am starving so let's go do it Ilana and I luckily have similar tastes when we're talking about the ideal chocolate chip cookie we're looking for a crunchy crispy exterior and a gooey interior and a bunch of chocolate chips spotted throughout the cookie our first stop is Jacques Torres chocolate Jacques Torres is a world-famous pastry chef and chocolatier chef Torres specializes in handcrafted chocolates made with fresh real ingredients hello I am Jacques Torres from Jacques Torres chocolates and this is the home of the best cookies in New York this is my go-to spot for chocolate chip cookies I come here at least once a month and it's conveniently very close to my house in my office so it's easy to stop by it's very dangerous give to your customer what your customer wants an American love cookies so when you do the things right your cookies will be a little bit crispy on the outside soft on the center with a nice layering of chocolates not too chewy not too soft so John now is responsible for pastries the pastry chef and John going to show you how to make all those cookies we're also gonna mix this together so it's nice and light and fluffy next we're gonna add the eggs eggs and vanilla so we use two kinds of flours we use a bread and a pastry flour and that's part of what makes our cookies a little bit unique as well that contributes to the texture and consistency of the cookie this is a dark chocolate 64% we use two bags with us to make of a batch of cookies that's 30 kilos we lift a hundred kilo cookie dough with a forklift from there we have a blowtorch to warm the bowl to loosen up the cookie mix so that it can be removed and added to the hopper the cookie machine will cut 80 cookies a minute from there they are taken in place on trays to be baked after they're baked they are cooled down and wrapped shall we yeah I like this very much okay okay no I love the chocolate - cookie ratio and I love the crispness mm-hmm and the chewiness I love the additional sense of vanilla that I get and this cookie compared to a lot of the other chocolate chip cookies that I've had just in my life in general what about you for me I'm kind of on the same boat with you I love the chocolate like and you just look at this cookie it's just one big big mama glob of chocolate Big Mama glob a chocolate right there in the center oh but yeah I really really love this if I could just want one more thing hazel I would want sweet at all yes see sold on top definitely see salt on top that will make this cookie like ten times better and a little softer on the inside I love a crispy exterior but I want something a little softer inside our second stop is Dominique and sell bakery chef and sell is a revered pastry chef famous for his creative takes on classic desserts his take on the chocolate chip cookie is a little unconventional so I create the cookie shot a few years ago now when I was invited at South by Southwest to create something for for the show I created the cookie shot and at the time it was just for one day and it got so popular I had to bring you back to New York it was a great cookie shot like some it was cold milk and then it was a warm cookie with chocolate inside so I think it was a really nice place I've never had a chocolate chip cookie with this before I think the cookie shot is simply simple it's something that is easy to understand it's fun and it's a great way to experience Takashi cookie the cookie shot is one of our best sellers and to this way to eat the cookie is actually to serve it warm add the vanilla milk inside have a sip of the milk from the out of the cookie and then take a bite of the cookie so first we use a silicone mold that is hollow in the center and here we have our rectangle of dough so we use Valona chocolate chips in our cookies we'll take this dough and we push it inside the mall all the way down and then we'll close off the top once it comes out of the oven we let them cool then we'll line them with our chocolate in the center to make sure that the sip the milk doesn't seep out and then we pour the milk infused with vanilla in a son of the cookie so the cookie is hot and the milk is ice-cold so fun really fun what you enjoy it have you ever seen a chocolate chip cookie fashioned in this way I've seen a lot of things in my 26 years of life can't say that this is one of the things I've seen so you know genius is this cream right it's pretty freakin genius all right shall we yep let's go to tears oh it's soft yeah when really there's so many different ways that you could go to town on this thing but he suggested taking that sip and then taking a bite of that cookie and it's that perfect bite of like cookie to milk when you take a bite of it after drinking the milk you have that kind of mushy cookie thing that you get with when you dip it and not for a while yeah when the cookie itself it's just a solid delicious cookie it's not just like a fun way of presenting a chocolate chip cookie this is a solid chocolate chip cookie I loved that milk that's like mixed in with that she shouldn't vanilla and the sugar and I just wanted more of that that is my only critique otherwise chocolate chip cookie every time you take a bite of this thing ideal bite [Music] our third stop is levin bakery it's well known for its massive cookies and has won countless awards from near and far levin bakery is most known at this point for our cookies and most known for the chocolate chip walnut is our most popular cookie i think it's a classic cookie that's people love this is my very first time at the baby my daughter has been telling me non-stop that we have to get one of these cookies where the lines are long at the bakery they move really quickly which is great aline is great as long as it's moving it's usually about 15 or 20 minutes after we realized that they were a hit then we started kind of playing with the recipe a little bit more took us about a year to get it exactly how we wanted it but no really big changes we get to people to get the bowl because it's so big and heavy with all that dough and carried over the table we weigh each cookie by hand to be sure that it's six ounces every location makes everything freshly each day and what we don't sell we donate at night every cookie that you get when you come to levin bakery is probably gonna be less than an hour out of the oven they have this cookie recipe too with science and their whole objective is to have this crunchy like crispy exterior and then the inside should be like molten kind of still gooey on the inside okay okay how is it do you like it I'm sure this thing is chock full of chocolate chips okay it's literally maybe like an inch in wet it is um you see the interior hmm what is the reason why this place is so popular this cookie for B checks off all boxes the textures are right the chocolate chips are just literally speckled throughout the cookie and there's like a hint of nuts I seriously just don't see yet how any cookie could compare to this this is gonna be really hard to beat our last stop mama this Cafe slash bakery slash restaurant is home to the nutty chocolate chip cookie the cookies are so popular that my mom makes around 3,000 cookies to last for just two days so for those of you who don't know my mom means mother in French and we named it that as a tribute to our mothers who our biggest influence in the kitchen so my husband and I opened up my mom in October of 2014 we opened it up kind of selfishly we wanted to kind of create a space that embodied wonderful home cooking and a beautiful home inspired environment deliver across the road so this is kind of like my local coffee shop and this the cookies are amazing especially the chocolate chip cookie it's like a really like homemade cookie like it's definitely like freshly made but the chocolate in the cookie is just you know really really good and just melts in your mouth so our nutty chocolate chip cookie is one of our most classic dishes and the best dish that we're known for here at my mom so we really wanted to mix that classic chocolate chip cookie with the buttery salty nutty essence that the French culture offers so we've had quite a bit of notoriety on our nutty chocolate chip cookie and our claim to fame was back in 2017 for the holiday season Oprah put it on one of her favorite things one batch made 3,000 cookies and that normally lasts for two days so this sort is from a small city in as west of France and is closer and more soldiers and the table sort so that it's one of the ingredients who makes the cookie very special next we combined together all of the nuts making sure we're using full salted almonds macadamia nuts and walnuts and next up the chocolate to make sure there's a gooey chocolate piece within each bite we use 61% Guittard chocolate wafers okay so I'm not like that chocolate chip expert here but this already has gained 5,000 points do you know why oh it's a positive okay - mine is a positive because this cookie is mostly chocolate this chocolate chip cookie definitely has more chocolate than the other ones we have tried all right let's dig in wait first I'm breaking oh my god okay like there's barely any room for the actual cookie up in here let's just appreciate first it's like you're melting out okay there's not one a basic bite in this cookie I am big on desserts that aren't just straight sugar I feel like I just that really isn't too sweet no no it's like the nuts and the salt balance it perfectly but it's not like a salty cooking no not at all I'm trying to find like any negative I can he really can I don't know I'm like but this might be a really hard one to decide which was the best and now it's time to decide which cookie is the best of the best so unfortunately Alana our journey to find the best chocolate chip cookie is finally over so many good ones I know it's so many good ones but it's time to pick the best chocolate chip cookie in your city are you ready don't look don't look I already have an inkling of an idea of where you're gonna pick one two three I knew it as much as I am disappointed in your answer I want to know what your reasoning is okay so when I have them on my cookie first thing off the bat it's the chocolate every single bite my mouth was just covered in chocolate the nuts in the cookie just had this wonderful crunch great textural component so for the exact reasons that you just explained I did not pick them all for that specific really it was a delicious cookie don't get me wrong but I picked the vent because it checked off all the marks it's crispy on the outside it's molten and gooey on the inside you're still getting globs of chocolate every time you bite into it it's just there are two iconic cookies in their own way if we're talking about my favorite cookie I'm gonna say my mom but if we're gonna be objective the price is just you know they're about the same and you get more cookie with Lavinia the lines out the door is just another thing that I think like symbolizes New York City and that so if you're talking about the best chocolate chip cookie in New York City it is Levesque I hate being wrong but I guess for this one time I'll have to consider more episodes here I just thought of how many times I am going to be or whatever all right I will say for this the best of the best cookie is liveable the bang I don't know so there you have it Levin the winner they're saying all four of these places were fantastic but I want to know do you agree with me or do you agree with Alana or do you think there's another cookie place we should visit let us know in the comments section below Oh", "sI7E8J1sGvw": "my name is Alena my name is Lorenzo ready there rumble hi I'm penny I've been baking professionally for 14 years now the last time I made chocolate chip cookies was so long ago this past winter for sure but I've actually been cooking for 14 15 years at my retail bakery we made chocolate chip cookies pretty much every single day we start with dry ingredients two and a quarter cups of flour all-purpose flour you really have to be precise with this especially flour eleven ounces of all-purpose flour as a professional pastry chef instead of using volume measurements we weigh all of our ingredients and then we have salt granulated white salt we're using sea salt today sea salt is great because it has some impurity still left behind it's in the impurities where the flavor is next we're gonna do baking soda baking soda make sure it's baking soda and not powder and baking powder we want a really thick cookie and the combination of baking powder and baking soda is gonna help me achieve that so I'm gonna start my wet ingredients we have two sticks of softened butter you will have to put them in the microwave I have two sticks of butter room temperature unsalted so not only do I want to melt my butter I actually want to smoke it and that's one of the ways and I'm gonna add a little bit more of a savoriness to the cookie I'm gonna poke a little hole and insert the tip of the smoker about 40 minutes or so I'll be ready to finish my cookies I'm gonna get the sugars which we have brown sugar and white granulated sugar extract all right a little bit more than teaspoon okay we'll just go with that instead of vanilla extract I'm gonna use an actual fresh vanilla bean now I'm going to get my eggs [Laughter] super super yellow yolks comes from the feed of the chicken butter and that's it it's ready for the chocolate the favorite part two cups of the chocolate chips what just to give it some pizzazz I'm little food I like to add bittersweet chocolate just crack it up in your hands open the package up if you want it a little bit fire that's fine just get your knife be careful please I really like these Pheebs which are a Kovich or chocolate 74% and then bakes off into great shards on chocolate throughout the cookie I have a really big scoop here which is about 4 ounces I like to scoop them if the cookies are all different sizes they're gonna bake at different rates one important step is to freeze the cookie dough for 24 hours before you bake the cookies it allows the flavors to meld and you get a more complex interesting cookie and I also smoked this salt as well to amplify the smoky flavor that would be in the butter so just sprinkle a little bit on top these are ready for the oven now we're going to cook them at 375 degrees for about 9 to 11 minutes I'm gonna throw these in at 375 for 11 to 13 minutes these are gonna bake for about 25 to 28 minutes in a 275 degree oven let's see if we can get this out they went in a little bit longer than they should have and they got so much bigger [Music] all right let's see they've got the chocolate chips they're a little melted okay see it's golden-brown it's actually smells terrific I can see all the chunks of chocolate the bittersweet the semi-sweet chocolate the cookie is really nice and thick and it's very evenly browned all the way around the edges are nice and crispy and the middle is still really soft and there you can see all the shards of the chocolate that's part will go up I make a good cookie that's a good good chocolate chip folks if I do say so myself now that we've seen three different chefs make three different versions of chocolate chip cookies I'm gonna break it down to see what was different between each version in baking science weighing is really important that's important that the recipe is the same this time as it was the last time with Elena's variation there was a little bit messy looks good enough and so we don't have a lot of precision there these are not gonna be even at all not all of the cookies are gonna look the same they still look good Lorenzo did a little bit better it is important to level it off a little bit use your finger use a spoon but we're gonna have some variation because there's things like humidity in the climate where you're baking that are gonna come into play sorry sugars have properties that are called hygroscopic properties they soak up moisture from the air starches can do it as well so depending on the environment you're cooking in if you have a real moist or humid environment or it's even just a rainy day where you're making your cookies it's gonna make a difference oh you don't penny really did a good job put them in the microwave just cut it up a little bit I only do I want to melt my butter I actually want to smoke it each one of our chefs did something really different with the butter Alena use the microwave to melt her butter I'll have to put them in the microwave that's okay but in reality you get some liquid portions and you get some solid portions so it's not gonna be a great way to mix your sugar this is like a semi workout right now but Lorenzo did is he used butter amateur there you go that's a really good idea that's right for the creaming method when you use room-temperature butter you can incorporate lots of air when you add crystal and sugar to the mix that makes for a nice porous light kind of cookie but penny did is different and interesting she used a melted butter so not only does it give that butter flavor but it's going to be evenly distributed throughout the entire batter and you're gonna get a more dense chewy cookie it's really nice and chewy on the inside may be really good with a glass of bourbon next to it some of the chocolates that you get may be in a chocolate chip bag okay there we go might not be the highest quality chocolate do they taste good it's pretty good yes but they're not gonna be tempered they may have emulsifiers added to it they may have other ingredients that won't cause them to melt as easily as some of your coverture chocolate does and that's it things that have been tempered things that have gone through a conching process you're gonna have more of a layering effect you can see all the shards of the chocolate that have made different layers of chocolate and dough when you think of a chocolate chip cookie you're probably thinking first and foremost about the sweetness of the cookie but if you add a little bit of sea salt or any kind of salt to the top of your cookie it's going to really enhance that flavor [Music] there have actually been studies done that show that some of the sensory cells that are associated with sweetness that used to be found just in the gut in mice now are associated with sweetness and enhanced by the presence of sodium and we get sodium from the salts that we eat okey doke you for know you smoking the salt adds another layer of flavor to your chocolate chip cookie to amplify the smoky flavor that would be in the butter this is a really interesting idea thank you and what makes it unique is that the smoky quality and the smoky flavors are going to balance out the bitter quality of the high-end chocolate that she uses and it's also going to balance out the saltiness as well as the sweetness from the rest of the cookie many traditional chocolate chip cookie recipes call for the use of sodium bicarbonate or baking soda make sure it's baking soda when you heat sodium bicarbonate you get something called sodium carbonate which has a little bit of a soapy bitter taste to balance that out we want to add an acidic component if you're using the baking soda a short soda you're going to need an acid and if you're using just baking powder powders different folks the acid is already in there in a chemical form so you're good to go penny let her dough rest for 24 hours and there's a lot going on when we do that one of the important things is we have some of our flavoring components that are in our batter they're hydrated they're mixed well and your flavor profile becomes far more complex make a good cookie when it comes to sugars you have options you can use white sugar which is crystal and sucrose with brown sugar its sucrose but it's also coated with molasses molasses is a byproduct of the sugar making processing you also have things like magnesium and iron and other types of minerals that add a depth of flavor to the brown sugar that you won't have with the white sugar the brown sugar also have this capacity to hold on to water and so you're gonna have this moist chewy more dense kind of cookie when you have the brown sugar so there's a whole lot going on chemically with chocolate chip cookies it's all about knowing the ratios and ingredients that you want to use in your recipe and knowing how they work with the other ingredients that are there that are going to make your cookie have the different types of properties that you're looking for but regardless of all of that everybody's always gonna love chocolate chip cookies [Music]", "NYH1Z7TUSEI": "people have been begging me to remake the worldliness chocolate chip cookies from levan bakery row I don't need to go all the way to New York to try them before I did that logically obviously I'm like that let's go is it bad if I've never had one before well we're going now so sorry it's never too late okay it's never too much it's fine eleven years ago now that I have my first love okay this is a New York staple at this point I don't know what kind of cookie you're into but this is a basically a ball of warm cookie dough with a vaguely crispy exterior it thick bastard this is a thinking man's cookie yes I like this car doesn't go 0-60 that fast but the people will literally ride either the line or a quarter into your lane and everybody's kind of they're like that's fine and I'm like this isn't this is not what I change the expect okay we're here in the beautiful Upper West Side at the original Levin cookie bakery Levin bakery I keep telling cookie Baker one of each cookie place yeah pay dirt [Music] all right let's dig into one of these mush look at the bottom looks great don't stick my thumb off Wow oh wow it's not exactly how I described it good no no it's just like it's just a lot better than I thought blowing my mind how good this is also having this like thicker texture is like you maintain sort of dewy liquidy chocolate that won't happen with it normally they probably go pretty light on the baking soda baking powder richness maybe more egg yolks maybe I don't know I really don't know it's kind of a well guarded secret so you're gonna try to recreate this at home I think I can do it so everybody in the world can experience this it's your turn to well that was fun now we're back in town and I think we're ready to take on this challenge or even get started just want to say a quick thank you to Benjamin Babbage Andrew thank you we appreciate you we love you and we kiss you and one more thing I have a collab video that went up on Babbage's channel there will be a link in the description but you should go click that and watch it it's bread you know you like that all right so not to flex but I actually got this right on the first try so I'm flexing a couple of important notes here the chocolate that you're using you want it to be relatively dark like 60 to 70% cacao so make sure that that's on the board no milk chocolate the second thing that you want is you want to use cake flour no all-purpose flour I don't want to hear substitutions please use cake flour you know how I feel about that cake so you gonna start off with one and a quarter cup for 280 grams of unsalted butter bring it to a melt with wait no you know what I mean so that's it aside and let it cool a little bit then rough chop one pound or 450 grams of dark chocolate but like a lot like this sort of some randomized pieces some big some small some tiny you know yeah in a medium-sized bowl combine one and a half cups our 230 grams of cake flour and two cups or 275 grams of all-purpose flour why don't have teaspoons are 5 grams of kosher salt and 2 teaspoons or 8 grams of cornstarch and a half a teaspoon or 6 grams of baking soda give that some whiskey whiskey to stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and yes you can do this by hand in a regular bowl with a whisk don't worry AB one on 1/4 cup or 285 grams of brown sugar light brown sugar and half a cup of 115 grams of white granulated sugar begin whisking down on medium speed and then slowly stream in your butter what's that all together until it looks nice and creamy like this then to that one egg at a time you're gonna add two eggs followed by three egg yolks making sure to incorporate them in between each egg of course and once you've got a nice smooth homogeneous little thing going on here switch to the peddle attachment and then mix in your flour mixture don't forget to spill a bunch of flour all over the place when you're pouring into your mixer because for some reason mixtures are built this way in such a way that you always spill flour I don't know I'm blaming the mixer instead of myself that's just how it goes what's your dough is nice too smooth go ahead and fold in two cups are 165 grams of rough chopped walnuts I'd recommend toasting your walnuts by the way and your chopped chocolate and also uh maybe don't do this in a machine because it's a little bit rough on your machine soda and there you go there's your nice little cookie dough now number one tip with these if you want them to be tall you need to chill these so wrap them up and put them in your refrigerator for at least 45 minutes the longer you chill them the taller they'll be I mean you can only give them so cold but you see items like sofas Ward and you've got your chili boy right now we need to talk about scooping scooping is very very important here upon further research I found on their website that their cookies typically average around 6 ounces in size so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna make a six ounce cookie ball and you want these balls to be tall I know this sounds weird but I found that a Vollrath four round stainless steel Disher works really well if you stuff it in there really nicely oven like the description for that if you want to use that if you don't have a scale whatever do what you want to do but get nice balls okay then just arrange them onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper I had six here I'd recommend doing four on each tray just to have extra room if you want these to be extra tall I would recommend refrigerating them for 25 more minutes I did not and you will see the minor consequences in a bit next you're gonna place them into an oven set to 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 220 Celsius yes very hot for 10 to 13 minutes or until lightly browned on the outside you want the inside to be a little bit underdone that's the goal here and so here they are here's a little side-by-side just for comparison I think we did pretty good here guys you know considering we got this on the first try and they're pretty darn close let's say they're about 85 to 90 percent of the way there in terms of similarity but do you want to know what it is a hundred percent of the way there [Music] or guys and that is it so I feel pretty good about this I don't think that they were perfect I think they could have been a little bit taller and I think if you wanted them taller you just need to chill the dome much longer I only shelled mine for about 30 or 45 minutes again thank you so much to Andrew up way cave inching with babish everybody calls him babish yeah Bradley own he calls him Bobby hey Bradley only if you're watching cuz kiss love you hit me up that was a ton of fun Babbitt hello that or should I have been talking for a while I've hinted at it a bunch everybody kind of already figured it out pretty early on so thanks for that I'm also doing a collaboration on his channel there will be a bread video over there like I said earlier be sure to go check that out there will be a link in the description but with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time also don't forget to subscribe to babish too these are the freaking description bro go go get that that DEP button

(upbeat theme music) Good Mythical Morning. - Big news, our studio is frozen. And our first-ever live tour special is available now for pre-order\non iTunes and Amazon, and it's gonna hit YouTube\nand most cable TV providers on Saturday, December 22nd. So, this is our stage show,\nplus a never-before-seen, up-close-and-personal mini-doc\nof our creative process and our travels on tour. It's called Rhett and\nLink's Tour of Mythicality: Live in Los Angeles, pre-order it now. - Yes, now my favorite food is peanut butter on a spoon buried deep in a glass of chocolate milk. Rhett's favorite food is\nwhatever he's currently eating. - Can't argue witH that.\n- But the only person who matters this month is Santa Claus. And his favorite food is cookies. - Yes, and he works so\nhard, the least we can do is give the man the best\ncookies on the market. It's time for, \u266a I did it all for the cookie \u266a \u266a Come on, the cookie, come on \u266a \u266a So you can take that cookie\nand rank it one to 10 \u266a \u266a Rank it one to 10, rank it one to 10 \u266a - Here's how it works,\nwe're gonna blindly taste six rounds of store-bought\nchocolate chip cookies and then rank them on a scale of one to\n- 10. - We're gonna take the\naverage of our two scores to determine the best one.\n- Best one. Alright, we're also gonna be\nplaying against each other to see who can accurately\nguess the cookie by brand. And whoever guesses the\nmost brands correctly will become the Captain of Cookies. The cookies that we're\ngonna be tasting are Keebler,\n- Pepperidge Farm, - Chips Ahoy!,\n- Famous Amos, - Mrs. Field's,\n- And Kroger ChipMates, a popular generic brand of cookie. - Alright, let's chocolate them chips. (rock music)\n- Round one. - As you can see, we can't. - And all of our chocolate\nchip cookies will be being brought to us on the patent-pending Santa's Sweet Sleigh of Surprise. - Bring in the first one, Santa, Rudolph, run, run. I'm smelling cookie. - Mmm, a sleigh of cookies. - I'm eating like napkin. Oh wow, that's a tall cookie. Oh, I got, I had two in my mouth. - I'm gonna try to talk\nwith a cookie in my mouth, 'cause I can't use my hands. I don't know what why\nwe can't use our hands. - Well, you don't wanna\nhave finger information. - Finger information.\n- Only mouth information. It's a crunchy cookie. - It's a crunchy cookie.\n- It's not too crunchy. - Well, now you're not a fan of a crunchy cookie, you\ncomplain about how dry it is all the time, but I think that's gonna happen over and over again. - I mean, I like cookie dough. If I had my way, you\nwouldn't cook a cookie ever. You would just tub it up and consume it. That's not a bad-tasting cookie, though. And I'm trying to factor in girth. - You always gotta factor in girth. - 'Cause some, you know,\nsome are smaller than others. - That was a good mouth width. - This is tough, I have a\nguess, but I feel like I'm, - Well, we gotta rank 'em first. - Flying blind, oh okay. - It's a good cookie,\nI like a crispy cookie, I like a soft cookie, I like\nin-between, you know me. That's a pretty solid cookie, not great, not horrible,\nI'm gonna say seven. - Six for me. - [Stevie] Ready to guess? - Yep.\n- Three, two, one. - Chips Ahoy.\n- Famous Amos. - Chips Ahoy, that's way\ntoo big to be a Chips Ahoy. - Really?\n- Yeah. - When was the last time\nyou had a Chips Ahoy? - Stay out of my business. (rock music)\n- Round two. - It's not that I don't\nlike a crunchy cookie, I just prefer to soften it\nin milk before eating it. - I popped that one right in my mouth. - Much smaller cookie. It has a signature flavor. It's very, hold on, there's\na hair in mine, what is that? - There's not a hair in mine. Maybe that's not intentional. - It's a Keebler elf hair, I bet. - I could see the logic in that. That's a better cookie In my mind, that's a better\ncookie, still crispy. - It's got, the chocolate\ndoesn't overwhelm, and so the cookie part\nactually makes it taste better. I agree, I'm giving this one a seven. - I'm going up, but not\ntoo far, to an eight. - Yeah, it's a smaller\ncookie, but it's taller than I would have expected, hmm, man. - Smaller but taller. - [Stevie] Ready? - Alright.\n- Three, two, one. - Chips Ahoy. - Kroger. I think this is a generic Kroger. - I think I'm gonna say\nChips Ahoy every time. - You go for it, I'd\nlove for you to do that. - I'm gonna get one right this time. (rock music)\n- Round three. - What I'm learning is that, I'm not good at identifying cookies. I need to eat more chocolate chip cookies. - Maybe they both were Chips Ahoy. See, this is a bigger cookie. - These are oriented differently. I'm gonna have to use my tongue. - It did all fit in my mouth, though. (Link mumbles over cookie) What's happening? (Rhett mumbles over cookie) This is not a good tasting cookie. - You don't like it?\n- Nuh uh. I'm down in like three territory. - Really?\n- Mmhmm. It's a bigger cookie, so I\ndon't think it's generic, but it tastes like generic, what I would think\ngeneric would taste like. - I can taste something in the consistency that reminds me of something else. - I don't like this cookie, but I am gonna be a little more generous. It started to taste better,\nI'm gonna give it a four. - It has a really good aftertaste. - Yeah, it got a little better for me. - Think about the way it tastes right now. - It's gone. - I'm gonna say a seven, I\ndon't mind this cookie at all. - Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - We differ, man. - Ready for the guess?\n- Yeah, I think I've got a strong guess on this one. - It's a big one. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Pepperidge Farm.\n- Pepperidge Farm. - Yeah, I feel good about\nthat, because the packaging of a Pepperidge, - I know what\n- Pepperidge packing. - The farm looks like, but not the cookie. (rock music)\n- Round four. - I think that the deal\nis the reason I don't mind a crispy cookie is because I bring the moisture to the experience. You know what I'm saying,\nthat's what spit's for. - Oh gosh. - I mean, it's crispy and then it's-- - Well if my spit was milk,\nI'd be with you, but it's not. I've tried, trust me. - Oh, hold on, totally different flavor pro-, smell profile. - Well, it's more than that, it's soft. Forget your spit, 'cause this one is soft. (Rhett grunts) - Me having trouble. - What's happenin', dude? You going full Cookie Monster over there? - Me having trouble getting to this one. - Don't ever go full Cookie Monster. Now listen, this is my jam 'cause this is a chewy cookie, and I love chewy cookies. In fact, I prefer Chewy\nChips Ahoy, which are weird. They even taste weird, and I don't care, because I love the consistency so much. - Hold on, but you cannot deny the fact, especially after having tasted some of those other ones, they\nuse a weird chemical, man. They use a weird chemical\nto get it to stay soft. - You're right.\n- You should always be suspicious of\nsomething that stays soft. - My world is a little\nshook, because I love the consistency, but, - It does not taste good, man. - I have to be honest. I never thought I would say this, - Three. It doesn't taste good. - It doesn't taste good. - It tastes like an\nexperiment that went wrong. - Yeah, I'm glad I usually don't eat these with a blindfold on. - Bring the moisture yourself, that's what should on the side of every chocolate chip bag. - I can't believe this, but\nI'm gonna give it a four. - Ha ha, yes! - And I know what this is. - You've seen the light, Neal! - [Stevie] Okay, three, two, one. - Keebler.\n- Soft Batch, Soft Batch from Keebler. - Yeah, bro.\n- My whole childhood I was eating these things. - I know about dems. - The elves knew me personally. - I've avoided 'em for years. - [Stevie] Link, I gotta say,\nyou're coming in a second last in these past two episodes, rounds. - Oh, my guess.\n- We gotta, it's on the one and then we guess. - You're copying me,\nthat's what's happening. - No, I don't care what he says. I'm not listening to him.\nOh really? (rock music)\n- Round five. - Now I know my answers have been delayed, and they were the same as\nyours, but I'm not cheating. - Suspicious.\n- I'm just slow at giving answers, but\nI'm locked in in my brain. - Well, she's giving you\nthree seconds to say it. - Give me five next time.\n- You know what, give him five, give him\nfive seconds, Stevie. - Ooh, uh oh, this is also a soft cookie. - Uh oh. - What is this soft cookie? - Somebody else has a soft cookie. Now I know that Chips\nAhoy has a soft batch. But I think that they went with what was the best-selling ones from each brand, that was my understanding. And there's no way that\nsoft batch outsells the regular Chips Ahoy. - Well, let's rate how good\nwe think this cookie is. - This is better. - I don't,\n- Distinctly better than the previous soft cookie. Now, it's still not great. I'm gonna give it a five. I'm gonna go with a solid\nfive, 'cause it's not in the crispiness territory. It has a little chemical-y taste to it, but not as bad as the last one. - You're right, I agree wholeheartedly, but I'm not cheating. I'm gonna give it a\nsix, 'cause I kinda like all of those things, even\nthe slightly chemical-y. - You like the chemicals.\n- Yeah. - You ready?\n- Yeah - [Stevie] Five, four, three, two, one. - Chips Ahoy. - Keebler. - Oh, you went with, you\ndoubled up on the Soft Batch? - Yeah, yeah, I know\nKeebler makes a Soft Batch, I don't think they put\nsoft batch Chips Ahoy in this mix, so I'm\njust playing strategies. - Nope, nope, nope, got him. (rock music)\n- Round six. - Okay, please deliver the\nfinal cookie of Christmas. Wow, we got caroled. We got cookie caroled. - Wow, whoa. Oh, there's a cookie. - That's a big cookie down here. - Oh man. - This is the biggest cookie. - I don't even need to finish that one to know what it is, hello. - That's a cakey cookie.\n- Mmhmm. Is there more, oh, hey. - Hold on, this is a tasty cookie. - That's a good cookie. - Wow. - It's got crispiness and softness. - I mean, I'm not gonna\nsay it's a perfect cookie, but I'm gonna give it a strong eight. - I'm gonna give it a nine, friend. - Alright friend. - [Stevie] You want\nyour five or your three? - Probably five. - [Stevie] Five, four, three, two, one. - Mrs. Field's.\n- Famous Amos. You said Mrs. Field's, Famous Amos, man. - Yeah man, Mrs. Field's.\n- That's a big ol' cookie. - Famous, he ain't that\nfamous with me, I guess. - [Stevie] Alright, you\ncan remove your blindfolds. So the runner-up for best\ncookie goes to Famous Amos, and your favorite cookie was Mrs.Field's. - [Link] Ha, that means\nI got the last one right. - [Stevie] Rhett, you have two correct. - Oh, okay, that's not great. - [Stevie] And Link, you have one correct. - What? What? He only got the last one?\n- I only got Mrs. Field's? - [Stevie] Correct. - And here, you're the Cookie Captain. It's kinda sideways, man. Now these Chips Ahoy,\nwe didn't even taste. Was that even in the batch? - [Stevie] Chips Ahoy, we\ncan go over it in More. - Alright, we're gonna go over to More, but for now we congratulate Mrs. Field's, you got a dang good cookie. - And me, the Captain of Cookies. - Thank you for liking,\ncommenting, and subscribing. - You know what time it is. - Hi, I'm Chris.\n- And I'm Tammy, and we're at the Audobon\nInsectarium in New Orleans. - And we're about to eat cricket cookies. - And it's time to spin.\n- And it's time to spin the Wheel of Mythicality.\n- The Wheel of Mythicality. - That's the spirit. - Yes, click the top\nlink to watch us find out which nut milk is the\nbest for cookie dipping in Good Mythical More. - And to find out where the Wheel of Mythicality's gonna land. - [Rhett] The Tour of\nMythicality will continue in the comfort of your own home.

while that melts sift together two and a quarter cups of bread flour with a teaspoon each of salt and baking soda why well the water from the melted butter will combine during agitation with the higher protein of the bread flour therefore producing gluten which is Julian also since bread flour can absorb much more liquid than all-purpose flour more moisture will stay in the cool game add the now melted butter to the mixing bowl and add a quarter cup of white sugar and a quarter cup of brown sugar plus a whole cup of brown sugar I should mention that the darker the sugar you use the chewier the cookies are going to be and now the wet works up to this point we've strictly been to bed cookies but we're now we're gonna make a change I'm gonna go with one whole egg let that work its way in and one egg yolk why the change I'll take this one it's got to do with egg whites you see egg whites dry out baked goods that's kind of what they do and a chewy cookie has got to be more so not only are we gonna get rid of one egg white we're actually gonna add an ounce two tablespoons of milk and of course our teaspoon and a half of vanilla as soon as that is integrated we can go with the dry stuff add this nice and slow scraping down the bowl as you go [Applause] now as soon as your batter comes together time to go with the two cups of chips now remember you got to give these little guys room to grow I never put more than six on a pan at one time how long are they gonna take well 13 to 15 minutes depending on your oven but I always start checking in on them after about 5 minutes the reason browning depending on your oven the back ones may start to brown before the front ones and you may have to rotate the pans a couple of times oh and remember the more pans you put in the longer the cook time you", "hCzVqaFMlIw": "soft and chewy thin and crisp or cakey how do you like your chocolate chip cookie I've actually received countless questions and comments on the chocolate chip cookie and I want to show you how to make the perfect chocolate chip cookie for you and there are two determining factors in the overall texture and look of the cookie two special ingredients for soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies it's two sticks of butter but if you want it to be thinner or if you want it to be cakey er you're gonna have to adjust the ratio of the recipe for a thin and crisp cookie it's two and a half sticks and for a cakey cookie it's one in three quarter sticks I'm gonna put the two sticks into the KitchenAid mixer here and make sure using unsalted butter when you're baking you always want to be able to adjust the salt on your own I'm going to add the sugar now and sugar is the other ingredient that really affects the overall texture and look of the cookie so I'm making soft and chewy cookies here and that is one cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of granulated sugar the greater quantity of brown sugar adds chewiness to the cookie because it has molasses in it for something that's thin and crisp cookie you want a higher ratio of granulated sugar so we have a 1 and a quarter of a cup of granulated sugar here too 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar and for a cakey cookie you need to reduce the overall sugar in general and we have 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar and 1/4 of a cup of brown sugar so I'm gonna cream together the butter and the sugar and that's going to incorporate air into the batter and cleaning is a very important step here because what it does it dissolves the sugar into the butter and it also incorporates air which will help to leaven your cookie so the butter and sugar is light and fluffy and to this I'm going to add two eggs now the rest of the ingredients for this chocolate-chip cookie are the same regardless if you're making soft and chewy thin and crisp or cakey so two eggs one at a time you want to add them into your mixture your butter and sugar mixture here two teaspoons of the best quality vanilla extract and I'm gonna eyeball it here and now I'm gonna add the dry ingredients two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and baking soda is what helps cookies cakes pancakes spread baking powder puffs so think of it that way soda spreads powder puffs so that's a half teaspoon and one teaspoon of coarse salt using kosher salt here and whisk that together and you really want to make sure you take your time here and whisk the ingredients together you don't want any pockets of leavener in your flour mixture make sure it's evenly distributed and then this goes into your mixer and I like to just dump it in all at once so mix on slow speed until it's just combined add two cups of the best quality semi-sweet chocolate and just mix this until it's just incorporated don't go any further than that otherwise you're gonna toughen your cookie you're gonna develop gluten that's in the flour you're gonna end up with a tough cookie so now for scooping and baking about a tablespoon of cookie dough batter two inches apart on a parchment lined baking sheet and I like to use these ice cream scoops for perfectly portioning out cookies you get really nice rounded sides so these go into a 350 degree oven and depending on the variation whether it's chewy thin and crisp or cakey it will take anywhere from 8 to 15 minutes so there you have it the trick to getting the perfect chocolate chip cookie just the way you like it if you have any kitchen conundrums if you have any baking conundrums write in the comment section below or use the hashtag kitchen

We're bumping up this basic biscuit from Plain  Jane to premium. Let's get down to basics. \u266a Okay, so one of the easiest ways to upgrade your cookies instantly is to brown your butter. We've got one cup of high-quality, unsalted butter here that we're heating over a medium heat until we start to see the milk fats separate and turn a light, toasty golden-brown. You want to take it off the heat at the very second that you start seeing those milk solids turn brown. You're going to burn some butter, don't worry about it, don't beat yourself up, just, when you do get a good batch go ahead and refrigerate it for at least an hour or until completely re-solidified. We're now going to add the cold butter to the bowl of a stand-mixer. If you don't have a stand-mixer, just let the butter soften up a little bit, but ideally we want to use cold butter. To that we're going to add half a cup of plain old white sugar, and 1 and one half cups of brown sugar. You can go light or dark, depending on how molasses-ey you like your cookies. I'm going dark. From here it's kind of the regular cookie procedure, we are creaming together the butter and sugars. Getting those guys whipped together at medium speed for three to four minutes, or until thoroughly combined, and then we're going to pause to crack two cold eggs into the bowl, and mix to combine. Once we've got that all good and homogeneous, we're going to shift our attention to the drier side of things. The dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, we are whisking together about 11 and a half ounces of all purpose flour. And a solid tablespoon of kosher salt, this might seem like a lot, but hey, sweet and salty. Ever heard of it? A half teaspoon of baking soda, and then my secret little ingredient, you can feel free to omit this, but about three quarters of a teaspoon of cinnamon. I think this adds a nice, subtle warmth to all the butter and chocolate, and it doesn't really taste cinnamon-y. Give it a shot, I think you'll like it. We are whisking those together until thoroughly combined. Before adding about half of the mixture to our wet ingredients. We're doing this in batches, because just like pancakes, we don't really want to over-mix the cookie dough once we've introduced flour. Because that will result in gluten development, which will result in a tough cookie. Ha ha... ah. Once that's combined we're going to add the remaining flour mixture and your desired mix-ins. I'm just starting with high-quality chocolate chips, and adding the nuts later to half the batch for those non-nut folks out there. J. Kenji Lopez-Alt also has an awesome technique where instead of using chocolate chips, you chop up a whole block of chocolate, thereby giving you a whole bunch of different sizes and textures. Now we're going to stop mixing this guy as soon as it comes together, and, again, optionally, cover and refrigerate for up to three days. Even as little as an hour in the fridge can make a noticeable difference in texture and colour. But a few days will actually give you more pronounced flavour. Now as you can see, I've separated half the cookie dough, and toasted some freshly-chopped walnuts that I have allowed to cool, and I'm going to mix those in to the nut half of the cookie dough. Now, my last little cookie trick is inspired by Levain Bakery here in New York, Basically, you grab a handfull of your dough, roll it into a ball, and then tear it open, thus creating a whole bunch of craggly cracks and crevices, which gives you a more rustic-looking cookie. And because we used butter as opposed to shortening, and because we kept everything cold these guys are not going to lose much of their height or definition. As we bake them at 350 degrees fahrenheit, from 12-17 minutes depending on how big you've made them. Now again, this is going to come down to preference. I like my cookies sort of almost like cookie dough in the centre, I like them really raw. So these guys are going to deflate and they're going to stay chewy and gooey long into the forseeable future. I'm also going to hit them with a little bit of flaky sea salt. Now, of course, taste the cookie first to make sure you didn't oversalt it beforehand, but if it could use a little bit of an extra hit of crunchy salty flakes, go for it. Next up we've got our nutters, make sure that you're keeping everything separate and being careful to not share any cooking surfaces or cooling surfaces with the non-nut cookies, in fact, bake all the nut cookies second, if you're concerned about anyone's nut allergies. So that's how you make Grandma Babish's down home, country style brown butter chocolate chip cookies. And let me show you why we specifically engineered these to retain their height, so we keep a nice, gooey centre. Doesn't get much better than that. Now, I hope you guys try this recipe yourselves and go ahead and experiment, try using shortening instead of butter, and see how it changes the texture and final appearance of the cookie. Try chilled versus un-chilled ingredients, try aging cookie dough versus un-aged cookie dough, after all, can you really have too many cookies? I mean, yeah, of course you can. So... enjoy responsibly. And bring a plate over to your neighbours'. Who knows, maybe you guys will start dating, and maybe that's how you meet your future spouse. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're welcome, and I'll see you at the bachelor party.", "YEZPxhMneOc": "- Hi everyone, it's Natasha\nof NatashasKitchen.com and today we are making our\nfavorite chocolate chip cookies. These are big, soft, and loaded with melt-y morsels of chocolate. These cookies stay soft for days. In a large mixing bowl,\ncombine two sticks, or one cup, of softened, unsalted butter with one cup of light brown sugar and half a cup of granulated sugar. Cream those together on\nmedium-high speed until smooth. (cheerful EDM music) You'll need two room temperature eggs. Add them one at a time, beating\nwell with each addition. Now mix in two teaspoons\nof vanilla extract. In a separate small mixing bowl, combine three cups of all-purpose flour, two teaspoons of baking powder, and a half a teaspoon of salt. Whisk that together, then add it to the creamed mixture in thirds. Adding it in thirds makes\nit much easier to blend. For the cookies to rise properly, make sure to measure your flour correctly by spooning it into the measuring cup and scraping off the top. And last but not least, add two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and fold those into the batter\njust until well combined. This cookie dough is\nthe perfect consistency. Now you can roll your\ncookie dough balls by hand, but I find it easier to use a trigger-release ice cream scoop. The cookies all end up the same size and they bake up more evenly. I also like to stud the\ntops of the cookie balls with a few extra chocolate\nchips for a prettier cookie. This recipe makes 21 large cookies. Arrange them on two\nparchment lined cookie sheets and bake one sheet at a time. You can freeze or refrigerate the second batch for another day and I will leave instructions\nfor that in the recipe post. Bake in the center of a pre-heated oven at 350\u02daF\nfor about 13 to 15 minutes or until the edges are\njust turning golden. The tops should still\nlook a little under baked when you pull them out of the oven. (chuckles) Cookies are ready. Okay and you wanna let these\nrest on the baking sheet for about five minutes once\nthey come out of the oven because they're super soft and they'll be hard to transfer. You don't want them to break unless it's in your mouth. (giggling) Okay. Goofy jokes aside, I'm\nready for this taste test. Okay, so transfer those to a baking rack and let them cook a little bit but I like to eat them\nwhile they're still warm and that chocolate is melt-y and gooey. Ooh! (giggling) Okay, so we're gonna jump\nright into this taste test. Got my milk here. You definitely want to be ready with that. Okay, here we go. Let's pick a big fluffy one. That's pretty much all of them. (giggling) Okay, this one looks promising. And take a look inside. Look at this. It is so soft. These are fully baked but you still have the amazing cookie dough consistency inside and they are so, so chocolate-y. (giggling) Yum! Wow, okay, here we go. Here we go, here we go. Mm. Mm, mm, mm. Mm. This just made my day. (laughing) And a little swig of milk. Perfect. (giggling) These have the perfect balance\nof sweetness and chocolate. They're wonderful and so moist and gooey and soft and fluffy and tall. Look at this. Mm. (giggling) My kids go wild for these. I haven't told them that\nthese are out of the oven yet because they're just gonna fly right off of this cutting board. So good and I love that you\ndon't have to wait for these. There's no resting. There's no refrigerating, although you can if you want to. I like to make half the batch now and leave the other half of the batch for tomorrow or the next day. So good. I hope this becomes a new\nfavorite recipe for you. Try it and you'll probably never look for another chocolate\nchip cookie recipe again.

took a few weeks off to refresh recharge the batteries but i'm feeling great and i figured we'd come back strong as ever with another epic food showdown i'm gonna be pinning the chocolate chip cookie recipes of rosanna pansino chef john from food wishes joshua weissman and binging with babish up against each other a lot of you guys sometimes ask me why i feel the need to do these big mega verses episodes when i have said in the past how stressful they can be and honestly it's because i go away for a few weeks and claims like this start getting thrown around these are the best chocolate chip cookies in the entire world and not only does this produce literally the perfect chocolate chip cookie but have no fear because the mythbuster of murky recipes the muckraker of musty foods is back once again so let's get right into this one you may be asking yourself how different can chocolate chip cookies possibly be and to that i'd say between unsalted salted and brown butters chopped chocolate chocolate chips dark chocolate like you'd be surprised but before we can explore any of those possibilities i wanted to give a huge shout out to my friends over at curiositystream over my break i was looking for something new to watch and curiosity stream filled that void perfectly from podcasts and documentaries to informational tv and feature series curiosity stream is your one stop shop for any topic ranging from space exploration to food to adventure and history if you're already an amazon prime video user curiosity stream is an easy extension it's available to watch worldwide on any screen and right now you can click the link in the top line of the description and get 40 off a year's subscription and thank you so much to curiositystream for sponsoring today's video as far as our cookies go rosanna panstino this is your first time on the channel and you are up first today i grabbed some all-purpose flour and kosher salt baking soda and granulated sugar two steaks of salted butter light brown sugar a couple eggs some semi-sweet chocolate chips reprimand any runaway eggs and some vanilla extract i figured this would be a really good starting point because this recipe is as basic as you can get both the dough and her finished cookies look exactly like a store-bought or bakery cookie in the best way possible and they come together super easily as well you're going to combine all of your dry ingredients into one bowl and set it aside we're gonna get super comfortable with this process throughout the day i think and then cream together both your sugars and super soft room temperature salted butter the salted butter is probably the only quirk of this recipe most cookie recipes call for unsalted butter but if you're somebody like babish who throws a tablespoon of salt back in the recipe anyway it's kind of gratuitous to use on salted butter this is also the only recipe that doesn't get chilled in the fridge for a while so if you're in a pinch and you need cookies asap this is probably the recipe for you regardless of outcome you want your dough mounds to be about two tablespoons each and a couple inches apart so they don't run together in the oven and you're gonna bake these off at 375 degrees for eight or nine minutes immediately i love how these look how some edges are a little bit more brown there's some pale spots on the top that should bode pretty well for the texture and finally now we can start today's cookie inhalation these are just as classic as you can possibly get from the smell the look of them they look so good i haven't mentioned this but unless otherwise noted i'm gonna let them all cool for like 10 to 15 minutes i feel like that's a good uh median time they're still super soft and delicate in the middle but they're like super crispy and perfect around the outside this is a cookie that you can never go wrong with is it the best cookie i've ever eaten no but it's super quick and easy and delicious and it's a great starting point up second today we've got the legendary chef john from food wishes i grabbed some all-purpose flour and kosher salt baking soda and granulated sugar semi-sweet chocolate chips some decent quality grass-fed butter 1 egg vanilla extract some milk and light brown sugar once again this is a pretty simple recipe it does take a little bit longer to whip up because it's all done by hand there's no electric mixer in sight no sifting it's a whisk a rubber spatula and some forearm strength and that's pretty much it yes it might take a few minutes longer and feel like more work but you're gonna have a lot less to clean later so maybe it evens out now the main ingredient based differences between these first two is obviously the butter and also this recipe gets a few tablespoons of milk how that's gonna affect the final texture of flavor or moisture i don't know because as you will see these cookies end up being super small and thin and crispy looking they do have to rest in the fridge for a minimum of two hours just in a ziploc bag side note if you're just doing that to have the dough firm up and make it easier to work with it's kind of pointless to leave it longer than an hour or two it's only gonna get so cold you know if you're developing flavors that's one thing but for firmness and like workability an hour or two is fine so these guys are going to be half the mass of the last ones we're going for one tablespoon each they're gonna bake at 375 for a little bit longer about 12 minutes and as you probably guessed these yielded a much more thin crispy uh dark colored cookie how they will stack up against all our other options let's find out this might just be in my head but oh [ __ ] i feel like you smell a lot more intensely like in the house and just having them under my nose i feel like there's just uh stronger smelling look how like paper thin they are too they look good though like the perfect little three bite cookie i'm just now realizing how hard this is gonna be i think it might just come down to a preference thing uh i like mine almost equal parts crispy to chewy to soft this is obviously a very high ratio of uh crunchy and they're not even as thin as chef john's were so his were probably even crunchier of course it's delicious i'd be happy eating this at any point but for me today it's gonna have to go into second third on the checklist is mr joshua weissman a recent regular on the channel who always comes through with some pretty great stuff you're gonna need some all-purpose flour and cake flour granulated sugar and corn starch a pound of dark chocolate bars and baking soda kosher salt light brown sugar five eggs vanilla extract and lots of unsalted butter now i acknowledge that this is textbook first world problems but recently i've started hating chopping chocolate i feel like no matter what you do it just flies everywhere you can't scrape it back with your hand because the heat from your hand melts the little shards so fast it stains up your cutting board you gotta wash it or else it'll get on everything else you use it's just kind of annoying and i sound like an entitled brat so i'm going to stop complaining now if you haven't already noticed i almost purposely constructed this video so that the super classic and traditional recipe went first and then with every subsequent recipe we get a little bit funkier and weirder for this one we're obviously using a ton of super dark chocolate chopped up we are using almost equal parts uh cake flour to all-purpose flour that should make a much more tender cookie and as you know already the dry stuff gets thoroughly mixed together and tossed to the side and as for the wet stuff we're using two whole eggs three egg yolks a ton of light brown sugar and then also a ton of melted butter i just realized it's kind of funny i'm putting joshua and babish up against each other in this one even though in joshua's video they're just hanging out eating some cookies i assure you guys no hard feelings i'm sure neither one of them watch or care about my videos anyway but just in case but this whole recipe comes together in your stand mixer you can add your flour a little bit at a time as the mixer is running and then just fold in your chocolate chunks so it's not so rough on the uh the motor this version is gonna get covered up and popped in the fridge as well for about 45 minutes until it's almost all the way chilled through and this is the part that i've been a little worried to approach joshua claims that you want your cookies to be six ounces each a huge like meatball looking mound that's almost a half pound cookie so these are going to be behemoth sized the balls do get popped back in the fridge for about 25 minutes so they won't spread so much but i was still scared so i only put three on my cookie sheet and baked them at 425 degrees for about 12 minutes and yeah as expected these are enormous approximately four times the size of our previous two cookies but they should taste good so let's give them a shot if you haven't yet grasped the scale of how big this is it barely fits on the damn plate but also it's like bigger than my face i just noticed this now but look how like magical and swirly the bottom looks that's pretty cool let's see if we can get one of those cool like chocolate pole breaks kind of [Music] yeah bit of a mess as expected but this is damn good i don't know how different the textural ratios would be if it was like shrunk down to a actual cookie size but honestly it's pretty perfect right now the outside is super crisp the very middle is like slightly underdone which some of you might say is gross i don't really care i kind of love that and then the uh the very middle the mantle if you will is like all the way cooked through but super chewy my stomach is gonna be hating me later but i do not care this is so good last but certainly not least today is binging with babish's chocolate chip cookies and for his i grabbed my depleting reserve of all-purpose flour and cinnamon kosher salt and granulated sugar dark chocolate chips unsalted butter baking soda 2 eggs and dark brown sugar admittedly this recipe is the reason i thought about doing this video at all a couple weeks ago i was binging babish videos and when i saw this and how it has brown butter dark chocolate chips cinnamon and dark brown sugar i wanted to do it immediately but i waited for today if you've never tried brown butter before i highly recommend you try to make some for your next cookie recipe it's one of my all-time favorite smells it's super easy to do once you kind of got the feel of it just keep an eye on those milk solids on the bottom of the pan the second they start to turn brown dump them out and stick that mix in the fridge to completely re-solidify the dry ingredients are pretty standard in this one with the exception of the cinnamon which i kind of love the idea of you know if it doesn't come through super strongly i can imagine it being just that perfect flavor enhancer and even if it does come through a lot i mean who doesn't like cinnamon so this should make for a pretty delicious cookie once again we are whipping out the stand mixer to whip together that completely hardened brown butter our white sugar and the dark brown sugar i love the fact that he uses dark brown too if you didn't already know brown sugar is literally just granulated sugar with the addition of molasses the light versus dark brown sugars is just how much molasses they added i don't know if this is just me but i kind of love learning things that seem so simple and obvious that i never really thought of throughout life for example you can make brown sugar if you have molasses and granulated sugar at home and you can also make powdered sugar by like blending up normal sugar it's kind of wild now this recipe goes in the fridge too and it can stay there for as little as an hour or for up to three days today i don't have the kind of time and for the sake of fairness when judging against the other recipes i left it in for about two hours the very last kind of neat portion of this recipe is instead of just forming normal dough balls you're gonna break that ball in half and then leave the newly exposed side upright this procedure is in an effort to create some uneven kind of craggly crevices along the top and let me tell you these smell so damn good i'm so damn excited i this has been weeks that i've been waiting to make these look how perfectly golden brown this got across the bottom around the edges it really did make a super interesting kind of rustic looking top by breaking it in half oh man oh my god you need to patent this and sell these babish holy sh i'm a little bit lost for words but sometimes when i'm making these verses episodes and i'm cooking and eating the same recipe four or five times in a day i get a little bit sick of it by the end not today this is such a magical combination of slightly bitter chocolate super rich and like decadent uh dark brown sugar the brown butter the cinnamon is like such a nice touch it doesn't taste cinnamony but you can tell that there's something else going on in there everyone drop what you're doing and make these like right now because this is one of the best cookies i've ever eaten i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did leave me a big old like once again i missed you all thank you so much for being patient letting me take a few weeks off it's mostly to like clear the mind recharge prevent burnout mainly um and it's worked the last few years so happy to be back i'm ready to get back in the swing of things and um i'll see you next time so have a wonderful weekend [Music] peace supersize my life with my 18 yeah", "wLCVHoyp28Y": "[Music] hey everyone welcome to PI skip Chen so for the upcoming holiday season I wanted to give you an edible gift recipe something you could make for family and friends and I thought you know what let's do a cookie recipe those are always appreciated but what should I share and I thought I have to share with you my chocolate chip cookie recipe because yes I know it's a classic yes I know lots of people make it but this is by far the best chocolate chip cookie recipe that I've ever made and trust me I've made chocolate chip cookies in my life many many many times so when you bring this for people they're going to be surprised how good this pretty basic recipe is but there are lots of tips here and there that I would like to share this original recipe actually came from a memoir of a local bakery owner she wrote a memoir about her life and included a chocolate chip cookie recipe and I tried and who the mazing so I will link to that book in the website post as well if you are interested alright let's get started so let's mix the dry ingredients first I've got here just some all-purpose flour and to that I'm gonna add some salt and some baking powder and baking soda so you don't need to sift the flour but one thing I do like to sift is baking soda especially if you've got some old making soda that you're using cuz sometimes they get little clumps in it and if you that clump doesn't get mixed in during the mixing process you can taste a chunk of baking soda and that's happened to me before so just to avoid it I like to sift it along with my baking powder see those little clumps is what I'm talking about and fresh baking soda doesn't get as much but older ones and then I'm gonna give this a nice whisk for the dry we'll let that sit for now so I'm using my stand mixer here which makes it easy but if you only have the handheld electric mixer that'll work too I'll include more details on how to work with those in the written recipe okay so I've got some unsalted butter that's gonna go in and it's been sitting sitting at room temperature that's what you want you don't want to work with hard cold butter here I'm just gonna give it I'm using the paddle attachment and I'm just gonna give it a quick stir my butter is pretty soft but sometimes your butter is like kind of soft but not really the initial stir really helps it soften fully okay and then I'm gonna add some sugar so I have two types of sugar here some dark brown sugar and regular white sugar and by the way I should mention that I have adapted this recipe from the original version a little bit so it's not quite exactly the same mix that on medium speed until it's nice and fluffy looks fluffy the color should lighten a little bit and we're gonna stop it halfway to scrape down the sides and scrape down the paddle too that's important make sure you dig all the way to the bottom because I find at least with this particular mixer the very bottom of the bowl doesn't actually get mixed so you know what's good for this a mini spatula there we go really get into those holes there okay that looks good to me the colors a little lighter looking a little fluffy and this stage is important because you are aerating the mixture and that's gonna you know get some air bubbles in the cookies it'll give it rise it also dissolves some of the sugar as well well I guess I don't have to do this I don't know why I do this right now because it's out of habit so in addition to this I'm going to add some vanilla extract and two eggs oh when the egg should also be at room temperature and then I'm gonna just mix this on low to begin with so I don't get egg splash everywhere once this makes a little you definitely need to scrape this because as you can see the sides are not getting mixed in again make sure you dig to the bottom now I'm just gonna mix on medium low just to incorporate everything together there you go that's it the dry ingredients will go in and we're almost done look how easy this is but with the dry ingredients I'm gonna have this bowl is way too big so unwieldy I'm gonna add just a little bit at a time if I add all of this in and then I turn the machine on it's just gonna kick up flour all over the place and will still kick up a little bit of flour but a little at a time kicks it up less let's give that a quick quiz turn that off and a little more flour and I turn it off in between adds just because I don't want to over mix this dough so I want to mix it as little as possible and my last addition what you could do as well is just drape like a kitchen towel over so when it does pick it up it doesn't you don't end up breathing it in one more push out here and then I'm gonna mix it just until and that's it it's not well mixed yet but I still need to add my chocolate chips and by the time the chocolate chips gets mixed in it'll be well mixed if you well mix it now you add the chocolate chips you make us it again then you end up over mixing right and again with this particular mixer I don't know with yours might be a little different I always like to go and scrape the bottom because I can see that the bottom actually has quite a bit of dry flour that just wasn't gonna get mixed in okay chocolate chips this is the most important part yeah I guess it's a very important part is the type of chocolate chips that I am using so instead of using chocolate chips I'm using chocolate disks okay so these are semi-sweet the original recipe calls for a semi-sweet mixed with milk chocolate but I don't like milk chocolate my cookies but the disc what these will do is when they melt they become layers because they're so flat right so you get these like beautiful chocolate layers on the cookie you get intense chocolate flavor and every bite it makes such a difference that these are in layers and not in like little chunks throughout trust me it's a little hard to find so I would encourage you to go to like a specialty store like a gourmet kitchen store that maybe have specialty baking ingredients but this makes a big difference okay trust me just gonna pour that all in and I've actually reduced the amount of chocolate called for in the original recipe I thought it was too much cuz I you know there are two camps of people people who think there's no such thing as chocolate chip cookies with too much chocolate and there are people who think that they want they also like to taste the cookie itself not just the chocolate so this is definitely something you can customize if you want more chocolate less chocolate super low speed just a few times to get the chocolate mixing that's it the dough is done yeah look at that now I'm not gonna scrape too much of this paddle because that cookie dough is really delicious and one of the things that's hard about this recipe is stopping yourself from eating that delicious duck dough although there's raw eggs in here and I'm pregnant so I probably shouldn't eat too much of this so this is all for Adam the cameraman so now I'm gonna portion out this cookie dough but not onto a baking sheet because we are not going to bake it yet we're gonna portion it out and then it's going to age in the fridge for 48 hours yes I said it we are aging cookie dough I was very skeptical of this method in the beginning I was like come on what difference could that make so I tested it a big one right away a big one one day age and I baked one to day age and the result was significantly better at two days the flavors are just a little more intense everything seems almost a little more caramely it's just a more flavorful cookie overall so if you can plan ahead age it for two days and all you do is just let it sit in the fridge that's all you do and you will have something much more flavorful than if you were to bake it right away okay if you bake it right away it'll be fine but it's not gonna be epic until you age it okay so as far as scooping I am using a number 30 scoop which is one fluid ounce it's equivalent of about two tablespoons if you don't have one of these you can just use two spoons and just get the balls about two inches in diameter that's it and I'm not doing a flat scoop like it is a little bit rounded that's the size that I like and for our patreon members for the show after the show I'm gonna talk you through some common cookie troubleshooting so some common problems that occur with cookies and how to work around them and if you want to know more about patreon the link is in the description below you can check that out and I liked to make sure that at the bottom of the scoop there is an exposed chocolate because what happen with this exposed chocolate is that it will melt when you bake it and when you take it up it'll it'll stick to the pan so you lose that chocolate to the pan a little bit is okay but you know if you see expose chocolate just you know push some dough over it to protect it [Music] so it's been two days no it hasn't been two days I was so organized that I made another batch that's been properly aged for you my oven is preheated and I'm gonna give you two options if you like cookies that spread a little wider sort of thinner more crisp you bake it at 350 for 15 minutes if you like cookies at a little bit thicker it'll still get crispy on the outside and it Browns a little bit more but it's gonna be a little thicker bake it at 375 for 11 minutes definitely try it out with your own oven just to see what you like I've got a sheet pan lined with either parchment paper or a nonstick silicone pad like this and you can only put safely six cookies on it if you're good maybe you can get eight but any more than that I've tried and they blend into each other once they spread so but I would recommend baking just six first just to see how it goes check you know check with your temperature and time just to see that that's exactly how you want it so there are changes that need to be made for the second batch you can do that look at that now here's a tip if you want cookies that's got like chocolates right on top make sure you nuts a piece of chocolate to put it on top of the dough and then it'll bake into that because otherwise you know chocolate gets hidden nothing wrong with that but this looks a little better so now this has to cool for at least five to ten minutes because right now it's very soft so you don't want to transfer it now this is actually the first time I'm using Adams oven to bake it so I had to adjust the timing a little bit and that's gonna be true for you everybody's ovens a little bit different so that's why it's good to bake up sort of a test batch of a few pieces so you can make the necessary adjustment without having baked like 25 cookies all right so these cookies have cooled enough for me to eat but they're still fresh and the chocolates still melty which is exactly when you want to serve it you want to serve it the day of if possible because it's chocolates still gonna be melty and yes you can reheat it and freeze the dough I will include all of those instructions the written recipe so I'm gonna grab this guy here and as you can see there's a little bit of chocolate stuck to the pizza pan this is what I was talking about about making sure you cover the bottom of the dough inevitably you still might get a little bit of chocolate lost to the pan but if you don't you sometimes lose a whole piece of chocolate to the bottom so you want to avoid that so let me break this cookie up for you oh I love it it's crispy on the edges but chewy in the middle look at that ah so good this is the most exciting part of my day you can hear the crispy edges still chewy in the middle there is nothing nothing like it and the two days ageing is totally totally worth it so I hope you give this a try the recipe as always we'll be on Ty's kitchen calm and definitely send me a photo if you make it on Facebook Twitter or Instagram let me know who you share this cookie with and what they think and if you haven't subscribed to the show make sure you do so you don't miss a recipe and click the little

wishes comm with chocolate chip cookies that's right this amazing recipe is by far the most closely guarded secret in the history of food wishes well actually that's not true the fact that my moustache is fake is probably really the biggest secret but food wise it's definitely these chocolate chip cookies and not only does this produce literally the perfect chocolate chip cookie it's also the easiest procedure I've ever seen and requires no electric mixer so let's go ahead and get started with the dry ingredients and for that we're gonna need some all-purpose flour yup no matter what your purpose this kind of flour will work and then to that we're going to add a spoon of baking soda not baking powder repeat not baking powder baking soda in fact I shouldn't even mention baking powder because now you're thinking about it and then last but not least of course we're going to need some salts and then what we'll do is we'll grab a whisk and give this a mix for about a minute so that everything gets incorporated evenly and this is more of a contemporary technique back in the day we would have had you put this through your sifter but you don't have a sifter but you do have a whisk so like I said we'll mix that up for about a minute at which point we'll simply set that aside and move on to the rest of the dough and that's going to begin with a little bit of butter just a cup and why is it so yellow because they let the cows eat grass like they're supposed to but anyway we're going to need a cup of butter and some very soft butter at that and it's this nice soft butter along with a heavy-duty spatula that makes this procedure so simple and electric mixer free so what we'll do is we'll add some white sugar and some brown sugar and once we add our sugar we will take the back of our heavy-duty spatula and begin to do what they call cream the butter in the sugar so we'll simply use the back of our spatula to smear and smush and smash that all together and things might start off a little slow but just keep at it and after a few short minutes of thoughtful speculation you should be looking at something that's very light in texture almost borderline fluffy and even though we're not going to use an electric mixer this really isn't going to take very long I mean this really should only take you a couple minutes and I'm including time to daydream in that okay but anyway like I said we're gonna cream all that together for a couple minutes until we end up with something that looks like this which way we can proceed with the rest of the ingredients so let's go ahead and add some vanilla extract of course we're going to use the real and the pure and then after the vanilla we'll do a couple tablespoons of milk and in the spirit of full disclosure I'm not even using real milk I'm using almond milk oh yeah chef John's a little more of a hippie than one would suspect so we'll do a little bit of milk and then we'll also need one large egg and then we'll grab a whisk and mix this all together and please take note how when I start off here I'm sort of keeping my whisk on one side sort of mixing one spot very thoroughly before moving on to another spout and the reason I do that is because there's a very small chance very small but a chance nonetheless that if we try to mix us all together too fast it can separate and not come together into the creamy mass we're looking for so by starting and staying in one spot until it kind of starts coming together you pretty much eliminate any chance that's going to happen so we'll go ahead and we'll give that a very thorough mixing with the whisk until that vanilla egg and milk are perfectly incorporated and once that's happened let's go ahead and switch to the spatula and we'll use that to clean up and scrape down our sides so we can move on to the final steps which are as follows let's go ahead and grab our flour mixture and dump it right in and then we'll take our spatula and mix that in which should only take a minute if that and do not worry about over mixing the dough this recipe requires exactly zero finesse really the hardest part about this step is not having the flour fly out of the bowl and then as soon as that flour has been successfully incorporated we will add to last and maybe most important ingredient the chocolate chips and of course semi-sweet is your classic choice but really any kind of chocolates going to work here except white chocolate I don't like white chocolate so we'll mix those in and then as soon as our chocolate chips are incorporated our dough is officially done and yes it can be used immediately but for best results I recommend transferring this into some kind of zip-top plastic bag and chilling it before we try to scoop it not only do I think the texture of the final baked cookie is a little better for reasons that I can't scientifically explain the cold front cookie dough is way way easier to work with then soft sticky room-temperature dough so I did refrigerate my dough for a couple hours at which point we'll pull it out and as suspected it was colder and firmer at this point we are ready to scoop and bake cookies and for me the easiest way to do that is one of these little sorbet scoops all right this one holds just about a rounded tablespoon which I find is the perfect amount because we chilled our dough in a bag it's very easy to stick the scoop in there grab the perfect amount of dough and then use the back to even it off so we don't have to get our fingers all dirty I mean what's worse than looking cookie dough off your fingers so that's my method although instead of scooping them onto a table what we really want to do is scoop these onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet and please do not crowd them I don't really think you should put more than 8 per pan so I'm gonna use the old classic - one two one two placement system then once we've scooped and evenly spaced our dough we will transfer that pan into the center of a 375 degree oven for about 12 minutes or until our cookies get beautifully golden brown around the edges and look like this check it out those look good and if everything's gone according to plan the outside of our cookies should be beautifully crisp not even though the outsides are crispy the cookie itself remains flexible moist and beautifully chewy so what I like to do is just slide them off using the paper onto a cooling rack just like that and those will firm up enough to handle in just a few minutes at which point we can lose the paper and ideally let these cool completely I know some of you like warm chocolate chip cookies that is your right you either Snooki of your cookie but I think to fully appreciate the texture and taste you should let these cool all the way down to room temp and by the way to kill time while I waited for my tea cool I decide to hold one up to the light so we can see just how thin these are and also kind of see that inner bubbly matrix that gives these cookies their incredible texture but anyway I did let my cool at which point it was time to taste what I consider the perfect chocolate chip which for me means the perfect balance between crispy and chewy which is exactly what I think we have here but don't take it for me listen for yourself and despite the outer edges being crispy the rest of the cookie is still flexible chewy moist and unbelievably delicious so anyway that's it the official food wishes chocolate chip cookie my sincerest apologies for making you wait eight years for this hey I've been busy but I'm glad we finally posted it and I really really do hope you give this a try soon so head over to food wishes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as

process what does that mean when I over mix under mix over bake under bake different sized portions of kiki does we've got our cookie calculator see the dial in your cookie just right and then on top of it the creme de la creme for me is the ultimate average we basically have made every formula you can think of take the chocolate chips out take the leaveners out and if you remove these things or double these things it gives you this really deep insight to exactly how the functionality of each ingredient works and plays together so we did all these trials and for me and I think the biggest takeaway the ingredients are as important as most folks would lead you to believe you can totally make or break a cookie any cookie based on the process tt means processed test temperature 325 for 12

half of it then you break up those cookies and then you mix it back in with the dough and then you bake those initially it shouldn't it doesn't make any sense that average plus average equals epic

cooking chewy chocolate chip cookies really really easy recipe we've got 200 grams of chopped chocolate you can use chocolate chips 1 egg 150 grams of sugar I'm using half light Demerara and half golden caster and you can just use one or the other we've got a hundred and fifty grams of softened butter 200 grams of plain flour some salt some vanilla and a bit of baking powder the first thing we need students need to be our butter and our sugar together until really light fluffy now I'm using an electric whisk for this you could use a tabletop mixer or you could use a hand whisk but it's going to take quite a lot of work because we want it really really light and fluffy that's what's going to make the cookies lovely and fudgy so first our butter goes into our Bowl and then our sugar and then we're just going to beat the two together until it's super light fluffy [Laughter] now our mixtures lovely and fluffy we can add our eggs I'm just going to crack our egg into the bowl like so I'm then going to add half a teaspoon of vanilla extract just want to beat those together to combine the next stage we don't want to overwork the ingredients cuz that's how you get tough cookies so at least we want to bring it together just as a dough and as soon as that's ready it's done now I'm using 200 grams of flour because I want cake here I want thicker take your cookies and I'm also going to cook them straight away I'm not gonna rest them in the fridge but if you're going to rest them in the fridge or you want thinner cookies than 190 grams is absolutely fine so in with that flour chocolate cool through the teaspoon of salt and our baking powder we just want to work this all into it though and the sues that comes together as a dough you don't want to overwork it any more you see let's come together just a little bit more flour to absorb that was all there was to it now your cookie dough's made you've got a couple of options you can either cook it straight away which I'm going to do or for a better flavor and for a better texture you can leave it in the fridge overnight so leave it in the fridge overnight and either cover the bowl of cookie dough as it is and just leave it in the fridge then tomorrow just roll it out its balls and bake it from cold or you can roll it out into balls now and then chill the balls overnight and then bake those from cold I'm going to bake my cookies for 8 to 10 minutes but if you're baking them from cold you need to bake them for 10 to 12 all I need to do now is scoop our 12 balls over two trays so that's six balls on each tray then I'm going to cook them for eight to ten minutes in an oven that's been preheated to 180 which is 165 and then they'll be so now is put our cookies in the oven for eight to ten minutes and they'll be cooked ready to cool and then ready to eat my cookies about ten minutes and they're out the oven and as you can see they are gorgeous they've just starting to brown on the outside but there's still molten and soft in the middle so that is those done now I'm going to leave them to cool slightly on the tray and I'll leave it to cool a bit more on a cooling rack and then they'll be ready to eat so

What is your favorite cookie? Drop a comment down below and let me know. Let's get started. First preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Then\nwe start with 1 cup of softened butter, 1 half cup of white granulated sugar, 1 cup\nof packed brown sugar, okay now using a hand mixer or stand mixer, let's cream this all\ntogether, once it is creamed together let's go ahead and scrape down the sides, at this\npoint we are going to add our eggs, one at a time, first large egg, now let's add two\nteaspoons of vanilla extract, now we take 2 and a half cups of all purpose flour, we\nwill add one tsp. of baking soda, on half tsp. of salt. Then we will go ahead and use a whisk or you\ncan sift it together, and we will mix it all together. All right now let's take our flour and we\nare going to just add about a third of it at a time, mix, alright add some more flour,\nnow we want to scrape the sides as needed, add more flour, and then before I add the\nrest of the flour, at this step I am going to add 2 cups of chocolate chips, these are\nsemi-sweet, you can you use milk chocolate as well, this equals about one package here\nin the States, I am going to mix those in. Okay, and then let's add the rest of our flour,\nthen one last scraping of the sides. Alright our cookie dough is done, and now\nwhat we are going to do is we need to separate our beaters and now time to clean off those\nbeaters, and then you can just use your spatula, come in here and push them out. Alright once our cookie dough is done, it\nis time to form our cookies, I am using a cookie sheet with an Artisan Mat on top, this\nis a Silicone baking mat, really awesome, really love these silicon baking mats, they\nclean really easy, they last a really long time, they help to keep the cookies from getting\nburnt on the bottom, and uh, if you want to pick a couple of these up, I will put a link\ndown below where you can get them, really awesome, I highly recommend them especially\nfor cookies. So what we do is we take a spoon or ice cream\nscoop and we take some cookie dough, it's about 2 tablespoons worth, and go ahead and\ndrop it on there, and you can form it a little bit, with your hand if you want, just like\nthat, whatever side you want to make, big ones, little ones, whatever you want to make,\nabout an inch and a half apart. All right and then you bake these in the oven\nat 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of the cookie, if you make them\nbigger, bake them a little longer, smaller a little shorter, until the edges are just\nslightly brown. All right so we cook them until the edges\nare just slightly brown right there, and then you take them out of the oven and let them\nsit on the cookie sheet, for about 5 minutes to cool before transferring them to a cookie\nrack to cool the rest of the way. Alright I am going to show you the bottom\nof this cookie, look at that, nice golden brown, pretty awesome.

going to be making some cupcakes today because cupcake Jemma makes cupcakes don't know if you've heard and these ones are really really cute I'm really simple and they're gonna be cookie cupcakes chocolate chip cookie cupcakes which sounds kind of straightforward but um they're gonna look really really lovely they're gonna be a really tasty burnt butter sponge with chocolate chips and they're gonna topped with really sweet little me chocolate chip cookies so I'm gonna start by making those cookies I've made these cookies a ton of times there's my go-to recipe when I want small cookies because they just kind of flatten out really nicely um and they work really well and they they really you know crispy around the edge and soft and squishy in the middle so I'm also gonna be making quite a heavy load of cookie dough even though I don't actually need not I probably won't even be using half of it or even quarter for this recipe but I always make too much cookie dough because I think it's really important to you have cookie dough in your freezer at all times in case of emergencies where you just need a baby stop I'm gonna start by beating my sugar and my butter together so I've got my soft unsalted butter here I'm gonna put all the descriptions in the box below and this is really nice and soft and spreadable you don't want to have to firm butter otherwise it's going to struggle to get through I've also got some light soft brown sugar and some cookie cookie and some castor sugar that's gonna go in and I'm just gonna beat that on a really low speed actually not for very long at all just to bring it together [Music] and that's come together nicely so I'm now going to add an egg a large free-range egg which I'm also gonna add a little bit of good quality vanilla extract to to make it all tastes really nice I'm just gonna whisk it in I'm also bringing my measurements there it's probably about a half a teaspoon to a teaspoon just gonna mix it in a little bit and then whack the mixer on and just mix that until it's just combined as well now I'm gonna fold in my flour I'm just going to wipe it all in along with some salt just to bring the flavor out a little bit and a little bit of bicarbonate of soda just to help it kind of puff up that just needs to be folded in briefly and when it's almost ready I'm going to wrap in some food quality chocolate chips I've just use like a really nice dark chocolate here you can use milk chocolate these fancy-pants chocolate cheap chocolate whatever you look [Applause] [Music] and that's looking pretty day like so it's ready to use and as I said this is a mammoth amount of cookie dough you're not gonna need this for all for this recipe so if you want to save it just wrap it up in cling film in a log which makes it nice and easy you can cut bits off and bake one cookie at a time if you so wish but for now I'm gonna roll my cookie dough into little balls I'm gonna measure them and because I want these cookies to be super small my preference for weight I think it's gonna be somewhere between eight and ten rooms so it's pretty pretty little let's see that's way too much ten perfect so roll them into balls and put them on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment now I'm actually going to make quite a bit more cookies than I need to you for these cupcakes because I'm going away in a couple of days I'm going to do if it it's my partner and my friends and these are going to be perfect to take to snack along the way and to take on height for us so I don't think there's ever a time where you shouldn't make extra cookies quite frankly and I'm done so I'm going to bake my cookies at 170 degrees C for about seven to nine minutes I'm going to just keep an eye on them in that time because they are quite small I don't want to overdo them so I'm going to check on them at 7:00 and maybe add a minute or two if they look a bit soft [Music] [Music] welcome back I mean you didn't go anywhere I went somewhere and some time passed but for you is only a couple of seconds anyway I'm back do you make the cupcake part of this cupcake recipe I'm gonna be doing really yummy burnt butter chocolate chip sponge and we use this recipe in the shop loads and burn butter is essentially what if ever looked in burnt butter a lot of fancy-pants petitioners call it burner Evette and it is basically where you burn the butter or brown it to a point where it becomes a sort of amber color and their little kind of grains of dark brown and it lets off this insanely heady nutty flavor nutty smell and it just makes the whole buttery flavor just that more kind of like round and sweet and nutty and it's really lovely and it works really well in sponges and what I've done is I've actually pre burnt it and then i refrigerator dit and then let it out just to kind of come to room temperature and then it goes this kind of whippy consistency similar consistency to you the butter that I would normally use in all of my cupcakes are kind of soft spreadable consistency so I'm going to be using that but first we're gonna sit my dry ingredients I've got some self raising flour putting that through a sieve with some castor sugar and some dark soft brown sugar this time and you can use like soft brown sugar if you like completely up to you also some bicarbonate soda and a good pinch of salt maybe a little bit more I'm just gonna push that through this lid because the Muscovado or dark brown sugar has a tendency to kind of lump up you don't want to get nuggets of it in your sponge because otherwise you're going to have when it bakes little cream is like cavernous kind of tasty but Calvin is like air pockets which is not what you want for a cake and and if it's not all going through the sieve at least doing this is kind of breaking up the lumps a little bit now you can see there's quite a bit left in my sip I'm just going to just turn now into the actual bow because I think I break it up enough now bombs they're gonna add and some soft butter regular butter on embrowned and then my bad butter of course it smells so nice I've done tons of recipes using that butter and I've made cookies with them Blondie's it's really versatile and so if you haven't I mean I always like to have a bit of it in the fridge as well because it's really nice to cook with and you can just toss some like green beans and some garlic in with it it's yummy anyway though this is a baking program not beans program and I'm also gonna add some eggs two large free-range eggs and as I said before all the measurements for this recipe ah in the description box below so I'll put that onto my mixer and then 30 on a low speed just speak that together for about a minute we're just gonna increase the speed to medium and let that go for about a minute of income together that's almost ready now just need to add some liquid might put one and a half tablespoons of milk and I'm also going to add about 50 grams of finely chopped chocolate chips together something something going on inside and just pick up the speed a bit and beat up a second that is looking and smelling really nice it's a really lovely color as well bit darker than normal cake batter or just regular vanilla you'll notice that I didn't add vanilla to this recipe and that's kind of cuz I want the burnt butter flavor to really shine here and also because I'm gonna be using vanilla buttercream and there's vanilla in these cookies I just don't want it to all be really say me say me so I have chosen to omit butter but please feel free to put it in if that's what you want to do I'm not the boss of you guys you are your own bosses and all I can do is suggester now that my batter is ready I've got my twelve whole tin already lined with paper cases and I'm gonna go ahead and spoon out evenly into each one and what are you batters in I just need to bake those at 170 degrees C for 20 to 22 minutes and it is now time to finish these guys off I have taken out the oven and they are a really lovely rich brown color and they smell so so good really reminiscent of a natural cookie will that burn butter and chocolate chips so now I'm just going to decorate them I'm just using vanilla buttercream you can use whatever kind of ice cream you like you don't even need to use frost cream you can just see them over there but obviously they're not gonna look quite the same and I because use my regular vanilla buttercream recipe and if you want to check that out and it's just one batch of that and the recipe is in the link there and it's the my vanilla buttercream masterclass video which will give you tons of tips and hints on how to get perfect buttercream every single time and also what would be nice with this would be maybe a Swiss meringue or like a milk chocolate since mine try that but I'm just keeping it simple with a bit of vanilla buttercream so I'm just gonna finish these guys off with a cookie and a bit of chocolate chip action [Music] and here it is the finished chocolate-chip cookie cupcake really simple and really delicious and look so so sweet and the best thing is I have 12 cupcakes but I've also got a massive bowl of cookies and I'm gonna share these with my upstairs neighbors who absolutely love getting my leftovers when I bake cakes here for you guys quite often I'm on my own and there was no one else to

"TlzVUIMI6gk": "hey guys and welcome back today I'm gonna show you how to make the best chocolate chip cookie of your life let's go so one of the most important things about my recipe is you're gonna need barred chocolate all right so now we've got the chocolate all good to go oh yeah so basically you're going to want I kind of like to break this up a little bit before I start chopping just coming ups and then just gonna take your knife and give it a rough chop be careful make sure your knife is sharp because if this knife rolls while you're doing this and you're gonna lose a finger don't do that you don't want to chop this to fine we want randomize chunks it's okay if it's uneven that's kind of what you want it's kind of a whole purpose here and by the way this is about six ounces of chocolate you can go upwards to seven but these two chocolate bars happen to be three ounces each so just be mindful of that and this is pretty good let's keep it like that and we'll just go ahead and put this in a container and set it aside for now I remember reading somewhere that it said if you say just set something aside in a recipe you're a tool supposedly because it should be obvious that you're supposed to set it aside but you know just for consistency I like to say it anyway because either a I'm a tool or B I just care that people don't accidentally do something incorrect because you'd be surprised what people do by accident also don't forget to turn your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit like I just did now for the remaining ingredients we've got butter flour salt sugar baking soda egg and not extract so if you didn't catch all that don't worry I'm gonna explain it all first thing we're gonna get going is butter now I would use a high quality butter this is Kerrygold grass-fed Irish butter you don't have to get it this sounds like in Ina Garten spiel but I would recommend it honestly if you don't have money for your regular order we're gonna melt it let's do that this is the worst thing about butter because I don't want to get my hands dirty and I don't want to clean anything so I'm sorry it's just how I am so I'll just use my hands it's fine now I have to wash my hands now I've got the butter melting over a medium heat right now we're just gonna bring it down until it's completely melted it doesn't need to go any farther than that now while your butter is melting we're gonna go ahead and add our sugars white sugar into the bowl and this is brown sugar and all the ingredients are gonna be listed in link below and also on my website on full recipe because I'm really bad at and remembering this stuff I mean after all I guess I've create recipes because I can't remember any of this so whatever so I've got my whisk and I'm just going to whisk this I'm just whisking to get the sugars evenly distributed so you don't get like a chunk of brown sugar as you can see the butter is completely melted we're good to go with this it's done we're gonna take it off eat right now we're gonna whisk and as we're whisking very lightly we're gonna start pouring in that butter just kidding portal oh yeah oh god it smells amazing good lord Oh Lord now we're gonna start whisking a little faster at this point now that we've got the butter pretty thoroughly incorporated there we're gonna go ahead and add the two eggs all right and then from that we're gonna add an additional egg yolk just ate yolk I don't want any whole egg white in there just the yolk see oh come on there we go and you're gonna whisk that in and then now we're gonna add the vanilla extract and the salt and baking soda all right so now we're going to take the whisk out because this part is gonna Bend the whisk to all help use a hearty spoon a wooden spoon metal spoon whatever and so we're gonna go ahead and add our flour about half of it first and then just mix it in and we're gonna keep mixing this until it is totally incorporated at first it's gonna kind of resist the butter but it'll start to come together just keep mixing and then now at this point we're gonna add the rest of the flour now we got a dough coming together at this point even though we kind of want to get all that flour that's in there we're gonna go ahead and add the chocolate chips well our chocolate chunks I guess you could say and we're just gonna kind of like fold those into the dough like so once that is nice and dispersed we can go ahead and start putting this onto a cookie sheet now here you can use any cookie scoop you want I actually like to use an ice cream scoop because you know Big Daddy cookies anyway we're gonna do our first scoop we're just gonna scoop a whole pressed in and leveled out scoop like this you don't really want we want to press it in pretty nicely and then we're just gonna lightly place it on our parchment lined baking sheets and pop it off boom that that's all you got to do it's pretty easy now to do that with the rest of the cookies that one's done alright so we have our cookies placed on our baking sheets as you can see David's cookie scoop everything's mixed and we could go they're going into again a 350 degree oven Fahrenheit I actually turn mine up to about 365 370 because my oven thermometer that comes with the unit is way off and yours properly is too so I would recommend getting an external thermometer and double-checking if you don't care it doesn't matter anyway here we go now while those are baking I'm just gonna give you a brief little scientific overview about cookies so my cookies I like to keep them super fudgy chewy and a little crispy on the outside and the trick in doing that is I use a little bit higher proportion of brown sugar and a little higher proportion of sugar in general in the dough which what happens is it melts in the oven and then it caramelizes and that gives it a nice chewy sort of like stickier teeth close to a caramel but you know in cookie form and then the other thing is I add an egg yolk to not only add fat but it also that adding that fat creates a sort of a more fudgy inside which I personally look for you know molten pieces of chocolate fudgy inside chewy outside you know you you you get it if you want to learn more about cooking science you can actually go there's a really cool article on serious eats I'll put the link down below and you can go check that out if you don't care about the science of cookies and you prefer to just care about the eating of cookies then you know I still respect that a lot so I just want to take a little beep good yeah this is a brief service announcement please don't go to a party and bring pre-made cookie dough there use these cookies because that's lame dude don't use premium cookie dough when you're going to a party if you're drunk and you're eating premade cookie dough then I understand that but don't go to a party and bring pre-made cookies that's lame okay sorry alright so the last part is going to be there since they're done baking we're just going to finish them with some Malden flaky sea salt you can skip this part if you want but it's actually to me it's sort of what makes these cookies extra-special we're just gonna give each of them a little sprinkling of the Malden all right so these are my idea of the perfect chocolate chip cookie you know I know that there are a bunch of varying ideas but my definition would be slightly crispy outside and edges and the chewy fudgy dense inside you know that is the essence of what a chocolate chip cookie should be to me I hope you guys enjoyed this and I hope that you get a chance to make these cookies I know that they're not peeling or gluten free and a lot of my recipes are and if you would like a paleo or gluten-free chocolate chip cookie that is amazing then I also have a recipe for that which is on my website and this recipe will also be on my website all those links will be down below if you want to follow me on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter all those links will also be in the description and yeah I hope you guys loved this episode and I will see you next time they're so good [Applause]", "zYZ2iUHoeHk": "hi guys it's really tasty producer I love cooking I love baking and I love eating last time you guys saw me making a cake using 30 hops this time my friend Annie collected 20 more hacks today we are making chocolate chip cookies this is our tone travolta cookie this is very classic basic chocolate chip cookie it's a little bit cakey for my taste my favorite one a little bit crunchy outside and soft inside let's get started puck number one use bread flour instead of using all-purpose flour so bread flour contains more protein than all-purpose flour that creates more gluten that means your cookie is become more chewy which i like you are using spoon instead of scooping flour out and little flour I don't get the point of just scooping with spoon maybe if you had a narrower flour jar scrape if you have a knife maybe it's easier I will use this hack for sure but not the spoon part our instant coffee to have some java effect July fact one teaspoon of instant coffee to have like nice bitterness I don't want to give too much caffeine for the little child I'm being mom so we will check back later whenever I see sweet baby moves around so I have a feeling my baby it's gonna have a sweet tooth too more butter hot we want to bring back cold butter to room temperature this is kind of a struggle I sometimes have like I decided to bake something you need a room-temperature butter this is a quick way of doing it you are going to put butter in a bag and just people would hate me if I'm the neighbor doing this right it's still cold about maybe we're gonna leave it like I feel like you will need at least 30 minutes I have another butter half so we're gonna just sit outside and just put butter inside I was afraid water to get into the wrapper but it seems like it's sealed well it'll make sure water is not too hard because if the water is a little too hot it will just melt you want to turn it every so often already feel like it's becoming soft there has been 10 minutes let's see oh yeah nice and soft this one let's see these are all so soft the water gets in a little bit though but inside it's still cold and a little hard I like this house better according to this hug we can combine white sugar with more assess and just add little by little until your desired color I have brown sugar at home I don't have more office at home raise your hand if you have molasses around in your pantry it all smells more offices Malathi it's kind of like a slime tutorial it's almost looked like like brown sugar right now I like a little darker so I'm gonna add more office texture and color it's exactly look like a brown sugar I have regular brown sugar let's see the taste tastes like brown sugar and this it's the DIY one tastes exactly like brown sugar so this Hawk definitely works bring back X to room temperature winds warm water when you're baking we want to make sure everything is room temperature it's like and you can touch it it's like a good shower so three minutes is up and we are going to check I think it's not cold anymore if the egg gets really cold it's more farm but this is kind of loose now this is room-temperature chocolate hot do you guys remember chocolate rain turns out it happens thirteen years ago I don't use chocolate chip when I make chocolate chip cookie I also use chocolate bar you can control the size it's looks more rustic than round chocolate chips so you can use knife physics in room temperature so it doesn't have any problem okay so I chopped all the chocolate this aside so we have all the ingredients ready deceits the room-temperature butter we made it earlier I liked this huh Collier now I'm sure I need one more stick butter so I'm combining 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar so we are using bread flour and brown sugar both components makes a little bit chewy our cookies we are going to cream these two together so instead of using vanilla extract using maple syrup I'm not sure about this hack you are kind of adding extra sweetness chocolate chip cookies already three I feel like if you don't have vanilla extract just skip it we'll see I'm going to cream about five minutes so this is nice consistency and I'm adding egg one by one I'm going to add flour mixture so for the cookie shorter the mixed time it's better especially we are using bread flour as well and there it's no flour visible so I'm gonna stop right here and I'm going to mix chocolate all right so though it's ready next hot we are going to use cookie dough as a glue you're using convection over especially there it's a whole air coming from the oven sometimes like paper just flew away I use this all the time it doesn't need to be cookie you can use this for macaroons so this is a good hug it's ice cream scooper I also use this hack all the time for baking cookie cause you can portion control and also creates nice rustic shapes using ice tray for leftover dough and you can freeze them I'm not sure about this huh you can maybe scoop on a tray with ice cream scoop and freeze it probably for like saving space I would just scoop it and put it in a ziploc bag so I'm going to rest this dough for overnight I think you guys ought to be so Alvin's two days cookie recipe video you want to at least risk this dough overnight or as alden data two days kind of makes it better flavor it's almost like curing you can freeze the dough so it doesn't spread too much but if you're resting this dough overnight you don't need to freeze it so I'm going to just put it in a refrigerator and I just see you guys tomorrow okay we've rested this dough overnight add more chocolate chip before you bake it I think this happens just give more chocolate chip pie I think we are doing this because the chocolate chip is more visible I might use it but I'm not gonna get a chocolate chip I'm gonna use roughly chop the chocolate use flaky salt this flaky salt it's good addition for chocolate chip cookie because chocolate chip cookie is very sweet so it's kind of cut and balance out the sweetness [Music] use muffin pain for perfect circle we're going to spray the muffin pain it's kind of like a mold you know so you're going to put cookies in a muffin ting it doesn't spread out it's intact I like the doors like rustic shape so I'm not gonna get this hot I think it's just a preference thing another muffin tin huh you are using muffin tin upside down to make kind of a cookie ball so you can put ice cream in there I wonder if it's gonna spread if you want to maintain the cookie shape you want to cook higher temperature and shorter time so I'm going to cook this 375 about 8 to 10 minutes all right so those are ready this is the one we bake in a muffin tin I know like a like a flat muffin cookie muffin cooking I don't know what it's the benefit of you can see my fainting so this is another muffin tin hock it spread kinda look like a jellyfish and I know okay so this is what we got the recipe we used they don't work I think it's like 60 percent successful use waffle maker Oh the reason it's smoky I put oil earlier this like make cookie waffle so cook you upwards cool let's see why it's gonna do it's coming out oh no oh yeah yeah Wow wait how are you gonna pick this out it's breaking No me too I think cookie dough doesn't have a enough structure or enough flour to keep the shape No so the original Nestle Toll House cookie recipe it's fake us 375 about 8 to 10 minutes so it's a little bit taller and inside it's a little bit more hekia and this is a la we've baked 350 for 10 to 12 minutes edge its crispy and it's chewy inside the most fun part tasting the texture it's great flavor it's great I have some sort of like aftertaste maybe it's the maple syrup I don't like this afternoon it is so much today overall I like hot cookie better than the control cookie because the texture I like salt and instant coffee kind of gives nice touch so I think this is a winner we have one last hug if you burn cookie in the bottom you can just grade it so it's not bitter so you can use either cheese grater or micro prying just like generally great so you don't need to do this away all right we used all 20 hacks and we are done here it's three hats I like from today's experiment brown sugar hock warming up egg huh resting Doha hot sauce [Music]", "dgNGZWSmgTc": "is it good oh very good would you pay 250 dollars for it no no hey what's up you guys hey hey hey I'm Vaughn I'm a video producer for NYT cooking and I love sugar and I love the internet and I've been spending a lot of time with both recently I was kind of like digging through our recipe archives and I came across this recipe for $250 cookies the story the folklore behind the cookie is that a woman was at lunch with her daughter the neiman-marcus cafe and they had these cookies at the end of their meal the woman loved them so much that she asked the waitress for the recipe on the way just came back she was like that of e250 and the woman's like great and she looked at her credit card statement bla bla bla bla I was doing $50 anyways it was a hoax it was one of those chain emails it was like if you don't send this to 15,000 people in the next the recipe was circulated around and it became known as these like revenge cookies because the woman to exact her revenge on Neiman Marcus was like I'm gonna send your expensive recipe to all of my friends and they're gonna make them for free I'm gonna obviously test them or the sake of journalism do an IRL chain mail type thing where I get people to bake them and I'm gonna see what they think of see how much they would pay for them and then I'm going to ven milk charge them well I so I wanted to know a little bit more about these $250 cookies who would make this up it's just weird I guess do you all have any insight as to how this thing got started or did it just transpire one day and you kind of had to ride the wave we're all connected by the cookies how cute okay this recipe is very simple it's got two thousand five star ratings so I've got very high hopes well this is a really bad angle I'm gonna start easing out all my ingredients that's essentially just like getting them ready cool see very pantry friendly recipe and if we didn't have everything on hand we could you know switch some things out [Music] absolutely everywhere [Music] what a fun tracking shot cookies $250 cookies to be exact now I mean it's just like the name of the recipe from like Neiman Marcus do you wear anyway cool was this in an email perchance no no I've had that they printed it out and gave it to me probably over 25 years ago what I've researched online says that the original recipe makes a hundred and ten cookies and our recipe on the site makes 55 a hundred and ten Nick no this says makes 112 whoa my recipes better we do not need a hundred and twelve cookies in this house Bob forgot to choke me nuts got a lot brighter in home just simply must scrape down the bowl the cow like light and fluffy [Music] I did it that a teaspoon it's hard to do this with one hand oh no oh no that sucks I'm gonna save this and I'm going to find something else to do with it all right we're doing it with one hand again scary pulse a few times Aaron McDowell taught me this trick a queen kind of prevents the flower from going everywhere and that took like a few seconds because I don't want to overmix it we don't want tough cookies we've already dealt with enough tough cookies today [Music] how's that for a POV shot great at Hershey's bars is a very weird concept to me but I think it'll be nice to have like chocolatey dispersion throughout hey mom mom it's hard cuz they keep all flying it's flying breaking off use a big drink or what do you mean hell they didn't have micro-planes back then with this right speaking do you think I should use a box grater hey won't a glass down [Music] what do you do when you get down to the ovens I get another candy before her they cost so much because they have seen manipulation then would you like for me to do see it's hard I'm just gonna throw these little chunks in there it will be nice surprises later now take the County Fair is that an expression yeah what it is now the grated chocolate is like perfuming the batter which is kind of nice Oh cookie yelling turn side note when I could not imagine doing a hundred and twelve of these I had 60 and they are they're pretty heaping I am gonna bake half of them and then I'm gonna bake the other half and then I'm gonna eat them hopefully not all of them [Music] the cookies are the fluffy gorgeous darling just gorgeous you're gonna eat some and give you my unsolicited well no I guess it's not unsolicited I really relate to them this guy they're good it's a very good cookie it's got like a nice nuttiness from the oat mom you wanna eat a cookie 960 okay well my fans I like it the more I coalition oh yeah would you pay $250 really for this recipe no need no I didn't pay 250 for the last one oh wow [Music] what's for dinner okay little crunchy on outside where - on the inside awesome oh good Wow - top eh cookies I'm gonna send the recipe to some of my friends and see how they like them just keep the love going via baked goods like oatmeal cookie and a little black dress a grated chocolate in here it's really good so we have 37 because I eat so much I've been averaging like six or seven cookies a day they're really good but so 35 more cookies if we can't feel connected in person we might as well feel connected through like a shared activity it's kind of cool to get a bunch of people baking all the same fish Cheers considering I haven't baked inside like 10 this is a little girl that we were baking cookies together and would you pay $250 for this cookies absolutely God love me some vengeance cookies no it's pretty good yeah how was the grading of the chocolate that's a major pain in the ass ultimately baking it makes you feel connected to people and it makes me really thankful and grateful for the people that I have in my life that I can share in that welcome you definitely can't put a price on that I hope you guys find some recipes that inspire you to do the same maybe it's this recipe maybe it's another one but regardless happy baking oh there's nothing better wait can I tell you um that I had a very successful chain letter that I wrote back in the myspace days I've got a spooky man named Orville who lived in people's closets and it took off I gotta say those my first moment of viral success I gotta Kate I couldn't quit it", "YbxFDselysw": "hi guys today on Dimas because I have a very special guest today my husband hello everyone and he is going to have full control today I am giving him full control and he's going to walk you guys step-by-step on how to make these chocolate chip cookies that we cannot stop making they are so good so take it away honey Thank You Monique now I have a secret ingredient that you don't find in most chocolate chip cookies and I have a tip for you to make this one the best type of chip cookie recipes that you'll ever try so let's get started now in our first bowl we're gonna mix our dry ingredients we're gonna combine our flour our baking soda and our baking powder and the 1 get a whisk and we're gonna whisk that all together to make sure those two ingredients are well combined then the next item you're gonna add in is dry minute those make sure you get 2 minutes not too traditional it's you want to mix that in all together now as you can see Monique is standing right there watching me like a TV to make sure I don't mess up anything inside of her kitchen now in a second bowl you want to get 2 sticks of softened butter make sure it's softening up melted and you want to combine in your white sugar and your brown sugar along with your salt you want to mix that all together to make sure it's well combined now you can use a hand mixer you can mix it by hand or if you're real fancy and you got a stand-up mixer you can throw in a standard mixer and let it do its thing make sure you scrape down the sides so there's no hidden ingredients down at the bottom of the bowl next you want to add in two room-temperature eggs and you want to combine that into the wet ingredients make sure that is also well combined and not forgetting to scrape down the sides to make sure that egg is well combined now we're going to add in our vanilla extract I'm adding in clear vanilla extract it doesn't matter if you use clear or brown I just happen to have clear on hand the day I made these cookies now for the secret ingredient here's the secret ingredient lemon juice now you're not going to taste the lemon juice in a cookie or what the lemon juice does it makes the cookie a more of a chewy type of cookie now we're going to combine the dry ingredient in green and we're going to do this in stages so add just a little bit at a time you mix it up a hand or if you're using a standard mixer just add it slowly into the standard mixer or if you have a handheld mixer it's strong enough to handle it you can use that as what I ended up using because I got tired of during it by hand but make sure you it's well combined also now when you're done this better is gonna be as smooth as a Tennessee whiskey now for the star of the show we're gonna combine our chocolates now here's my baking tip I combined semi-sweet chocolate milk chocolates and dark chocolates all to the same cookie no put it into the mixture and you want to fold this in by hand do not use distend a mixer or handheld mixer you make sure you want do this by hand and get all those chocolate chips folded into all that cookie dough and then I take a large ice cream scoop which is roughly about a quarter of a cup inside I scoop that out but pack it in really well into ice cream scoop and I just put it onto the cookie sheet this sides ice cream scoops coming about 1819 cookies on this recipe once I get all the cookie scooped out I didn't roll them up into a ball and then I pressed him down into the pan to kind of flatten them out then I picked him back up and I shaped him into like a hockey puck type size and this will give you the nice stick side sort of cookies once you're done with that throw him in the freezers about two hours or you can make him up the day before leave it in the freezer overnight and come back and pull them out throw them in the oven for about 18 to 20 minutes now when you pull them out the middle of the cookies gonna look a little soft like it's not finished cooking just leave it on the warm pan and they will continue to bake and finish up and then when it's done oh my goodness you pull apart all three of those chocolates have been fused into one another that lemon juice has made the cookie even more chewy but it's gonna be one of the top cookies that you probably ever bake and if you bake them for others I'm gonna ask you to make some more so be prepared please like the video and down the comments if you have a baking tip or secret ingredient that you put in your chocolate chip cookies please share with others if you happen to make this recipe please take a picture and hashtag Neves can cook on social media networks we'd love to see what you guys make and as always thank you for watching the videos been a pleasure sharing this recipe with you and we'll see you later", "Bfgl3ng5MM4": "Hey everybody. It's Sam here from Sugar Spun Run and today I'm showing you how to make giant chocolate chip cookies. Today's giant chocolate chip cookies measure about 5 to 6 inches in diameter. These are huge, and thick, and chewy, with slightly crisp edges, and I think you're\ngoing to absolutely love them. Now to get started, you're going to need a large\nbowl and you're going to want to melt one cup, or two sticks of unsalted butter. Once your butter has cooled, we will add our brown sugar. Now you'll need 1 cup of firmly packed brown sugar for this recipe. You can use light brown sugar, or\nyou can use dark brown sugar. I actually love using a blend of both of them. So\nthis is about half a cup each of dark brown and light brown sugar. That's just\na personal preference. Either one will be fine in this recipe. We'll also add 3/4\ncup of granulated sugar, and just use a spatula to stir the butter and the sugar\ntogether until they're completely combined. One of the great things about\nthis recipe is because it uses melted butter you do not need a stand mixer to make this. Now we'll add our eggs. My recipe uses 1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk. We're adding that extra yolk and we're omitting that other white because\nwe want our cookies to be nice, and soft, and chewy, and tender, and adding an extra\nyolk does just this for our recipe. Another important thing to note is that\nyou want your eggs to be at room temperature. This is important because\nwe've melted our butter. Our ingredients in our bowl are at least at room\ntemperature. If not slightly warmer. If we add cold eggs we're going to shock our\nbatter, and our ingredients are not going to be as nicely incorporated as you want\nthem to be. We'll stir in 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. This is looking pretty good, so we're going to set our wet ingredients aside, and you're\ngoing to need a separate bowl for your dry ingredients. We're going to start\nwith 2 and 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour. We'll also add a tablespoon of corn\nstarch, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Stir your dry ingredients together until everything is completely combined. So our dry ingredients are nicely combined so let's bring back our wet ingredients. We'll gradually add the dry ingredients into our wet ingredients. and stir everything together until our\nbatter is completely combined. The last thing we need to add to our cookie dough\nis our chocolate chips. Now you'll need about one and a half cups of chocolate\nchips. You can just use regular semi-sweet chocolate chips, or even milk\nchocolate chips. That'll be fine. I actually like to use a blend of\nsemi-sweet chocolate chips of different sizes. So I'm adding 1/2 cup of regular\nsemi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 1/2\ncup of jumbo semi-sweet chocolate chips. And we'll stir these into our dough. Our giant chocolate chip cookie dough is now going to need to chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour. It can chill longer than that. If you want to make this the day before, or even several days in advance, that will be totally fine. I'm just gonna cover the bowl with some plastic wrap, and this is off to\nchill in the fridge for one hour. Now about 15 to 20 minutes before you're\nready to bake your cookie dough, you'll want to preheat your oven to 350 degrees\nFahrenheit. Now my oven has been preheating for a while, and my cookie\ndough is now chilled, and ready to bake. So we can go ahead and start scooping this. Each of these giant chocolate chip cookies is going to need about 1/2 cup of batter. I'm actually going to be using an ice cream scoop instead of a\ntraditional cookie scoop to scoop this batter, but even this isn't quite enough.\nI'm going to need to make heaping spoonfuls. That way I have a 1/2 cup of\nbatter per cookie. Now if you let your cookie dough chill for longer than an\nhour, you might notice that it's a little bit hard to scoop. It'll probably be\npretty firm. So if you let it chill for a really long time, you can let it sit at\nroom temperature for about 15 minutes or so just to soften it enough so that you\ncan scoop it. So this is about how much dough we want per cookie. Now one thing I really recommend doing is just gently rolling the dough between your palms to\nform it into a ball. Now if you just plop the cookie dough right onto the sheet,\nyou're gonna have some frayed edges that are going to cook really crisp, really\nfast in the oven. Just to ensure that everything cooks pretty evenly you want\nto have a nice round ball. Now this recipe makes some really big cookies. So\nI only usually bake about two cookies on a baking sheet at a time and you want to give these some room because they are going to spread while they're baking. Alright we can take these over to our 350 degrees Fahrenheit preheated oven where they will need to bake for about 14 to 16 minutes. The edges will be a\nnice light to golden-brown and they're finished. These cookies are going to be\nreally fragile while they're still warm, so you're going to want to let them cool completely on the baking sheet before you remove and enjoy them. And that is how you make these giant incredible chocolate-chip cookies. I really hope you guys enjoyed today's recipe video.

So just so you know, we do have a limited\nnumber of autographed book plates, so pre-order now so you don\u2019t miss out. So pre-order and claim your bonus gifts on\nmy website. Right now I\u2019m gonna share with you my 15+\nyears experience working as a professional chef in my brand new Pro Chef Secrets show. Get ready because you\u2019re about to learn\nmy 5 secrets for the ultimate chocolate chip cookie. So first things first, the star of the show\nhere is my best ever chocolate chip cookie dough. You guys have rated this on my website with\nover four and a half stars and a thousand comments, it\u2019s definitely a fan favorite. The written recipe can be found on Bigger\nBolder Baking.com So the first secret is probably the most important when it comes to making\nmy cookie dough, chill your dough. Once you make it, put it in the fridge for\na minimum of one hour. What happens is the butter solidifies and\nhardens so when you put it in the hot oven it melts slowly, If you bake your cookie dough\noff straight away, they\u2019ll just get really flat and I\u2019ve seen a lot of pictures like\nthat, you just want to make sure you chill your dough. So I\u2019ve got a little bonus secret for you,\nthere\u2019s a thing called aging your dough. So like I said you can put it in the fridge\nfor a minimum of an hour, but you could also leave it in your fridge for up to seven days. Now during this time the dough develops, the\nflavor gets better, the texture gets better, the flavor gets more concentrated, so you\nend up with a much nicer cookie, I always leave my dough in the fridge for up to seven\ndays. So here\u2019s secret number two, you want to\nscoop your cookie dough with a quarter cup measure. It might seem like it\u2019s a little bit big,\nhowever, the timing that we bake our cookie dough is based on the size, we need everything\nto be the same to get the exact results I did. So we have our nice big quarter cup scoop,\nlets get it into the palm of your hand, and shape it into a circle, a nice little ball\nof dough, like that, then put it straight on your baking tray. You want that nice round size because this\nis gonna make a difference when we bake our cookies. So tip number three, don\u2019t flatten out your\ncookies. I know it\u2019s really easy when you\u2019re making\ncookies to flatten them out with your hand, but if you do that with this dough you\u2019ll\nmake them spread out and you\u2019ll end up with really flat cookies and that\u2019s not what\nwe\u2019re going for here. So just leave them in the nice shape that\nthey are and in the oven they\u2019ll do their thing and work themselves out. So remember tip number one about chilling\nyour cookie dough? Well what I like to do is after I\u2019ve scooped\nthem, put them back in the fridge, for around 30 minutes to get nice and cold again before\nwe bake them off. So secret number four, bake at a high temperature\nfor a short amount of time. So the reason we do this is because the hot\noven will give you a crispy outside, and the short amount of time will give you doughy\nand gooey in the middle which is what you want from the ultimate chocolate chip cookie. Bake your cookies off at 375\u02da F or 190\u02da\nC for roughly 15-17 minutes. When I originally made this recipe I said\nbake them for 12 minutes, but recently they\u2019ve been taking longer so just keep a close eye\non them. So our cookies are hot out of the oven and\nhere\u2019s our secret number five, it\u2019s called the Pan Bang and it\u2019s taken the internet\nby storm. So what you do is with hot cookies, take the\ntray and bang it against a cold counter. So what happens is your cookie falls and creates\nthese lovely crinkle crackles on top, it also redistributes the chocolate so you end up\nwith these pools of chocolate all over your cookie, So there you have it, once you follow\nmy five easy tips this is what you end up with, the ultimate chocolate chip cookie. Crispy on the outside and doughy, gooey in\nthe middle. This is heaven, absolute cookie heaven. Head over to my website for this awesome recipe\nand let me know in the comments below which pro chef secrets you\u2019d like to see. I\u2019ll see you back here soon for more Bigger\nBolder Baking.", "bkXWYnQ8ITo": "today on training versus traditional we'll be making two different versions of the same dish this specific episode we are going to be making arguably the greatest treat that's ever existed it is never not a good time to have a chocolate-chip cookie you're gonna be making a trendy chocolate-chip cookie whatever that means stay tuned good luck you're at first right yes I am all right go now yes so we're actually making chocolate chip cookie shot glasses or just chocolate chip cookie cups I got the idea from chef Dominique Ansel who actually created this recipe I think my role in this show is to just be boring but good that's what I'm gonna try and aim for with these chocolate chip cookies now we're gonna try and hit a really nice pun intended sweet spot not too chewy not too cakey not too crispy I have my ingredients out I have my butter eggs flour brown sugar white sugar vanilla and a lot of chocolate so I would say in terms of ingredients there's nothing out of the ordinary baking is a little trickier for me because you have to be a little more precise with your ingredients to me I always think of baking as more of a science but it's gonna be pretty simple we're gonna have dry ingredients and wet ingredients into the oven cookie time okay let's do this this butter has been sitting at room temperature just dice it up I'm just gonna smush this a little bit oh yeah that's what you want you see that not that satisfying now that this is super soft we're gonna add in the white sugar and then we have the brown sugar also tossing that in now we're just gonna clean this together it would have been a lot easier if I was doing this on a stand mixer sometimes when you work harder that cookie also tastes the better sweat and tears everyone you have my word that at some point during this recipe I will get flour all over my tropical shirt so we're doing two and a quarter cup of flour to start so I'm gonna be a nice boy and measure out oh ha not my floral shirt but very close the flower was warning me do not mess around okay it's looking a little bit fluffier that's a good sign I think that that's well incorporated now that the butter and sugar is done we're gonna add in the eggs boom two eggs cup number two oh boy alright so that's two and a quarter enough goofing off baking soda scares me because I only associate baking soda with the science project that everyone made where you pour it into a volcano and the idea of putting that into a recipe always it doesn't sit well with me [Music] gentle discs put this in there I think salt we're gonna take a little bit of a creative Liberty oh and that's will do more than three so now that we have our wet ingredients pretty much ready to go we're just gonna add the dry ingredients so I have flour here baking soda and a bit of salt soda just a generous sprinkle we're gonna take it up a notch it's gonna get a little more exciting we're gonna involve some heavy machinery basically what we're doing is we're gonna put butter sugar and eggs into this stand mixer and swirl it all together so now that we have dry ingredients we're going to sift it we just want to stir it enough for it to combine with the wet ingredients if you mix it too much it's actually going to become too tough there's nothing wrong with being a tough cookie but I like mine softer and chewy we are going to go very aggressive with the butter butter and salt where is this gonna go wrong it's not those are two things that make everything better stick and a half we're gonna heat it up a little bit in the microwave when you do that it's important to let the butter then cool back down a little bit you don't want scrambled egg cookies that's pretty good I know there's still some flour on the surface here but start to toss in the chocolate so we have a stick and a half of butter that's going into our stand mixer I am so bad at measuring do you see this 2/3 of a cup of white granulated sugar fractions are tough guys oh boy little spillage these are gonna be sweet I'm actually gonna cut up these chocolate chunks they're both just semi-sweet here we go there's really no reason why you shouldn't use chocolate chips I just like it when it's like chocolate chunks or chocolate shavings she's more fun give it a whirl Hey she's uh she's a wild one here are our chocolate pieces I'm gonna toss that right in boom chocolate explosion hello we found a smaller piece so now the robotic uprising has been quelled that looks like it's supposed to I'll talk into the microphone so you can hear me over the machine now we're gonna let this run for a couple minutes you want the butter and sugar to get nice and creamy I love how this looks it's almost turns it's like part of the dough into chocolate which is great because more chocolate I love that I'm actually gonna let it rest for an hour let it chill in the fridge then we're gonna take it out and roll it out and then we can take it from there now we're gonna put our eggs in one egg give it a whisk second egg a little of this goes a long white conv nil smells so good I am a big vanilla boy I've already made it farther in this recipe than I thought I would it looks like cookie dough so these are gonna turn into cookies here we go rest of the dry ingredients so this has been chilling in the fridge for an hour so the idea is to mold this a little bit and then roll it out into a sheet so then we can cut out rectangular pieces which will then put their pieces into this mold it's supposed to roll this out into like one and a half inch thickness I'm using every single fiber of my being and muscle just cut this open it's a little easier to work with that aside so I don't want my cookie comes to be too thick but I don't want them to be too thin either so they're actually like pretty big cookie pieces if you're just looking at this last but not least the I think I do this every episode whatever whatever my most crucial tool slash ingredient is I display it like a fine bottle of wine semi-sweet morsels I hate the word morsels it makes it sound like I'm an old witch dump all all feels like so much and then we're not even gonna turn on the mixer we're just gonna like combine okay so now I have our six pieces I'm going to go ahead and put it in a mold I actually think I'm gonna form little balls to put on the end and then squishing them down like that try to just fold it in I'm just gonna put it in you guys didn't do this right but it's okay it's okay we see a lot of extra bits right now extra cookie dough we can always just trim that off we got this that's sort of what our first one looks like I love cookie dough so much it's like it's almost as good as cookie and this is gonna be a pretty good indication of where we're gonna end up here's two salmonella [Music] oh I'm not like proud of myself it's butter sugar and chocolate this kind of feels like when you're playing with play-doh you know you're just shaping it into whatever you want to do with it now we just have these little holds back we're actually gonna push into this cookie dough so that it can keep its shape [Music] gently hammering this in boom we're gonna pop this in the oven now hopefully when we pull it out it's actually gonna look like cups I don't know how I think these cookies should be pretty big we're gonna this I think that looks okay right that's gonna be too is that too much I don't want to take this out of the oven and it's like one sheet cooking the cookie shots are out they don't look exactly identical but you can see that they are cup shapes I've never done this before so I'm just glad that it looks like a cup shape I'm pretty pleased with how these look if you asked me to draw a picture of a chocolate chip cookie this is pretty close I'm just gonna coat the insides of chocolate because again extra chocolate is always great but also it helps the milk from kind of soaking too much into the cookie and making it overly soggy that looks awesome thank you yes it does that looks good today has been doing a lot and a lot of videos on cookie so there's really no better person than to critique does it say cookie master on his LinkedIn page hello hello what do we have here welcome to the cookie dough this is really interesting this is a chocolate-covered chocolate chip cookie shot glass with vanilla milk because that's what we have Anila milk yeah I didn't explain that but yes there is Manila in here I had to this is I'm just trying to do what the og person did that's what chef Dominic are you comforting me already I'm very excited to eat your cookie Chris fine it's okay this is a chocolate chip cookie and that's all I have to say all right here we go starting in traditional land like a very solid talk like that noise that's a good noise too I like the salt did you put salt in it I didn't put salt on it hi-five had this one it's a great solid cookie I'm gonna try the trendy one now because it looks really cool oh that's fun nice Wow so it's like you can drink your milk and then you can yes - yeah trendy all right here we go mmm it's so fun [Music] are you gonna take a shot when you get up we don't get points for your fun right but you got it you got an M and this is moon I'm s got it so yeah I'm sweating this so cool I have my decision so from a flavor point of view I think both of yours are great out of five points to give you a four and out of five points I also give you a four different I think they're really cool from a presentation point of view yours is like you know when you come home you're comfort in your mom sets the plate down you're like yes thanks mom I give you also give you a fork from your point of view I think this is a cool trendy way to present a cookie you're gonna get a 5 so the winner will be the trendy cookie as someone who loves cookies as much as anybody else I think the texture the presentation vanilla milk just knocked it out of the park but you did congratulations to the winner and I'm gonna go so this episode is done trendy takes this battle let us know in the comments which type of food we should pit against each other next see you guys next week [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "42fmCChjBJg": "hey guys so today I want to see if we can take our sourdough starter and somehow turn that into the most delicious Joshu cookie so I think it's safe to say that sourdough has taken lockdown life by storm everybody and their grandmother seems to be making a sourdough stout there and whether you've been following along my old videos from last year on my bake along from Instagram earlier on in the year so many of you thousands of you have been sending me pictures every day of your lives and it's the best thing but if you're not gonna make a loaf every day this thing still stays hungry and needs feeding which means there's also waste biggest questions I've been getting is what do we do with the waste thankfully we can bake with it [Music] so once your tacit is nice and fit you end up with this this is your sour note discard it starter that we're not going to use to make bread and right now if I only have to come by so this is pretty wasteful so we can bake with it but not in the traditional sense I'm not going to use it for its yeasted properties but just for its flavor that extra tangy might give a recipe now thankfully substituting it into another recipe is not that complicated because if you think about it a starter is 50% water and 50% flour so you can easily make that substitution say with a pancake recipe very straightforward you take the stuff that you have you divide it by two and you take up that amount of flour and that amount of liquid and you replace it with our starter it's fairly straightforward with choc chip cookies we have a problem because cookies don't have any water or do they so the ingredients you cookie are pretty standard there's nothing unusual it's all the usual suspects things like flour sugar and nothing complicated and really there's no additional liquid so we can't just take out a liquid so how do we get rid of water in a recipe that doesn't seem to contain water well actually there is two elements in this recipe that's actually very easy to eliminate water from and the first is butter I hope you forgive me for a second as I get a little bit nerdy but this is very simple to understand and it does help so very European style butter which is a standard ingredient includes about 82% butter fat and that's fairly standard across Europe some were a little bit higher generally 82% is the best standard the rest of it that 18% extra is water and it's really easy to eliminate that through browning so we're going to brown the butter which also makes it extra delicious so it's well worth doing so if this is 225 grams of unsalted butter and we want to eliminate 18% of it or we Brown it we're aiming to have 185 grams of butter remaining and that means it's offer no water and that lost that 18% can we replaced with sourdough starter so we're gonna put 225 grams of butter into our pan they're gonna burn on it and then we can see how much we have left at the end of it so those of you who have never brown butter before what we're gonna do is we're gonna place the butter over a medium or so heat in a pan we're gonna cook it until you start to see nice carmelization in the butter you'll see these little brown bits and the butter has taken on a nutty flavor and a slightly brown color you'll also be able to hear it as we go along okay so now that our butter is melted you can see it's gonna start to foam and if your listen that bubbly noise which is not as normal as kind of bubbling water is actually the water from the butter trying to escape and evaporating away and that's where has that kind of like popping noise because it's fat and water together so what we're gonna do is keep it going until these white pieces out on the surface sink to the bottom and then caramelize and by that point it's going to stop this kind of fast aggressive bubbling we shouldn't cut off all the water [Music] so what's the first ingredient you might have guests included water the second ingredient that has the guest is not the first thing that will jump to mind and that's because it's the eggs now the egg white in this is what includes water ninety percent of an egg white is water so just by eliminating the egg white that helps us to get more water to play around with now from years and years and thousands on thousands of macarons made I can tell you that UK sized large egg is basically 40 grams worth of egg white so two of those in this recipe means we have eighty grams worth of liquid removed from our recipe and plus the 40 grams of water weight we lost in the butter that means we have a total of 120 grams to play with now that doesn't mean we can just add 120 grams of starter because remember I start as 50% flour and 50% water so that actually means we can add 240 grams of starter but it also means we have to remove half of that as flour so 120 grams of flour from the recipe also has to be removed I know this is sounding super complicated but I've done the math you don't have to follow the recipe you're gonna Brown the butter you're gonna remove your egg whites super simple I promise also you might be wondering why I'm not using the cookie recipe I developed during the pudding Chronicles last year and the reason for that is that recipe already used brown butter so it was harder to eliminate water from a recipe without making more complicated changes so what I'm actually using is this recipe it's from my first book which you can tell was a very long time ago and the reason for that is it's a recipe I know inside out and it's also a classic recipe that uses at creamed butter and sugar so it's easier to find the water to eliminate and talking about good timing look what just arrived or look at the name what was just alright so this is from a pump Street chocolate they are a bakery and truffle company down in a tiny village and I'm talking literally tiny there's a bakery a church a restaurant a hotel a pub I think that's it it's so small it's on the coast in a place called Alford and they are a small bakery with a very big reputation and that chocolate company is even bigger that chocolate is incredible so this is something really fun and I cannot wait to put it in this recipe to make the actual cookie is really straightforward all we're gonna do is take our ever so slightly cold brown butter have that to our mixer now obviously we can't cream this beat the butter and sugar together because it's liquid so what we're gonna do is just whisk everything to combine just briefly not obviously that doesn't really do much we just want to bring everything together then we're gonna add our egg yolks and that should help bring everything into slightly smoother make so we're gonna add our egg yolks I'm adding just one extra just to help make the mixture a little bit more fudgy we're just gonna whisk that again to combine so after couple minutes whisking it will look a little bit gross it might look like it's kind of split it will look a bit wet and we are adding a little bit of air but our main function of doing this whisking is just to break up any lumps of sugar and just make sure everything is nicely combined now at this stage we need to weigh in our discard so we're going to use 240 grams I'm just gonna add that straight to our bowl at this stage I'm also just gonna add about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and we're just gonna whisk it to combine I'm using the whisk because it will combine easier then using the paddle it'll be a lot quicker [Music] so you can already see just after a minute of mixing it already looks a little bit more like a cookie dough so all we need to do now is add our remaining dry ingredients so to this we're gonna have a flour salt baking powder and baking soda remembering that we've already removed our excess flour our hundred 20 grams that is in the starter so this stage I'm just gonna pulse just on short bursts just until everything is hydrated and once the dough just stuff to come together like that in take our chocolate which nicely chopped and we're just gonna add that to the bowl and again mix that just until it's good and that is I finished so dark chocolate cookie dough so once our cookie dough is made once we could bake this now it is better if we refrigerate it for at least four hours it will control the spread and it will just make a better texture of cookie now because we have added sourdough starter the dough will continue to ferment so depending on how long you leave it will depend on the flavor of the end cookie I like to bake them after about four hours but they will develop more and more of that sour Tang for long you leave them so if you leave them to 24 hours you look at get more of the Tang but will be even more delicious after about 4 hours or so a coca dough is really nice and firm it's all we're gonna do is roll that into bowls and bake them so I like to do 70 grams size bowls and that's just means you get a good size cookie you can do this by eye kind of rolling them to kind of golf ball-sized pieces but I like to weigh them so they're all the exactly the same size and your baked in the same time so all we're gonna do is just cut some of the dough with a spoon just scoop out and then roll it into a ball if the dough gets super soft to join this dating it's really warm you can throw it back in the fridge but we shouldn't need to we should be able to bake them straight away now to finish the cookies I'm going to sprinkle them with a little bit of flaked sea salt obviously you can leave that off but because we're adding that sourdough starter that discard I find it adds a bit more Tang and salt really helps to balance everything out to balance the sweetness and just bring out all those flavors now gonna put them in the oven for about 16 to 18 minutes in an oven that's been preheated to 350 degrees it's 180 or 160 on a fan oven we just want to bake them until they're nice and golden around the outside so after 16 to 18 minutes this is what you get the most delicious looking chocolate chip cookies they look super classic but inside them lies a little secret and that is Tang and deliciousness from the sourdough starter puddles of chocolate so delicious and just I can't tell you how good they are and it is such a good use of this out of this card it uses a couple of days worth of discard is a really easy recipe to do and once you learn how to do it it really teaches you how to swap out that discard in other recipes so it's well worth playing around with I hope you enjoyed the video as always the recipe it's linked up in the corner or down in the description box below make sure you are subscribed because I'll be making new baking videos every single week including next weekend a sourdough pizza recipe that is so delicious don't leave me a comment down below what your favorite topping would be or sourdough pizza until this week I'll see you later [Music]", "xzFtVPOn7Sk": "these are my best ever vegan chocolate chip cookies so I really wanted to create a vegan version of chocolate chip cookies because there's such a classic dessert so to replace an egg in a cookie all I needed to use in the cookies was almond milk but if you need something that's gonna like find your dessert a little bit more you can use a flax egg you can use apple sauce you can use banana there are so many options and so many substitutes for eggs and vegan recipes so it's super super easy so you absolutely do not need animal products to make a delicious vegan dessert all you really need is flour some kind of fat like oil and sugar and it's gonna taste amazing people really think you need eggs and you need butter but like you really don't so when I made this cookie I really wanted to stand up to any non vegan chocolate chip cookie and I really think I accomplished that I gave it to my coworkers didn't tell them it was vegan I just said hey I made some cookies you guys want some and they were like these are amazing and then when I told them they were vegan they were like how is that possible so after you pull these cookies out of the oven and you let them cool they're going to be perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside and in my opinion that's exactly the texture you want for a cookie I think I ate about a thousand of these when I I think I gained like 5 pounds when I was shooting this video because I kept trying to get that perfect pull apart break of the cookie and I think it took me I'm not exaggerating I think I had to go through like 60 cookies to get it I was just making more making more eating more and when you like pull it apart and you have it in your hand you just and it's something that's that delicious you put it in your mouth and you're like oh my god I'm eating like thousands of calories of cookies right now but I cannot stop because it's taste like magic I have had people that I don't even know tell me that they've made these cookies and it honestly it makes me feel really good this is one of those recipes that I'm really proud of it's like a go-to recipe for me and I make them at least like I make them every Christmas and it's just like become a staple now for me so give them a try and you won't be sorry you think a lot of people associate vegan food with being healthy and that's just not the case like sugar is vegan or different kinds of sweeteners are vegan and oil is vegan and flour is vegan and if you have those things you can make anything taste delicious the bottom line is these cookies are better for the animals they're better for the environment and they taste incredible so why not give them a try [Music] you [Music]", "TzMoj2JeANQ": "[Music] Oh [Music]", "rJuQV9sS3xw": "Today, on Sugar Spun Run, I'll be showing you how to make chocolate chip cookie bars If you guys are anything like me, then I know you love a good chocolate chip cookie recipe, however, if you are also anything like me, sometimes you might feel a little bit lazy and maybe you don't feel like taking the time to chill your cookie dough or Portion out your cookie dough one scoop at a time. While you can sometimes Take just any chocolate chip cookie recipe and bake it in a pan with no problem, I've developed recipe for you that is Perfect for baking in a pan. Do please keep in mind though that you cannot take this recipe and use it to make regular cookies. If you're looking for a great cookie recipe, I have a very popular \"worst\" chocolate chip cookie recipe that you should definitely check out. We'll start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit Next you'll need 1 cup or 2 sticks of unsalted butter go ahead and you'll want to cut this into tablespoon sized pieces and Place the butter in a large microwave safe bowl and heat it in the microwave until the butter is completely melted Once the butter is melted, we're going to add one cup of tightly packed light or dark brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white sugar Now stir the butter and sugar together until they're well combined and now we'll add the eggs. You're going to need two large eggs and one egg yolk for this recipe. That extra yolk is going to help make your cookies nice and soft and chewy Stir everything together again until it's really well combined. Now add a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract. Now set this aside and we'll prepare our dry ingredients. We're going to start with two and a half cups of all-purpose flour And then we will add two teaspoons of corn starch. As with the egg yolk This corn starch is going to help make your cookies nice and chewy Now add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt and whisk these together until they're well combined. We will add our dry ingredients to our wet ingredients. Finally we'll add our chocolate chips. This recipe calls for two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I like to add most of the chocolate chips But I reserved a handful of them to sprinkle over the top of the chocolate chip cookie bars before they go into the oven, that's optional, But I think it makes them look extra pretty. Now spread your chocolate chip cookie dough batter Into a 9 by 13 pan that's been lined with parchment paper. Spread the batter evenly into your pan and then top with your remaining chocolate chips Now we will bake these cookie bars on 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 25 to 30 minutes or until the edges are nice and golden-brown and the center is cooked. I usually like to insert a toothpick in the center of the bars and make sure that it comes out without any wet batter, that's how you can tell it's done. You don't want to bake these chocolate chip cookie bars too long though, or they will not be nice and soft and chewy Which is what we are aiming for. Allow them to cool for at least 15 to 20 minutes. I like to serve my warm, topped with a scoop of ice cream, but that's not required You can just slice them and eat them like regular cookies. That's it, no portioning out your cookie dough, no waiting for anything to chill. All you have to do is mix up your dough, drop it in a pan, and bake it and you have these delicious soft, chewy chocolate chip cookie bars. I hope you guys will try this out and please let me know what you think. Leave a comment, I always appreciate it and I will see you next time", "8eRIZDcmaYs": "now nanny this cookie is gluten-free hey guys I'm blonde I got a problem I wasn't able to find regular flour at the store and I really want to make chocolate chip cookies my body is like 97% cookie by this point I figured I would call my good friend and pastry chef extraordinaire Erin Jean mcdowell she is a queen in every sense of the word she's really been a go-to for me for like what can I substitute where Erin was able to take the iconic New York Times chocolate chip cookie and make it more accessible for people which is great let's get on the phone and call Erin and get bacon [Music] mom's a proud Gryffindor it's very cute hi how are you I'm so good how are you I'm feeling particularly good today cuz I'm not wearing pajamas this was really the first time I've ever been asked to develop a recipe based on somebody else's recipe so the real challenge was trying to make sure that these stood up to the main thing this one was a doozy if I started out with something like eight different flours we're talking about many dozens of cookies walking down the street like tossing cookies in the air like I can definitely attest that you do not have to be gluten free to appreciate these cookies but if you are gluten free you're going to appreciate them even more because you can't just run to the store and grab a chocolate chip cookie as easily and for me the number one thing about almond flour is it's the easiest to find a lot of alternative flowers because if you can't find it in the store you can make it yourself with almonds you wouldn't necessarily know that it had not without me telling you I was constantly surprised because all the taste testers liked it the best of some that I gave them so then I was like okay we're onto something and truly I like it this way because it feels like the exciting days of radio I can't see what's going on down below oh that isn't what I meant by down below I just meant the goal is your butter at room temperature Oh based on your dewy skin I assume it is room temperature because very warm well and I wanted to give one little tidbit for people who always forget to soften the butter I put the whole stick into the microwave still in its wrapper you microwave it for 10 seconds and then you rotate it on the other side and do 5 to 10 seconds more and it'll be perfectly room temp Oh chefs kiss great creamy I usually start at a lower speed just to kind of get things combined but eventually you're gonna want to raise it up to more of a medium speed to really get that aeration when my husband and I moved in together that's how we knew we were meant to be together because we have the same color stand mixer that's really yes I think it looks great and we're already halfway home friends Wow this is wild I mean this recipe comes together and be quickly as a good chocolate chip cookie recipe shape because we want to get from zero to cookie like as quickly amen do you have your chocolate like all ready to go I got chopped that is a good question and no I started to take it out of the foil and as you can see I not made it yeah when I call her chocolate belt they can use chocolate chips and the answer is you usually can use chocolate chips almost anywhere that chopped chocolate is called for the main difference is that chocolate chips have these stabilizers in them that will help them keep their chip shape after baking the main reason that I think chopped chocolate is the best is that you get these uneven chocolate hock it kind of also makes for a crag layer cookie which is kind of for me one of the more desirable traits of chocolate-chip cookies in particular visible puddles of chocolate on the surface of the cookie and on the inside puddles of chocolate Wow my band's name hi sweet boy he's like you woke me up from a nap whatever oh yeah there was go ahead and put the dry ingredients in and mix them until they're combined if you have like a clean kitchen towel around when you go to turn on the mixer you can drape it over the mixer instead of going all over your counter and all over the mixer it'll kind of get trapped and go right back into the bowl kitchen towel with macarons on it you oh another appropriate treat if you can't find flour because guess what they're made with almond flour you just go ahead and add your chocolate and mix it until it's you know uniformly combined as well and then we ready to scoop scoop show me mine that's the one yep and then that's exactly what I do I scrape it along the edge but I also don't care if there's some little like nubbins around the edge yeah like that because I think that that makes again for craggly cookies david describes it as the size of generous golf balls because they are they're like it's a racquetball that's how I Drive it generous golf ball is also a good band name very good I found that giving these cookies a little bit of a help so that they don't stay mounded it just helps them spread a little more uniformly just pressing them down snitch they look almost like little hamburger patties okay that should be exactly what they look like yes just like that I can't remember when it was originally published but it's definitely one of the earlier recipes that had you know such a generous quantity of the flaky salt and that's another great reason

"biripgdyfjU": "Hey everyone. It's Sam here from SugarSpunRun.com and today I'm showing you how to make mint chocolate cookies, loaded with Andes candies. In honor of upcoming St. Patrick's Day, I thought it might be a good idea to do something at least a little bit green for the blog. So I thought it was also about time I share a mint chocolate cookie recipe. Today's cookie recipe is made using Andes candies. You probably know these mint chocolate candies. I love them and it's very simple to make. So if you like mint and chocolate, you're going to love today's cookie recipe. To begin, you're going to need 1 cup of unsalted butter, and you're going to want to go ahead and melt this. Now once you've melted it, it's very important that you let it cool for at least 10 to 15 minutes, because we don't want to add our sugar, or any other ingredients, until that butter has had a little bit of time to cool down. My butter has had some time to cool, so I'm going to add my sugar, starting with 1 cup of tightly packed light brown sugar. And we'll also add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar. Just stir these together until it's completely combined Next we'll add our eggs. So you're going to need 1 large egg and 1 large egg yolk for this recipe. I love tossing an extra yolk in my cookie dough. It makes for tender chewy cookies We'll also add one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract. Stir everything together. Once you've prepped your wet ingredients, you're going to want a separate bowl for combining your dry ingredients. We're going to start with 2 and 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour. Add a tablespoon of cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt Use a spoon or a whisk to stir the dry ingredients together until they're completely combined. Now bring back your butter mixture. We're just going to gradually add our flour mixture to our wet ingredients until completely combined. Now we will need a cup of chopped candy pieces, and to get to a cup, that's usually 28 of those small Andes candy bars. So I'm going to add these into my dough, and just for some extra chocolate I'm also going to add 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. Of course, we'll want to stir these in. This dough is going to need to chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes. So I'm just gonna cover it with some plastic wrap, and we'll let this dough chill. About 15 minutes before your dough has finished chilling, you're going to want to go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. My oven is preheated and now my dough is finished chilling, so we can go ahead and scoop this. I'm going to be scooping my cookie dough into about one and a half tablespoon size cookie dough balls. We're gonna space these cookies about two inches apart, because they are going to spread some in the oven. You can bake your cookies just like this, but because I like mine to look pretty, with nice rounded edges. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to briefly roll them in my hands. So they have nice smooth edges. We'll take these over to our 350 degree fahrenheit oven where they'll need to bake for about 11 minutes. Let these cookies cool completely on their baking sheet before enjoying. And that is how easy it is to make these mint chocolate cookies. They are soft and chewy and I really think that if you are a mint chocolate lover, you are going to absolutely, go crazy for these. If you guys try this cookie recipe out, I would really appreciate knowing how you like it. What you think of it? Please leave me a comment. Thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time. Hey if you guys enjoyed today's recipe, I would really appreciate it if you gave me a thumbs up.

Cheesecakes come in all different shapes and\nsizes. However, this bold cheesecake is like no other. It has a giant cookie on the bottom, cream\ncheesy filling, and gorgeous, tiny little cookie sprinkles on top. So let\u2019s get started! So the beauty of this cheesecake is that every\npart is cookie\u2014every single layer. We\u2019re going to start out with the base,\nas you normally do, with our cookie layer. Unlike a traditional cheesecake, where you\nbreak up cookies, like Oreos or graham crackers, we are going to make one big giant cookie\nfor the base of this cheesecake. It\u2019s going to be delicious. So, you can use store-bought cookie dough\nif you want to. However, I\u2019ve got a really easy recipe on\nmy website, BiggerBolderBaking.com, one of the best cookie doughs you will ever taste. So I recommend you use that. Here it is. And all you want to do is take your room temperature\ncookie dough. Then just push it into the base of your cheesecake\ntin. The cheesecake tin that I am using is 9 inches,\nand I am going to put a link on my website of where you can buy one. A cheesecake tin is so important in your kitchen. And that\u2019s it! That\u2019s the base for our cheesecake\u2014really,\nreally easy, no food processor needed. Now what you want to do is pop it onto a tray\nand bake it in the oven until it\u2019s golden brown. My kitchen smells like chocolate chip cookies,\nand my timer just went off, so I\u2019m pretty sure our base is done. For my chocolate chip cookies, they\u2019re always\nbest when you under-bake them, so you get a lovely, gooey middle, so I suggest doing\nthat for your cheesecake. So I\u2019m going to set this guy aside, let\nit cool down, and we\u2019re going to start making our filling. To make a cheesecake, the most important ingredient\nis cream cheese. And I\u2019m very happy to tell you that after\nhundreds of comments, I have a Bold Baking Basics video of how you can make your own\ncream cheese. The results are fantastic and all you need\nis two ingredients. So for those of you who can\u2019t buy it, I\nreally hope you try and make it, so then you can make all of my recipes that contain cream\ncheese. So this guy is going to go into the mixture. For making cheesecakes, make sure your cream\ncheese is at room temperature because it will whip up so much better. For our cream cheese, we are going to add\nin some brown sugar. Brown is preferable because chocolate chip\ncookies are generally made with a molasses-y kind of brown sugar, so that\u2019s why you use\nthat, but if you don\u2019t have brown, you can always use white. Next, we\u2019re going to add in some vanilla\nextract. I love vanilla extract, and I think it\u2019s\na really important flavor in cookies. Now, turn your machine on to a medium-high\nspeed, and whip it up really well to get rid of any lumps in there. If need be, stop the machine, go in with a\nspatula, and just scrape down the sides. So our cream cheese has been beating up for\na few minutes, and you can see that it is lovely and smooth. You want to make sure that all the lumps are\nout before you add in your cream, because otherwise they won\u2019t work themselves out. So get it out at this stage, and you won\u2019t\nhave to worry about them. So to this mix, we\u2019re going to add in our\nwhipping cream. You want to make sure the cream you use is\ngood for whipping, because we need this mix to get nice and stiff. So we\u2019re going to turn the machine back\non to a medium-high speed, and let it all mix together. We want this cream cheese to get really nice\nand stiff, because this cheesecake doesn\u2019t contain eggs or gelatin. We need it to be nice and firm so it will\nset all by itself. I\u2019ve had a lot of questions about adding\ngelatin into the recipe. Cream cheese is different in every country,\nand it is softer in some countries than in others, so I\u2019m going to put notes on BiggerBolderBaking.com,\non the recipe, so you know if you want to add in gelatin, if you can do so, and when. So that\u2019s it. It just takes a few minutes on a machine. You can also use a hand-mixer. It\u2019s hard to do this by hand, but if you\nhave a lot of elbow grease, a lot of strength, then you can. Well just look at that: lovely, thick cream\ncheese, and cream. This is perfect. This is the texture that we want. So the very last thing we\u2019re going to add\ninto our cheesecake filling are chocolate chips, an essential part of a cookie. It\u2019s going to make its way into our filling. Fold these in very gently. It just takes a few seconds. Now our cheesecake filling is ready to go\ninto our tin. I have my cookie base; it\u2019s nice and cold. And I have my delicious filling. So now this guy goes straight into the tin,\nand just spread him out all over your cookie. Lastly, I like to tap my cheesecake, on the\ncounter, and that releases any air bubbles, and it also smoothens them out on top. So that\u2019s it! That is our cheesecake. It took no time at all to make this guy, and\nit is going to be delicious, I can already tell. So I\u2019m going to cover him in some cling\nwrap. Now because this cheesecake contains no gelatin\nand no eggs, we\u2019re going to leave him in the refrigerator for that little bit longer,\nso I\u2019m going to leave him in there overnight so he\u2019s really nice and firm for serving. So to top our cheesecake off, I have something\nreally special that you have probably never seen before: cookie sprinkles. You roll up your dough really small, bake\nthem off, and the results are the mini-est of mini-est of cookies. They\u2019re bigger than sprinkles, but just\nlook at how cute they are. Who wouldn\u2019t want to see this on top of\ntheir dessert? So here\u2019s a cheesecake I made yesterday\nbecause I wanted one that was nice and set for you. I\u2019m going to take it out of its tin. I\u2019m pretty proud of this guy, Like everything\non Bigger Bolder Baking, he has to be dressed up, decorated to look even more fantastic. I have some freshly whipped cream here in\na piping bag, and with a star nozzle, I\u2019m just going to pipe some lovely, big rosettes,\nall around the top of my cake. Now it\u2019s time to bring back our cookie sprinkles. I\u2019m going to place them on the top, right\nin the middle, as many as you want. Don\u2019t be shy with our cookie sprinkles. And then, of course, on top of each rosette\nof cream. This is definitely a commitment to cookie. Everywhere you look, there is something cookie. This is my first time making this dessert,\nand I had a picture in my head. But I\u2019m actually surprised it came out looking\nlike the picture in my head! This is fantastic. Now, because I went to all this trouble to\nmake it, I\u2019m going to cut myself a slice. Look at that. Look at all those lovely layers of cookie\nthat we created: that gooey base, that thick cream cheese filling, and then the little\ncookie sprinkles on top, and then of course a little bit of cream to add texture. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve done so many episodes\nand I\u2019ve never put a cookie on the bottom of a cheesecake. I\u2019m a little disappointed in myself. But at least we did it now. I think this has to be one of the best cheesecakes\nI have ever made. Share photos with me of your big and bold\ncreations on my website, and across all my social media.

Today's white chocolate chip cookies are like an inside-out version of classic chocolate chip cookies. These are so good especially if you love a good, soft,\nchocolate cookie. Now this recipe is really simple. There's no mixer required,\nand that's mostly because we're starting with melted butter. You're going to need\n1 cup, or 2 sticks, of melted butter, and this should be unsalted butter. You'll\nwant to melt it in your microwave and then let it cool for about 10 to 15\nminutes before adding any other ingredients. If you add any sugar while\nthis is still too hot you can actually end up melting your sugar and you'll\nhave a runny cookie dough on your hands. Now my butter has already been cooling\nfor about 15 minutes so I can go ahead and add my sugars. We're going to start with 1 and 1/4 cups of tightly packed light brown sugar. And just a 1/2 cup of granulated sugar. Stir together your butter and your sugars until everything\nis completely combined. Now we can add our eggs. You're going to need 1 large\negg, plus 1 egg yolk. Just the yolk for that second one. We're adding this extra yolk because it helps make the cookies tender, and soft, and chewy. We'll also stir in 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract. Now set your wet ingredients aside, and in a separate bowl you're going to need 2 and 1/4 cups of\nall-purpose flour. Add 1/2 cup of natural cocoa powder. 2 teaspoons of cornstarch. 1\nteaspoon of baking powder. 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.\nNow stir everything together until your dry ingredients are completely combined and your cocoa powder is really well integrated into the flour mixture. Now we'll gradually add our dry ingredients into our wet ingredients until the dough is completely combined. Now we can add our chocolate chips. You\nare going to need a total of 2 cups of white chocolate chips. Now only one and a\nhalf cups is going to go into the batter now. We're going to reserve that other\n1/2 cup for later on when they come out of the oven. We're going to press them on\ntop the cookies. I'll show you that in a bit. Now our cookie dough is going to need to chill in the refrigerator for at least 30\nminutes before we can bake it. So I'm just gonna cover this with cling wrap\nand transfer it to the fridge. When your cookie dough has just about finished\nchilling you can go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Once\nit's finished chilling we can go ahead and scoop it and bake it. I'm using a 1\nand 1/2 tablespoon size cookie scoop here, and for a round uniform looking\ncookies, I'm gonna go ahead and just roll the cookie dough between my palms so\nthat it forms a nice uniform ball. These cookies are going to spread as they bake\nso make sure you space them at least 2 inches apart. Alright we can transfer\nour cookies now to our 350 degree Fahrenheit preheated oven where they\nwill need to bake for about 10 to 11 minutes. Now once your cookies have\nfinished baking, remember how we reserved that 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips,\nnow we are going to take these and within one minute of your cookies coming out of the oven I'm just going to gently nestle a few chocolate chips on top. Now this step is optional. If you don't want to do this, you can just toss this 1/2\ncup of white chocolate chips in with the rest of your dough, and stir it in that\nway, but this really makes the white chocolate chips pop. It looks a lot better this way. And that is how you make white chocolate chip cookies from scratch. I really hope you guys enjoyed today's recipe, and if you try this one\nout, please let me know what you think. Thank you so much for watching and I'll\nsee you next time.

Also if you enjoyed today's cookie recipe, here are a few others you might enjoy as well.", "u1qE1nxBSAI": "- Hey, guys. Every great host or hostess has to have an over-the-top chocolate\nchip cookie recipe in their repertoire. It's the kind of thing that can impress a crowd in an instant, and\nI've got just the thing. It's my diabolically delicious\nchocolate chip cookie. They're so good they're evil. We're first going to start\nwith some softened butter. It's really critical to getting a great chocolate chip cookie to\nstart with softened butter. That just means that all\nof your sugar and your eggs and flour are going to\ncombine really well. If you don't start with softened butter, that means they never really combine well, and then the butter\ndoesn't get well disbursed throughout the cookie,\ndoesn't bake up right, you don't get the flavor. Just better to start with\nthe room temperature butter. Then you're going to add your sugar. I like to use a little bit of white sugar and then mostly brown sugar. The reason I do that\nis because brown sugar has molasses in it, and\nthat is going to help those cookies stay nice\nand moist and chewy. Go ahead and whip that\ntogether for at least a good five to six minutes. You want that butter and sugar to really whip up nice and fluffy, so that when you add the eggs, it will combine well. Then you're going to add\na tablespoon of vanilla. I do like to add a lot\nof vanilla to my cookies because it just gives it that wonderful depth of flavor and delicious taste. Then, in a separate bowl,\nyou're going to whisk together some flour, salt and baking soda. Give that good whisk. Then you're slowly going to combine that to your butter mixture. Now, I don't use a lot\nof flour in these cookies because you'll find if\nyou use a lot of flour in a chocolate chip cookie recipe, they tend to turn into like little rocks, and that's not what we want. We want chewy and delicious. That's why I kind of pull\nback a bit on the flour. Now if you ask me, a\ndiabolically delicious chocolate chip cookie has four different components going on. First, we're going to get traditional with our semi-sweet chocolate chips. Need to have those. Then I love to have something chewy in the form of a milk\nchocolate covered raisin. Really, really good. Then you also have those\ntwo chocolates going on, which is nice. Then we need to have something crunchy and a little bit salty in\nthe form of a candied walnut. Then, to really send it over the top and give you one more texture, I love to add some toffee bits. It's just going to make those cookies all the more chewy and\nbuttery and delicious. If you're using a standing\nmixing like I have here, you could just whip that up, just two or three pulses with your mixer. If you don't have a standing mixer, then I would just use a wooden spoon to combine all of the mixings. Now, because these cookies are so good and we've got so much going on in them, we want to make sure\nthey're a good size as well. That way, everybody gets a little bit of all of the different\nflavors and textures, so go ahead and use an ice cream scoop. That will make really\nnice, large-size cookies. Then you're going to pop those in the oven at 350 for exactly 13 minutes. I've tested this recipe several times, and 13 minutes is the magic number, assuming that your oven\nis calibrated properly and runs at exactly 350. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I have a great video for you. Just click the thumbnail, and it'll tell you all\nabout oven calibration. At the 13 minute mark,\nyou're going to pop them out. Let them sit on the tray\nfor another five minutes, because as they sit, that tray is hot, and they will continue to cook. You just don't want to\nlet them cook in the oven because then they'll get too golden brown, and you really just want\nthose centers to set up, and this is the best way to do that. After about five minutes\non that cookie sheet, you'll see, it'll start\nto deflate a little bit, and they will be perfect. Go ahead and transfer\nthem to a cooling rack to continue to cool. But really, truth be told, these cookies are best\nwhen they are still warm, so if you need to dive right\nin right then and there, you have my permission. There you have it. My diabolically delicious\nchocolate chip cookies. The next time you're invited to a potluck or a summertime barbecue, and you're asked to bring something, you've got just the thing. I'll see you guys back here next week when I'm going to share with you how to make my raspberry\ncornbread muffins, the perfect thing for a springtime brunch. I'll see you then. (upbeat music)", "ONjRr1-mjfY": "- Today I'm gonna show you how to make a chocolate lover's dream, chocolate chocolate chip\ncookies with toasted pecans and a little something extra that I'm not gonna tell\nyou about til later. If you like my videos, hit\nthat like button and subscribe. Okay, let's get started. I'm adding two cups or 240\ngrams of all purpose flour into a small bowl. Just gonna weigh it out. Perfect. Now, two thirds of a cup of cocoa powder. I was gonna sift that out. Nevermind, it's okay. All right, half a teaspoon of salt. Three quarters of a\nteaspoon of baking powder. Ahem, I said. Now let's whisk it together. Carefully since I used\na bowl that's too small. (laughs) So chocolatey, so chocolatey. This is a chocolate lover's cookie. Okay, set that aside, including the scale. Now we're gonna cream our butter together. Into my stand mixer, I'm adding one cup or 226 grams of unsalted\nbutter at room temperature. In you go. No. (laughs) Look at me, trying to be a big shot. Okay, in you go, thank you. Close it up, cream it up. (beep) Plug it in, then cream it up. (beep) Cream that butter. Just cream it right up. Now we can add in one\nand a half cups of sugar. One. Two. This guy has to get polished. Let it beat until it's\nnice and light and fluffy. You will notice a difference. (upbeat instrumental music) Okay, I think you can tell, nice, creamy, fluffy, light. I'm gonna add two eggs in one at a time. And this recipe, if\nyou're making it at home, calls for two teaspoons\nof vanilla extract, but I have been baking all day, (laughs) I spilled my vanilla extract. There is enough left for this recipe, but instead I'm gonna use two teaspoons of orange blossom water because I think that orange, chocolate, great combination, I wanna give it a try. Always be adventurous in baking. If it makes sense. All right, one egg. Two eggs. Got it in. Now for the orange blossom water. This is so fragrant. I highly recommend it. Smells so good. Okay that is fluffed up to heck and back. I'm just going to, oh it's so cloudy on the inside. All this butter is so lightweight because all the air that got whipped in. Now it is time for that dry mixture. So we're gonna add this in\nwhile it's mixing on low. Stay in. Okay. Saved it. Kind of. Okay, here we go. This, yes. I really like the orange\nblossom water in here. You could leave it out if you want. And if you wanna go crazy,\ngrate some orange zest in here. Zest of an orange. You will be in orange chocolate heaven. Right now I'm adding a generous half cup of chopped\ntoasted pecans, my favorite. You could also use walnuts. You could also omit the nuts all together. Macadamia nuts, that's an option too. One cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. The never ending cup. And two cups of semi\nsweet chocolate chips. Get those all in there. Again, if you want them\nto be super chocolatey, use the full two cups. If you want more of the\ncookie, cut it in half. We're just gonna mix this up by hand. I wanna remind you to use a metal spatula when you do this because it\nwill snap the wooden ones. I've learned the hard way. (upbeat instrumental music) Get your exercise in there. I mean, unfortunately with food blogging and then the twins, this\nis all the exercise I get. Gone, gone are the Los Angeles\nfancy exercise classes. That's a memory. (sighs) Memories. All right, that's pretty good. Oh, this is cookie dough. This is delicious stuff. I'm not gonna eat it though. It's gonna onto a baking sheet and I will be using a Silpat. I'm using my trusty one and a half tablespoon ice cream scoop to get some nice consistent cookies. You could use whatever you'd like though. This is also the neatest way for me 'cause other wise my hands would be completely covered in cookie\nbatter, cookie dough, yeah. All right, on you go. (upbeat instrumental music) So full of chocolate and nuts. The nice thing about making\nyour own cookie dough too is that you can make a batch, put the rest in the fridge or the freezer, just make sure it's really well sealed, and have on demand fresh homemade cookies whenever you'd like. (upbeat instrumental music) These cookies are ready\nto go into the oven. However, let me show you a little, I don't know if it's a food blogger trick or just like a persnickety person trick, but if you want them to look\na little bit more perfect, just put a couple chocolate chips on top. You can imbed them in so it looks like it happened naturally. And that way when they bake, you'll have that nice\nglossy chocolate chip top and a little bit more chocolate. You can do the same\nthings for the pecans too. Just a couple little pieces\nof pecan here and there poking out, not covered\nby the cookie dough. They'll look really nice and show everyone exactly what's inside, besides butter and sugar. These'll bake at 350 Fahrenheit for about eight to 10 minutes. Just watch them spread. The edges will set. The inside'll be kinda gooey still, so let them set by cooling Don't lift them up. Out of the oven, just\ncool enough to handle and they smell so good. I didn't even eat any off camera. I waited for you. Okay, I'm gonna choose one of the cookies, put the rest away for later, and let's take a look inside. This is like chocolate fudge basically. You know I like a burnt\ncookie but for these guys, I don't mind them being\nlike so cakey and fudgey. (laughs) That's really good. There's so much chocolate in there. And the orange comes through in the last two thirds of the bite. Oh, that orange is nice. In fact, if you make this\nwith the orange blossom water, add some orange zest in too. You will be in chocolate orange heaven. Okay, thanks so much for watching. Hit that like button.

the cookies you gave it that name not me so this is a recipe that originally appeared in my first cookbook dining in the reason I think that it's achieved the success that it has because it is familiar it does have elements of a chocolate chip cookie and elements of a classic shortbread cookie and when the two combines you get the cookie anytime I'm baking anything I like to have all of my ingredients measured first before I start mixing because what can happen is you get to the bottom of the recipe and you realize that the egg that I call for doesn't actually go into the cookie as it goes on the outside and the flaky salt that I call for goes on top not in the dough and I just really gets nice to see everything read the recipe know exactly what you're getting yourself into before proceeding I've never baked anything by the way without getting flour absolutely everywhere and oliver myself and my loved ones and my kitchen and it's just you know whatever will vacuumed I do think that's the most accurate way to measure things especially flower is with a scale every time I weigh a cup of flour it weighs almost exactly 145 grams oh my god 144 grams baby yes I'm in a competition with myself and I won let's see if we can do it again 148 little heavy a little heavy that's fine I feel like as long as you are within like 4 or 5 grams on either side it's not gonna make a huge difference moral the story use the scale if you can now comes our sugar which sugar almost will always weigh the same so quarter cup for me is probably 1/4 cup for you the way that it settles in the cup there's not as much discrepancy so I wouldn't worry too much about that a good thing to know is that this dough freezes really well the recipe can easily be doubled have some for now and have some for later so our basic ingredients are here and accounted for we have salted butter as the name would imply our chocolate and I really like having a lot of different textures of chocolate in this cookie but you know this is like as about as big as I would go I feel like making these cookies for us right now is kind of like a video game where like each level is a new hurdle or a situation so this is butter this is stage 1 actually no measuring shopping is stage 1 because you need to buy the right ingredients measuring is level 2 and now we're at level 3 mixing the dough starting with the butter I like starting with cold butter because you beat it for an eternity I want people to really go for it this is not a suggestion I'm not hinting at maybe combine the butter and sugar together I want you to cream it I want it to be fluffy I want it to be light I wanted to almost look like frosting and it's not because I'm trying to waste your time it's because you're really relying on this air which is also what gives it that like when you bite into it it feels somehow light and fluffy almost like a puff pastry it should be very flaky beating the air into it at this stage is what's gonna get you there so I'm gonna scrape down everything to kind of make sure that all the butter at the bottom is getting mixed with all of the sugar all right our butter and sugar is pretty much there can see in this bowl it already looks like there's more stuff in there and now I'm going to add my flour [Music] you basically want to mix it until the dough comes together to give it a few turns I want you to look at this dough I always tell people that it should resemble play-doh it shouldn't be dry it shouldn't be crumbly it should look you know like cookie dough now you've all used to be able to like make a log cabin with I don't know what he do with play-doh anyone who's ever tried to wrap anything in plastic wrap you know that it is nothing but heartbreak and from here we're gonna shape it into logs and you kind of you know it doesn't have to be perfect it just looks like a blob so this is decidedly more square than round but the round happenes now you just kind of roll it and your cute little large Oh God where will they go don't look at me look in here oh my god I should have thought about that before ah what a nightmare who lives here doesn't bear Seng uh anyway in they go thank you good night the cookies are taking a little nap in the fridge they're gonna be there for at least two hours don't look in here get out of there okay it's doesn't look better than the last time we went in so I forget what level we're at in that crazy metaphor that I brought up earlier but um is the second to last level we're gonna roll it in egg wash and like you're mixing paint or something or feeding an egg I'm sure something that you do more often than mix paint I like to put this sugar in a like a baking dish or a rimmed baking sheet or something like that just like your breading a chicken cutlet or something my analogy is today are really something else so really you're just kind of looking for a nice thin layer which is why I like using a brush just kind of paint the outside and then you can kind of just roll the cookies like this once I seen these cookies I go about a half inch thick sometimes even when I'm cutting them the dough will crumble a little bit and that's okay because you can kind of piece it together if it's pretty forgiving this is probably the most common thing that will happen to my cookies when you get to like a large chunk but I literally just put it back together Oh Humpty Dumpty situation we all know that one yeah they can go definitely closer together these cookies will not spread so to finish they're gonna get a sprinkling of salt and you're not gonna use kosher salt you're gonna use a nice coarse flaky salt and now they go in the oven it's been about 11 12 minutes and our cookies are ready to be taken out of the oven so you can tell they're ready because they are golden brown around the edges they're still pretty pale in the center but they're crispy they smell amazing and I think they look pretty perfect little babies go ahead and transfer them to you know one by one to a wire rack or if I had more parchment kind of letting them cool here these are the kind of cookies that are truly better at room temp they are not like a chocolate-chip cookie where you want to eat them warm put an extremely fun plate of cookies and my favorite one is gonna go on top there there are cookies our cookies the cookies cookie salted butter chocolate chunk shortbread cookie and now comes the moment we've all been waiting for so they should be crunchy they should be crispy that texture in there that is like kind of almost like laminate II it's like flaky and but still dense is exactly what we're looking for mmm I think my favorite part about them is that to me to the best of every world like they have that vanilla and brown sugar and like crispy edge business that a chocolate chip cookie does and they've got the dense buttery flakiness that a shortbread does so to me it is like absolutely the perfect cookie hmm they're really good you guys they're really good for the recipe and a lot more you can check out New York Times cooking [Music]", "Jp0Wb_I8Y2Y": "welcome back everybody today I'm going to be making the Double Tree Hotel cookie recipe I'm actually only going to make half the recipe but I will give you full amounts okay so I'm only going to make half of the recipe but I will be giving you the full recipe amounts and I will also link the recipe resource that I used okay so to start you will need two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour to that you will want to add a half cup of rolled oats I'm also going to add one teaspoon of baking soda and one teaspoon of salt and a pinch of ground cinnamon now I'm just going to mix and combine and in the original recipe that was posted or that came out a couple of days ago I don't know if it was yesterday or the day before it does call for mixing everything in a stand mixer but you know me I like to do things by hand and my stand mixer is way over there so I'm just going to use this but you definitely can use the original recipe method now in a large bowl let's see here you're going to want to add a half pound of butter which is two sticks of unsalted butter actually in the recipe it's that butter but I'm just going to assume unsalted softened butter you'll need 2 sticks of softened butter now I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar a packed cup that is and 3/4 and a cup and 1 tablespoon of sugar a plain grant granulated sugar 1 and a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract now I'm just going to add one large egg actually the recipe calls for two large eggs that's right I'm doing half a recipe so make sure you add two large eggs and you will need a quarter teaspoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice now I'm gonna get this all creamed and mixed together and you want to make sure you're working with softened butter and room-temperature eggs and in the recipe it says to make sure to cream well especially if you're using a stand mixer so I'm gonna do this for about a minute just to make sure everything is combined mixed and creamed well this is done no I'm going to add in my flour mixture and it does say in the recipe not not to overmix so I'm just sort of gonna kind of fold it and combine okay so this is mixed now you are going to want to fold in 1 and 3/4 cups of chopped walnuts I am a nut free house so I'm going to substitute it with some sunflower seeds and you're going to add 2 and 2/3 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and the recipe does call for Nestle's Toll House chocolate chips okay so here's the part where you want to fold these in but don't over mix I'm going to use a large scooper because it does say to put 3 tablespoons of the cookie dough per cookie which gives it that you know that large larger cookie so I'm going to do the best I can but I will be baking these in a 300 degree fahrenheit oven for 20 to 23 minutes okay so here's kind of what I did I was gonna do three in each row but I want to make sure I give them room because I'm not sure how much they'll spread so for this large baking sheet I added six so I'm gonna put these in an oven it's a preheated oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 23 minutes now I'm just going to take these and put them on my cooling rack okay so nothing beats a fresh homemade oven baked warm cookie take a look at this thanks to the good folks at Double Tree hotels for releasing their recipe because now we can all have that vacation cookie while we're at home oh yeah I hope you give this recipe a try I hope you like it and thanks for watching [Music]", "TA7snO72lwU": "hello it Gemma and I'm at home and I need something sweet as usual and I'm going to show you how to make my chocolate chip cookies this is something I quite often have just frozen in my freezer the cookie dough and when I need some cookies I can just get it out slice a couple of slices off and have myself a yummy freshly baked cookie to start with I'm going to use 225 grams of softened unsalted butter start by putting that in my mixer to that add 40 grams of light soft brown sugar and 180 grams of light Muscovado sugar and that's going to give it a really nice kind of treacly soft gooeyness right so I'm going to be those together for a minute or two just to get them light and fluffy and then we'll add the move down right that's been going for about a minute it's gone lovely and fluffy and pale and now I'm going to turn it down a bit and add about a teaspoon of vanilla extract we let that mix in a little bit and then just need to add two large free-range eggs one at a time beating quite well in between each one time for my other egg right there once your eggs are all mixed in turn your mixer off and i've got 270 grams of plain flour which I've sifted and pop that in and then add to that 1 teaspoon of baking powder and half a teaspoon of salt and then we're just going to mix that on a low speed just until it's incorporated and then once it starts coming together add 250 grams of chocolate chips now I've used chopped chocolate because I like a bit of irregularity with my chips you can just use chocolate chips this is where it gets a bit exciting in here and that's it don't need to mix it too long this is what the dough looks like it's it's quite soft at the minute you can bake this now what I like to do is wrap it up in cling film in a sausage shape and stick it in the freezer all right so my cookie dough has been freezing in the freezer where things freeze for about two hours and it's now Salladhor the rack and I'm gonna now use my trusty knife and slice bits off it bake them and then right and then just pop them onto a baking tray lined with baking paper space them quite far apart because they're going to spread quite a bit these are gonna be a funny shape when they bake because my love froze and do a punishing bake them at 180 for 10 to 15 minutes so check mine at 10 if they still feel a little bit soft on the top whack them in for another couple of minutes but you want them to be soft ish in the middle 7 all nice and chilly but my cookies have been out of the oven for about five minutes and that's about as long as I can wait because I need cookie so they're still warm look how cute they are with a little uneven chunks of chocolate all over the place and I'm going to have to have a little bit yummy so soft in the middle if you liked this video and you want to see more videos by me and please do subscribe to my channel by clicking on the link over here and I'm going to go grab myself a glass of milk and don't my cooking itself see you later you", "zQJTYCWTyDA": "[Music] hey guys it's live welcome back to my channel today I am doing a video for a recipe that I have posted on my blog and it is in my cookbook it's one of my most popular recipes ever but I actually never did a video tutorial for it so I know a lot of you guys have probably already made this recipe but I wanted to have a video tutorial where I show you how to make them I answer some frequently asked questions and I give you all my best tips so that you guys can learn how to make the perfect vegan chewy chocolate chip cookies I think that is everything I have to say for now so let's get into the recipe so you want to start off by adding your vegan margarine or butter to a bowl I have tried it with both and I prefer margarine which is what the book calls for and this is the brand I use I buy it because it is the most cost effective so then you also want to add your brown sugar and cream those together you can use a spoon I have made these hundreds of times before using a spoon but ever since I got an electric mixer I have preferred to use this just because it's a lot quicker and easier but basically you just want to cream together the vegan margarine and sugar until it is light and fluffy like this next you're going to add your non-dairy milk I use almond milk and vanilla and then just combine that as well again I just like to use the electric mixer for this so then next you want to combine your flour baking powder baking soda and salt and I just do it in a big measuring cup like this and you want to whisk them together really well so that the salt and baking soda baking powder is evenly dispersed so that your cookies will rise evenly but then you just want to add that to the bowl of wet ingredients and combine it I like to do it in two parts so I put half of the flour mixture in first mix that until it's all combined into a dough and then I add the other half as for flour the amount that I call for it is a cup and a half but you can also go up to about a cup and three quarters sometimes if it's really humid or hot where you live the dough can be a little bit softer so just kind of play around with the amount a cup and a half to a cup and three quarters is kind of where you want to be for it the best texture so then you can mix in your chocolate chips I call for a third of a cup but sometimes they do a half a cup if I just want them a little bit more chocolatey I know some people like a lot of chocolate chips and lastly you want to get a baking sheet and you actually don't need any parchment paper or any liner I just make it right on the cookie sheet and you want to roll about two tablespoons of dough into each ball and then just bake that if you're using a light baking sheet like mine you want to bake them for about ten to eleven minutes but if you're using a darker pan you'll probably find you only need about nine minutes that's just what I found through trial and error and using a bunch of different pans and then I actually let the camera run and spread this up so that you could see that leaving the cookies to cool for a couple minutes really allows them to deep puff so if they look pretty puffy when you take them out let them cool on the pan for a few minutes and then you can move them to a cooling rack and they should fall to be about the perfect chewy cookie height and consistency and obviously I recommend eating these warm with a glass of almond milk it is incredible for cookies this is my sister for those of you who don't know I prefer my cookies like super chewy and Joey so I kind of under make them a bit but if you like them a little bit more cook just bake them longer until they're more golden on top also if you want to make them even more perfect if you freeze the dough overnight and then you kind of like let it thaw for a little bit and then bake them from kind of like frozen dough they get perfectly crispy on the outside they get like golden on top but if you want to just make them right away and not freeze your dough because I hate recipes that say you have to refrigerate them you don't have to refrigerate the dough for these to be good but it does help I make these probably weekly I make them for every family gathering any time I go to a meeting or I have to like meet a new person and impress them with food I make these literally all the time I have the recipe memorized I just there's amazing so I hope that this video is helpful I still get messages like almost every day of people sending me pictures of cookies so it's like the best part of my job thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope that you go a try out it'd be perfect vegan chewy chocolate chip cookies like I mentioned the recipe is in my cookbook and it's just one of a couple that were kind of like fan favorites that I included in the cookbook but um that's my book right there but the cookbook has like a hundred brand-new recipes that aren't already online and that I won't be sharing anywhere else so if you want to check it out I'll put the link in the description box below thank you to everyone who's already purchased it and left reviews I appreciate it so much I hope that you're having an amazing day and I will see you all next week [Music]",

so thank you guys so much for contributing and I guess we have some time so let's chat shall we let's see what do you guys want to talk about let me think so one of the little random iceberg of questions mmm worse dreaming that's a good one what was your worst dream um I think the one that I remember most was this reoccurring dream I had I was probably I was pretty young I was I think in middle school and it scared the bejesus out of me and I dreamed that some bikers moved up the street from our house like they moved in across the street and would terrorize the neighborhood bikers if you're watching please don't take offence I was just a kid and I have always been sensitive to loud noises and it was his reoccurring dream and they didn't do anything they didn't harm us they didn't scare come to our Oh No one of them came to our this is a dream it's Jim came knocking on the door and I just remember being terrified but did nothing to us never harmed us but just hearing the motorcycles tearing up the street I had that reoccurring dream I think three or four times and that was really scary but thankfully I am a bit sleeper are you good sleeper I am a good sleeper and I just asked me about my B's my D B's are doing pretty well let's see I've had to reduce the number of bees that I have been keeping in my apiary I used to have four hives but now I have two one of them was not doing well over winter I found a dead queen queen is the mother of the hive on the landing board and I thought well I'll just see what the beads do and it turns out when I can win in in spring it was queenless it didn't have a queen and the population was very very very small and so I tried to bring it back by giving the Beehive a frame of brood from another hive hoping that they would make a new queen but they they were unsuccessful they did not bring up a new queen and I think I had a drone linguini which was mean means a queen I'm getting technical here I know a queen that was not laying fertile eggs so I ended up getting rid of that hive by combining it and by shaking all the bees out and letting them fly to find other homes in my other hives because it wasn't gonna make it and because of lockdown queens are not readily available John hello thanks so much I appreciate it Queens are not readily available I'm not we're not we're social distancing we're not going out so I just decided to reduce the number of pads also my son one of my kiddos has developed a bit of an allergy to bee stings and so that has me very cautious about the number of these I have on the property so I've heard that gave me reduced me down to three hives and then I called someone on my local bee club to see if they would like to adopt one of my hives because again I'm trying to trash I think so much to reduce the number of hives so now I only have two and so the number of two but then if you follow me on Instagram I have in my highlights I saved it I actually caught a small my first one of the year if you also follow me on my other YouTube channel I'm gonna put Brianna thank you so much I'm gonna put the video there of what happened I actually caught a swarm so swarm is when half the bees leave roughly half the bees leave with the old Queen to start a new colony that means your colony is big and blooming and it's ready to repopulate so that happened to me but I actually saw it happen I saw all the bees fly out I saw them go to a branch it was it was amazing to see so many bees flying around so they went into a bush near I hired a lot of things so much you joining me and they flew into a shrub right next to the hives and I was able to just clip the branch and catch the swarm it was so so cool so I will put that video on to my other channel and if you follow me on instagram you can see in my highlights as well so what are we doing we're down to 12 minutes Alejandro Gomez thanks so much and we are just let me show you what this looks like can you see hope let me turn this around they're just starting to melt right there so it definitely looks like it's gonna take the full 20 minutes so now that I so I caught back to the bees I've caught the swarm back though thank you I caught the swarm and then I've rehoused that was about a week ago so now I have three hives again that one's a very small colony and then the other day my neighbor called me and said uh I mean I think we might have tuition and my other hive I think swarmed and they were way up probably 45 feet 40 55 feet in the tree so I was not able to get them and so yeah but that's okay you know so it goes now all the other questions for me recipes that I have tried and that have liked I do so many recipe tests yeah um I can't say that there's a specific one that I've done recently that has really really stuck with me because I'm doing somewhat today I made a recipe for Crisco salad Crisco you know vegetable shortening it's an old retro recipe that was sent to me by one mile of leaves so I learned to make great things from you ever had Crisco salad I didn't not until today and that was a fun recipe to make what did I get Rebecca wants to know where I got this little timer I picked this up at a little shop in Provence called stock and it's a dozen house and I like it cuz it's kind of old-fashioned II it's very analog and tikkis and it has a magnet on the back so I just stick it on my refrigerator so yeah it's fun and what else any other questions for anyone else you guys want it I shouldn't make an eat stogies Alice's I should check it out what's a stove even a thank you um Chris thanks tips on beekeeping number one tip beekeeping is very romantic it's a lovely thing to think I've got a hive in my backyard and bees are beautiful don't get me wrong but they do require a good amount of attention during specific times of year so if you have that time then that's a good thing yeah but you it's a significant King amethyst I actually have a video on what I do for my makeup it's a couple years old but I don't really do anything different so you should check that out Rachel thanks so much and so back to keeping bees if you want to keep bees take a class also but number I was saying investment it's a significant investment when you first start beehive it's probably gonna be about set you back about 500 bucks in the beginning because you're gonna buy hive if a box for the bees to stay in and you also have to purchase the bees as well so to purchase the bees and you have to pay about 150 bucks 100 bucks for three pounds of bees and queen so that's gonna be you know an extra 400 bucks well anyways altogether the setup and the protective equipment a veil and a jacket and a smoker will all be about $500 or so to start I would take a class I would recommend taking a beekeeping class just so you can get idea of what's involved and also because you'll meet so many cool people there are so many cool people keeping bees and you'll learn so much and you'll definitely metal Nicky you'll definitely need the help because I certainly did and so yeah so these are cool but they're also a lot of work so also if you want to extract the honey in that extractor the thing that you spend the honey out of costs a few hundred dollars but if you're part of a local bee Club I am you can borrow one usually you can check one out and Emily you know stock stock is awesome and they will let you borrow the extractor which is great because then you know you can just get it out loaded out and then after that you you know you don't have to pay that big chunk of money for the extractor but if you want honey you're gonna need to extract it yes James bees do come in a three pound weight so that's just the basic thing and then each year you're gonna you keep your bees and then they overwinter that means you try to keep them alive over winter and then the thing they don't tell you or they don't stress is that the next year your bee population if they survive the winter is gonna be nice and strong so they're gonna want to swarm swarming is like I just described half of the bees won't leave and in order to combat that your beekeeper usually splits them they take some of the bees out to kind of weaken the hive so that it doesn't want to swarm so suddenly your keeper of one high one becomes two and then two becomes four and suddenly you have a huge apiary so that's something else to think about too like where do you live and how many hives can you keep how many hives are you willing to be responsible for because each additional hive requires that much more work yes Chiara I know about the flow hi thank you a lot of lovelies have been sharing the flow hive with me and I am NOT interested in at the moment because this is just my fourth year of beekeeping I'm no expert by any means and so I'm just learning with just the basics and I want to do it with equipment that is tried-and-true and basic and foundational the flow hive is an interesting thing but I I don't want to get confused in equipment that I have no idea how to use because I'm learning for something else so perhaps someday but for me not right now no uh so the flow hive it's a contraption if you don't stir no John thanks so much if you guys don't know again what a flow hive flow hive is you might have seen little videos about it John thinks you always are stopping by I really really appreciate it and contributing by the way if you're just joining me I am making the Doubletree in chocolate chip cookies and all of the proceeds from super chats and stickers aren't going to the Minnesota freedom fund which helps with bail and for protesters in Minnesota right now and helping them out so that's a great cause and I was going back to the flow hive the flow hive is a contraption on the hall contraption but it's a type of hive that has a plastic super-super is where the honey is stored by the bees on the top and instead of using an extractor or machine to spin out the honey or take out the frames the fluo hive has a key that you turn and it all flows down okay thanks so much it all flows down directly into a jar which looks pretty cool but I've heard lots of things about the flow hive not working all that well all the components are made out of plastic a lot of times the bee don't want to store honey or nectar in plastic because it's not made out of beeswax I mean thanks so much and so they to get the bees to actually use the flow hive I've heard is challenging so you love to thank so much and Seana thank you guys so much thanks so much all of you for joining me today and all of you that are contributing to this and yeah I appreciate it it's good to see you all and um so yeah the filippov is not something I'm interested in that was a kind of a long interesting story into that a lot of you want to know about my skincare routine um I don't really have much the epitome of sass thank you I don't really have much of the skincare routine now that I'm getting older we're all getting older I do make sure I wear sunscreen so that's one thing I am pretty adamant that okay skincare routine we're just gonna talk about it

watching transformations drag queen tutorials in particular that transformation is always huge and just transformative love that so I love watching those videos but I don't really want to do that for my own face Wow um are you guys asking if I can sing no I can't sing it I wish I could sing I can sing no I can I wouldn't even call it singing I would love to sing and I enjoy making noises out of my throat that are singsong I am captivated by music though anyways that's my I'm at any rate that is my skincare tutorial I don't use highlighter I don't use any that kind of stuff because I just I just can't be bothered I can't be bothered I have to get it all done quickly and I don't want to have a bunch of stuff on my face all right so where are we at ladies and gentlemen we are at looks like two minutes here and the cookies off looking gorgeous can you see that so I think it's gonna take the full amount of time so it says when they're golden around the edges and they get this this recipe says that you should let these cookies cool for an hour before you eat them who lets their cookies cool for an hour before they eat them in their right mind see I told you nobody does so that was 18 minutes so I'm gonna give these an extra three minutes yeah I'm gonna give him a buck an extra four minutes or so just to make sure they yeah I like my cookies on the softer side I like them to be crispy on the outside not too crispy but definitely on the softer I don't like crisps chocolate chip cookies generally speaking so yeah what's your favorite cookie I would say easily chocolate chip for me a good buttery chocolate chip cookie that's it um even chocolate oatmeal cookie I'm like a lot I like the chew that comes with that but I like to keep things simple plump and juicy thank you macadamia nut frugal Dee says is her favorite eye well then I remember my first macadamia white chocolate chip cookie I remember that experience in thinking what are these things they are amazing shortbread lemon cookies and Sharon likes lemon cookies when it comes to lemon shortbread I like I like shortbread with tea mm-hmm macadamia nut chewy chocolate - chocolate good [Music] and shortbread chocolate chip oatmeal chocolate chip macadamia that chocolate chip with walnuts yeah I think it was a smitten kitchen recipe and I tested out years and years and years ago and she recommends chopping up the nuts super tiny and I'm all for that super tiny tiny tiny so you get the richness of the nut ease but you don't aren't distracted by the nut chunks snickerdoodle yes and yes my best friend in elementary school her mom would make snickerdoodles and she would pack her an extra one so she could give me one at lunch that's a real true bestie right there favorite doughnut Marla wants note glaze just a glaze yeasted doughnut though I'm not a huge fan of cake doughnuts I like nice tan doughnuts snickerdoodles peanut butter chocolate chip I'm not a huge peanut butter chocolate peanut butter cookie fan although I love Reese's Pieces red velvet cookies I've never had this Mexican wedding cookies those are good I love the melt awareness of those cookies gingerbread oh gosh you guys sure did give me Simoes pumpkin oatmeal chocolate chip I've never had those I can imagine it though with spice I don't know dark cookies oh my gosh peanut butter thimble berries yes Elliot I have had them berries I've actually harvested them before they're fun they're easy to spot oh my gosh look at I'm looking forward to making freezer Jam strawberry seasons just coming around the corner here and I'm looking forward to making a strawberry freezer Jam I make a ton of that berry season love berry season licorice cookies with white chocolate really fresh baked stroopwafels yes shroob waffles are so good I have a stoup waffle iron that I need to make stroopwafels with simple berry jam that's awesome um what else homemade nuggets like chicken nuggets yes I have well we usually call them tenders chicken tenders oatmeal peanut butter M&M okay yes if you guys haven't I've never made strawberry freezer Jam it is the best even if you don't like strawberries it's the best okay how are we doing cookies not quite yet stroopwafels I'm sure I'm saying it wrong but okay lemon glazed kissee cookies I don't know Kiki I don't know what kissy cookies are are they like the ones that have like the Hershey kiss on top trail mix please yeah I can go there why do I have braces I don't have raisins I have little things on my teeth how do you call those dentists hygienists what do you call them lines on my teeth I don't have braces I've never wore braces I don't have Invisalign I don't have clear braces it's just the texture of my teeth coconut cookies okay let's look at these John thank you look they're looking a little pale still so I'm gonna turn these around don't get the towel in there look at the size of those I have to say that's the correct size yeah that is the correct size of cookie so this dish sure was good size for making these cookies and I can't tell you what the size of this is because this is an old I don't know it doesn't say what size it is I've got this from the fish store I love that's one of the things I've been definitely missing during lockdown is going through store shopping or junk picking I love going to junk shops and picking out old things because often times they just works much better no I've never worn retainers either no no no I have a cross bite see if you look if an orthodontist is watching this video that they'll know all the flaws of my teeth I have a cross bite here oh yeah I've never worn corrective teeth stuff I almost got braces to fix that cross but I never did so yeah herstory junk picking I really missed going and finding all kinds of funny treasures but you know I'll get that I'll get that edge back soon I might what I want to find is an inexpensive rice cooker and I want to try making um black garlic in it but I have an alternate plan if I can't get an old junky um rice cooker I want to make black garlic in my compost pile so our compost pile is was kind of cold and dormant during the winter so now it's starting to water them up and it's getting hot again so to make black garlic you got to have a temperature about 130 degrees so that happens to be the hot cooking temperature of a good compost pile so all right I'm talking too much I gotta check this out let's see Leslie get in there thank you okay I guess I'll keep talking for like a couple more minutes ah burger and can where can you get it the broker toucan was sent to me by mountain MRE and I believe the manufacturers are located in Germany and not in the US so I think if you're gonna find it you're gonna have to look for it abroad if you have a hook-up or a connection in Germany they may be able to find it for you but yeah I don't think it's easy to find well my favorite burger chain huh okay this gets complicated because we could start talking about different styles of hamburgers so for nostalgic reasons and because I just love their burgers I love in and out because I grew up in California and I have so many fond memories of going to in and out with friends and family and so I just love going in now when the first places I go to when I visit my family I also love Shake Shack I just had Shake Shack for the first time just relatively recently within the last five years love their salaburu Smashburger is my favorite type of burger so that's one reason why I like Shake Shack because they do that style of burger which I really love but I've heard a lot about a lot of other burger joints that do that too which I haven't eaten so I'm sure there are lots of different burgers that are amazing I just never had I've had Apple pan in LA I still like um yeah we're talking about chains here so yeah she check is delicious and oh five guys I've had I'd like five guys I think they make a good burger but what does it do I don't like so much the fries I don't know I mean the fries are pretty good I guess seasoned fries I guess the prices are a little bit steeper um five guys but they make a good burger I wouldn't say that they're my baby from it fat burger oh they're in LA right I've had fat burger before but it's been a long time so but I've never had what a burger before I've never had smash burger before I've never had what other ones have I not had cuz those are so regional so yes Chris I do have a Twitter account I also had an Instagram account I also have a Facebook account I haven't taped off account but I haven't started it girl what should I do there's too much to manage I'm gonna check on the cookies okay this we're getting close we are getting close so so far that it is solid 25 minutes just like the recipes said Mellon wants to know if I like boba tea I do I have a few recipes on my channel on how to make boba tea and Oh King amethyst thanks so much for subscribe me on tik-tok oh my apologies for not posting anything hmm excuse me I just burped yeah but I will I don't oh no y'all it's the pressure of having to do more so what if like I don't know how to dance I can dance okay actually I'm not a great dancer but I know to talk is more than just balance Big Daddy burgers the bomb bad daddy burger bad daddies I've never heard it Paula never heard of it maybe it's just an original thing Oh Wendy's you know what I used to love having it Wendy's was there frosty and fries dip dip dip it up it up it up yes that reminds me of high school and getting um Frosty's and fries and they have baked potatoes at Wendy's do they still have baked potatoes at Wendy's I remember getting baked potatoes with sour cream and chive I've never had a mommy burger Santa nope never had it and rightfully Thanks uh-uh uh-uh Cheetos and fries with Carolina oh yeah bad daddy ever had it uh have I tried Cheetos and fries I have not nope for tips off what about produce of easy recipes yeah I thought about that I should probably just do the checking box yes I used to get the spicy chicken burger is that even son a burger a sandwich at Jack and box I loved it okay let's check on this before chatting away okay so I think part of the reason why this is taking so long is that it's cooking at a relatively low temperature we are cooking these cookies at 300 degrees so yes oh if you're just joining me hello everyone thank you so much for joining me lovelies I am here making the Double Tree cookies the chocolate chip cookies and all the proceeds today are going to the proceeds of the Super chats and stickers are going to the Minnesota freedom fund so thanks so much for contributing and for being patient while these cookies cook now I'm gonna say that is good now let me stay on how okay so it's browning up Mullen will sit there for a minute hey hey Heidi thanks so much so this cookie recipe has the gall to ask you to wait one hour can you can you I can't even 1 hour it says allow your cookies to cool for an hour anything that's insanity and that is not going to happen I'm gonna go grab a plate and I'm gonna eat my cookie right now plate because I'm trying to be civilized no I'm gonna use an offset [Applause] here oh look this is perfect can you see that okay Nike come on thank you so much I appreciate it this is wonderful you guys are wonderful okay this is risky did you see that I almost lost my cookie did I'm dumb that was my little drum hi-hat whatever snare I'm not a drums John thank you there is the beautiful cookie that I have not waited an hour for I have to say that looks pretty good that looks a lot like the Doubletree in cookie and even in size that turned out just because when you get when you stay at the Doubletree ends what they do is you stay and then on your pillow or somehow I have the memory up on your pillow but maybe not someone maybe it's on the table but they have a little like paper sleeve and they give you freshly baked cookies or maybe when you check in they hand you cookies with your check-in stuff it's what a brilliant idea like welcome have a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie yeah so I have to say upon initial look this looks pretty good now this is funny I'm good well maybe not cuz this is gonna be so hot okay look [Laughter] boys and girls and all of us human beings look at that all right it smells great I wish you could have a bite eat the lucky Mouse mmm delicious absolutely delicious that little bit of oats there's only a half a cup of oats in there but along with the brown sugar makes these cookies a little bit cloudy thank you a little bit chewy Oh delicious am I trying to I'm trying to taste the cinnamon I can't pinpoint that there's cinnamon in there but it gives it a something little haha oh my goodness this might be them my knees Nick's like favorite is good I have so many chocolate chip cookie recipes that I want to make cookie I want to make jock Torres's cookies his are supposed to be like the best like ultimate chocolate chip cookie recipe but you have to wait like 24 hours before you can actually bake the dough so that's kind of insanity in my world so I haven't made that one yet there's that what I want to make there so so many brave tart has amazing chocolate chip cookie recipes but I have to say this one is pretty stinkin delicious I mean granted I'm eating it like right out of the oven which is the best way to eat cookies in my opinion attract full of chocolate there's so much chocolate in these cookies and there's little bits of bullets I recommend chopping the 1rc thanks so much Suzanne thanks so much for chopping up the wall it's really really tiny because you get that rich nutty flavor and a little bit of like truthiness but you don't have them like they're

family i could pretty much always depend on my dad to have one for his birthday when we were growing up so i kind of consider myself a bit of an expert this one is one of my favorite cakes hi i'm lindsay from life love and sugar and today i'm going to show you how to make my chocolate chip cookie cake all right to start off we're going to take our butter add it to our mixer bowl and then we're going to add our sugar we use a combination of brown sugar and white granulated sugar we're going to cream those together for about two or three minutes until they get nice and fluffy [Music] all right so when things look like they're fully creamed and they've gotten light and fluffy you want to go ahead and stop if you're not really familiar with what you're looking for i'll go ahead and give you a little peek you can kind of see on the beater blade here see how this is light and fluffy and it's gotten kind of creamy this is still a little bit darker that's the kind of contrast you're looking for so once everything kind of gets to that light and fluffy point you're going to want to add your egg and i'm going to scrape down the sides of the bowl real quick just to make sure everything's getting nicely incorporated we're going to add our vanilla extract from there we're going to put together our dry ingredients we've got our all-purpose flour we're gonna add our baking powder and baking soda and a little salt and combine those then we'll just add those in with our batter [Music] it may seem a little dry at first but it'll all come together into a nice dough once it starts to come together you want to go ahead and stop mixing and we can kind of finish doing the rest of that with our spatula so we're not gonna over mix and end up with a tough cookie just kind of scrape the sides of the bowl make sure we're incorporating everything and then as we're doing that we can add in our chocolate chips stir those in all right and now we've got our cookie dough so we're going to take a nine inch cake pan i'm gonna grease it with some baking spray which i've already done and i'm gonna add a parchment round into the bottom of it to help keep the cookie from sticking to the bottom of the cake pan and then we'll add our cookie dough it's fairly thick and sticky all right and then i'll use my favorite little offset spatula here to spread it out evenly into the pan you could even use a spoon or even the silicone spatula you were using to mix things and then once you've got it evenly into the pan i actually like to add just a few more chocolate chips to the top all right there you go now your cookie is ready to go in the oven bake it at 350 for about 20 minutes so you want to set your cookie cake aside so it can cool completely you want to leave it in the pan while it cools it's much easier to get it out of the pan once it's completely cool and once it's close to being ready it's time to make your chocolate frosting so for that we're going to start with our butter and shortening you can use all butter if you prefer we'll just add those to our mixer mix those together until they're nice and smooth [Music] all right once that's well combined you want to add about half of your powdered sugar we'll mix that together until it's well combined and smooth and then we will add a little bit of water you could also use milk if you prefer i'm just going to add about a tablespoon we can always add more later if we want to thin it out a little bit more we'll add our vanilla extract mix those in all right now add our cocoa powder and combine that all right we'll add the rest of our powdered sugar and then from there we can add a little bit more water milk just to kind of thin it out and get it to the right consistency all right so it's looking nice and creamy so we're going to go ahead and get that off of the mixer and if at this point you notice it's still too thick and add a little bit more water i think this is looking pretty good all right so we're going to set this aside for a minute while we get our cookie out of the cake pan okay so we've got our cold cookie ready to go if you cool it completely in the pan it should be nice and firm and it should be easy to just kind of invert it and get that cookie out i've just got this on a cardboard circle and there is our cookie cake and you can set that up on your cake stand now it's time to frost it so i'm just going to do some swirls around the outside edge of the cake [Music] there's our frosted cake finishing touch sprinkles grab your favorite sprinkle mix and finish off your cookie cake there you have it we've got our classic chocolate chip cookie cake perfect for any occasion or birthday dense chewy and delicious for the full recipe head over to [Music] life11sugar.com you", "OvpRev2WIVU": "baking cookies is a holiday tradition that I love my daughter alexis is brown sugar chocolate chip cookies these gorgeous thin beautiful cookies are a long-running family favorite and this year I think they'll be perfect as a dessert for a Christmas gathering so these are very easy to make one pound of butter 3 cups of light brown sugar and 1 cup of regular sugar and cream the butter and sugar together and then you add 4 large eggs into the creamed butter and sugar these are farm-fresh eggs add the eggs one at a time right out of my hand house right out of my hands that beautiful chocolate brown egg and this really does loosen up the batter nicely I want the eggs to be totally incorporated into the butter and sugar and then two teaspoons of the best vanilla let that mix up while you sift three and a half cups of all-purpose flour with one and a half teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of baking soda that's another reason why the cookies are so nice and flat there's no leavening agent in the cookies and sifting is very easy when you use a wire whisk like this mixing up all the dry ingredients and then you can just add the flour while the machine is going at low speed and when you get down to the bottom you can sort of like ease the rest in and the last thing of course that goes into your chocolate chip cookie batter one and a half cups of best quality chocolate chips or chocolate bits like that like that all right have your oven preheated to 375 degrees and this amount makes about thirty delicious 4-inch cookies and another little hint that we love to share with all of you is using a release ice cream scoop for the batter you can just use a 2 ounce scoop this will give you a four inch cookie and the bake in about eleven minutes bake right on a Silpat and because he spread and because these are so large I suggest baking three on a sheet now these go right into a 375-degree oven if you're baking more than one sheet at a time in your oven make sure that about after five minutes you rotate the cookie sheet that will ensure a nice evenly baked cookie as I showed you before this is what they look like and this is mine I'm going to take it away it's a good thing all next this is chocolate chip cookies make them part of your holiday celebration [Music] you you", "VaT3qsoHPQ8": "hey guys it's cause your world and today we're making the perfect chocolate chip cookies these cookies have just the right amount of chewiness on the inside and crunchiness on the outside so let's get started first go ahead and measure our two cups of all-purpose flour and then add this to a small bowl then add an i 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda along with a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and then whisk everything together now you need a cup of brown sugar make sure this is packed of course and add this to a separate bowl then add an 1/2 cup of white sugar and you also need the recorders cup of butter now in this recipe instead of using room-temperature butter are you going to be using melted butter this is going to make your cookies a lot chewier so go ahead and add the seer bowl and then you're just going to mix this together with the wooden spoon one of the reasons where I really like this recipe is that you don't need a stand mixer for it now I'm going to crack in an A and you also need an egg yolk for extra richness and then you need a tablespoon of vanilla extract then just give this a stir [Music] now go ahead and add in your dry ingredients and mix everything together this can get a little tricky to do with the spoon so eventually I switch to using my hands now I got these semi-sweet chocolate chunks from Trader Joe's and I really like this because they give a nice rustic look to your cookies and I'm going to add a cup of these to my cookie dough of course you can use regular chocolate chips as well and then just mix everything together by hand or using a wooden spoon as you can now cover this with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 20 minutes then once you're doing us come out of the fridge it's time to scoop out your cookies I'm using an ice cream scoop to do this it makes it much easier so grab a scoop of it and then roll it into a ball then place it on a cookie sheet about three inches apart then just bake these at 325 for about 13 minutes once they've come out of the oven place them on a cooling rack and enjoy I really like this cookie recipe because these cookies stay nice and chewy on the inside or arraigning crispy on the outside and of course a glass of milk makes these the perfect dessert so I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to post pictures of your creations to my Facebook page and I'd be happy to feature them in an upcoming video thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time everyone [Music]", "dMPTxTmZDzE": "I'm so now when I go to bakeries and get a cookie because everything is judged against this one and like I've written about this cookie I've written articles about this cookie I dream about this cookie I've woken myself up because I and I start biting the air really embarrassing but that's that's a sign that I'm hungry and I'm probably dreaming about something really delicious so yeah this is the ultimate chocolate-chip cookie it will ruin you for all other cookies every time I make this for any friends it becomes their go-to cookie this is legitimately my favorite cookie on this earth it has all of my favorite flavors it's got brown butter dark brown sugar toffee dark chocolate the chocolate never seems to actually harden up it's just in this perennial state of goo which I love I cannot wait to eat this cookie so let's get started so this cookie is a little bit different than most this one we're actually starting with brown butter this does a couple of things the first thing is it adds incredible flavor because we're browning the the butter and we're not whipping it it's going to lay a little bit flatter it's the edges of the cookie you're gonna crisp up you're gonna get a nice lacy hard texture on the outside of the cookie but the inside is gonna stay really moist and and the chocolates just gonna get really gooey alright so the first thing I'm going to do is turn on this pan I'm gonna drop two sticks of unsalted butter in there you just want to basically swirl that'll help get the butter to melt more quickly so the thing about the brown butter is it happens really quickly so you can see the outside edges of the pan the butter is already starting to brown and stick to the sides as soon as you see it get slightly golden go ahead and transfer it to a heatproof bullet and you watch it's going to continue to brown even as it sits and uh it smells so good so this is super hot I'm gonna scrape it into my stand mixer it needs to cool down if I put my raw eggs in this right now you're gonna get brown butter scrambled eggs and that might sound good but it's really not so I'm gonna let that sit and cool and I'm gonna mix the dry ingredients salt definitely important for baked goods by using baking soda you're gonna promote some both the spread of the cookie but also the other brownie I'm gonna give this a little whisk this step is really important because you want to make sure that you've thoroughly incorporated all of the dry ingredients together and now toffee I actually prefer having the toffee in the the cookie so I'm going to refrain from starting to eat this I'm gonna mix the sugars into the butter the butter is still pretty hot but it's not gonna matter for the sugar nothing's gonna happen other than the it's gonna cool down a little bit more and all we're really doing here is we're just mixing to combine and to also pull it off it smells so good this is 72% cacao chocolate wafers wafers tend to melt more evenly and smoothly than chips do I also find that whenever you buy wafers they didn't to be better quality chocolate than your average chip so I've got the Sun low I'm gonna add the vanilla I'm adding to room temp eggs all right I'm gonna increase to medium it's turning color it's a little bit lighter it takes between about 30 seconds and a minute to get this consistency you really want to get this sort of light and creamy texture otherwise your cookies just gonna spread and you're gonna get these like really thin cookies now we are going to add the dry I'm gonna pulse this to make sure that I don't splatter flour everywhere almost looks like it's come together chocolate so I'm gonna go ahead and just pulse it again just to mix and now take this out now I'm going to make sure you get all of these little shavings as well because those are gonna melt in and just add a lot more flavor just really get in there scrape the sides and the bottom of the bowl this dough is gonna seem really loose and that's fine because of the brown butter you really need to let this sit for at least 30 minutes all right that looks really good I want to stick my finger in there and eat it it was so bad and I think I'm going to quality control I'm gonna leave that put it out of arms reach and let it sit for 30 minutes to harden up and then we'll make cookies so the dough is rested and by the way can I just say that every single member of this crew got a spoon and eat cookie dough too so it wasn't just me so this dough has been resting so you can see it comes together this is what you're looking for they should be firm dough balls when you put them on the sheet tray otherwise they're just gonna spread and you're not gonna get the texture that you should get this cookie I typically use an ice cream scoop when I do cookies this shape is perfect for forgetting like beautiful cookies I usually do nine just to get an idea of how much they're gonna spread and then all the subsequent trays I will then add either more or keep it the same depending on the spread there is salt in the cookie dough I deliberately did not put a lot of salt if I was going to not top it with flaky sea salt I would have upped the salt in the dough I really love the hit of salt on the top visually it looks pretty but the other thing that it does it gives you one more added bit of crunch on the outside crisps Morocco actually was around when I was developing and testing this recipe and he and I would literally just take a sheet tray fill it up with the the cookie balls and stick it in the freezer and in case of emergency we would just pull out like four or five balls of cookie dough throw them in the oven you've got fresh hot cookies just salt them right before they go in the oven don't put the salt on top and then freeze them because it'll melt and you'll just get a really salty weird edge all right so I'm going to throw these in a hot oven you want this 375 so if you really wanted to do two sheets at a time go for it the reason why I did it is because there are certain cookies that benefit from being in the center of the oven so it's getting the optimal heating from the bottom and from the top yes look at that so beautiful as much as I want to tear into these they're super hot if I try to pull them off the pan they would just sort of disintegrate and melt so I'm going to leave them on the tray to crisp up the bottom a little bit for about ten minutes if you try and pull these off before ten minutes they're just going to be way too soft and especially if you're using the wafer chocolate they'll just sort of disintegrate and chocolate will go everywhere all right so these are gonna sit for another 15 minutes or so I might cut into one you in flow one now okay yeah that's fine well that's pretty intense alright as much as I want to eat these all to myself I'm gonna invite Alex and so come on Billy any let's uh you've had these before I have an ear con man because you run the risk of me eating all of yours well really I want you to pull me a shot of espresso okay so we're trading we're trading one yeah yeah I remember good told the brown-butter member in the toffee in assault whoa dude thank you like I'm making my afternoon right now any time you know there anytime and you I'm holding you to that tomorrow I'm gonna be like Rick where's the cookies I mean you know I'll make more still waiting for my coffee but um just gonna keep eating cookies cuz they're really good I'm actually really upset because I don't have a swap of the cookies that's fine I'm gonna power through because I love this cookie so much", "dQiii4pg4s8": "[Music] hey guys guess who's back it's me and I'm back here at condos HQ after a lot of rest and I am so much better my back is recovering so need to take it easy so I'm still not in the bakery I'm doing all the sitting down work but the gang slowly included have been and doing an amazing job of keeping you guys recipe DUP now with keeping me in in you know after my eyeballs and cookies but the best cookie that was I've ever had was the New York style cookies that reason I've made so delicious and if you haven't made that yet please check it out but not yet the cause I am setting your Italian okay I love that cookie it was amazing it was amazing I think it could go like 10 million times more intense okay I want a really chocolatey double chocolate the chocolate cookie so ultimately cookie okay so like think that other cookie the New York chocolatey boy it more got it okay and I want it warm well not straight from the oven I got that burn my mouth but I I want it as it as you guys have been having while I've girl she's so demanding but like come on joy is abuzz and it is Christmas and I've got my apron and the Crocs and she's gone so let's head into the bakery and we will come up with hopefully the most chocolate eeriest yummiest cookie for cupcake Gemma cos she deserves it and she's eating for two remember okay cupcake Gemma challenge accepted I'm gonna make you the most chocolaty version of that New York cookie that Dana and I came up with a few weeks ago unfortunately Dana's a busy guy he's over in Soho running our bakery there so it's just me today but I've been chatting with him and the other guys here Nikki Rosie and we think we've come up with the perfect recipe the little tape on the one we did before but it's not just as simple as chucking in cocoa and chocolate and I'll explain a bit more about that as we go on but we're gonna start with 230 grams of cold butter which is chopped up it's really important that it is cold straight from the fridge that's going to go in our mixer and we're gonna get that beating just for about one minute and that's just gonna gently break up our butter we don't want to cream it or anything it's too hard for that anyway we just want to break it up so now we can add some sugar and we've quite equal quantities 160 grams of both caster sugar and light brown soft sugar we'll pour both of those in and get the mixer going for another 30 seconds just to combine them with the butter and you can see it's not combined like as if you were creaming it together it's made little nuggets and that's absolutely perfect do not worry now we're going to go in with some chocolate we've got 450 grams here I'm going for a 54% chocolate because I sometimes find 70% is too intense and but by all means put whatever chocolate you like in your milk and then back on for again another 30 seconds just to kind of mix it through again not beating it not creaming it just combining it [Music] and now it's time for our dry ingredients and we're gonna start with the flour so we have got 230 grams of self-raising flour and 200 grams of plain flour now this is a little bit less than we had in the kind of regular chocolate chip cookie that's because we're going to add some cocoa and if we just added the cocoa on top of the full quantity of flour it's very to dry so we've kind of removed a little bit of self-raising flour - and replace with 70 grams of cocoa powder we're going to put all of that into the mix [Music] and then to give these cookies the lift that we want because we want big fat cookies we're going to go in with one full tablespoon of baking powder which bit of baking trivia for you is the same as three teaspoons a quarter teaspoon of bicarb and a full teaspoon of salt now so it's really important because it pulls out flavor and it just enhances everything so don't you know I know a lot of people don't really like pudding so and stuff but it's really beneficial and you'll get much more flavor from your cooking so we're going to put on a slow-speed and just let it sort of combine and it's going to go to a bread crumb consistency and that is exactly how we want it [Music] ok so now it's time to bind this all together and we're going to do that with our wonderful eggs I've got two large eggs but if we close the cocoa powder it does make this mixture a little bit drier we're going to add an extra egg yolk [Music] and I'm just mixing those up a little bit just because with this batter in general we don't want to over beat it so I'm just helping the eggs by mixing them together first put the mixer on slow and we're just going to pour in our egg and bind it all together and once your mixture has come together it won't take more than a minute or two we can start measuring our cookies and we're gonna go for 125 gram balls because we found that that is our preferred cookie maybe you like them bigger go for it so measure out 125 grams gently squish them together I'm not rolling them and then put them onto a board and keep going [Music] so it actually managed to get 13 rather than 12 I thought I was gonna get it 12 but what a full baker's dozen I'm not entirely sure why 13 is baker's dozen anyway we're gonna wrap these in cling film because we need to freeze these for 90 minutes or overnight and because we want them to fake so they're all kind of gooey and the inside and freezing them is going to help with that it's gonna stop them from spreading as well so I'm gonna pop these in for 90 minutes now luckily I've already made some cookie dough because I don't want to wait 90 minutes for these to chill and I've already got my oven set to 180 degrees C with a fan and also I've got in there a baking tray getting nice and hot because that's going to make the underneath of our cookies nice and crispy [Music] okay so we need to space our cookies out enough that they're not going to stick together because they are going to spread a little bit but I think we can probably get about 9 or 10 on here at once we've got a lot of hungry people in this kitchen today and I know they all want a cookie so we're gonna bake these for 18 minutes and they crack the outsides really nice and crispy and the inside sorry all squishy and gooey [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my goodness they look amazing no oh hi there - hi - I know look at them mmm they're really squishy but they are far too hot to be eating right now or so we need to let them cool down a bit so they kind of stick together if you try to pick this up now it's gonna crumble so shoot ten minutes burn your fan they will burn your face oh really good I made the bail amazing do don't they and then they do cool down a bit but they're still soft and melty yeah them the chocolate chips should be melted still let's have a look inside oh my god there you go let's do it okay with that drop the tea enough for you I mean yeah good right thank you we're also gonna have these in the solar stalks along with the chocolate chip version that Dana and I did so if you're in the area please go and check it out get cakes get cookies get coffee put your feet up while she doing your sales shopping and everything yeah yeah that's fine that's fine but um yeah thank you so much for watching and I'll just keep talking we'll be back in the new year with loads more recipes it's been a super fun really busy 2019 with weddings and babies and New York ish trips for some for me and Sam we had a great

pinnacle of perfection if you wanna fade bat chuay cookie like the kind you see at bakeries and specialty shops then these are cookies for you we'll start by preheating the oven to 325 degrees next Greece to cookie sheets or if you prefer you can line them with parchment paper sif together two cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and half a teaspoon of salt then set that aside now melt one and a half sticks of butter that's about three-quarters of a cup combined now with one cup of packed brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar cream this together really well when those are blended beat in 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract 1 whole egg plus one egg yolk this mixture until it is light and creamy to add the dry ingredients and combine until just blended making sure not to over mix at this point now using a wooden spoon stirring two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips once the chips are evenly distributed throughout drop the dough 1/4 of a cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets leave 3 inches between each cookie because they will spread bake the cookies in your preheated oven for about 15 to 17 minutes the cookies are done when the edges turn light brown cool

automated meal plan and customized shopping lists it's super simple to use and to give you a teaser here's one of the recipes from the website it is a one pan skillet chocolate chip cookie that everyone can dive into with lots of vanilla ice cream it is phenomenal [Music] now i'm all about nailing your mid-week meal plan but sometimes you need a sweet treat and this one pan chocolate chip cookie is the way forward it's only a handful of ingredients that you most likely have in your kitchen store cupboard and it's all combined in this now what you are going to need is a greased oven proof pan and once you have that ready to rock and your oven set to 160 degrees celsius we're good to go so into a bowl with two types of sugar some caster sugar and some light brown sugar and it's the combination of these two sugars that's going to give you that irresistible toffee chewiness to this beautiful big cookie so to this some softened butter now with a hand mixer you just want to get this beaten until it's light and fluffy this is the kind of sweet treat that just ticks all the boxes so to our butter and sugar mix we're going to get in there with one large free range egg and just beat that until it's nicely mixed through now for our dry ingredients i've got some plain flour some baking powder and some baking soda for some flavor some vanilla extract and when you've got your dry ingredients in there very gently and slowly start to incorporate them right the dough is pretty much good to go so just time now to fold in some dark chocolate and some white chocolate chunks give that a good mix through and try not to eat the dough at this point which is what i'm always tempted to do and just to finish it off and to balance out the sweetness that's in there a little pinch of salt goes a long way as soon as you have that rough cookie dough this actually works quite well if you freeze them as logs and you can slice up cookies to bake in the oven or if you're doing this method you literally take that entire cookie dough mix and pop it straight into a skillet or a frying pan and then using the spatula just press it into all the edges now the true trick to getting really great texture on your cookie dough is to rest it so at this point now we're going to pop it into the fridge and let it rest for about an hour now i know that step of chilling the dough is an extra one and it takes a little bit more time but it will make a difference to the end texture of this cookie dough so at this point now that it has chilled it's going to go into the oven it's going to cook for 20 minutes now just have a look at that one pan chocolate chip cookie and it is essential if you're cooking this in the oven in a pan that you make sure that you use one that is an oven-proof handle and that you make sure that it's completely covered with a towel when you bring it to the table now we're going to finish it off by adding some ice cream just to the top and then it's just a case of digging in three little ice cream scoops that just melt into that hot cookie mixture now to serve it up bowl spoon let's go come on beautiful soft melted cookie and then that gorgeous scoop of ice cream on top now all that's left to do is dive in and try some you've got beautiful melted ice cream you've got really tender cookie and a bit of chew wow oh it's this intense sweetness that you just want it wraps you up in a bowl of beautiful cookie comfort now if you want the recipe of course it's on donald's kitchen i know you're going to want to try this so check it out and let me know how you get on [Music] you", "ZhGDifSknfQ": "- DoubleTree Hotels has just released their famous chocolate chip cookie recipe. All of these ingredients\nseem pretty standard for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. There are a couple surprises that I think are pretty interesting. Let's see what it's all about. All right, I'm gonna start\nby mixing my dry ingredients. So that starts with two and\n1/4 cup of all purpose flour, a half a cup of rolled oats, a teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of baking soda,\nand then a pinch of cinnamon. So, this could be the secret. 'Kay, I'm gonna stir these together and have those ready\nto go in just a minute. All right, now we'll get\nready and mix the batter, so that starts with two sticks of butter that are at room temperature. 'Kay, we're gonna cream\ntogether the butter with 3/4 cup of light brown sugar and 3/4 cup plus one\ntablespoon of white sugar. (measuring spoon clunks) All right, I'm gonna cream the\nbutter and the sugar together for about two minutes. (mixer whirs) All right, once your butter\nand sugar have come together for a couple minutes, then\nwe're gonna add in two eggs, one and 1/4 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and freshly squeezed lemon juice. So we're gonna need 1/4 teaspoon of this. (measuring spoon taps) Not sure what that does, but I have a feeling that's\nthe secret ingredient. (mixer whirs) We gotta let that go for about 30 seconds, then I'm gonna crank\nthe speed up to medium and let it go for two minutes\nuntil it's really fluffy. And you'll scrape down\nthe sides as necessary. (mixer whirs) Something 'bout a good\nchocolate chip cookie. (mixer powers down) 'Kay, that looks great. I'm going to add in my dry ingredients while the mixer's on low. And then you don't wanna overmix here. It says to go about 45 seconds. (mixer whirs) (bowl taps) (mixer powers down) All right, that looks great. Now we're going to stir in\nour last two ingredients. Now we're going to fold\nin one and 1/3 cups of chopped walnuts and two and 2/3 cups Nestle Toll House chocolate chips. They specify this brand, so\nthat's what we're gonna do. (chips rattle) That is more than a bag, so\nbe sure you buy two bags. 'Kay, so this is going to require a little bit of arm strength. So you wanna get these folded in, but we don't wanna overmix. 'Kay, looks good. We're going to do three\ntablespoon size portions two inches apart on a\nparchment-lined baking sheet. All right, 300 degrees\nfor 20 to 23 minutes, so I will definitely be\nchecking them at 20 minutes, because I don't like an overbaked cookie. See ya soon. First tray, outta the oven. Look at these. You wanna pull them when\nthey're a little bit brown around the edges, but they're\nstill pretty gooey on top. Then you're gonna let\nthem cool on the tray for about an hour. I don't think I can wait that long. All right, my cookies have\nbeen cooling not quite an hour because I can't wait that long. You gotta see this. These look really good, and\nthey baked up perfectly, so, so far, loving this recipe. (cookie crunches quietly) Mm. I love getting a little bit of saltiness in a chocolate chip cookie, and this has the perfect amount. It is slightly crisp around the edges, but soft in the middle, and\nof course, I love that too. Mm. DoubleTree definitely has\na good thing going on. These cookies are just about perfect. (cookie crunches quietly) They are perfect.

Happy baking.", "aw8m4TE90ag": "these cookies are big how big extremely big six ounces of Pop I'm telling you if you're not prepared for these cookies just stop don't even try this recipe if anyone leaves a comment on this recipe can I make these cookies smaller the answer is No [Music] hey everybody we're here today with some really epic cookies these are levan style copycats chocolate chip cookies fashioned after a bakery in New York that makes these giant monster cookies these cookies are no joke they came not to play but to slay you can kill a man with these cookies not that you should but if you needed to it would certainly get the job done it would also make for an interesting game of Clue this cookie is the size of my face it's my face entirely blocked out we're making this cookie dough it's really easy because I just am exerted a little work for us we're gonna throw in all these ingredients first up some light brown sugar this is the kind of situation where light brown sugar matters dark brown sugar is them has molasses content it's a little too high and some cos cookies to spread more do not want we want these cookies to say thick crowd favorite here seriously so calm toasted sugar this recipe does not require toasted sugar if you don't have any don't worry about it you can start making cookies right now with plain white sugar it's not going to be a real deal breaker if you don't have it but if you do push it over the top salt baking powder and baking soda next up a little bit of butter a little bit it's a whole stick it's a quarter pound of butter it's plenty of butter there's it's been softened to cool room temperature about sixty sixty-five degrees vanilla no gonna do a whole dang tablespoon that's a half an ounce for y'all doing the math at home a little bit of a secret ingredient here is an extremely small amount of nutmeg we're talking a smallest amount of nutmeg it's like 0.1 grams if we were to weigh it out nutmeg has this cool power where it makes butter taste more buttery so that's how we're putting it in here if you can taste the Nutmeg you've added too much don't overdo it this is a real delicate matter so just go on that's it okay gonna pop this on the mixer trusty paddle attachment I'm gonna start out on low speed just to get everything combined and then crank it up to medium so we can get some light and fluffy business we're gonna crank up the speed [Music] waiting set light and fluffy magic these are eggs straight from the fridge I'm kind of Cavalier and I'm just going to crack them straight in if you're not comfortable doing that you can crack them into a little bowl and then tip them in so it starts to smooth back out it's time for egg number two [Music] gonna decrease the speed here too low and add our all-purpose flour [Music] once the flower is mostly incorporated it's time to add the walnuts raw walnuts if you're using pecans I'd recommends hosting them first you've been baking with me long on serious eats calm or in my book a chart you'll know that I'm a big fan of chopped chocolate and cookies so you might be surprised to see that I'm using chocolate chips in this recipe historically in America chocolate chips have been made of a very low quality chocolate since to be a little bit harsh and unbalanced nowadays there are a lot of different chocolate chips on the market and in fact I have made my own chocolate chip blend using 8 different brands of chocolate chips so you know we've got like some big guys and some little guys choc chunks this recipe has more chocolate than butter and sugar combined so for that reason using a mix of different chocolates is really gonna make the flavor pop overall instead of every single bite tastes like the exact same chocolate you get some different nuances and it really adds some depth of flavor it creates some more interesting chocolate serve well that's it alright so these cookies are six ounces of pop a little wax paper on scale here so I don't have to wash it in between useless here goes five and one eight ounces i us six and one eight that's like one chocolate chip of too many shout-out to my friend Cheryl who describes this as a threatening amount of cookie dough anyhow it's time for a little dough wranglin these monsters need to be wrestled into some spherical like shape so best way to do that is by hand you guys are squeamish you don't want touch though I don't know why you're baking round it up into a nice spherical shape pop it on a baking sheet we're not baking them right now this is a type of dough that benefits from aging overnight in the fridge help start may are browning so the cookies get some nice color in the oven it also helps keep them nice and thick what's the flowers hydrate it's a little bit of chewiness I'm just gonna cover these in plastic and I'll see you tomorrow whole day has passed if you can even believe it I know it seems like only seconds this is some dough that has been chilling for 24 hours in the fridge you can tell I'm not lying because that's the fun of 6 ounces of chocolate chip cookie dough intimidation I'm only baking for because there's not that many people here at serious eats today and there's no way all eight cookies will be eaten we would die alright gonna pop these in the oven see you later [Music] look at these three perfect angels and a hell spawn we have three perfect cookies and one intentional screw-up so in case you're wondering what happened here this cookie is what happens when you don't roll up the dough after portioning all the dough I roll it into a nice smooth ball that ensures the cookie spreads at a slow even rate and that keeps them nice and thick if the dough is just left in a rough hodgepodge pile this is what happens it spreads every rich way and it spreads a lot thinner so if you've ever wondered why someone wants the trouble to write such an obnoxious detail on a recipe this is why these cookies are so thick and chunky that using a thermometer is a really good way to test them to make sure that are fully cooked you want to see them somewhere in the upper 1 70s to low 180s it's weighty it's a six ounce wad of dough its hefty and it's loaded with chocolate chips and walnuts the gang is all here guys so thanks for joining me on this emotional roller coaster as we tackles the largest cookies known to man these cookies can end a person but we're here we're alive we made them what I did and you can too [Music]", "qqGoXMEius4": "So here's a question for you: Who among us\ndoesn't love a freshly-baked chocolate chip cookie? If you hand anyone a plate of these tempting\ntreats, they're sure to go full-blown Cookie Monster on you nom-nom-nom, as the kids like\nto say. In fact, chocolate chip cookies are such a\nfavorite that it's hard to believe they haven't been around since the dawn of mankind. Curiously, these delightful snacks only date\nback to the 1930s, where they were invented at a restaurant called the Toll House and\nyes, that's precisely why they're often referred to as Toll House cookies. So now you know. You probably also know that the original recipe\nthe one you'll find printed on bags of Nestle chocolate chips is already just about perfect. Still, there are lots of ways to improve on\nthe classics, usually by switching up one magic ingredient. Lucky for you, Handle the Heat blogger Tessa\nArias took it upon herself to test the most popular ingredient tweaks for the classic\nchocolate chip cookie. She replaced butter with shortening, substituted\ncake or bread flour for all-purpose flour, and added cornstarch or an extra egg yolk. The verdict? The secret ingredient that made the very best\nchocolate chip cookies was the same one endorsed by celebrity chef Alton Brown: Namely\u2026 bread\nflour. \"Sift together two and a quarter cups of bread\nflour with a teaspoon each of salt and baking soda.\" It's true: Bread flour makes for the thickest,\nchewiest cookies on the planet, and Arias strongly suggests that you substitute at least\nhalf the all-purpose flour for bread flour when making your chocolate chip cookies. But if you don't use any all-purpose flour,\nyou might need to adjust the proportions a little bit. Her recipe calls for using 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons\nof all-purpose bread flour in place of 1 cup of all-purpose flour. Alton Brown's famous chewy chocolate chip\ncookie recipe also calls for using only bread flour, which is measured in ounces 12 of them,\nto be exact; approximately 2 and 1/3 cup. He even helpfully uses a puppet to help explain\nwhy this is: \"Since bread flour can absorb much more liquid\nthan all-purpose flour, more moisture will stay in the cookie.\" Thanks for clearing that up! Meanwhile, Brown assures us that the bread\nflour will help you attain \"extra chewiness\" in your cookie, and everyone will be thrilled\nwith the results. According to Baker Bettie's Baking 101, bread\nflour has the highest amount of protein of any of the most commonly used types of baking\nflour the others being all-purpose flour, cake flour, self-rising flour, and whole wheat\nflour. In the baking process, extra protein translates\nto extra gluten and gluten is what creates that highly desirable \"extra chewy factor.\" That's why bread flour is a smart swap for\nregular all-purpose flour. Bettie also has her own scientifically-formulated\nrecipe for chocolate chip cookies that are chewy, yet thin. This recipe calls for using bread flour as\nthe only type of flour in the whole recipe. Bettie also provided a few other tweaks for\nadded chewiness in a blog post about the science behind chocolate chip cookies: For example,\nyou can use more brown sugar than white sugar in the cookie recipe. Or you can eliminate one egg white and add\ntwo tablespoons of milk in its place. You can also choose to melt the butter instead\nof creaming it. Want to know why? It's because melting the butter releases water\nwhich, when combined with the bread flour, creates yet more gluten. Chocolate chip cookies are a beautiful thing\nin their original form but the recipe can certainly be tweaked if you want to try improving\non perfection. The website Food52 claims: \"Cornmeal adds a slight grit and texture to\nthe batter. Toffee echoes, and repeats back, the earthy\nsweetness of brown sugar without adding too much extra sweetness.\" Last but not least, a little sea salt helps\ntie the whole thing together. Meanwhile, the craft beer website The Beeroness\nposted a recipe for chocolate chip cookies flavored with chai spices, molasses, and,\nyou guessed it: beer.

week it's chock-full robach of amazing recipe see what you did there DJ and who better to kick it all off for us then chef Jacques Torres who is here to make his world famous chocolate chip cookie I say world-famous because I mean this is kind of an American classic you're French obviously so why did you decide to take on the chocolate chip cookie because I love cookies you know they are great they are good they have chocolates and by the way did Namine why not in mail coming for the adult it's way better way better okay that's why you take up taco you didn't think we were doing them well enough you see us dipping them in milk that's the wrong way to go okay what's this about cream and butter here we have to do so cream and butter is the better its code let's it go for five minutes if the butter is room temperature go do it a little bit you know two minutes will be fine then I have here the butter and the sugar you add the wet ingredients you have the vanilla whenever you finish mix you add the dry ingredients okay that does the secret I see you are bread flour and cake flour why it's because all-purpose flour is good for everything but not ready for nothing you need to make your own mix so by doing 50/50 you do a batch of cookies you try them keep two in the freezer - cookie dough so you'd show the cookie dough no no I'm sorry let's go back so you mix fifty-fifty keep a little bit of dough next time do 40 50 the following time - 40 50 whenever you do cookies and then you cook those cookies together and you try the way you like and the way you like them that's called adjusting the flour now don't over mix the flour have protein the protein become gluten that elasticity into the the cookies so don't over mix the dough you don't want to over mix that gluten the last thing is chill the dough overnight so the dough going to match you're going to get more flavor has the vitriol what we don't do if it's okay but it's better to chill that and then you get anxious you want those cookies you jump on we're gonna make him tomorrow now pinch of salt on them during the flavor to me of course the most important going to be the chocolate a lot of time you make cookies there is a big picture of cookies on the studio those chocolate chips didn't melt so if they don't melt in the oven at 350 degree what do you think that chocolates going to do in your stomach in no I'm going to melt good eat that bad chocolate ha good chocolate I mean you have I'm working you have to eat the way we go here okay you have my wine wait so you actually I love this added thing after they come out of the oven how long you wait you actually dip them and melted so what are you are going to bake them I have some in the oven behind me when they are baked let them cool down melt some chocolates again some good chocolate the same chocolate that you put inside French chocolate you know it doesn't have to be French but you know good quality chocolate and then you're going to put a little chocolates on the back of them you can use a brush you can use a spatula whatever you like let them cool down a tiny bit Oh another way to do it take your cookies but your cookies take your chocolate and eat the chocolate you can get this recipe by the way on our website Good Morning America calm we've got day two tomorrow but it's gonna be tough to beat this one thank you well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from GMA every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on GMA", "4rphXONtZnQ": "we're all really excited today because we're making a chocolate chip refrigerator cape kind of like the cake that you make of the chocolate wafers and the whipped cream but with chocolate chip cookies it's gonna be really great first of course you need to make cookies so I have a two and a quarter cups of flour and this is a teaspoon of baking soda and then one and a quarter teaspoons of coarse salt whisk together sure you whisk it properly because you want to make sure that your baking soda is well distributed in the dry ingredients and then at two sticks of butter one and a half cups of light brown sugar and to that I'm adding 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar and then make sure your butter is room temp and beat until fluffy you're looking for your mixture to get lighter and fluffier but with brown sugar I've said this before it doesn't get as light and fluffy as with white sugar so just keep that in mind when you're looking to see where you're going it should be nice and well combined and if your butter is soft and at two teaspoons of vanilla extract and two large eggs [Applause] you want to add each egg and let it beat in before you add the second one so it combines well and eggs add additional leavening power to the chemical leavener which is the baking soda so you want to give it its chance to actually heat up gonna add them all at once not like a cake batter you're not wanting to keep it tender in the same way that you do with a cake so I just go ahead and add all my flour at once but be careful when you turn the mixer back on that you don't turn it too high because things go flying out of this mixer if it's on too high of a speed in the beginning two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and then beat to combine and your cookie batter is done the very classic cookie dough 1 tablespoon scoops onto parchment lined they spread a little bit so give them some room between to spread out they don't have to be perfectly shaped though because you're gonna form these into the base of your cake and you're not really going to see each part so continue doing this baking them off until you've baked them all you should take about 12 to 14 minutes and a 375 to make your cake you'll need three layers of nine each cookies how many cookies that it's a lot to bake off on your cookies and then to assemble you have to whip a bunch of cream I have 3 cups of heavy cream in my mixer and I'm gonna whisk that with 8 ounces of mascarpone cheese this adds richness not that you need more richness and a little bit of stability to the heavy cream with 2 tablespoons of sugar and if you like you can add in vanilla it's up to you this is a tape whiskey bourbon vanilla whatever you want you want to make sure your whipped cream is stiff enough to hold up all those cookies so it shouldn't be that loose sort of lip cream the recipe doesn't say to do this but I'm going to create a little layer of glue for my cookies on the bottom of my cake stand but this way when you layer your cookies on there they won't slide all over the place and it's delicious glue so there you can slightly overlap them this works great there you go so each layer gets built like this spreading the whipped marscapone and cream between each layer you'll need to do seven layers you want to go almost completely to the edge with the whipped cream you'll need to use about one cup per layer you want to overlap as little as possible because the whipped cream is what's gonna soften these cookies and turn them into sort of cake layers so you want to not have them overlap too much but it's nice to have not too much space between them as well so use your judgement keep layering until you've used up all of the whip cream and all of the cookies and then refrigerate it for at least two hours and up to overnight you're definitely gonna want to cover it so that all of the moisture stays in doesn't get dried out or get any of those refrigerator flavors but also the moisture from the whipped cream is what softens the cookies into the cake like layers to make it a little bit more even and cute I've been overlapping so that I go where the the gap is with the next layer of cookies and I think it's keep that may I also seem to be going smaller as I get to the top because all of a sudden I just realized that I started with nine on the bottom and now I only have six that's all right it doesn't look uneven that's the most important part lay off okay that was the final there it should go into the refrigerator and like I said overnight you'd probably want to cover it so it's had chance to soften I left mine in the refrigerator overnight you can top it with more whipped cream because there's never enough whipped cream in life sprinkle with some chocolate shavings or if you don't have chocolate shavings you could do like little mini chocolate chips or something like that whatever you like and then of course you're gonna want to try your masterpiece right I want to try mine this serves a lot of people I'm just saying it's a humongous cake I mean the crazy thing is all that whipped cream which was like seven cups of whipped cream all got absorbed into the cookies hmm it's totally delicious and it serves like a hundred thousand people to make it for your next party and then thank me afterwards if you like recipes like this and you want more make sure to click like and subscribe because we have plenty more where this came from [Music]", "iH8iTR2fIQQ": "- There's nothing better than\na warm chocolate chip cookie. I'm gonna show you how\nto make one right now. So we're gonna start up with your butter. That's two and a half sticks. Softened to room temperature. We've got one cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of white sugar. Now we're going to cream the\nbutter and sugars together. We're beating it until\nit's light and fluffy. And when you're beating\nthis, you're actually adding some air into the butter\nand when the cookies bake they'll bake a lot plumper and higher because we've integrated that\nair, which is a good thing. Brown sugar will give\nyour cookies some chew. While white sugar will\ngive them some crispiness. I prefer my cookies a little\nchewy so I like to go a little heavy on the brown sugar. So this is looking good. We can start adding our\nvanilla and our eggs. I'm gonna start with one egg at a time. Just get them integrated evenly. Egg number two. And now we're gonna add our vanilla. I'm using two teaspoons of vanilla. This is a two teaspoon measure. Pretty fancy. I found that using cheap\nvanilla works just as well as expensive vanilla in cookies. I would save the nice stuff for ice cream and other things where vanilla\nis taking center stage. All right, so I'm gonna\nset our wet ingredients to the side for now and we'll\nmix up our dry ingredients. We have three ingredients going\nin our dry ingredients bowl. Number one, flour. This is just all-purpose flour. Ingredient number two, baking soda. And salt, last ingredient. We call for three quarters of a teaspoon. I like my cookies a little salty so I'm gonna add a little extra. Then we're just gonna\nwhisk this to combine. Now it's time to bring them together. I'm just gonna add these. You don't wanna add the whole thing yet. And now the rest. This is looking good. Ready for the chocolate chips. I like semi-sweet chocolate chips. But you can do milk chocolate. You could do dark chocolate. You could chop up chocolate\nbars if you wanted, that's really nice. But you need chocolate because it's chocolate chip cookie, okay? Lovely. So if you were gonna\nadd nuts or dried fruit, this would be the time to do it. But we're just gonna keep it classic. I think it's time to put\nthese babies on a baking sheet and get them in the oven. Baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Another important tool I love\nis this little cookie scoop. The best part about this is\nthat when you're scooping you're getting the exact\nsame amount in every cookie and then they bake evenly\nwhich is really important. If you don't have one of\nthese, try to make sure that you're getting your\nscoops about the same size so you can have an even bake. Make sure you're giving your\ncookies a little bit of space. About an inch or two\nbecause they're gonna spread in the oven and you don't want\nthem crowding on each other and squishing into each other. I almost forgot. Something very important that\nwe do a lot here at Delish. It's sort of a little food styling tip. We like to press chocolate chips\nonto the top of the cookies before we bake them. That way they just look extra\nabundant, full of chocolate. It just makes them look a lot better. We've had this oven preheated\nto 375 and these babies are going in. I'm gonna set the timer for 10 minutes. They likely won't be done by\nthem but I just wanna start checking because you don't\nwanna burn your cookies. See ya later. So it's been 10 minutes. I'm just gonna take a peek at them. Eh, they're getting a\nlittle golden on the bottom but not quite there yet. I'm gonna give them a couple more minutes. These look perfect. Starting to get a little\ngolden on the outside. Still a little squishy on the inside. But if you wait until\nthey're completely brown when they're in the oven, when they cool and they continue cooking, they're gonna get a little overcooked. So it's better to pull them before they're completely golden. We're just gonna let these\nguys cool on the tray for a couple minutes before we move them to the cooling rack. They smell incredible. (sultry music) Just dunk this in milk and I'm so excited. (upbeat music) Oh my God. This is the perfect cookie because it's loaded with chocolate. It's got the caramelized crunchy edges. They're chewy and soft in the middle. It's just 10 out of 10. Delicious. This is the best day\nI've ever had at work. (upbeat music)", "Z6a6x0tH_pU": "today we're making this amazing one-minute microwave cookie this is not a mug cookie this is not a sad cookie this is a proper delicious microwave cookie i really wanted to develop a recipe for you that was quick and amazing once you try this you'll always be making one minute chocolate chip cookie okay so we're gonna start out with some good old butter which we're gonna melt in the microwave to this we're gonna add some brown sugar and a dash of milk which you'll see in a moment i do not like to add eggs to any of my microwave recipes you know this eggs in the microwave usually become rubbery and we don't like to eat rubber not on my channel okay so we're gonna substitute the eggs with a dash of milk if you're new to my channel hello there welcome make sure to subscribe and click that notification bell i post new videos every week i've gone ahead and added the dry ingredients which are just flour baking soda and salt and you want to mix these just until combined now i'm using chocolate chunks today i've just cut up you know a chocolate bar you can use chocolate chips use whatever you like you're going to fold these into the dough and then you're going to bring the dough together with your hands and shape it into a cookie so form a ball and press it down place it onto some parchment paper add more chocolate chips if you like and this is done well this is not done you know you get it okay we're ready to microwave this now i'm gonna speed up the video but i do want to mention two important things you're going to cook your cookie for exactly one minute however every microwave is different so just know that your cookie could take between one minute and one minute and 15 seconds the second most important thing to know is to not overcook your cookie your cookies should come out of the microwave still soft as you can see when you pick it up it's gonna be really soft so let this cool for about five minutes otherwise it's gonna be too hot to handle and the cookie will just fall apart how amazing does this look you would think this was made in a regular oven if you love warm soft baked cookies you have to try this this gooey delicious and satisfy make this for late night craving after school after work have this with ice cream you'll love it you", "XpqmfnxtYwg": "we're going to make a cookie dough and this cookie dough inside the right mold give you that house so it's not that complicated okay step by step we should stick with cookies just two little round ones make the cookie so as you know cookies always start with the butter and the sugar you cream that together that's what's going on here you add the eggs so so far no no surprise the only thing that I do different is that I don't use all-purpose flour to me all-purpose flour is good for everything and it's not really good for nothing because it's good for everything so I like to mix my flour bread and cake fifty-fifty you have a certain elasticity 4060 you have another elasticity so depending on what you like you're going to grab your new going to add just so that's what I like to do this is a 50/50 now I put the dry ingredients so you use you know the recipe that you usually use use the the flour the way I just did baking powder baking soda vanilla or yes I forget the vanilla sorry so now you know what what make a cookie really great you don't want to cook it to beat well I think that's why the two different flour but that's the secret ingredients good quality shot and also the size of those of those pieces they have to be big so something that you have to remember is you don't want cookie cookies to be elastic so just mix the flour makes a no don't over mix it so look at I'm going to mix it but you get the message a mix that and then you have the cookie dough the cookie dough is here using this is hard it's raw and they already [Applause] yeah so the last thing is I will put a little bit of sister before I beg them I love to bake them the day after mm-hmm and for two reason one that the flower going to relax all the the flavor of the ingredients going to blend well but that going to build anticipation [Applause]", "yzMgGqoq4t8": "hey guys today we're making two of the\nmost incredible bakery style chocolate chip cookies they're warm and gooey and\nchocolaty everything you would want a chocolate chip cookie after watching\nthis video make sure you head over to sauce stache - to get that bonus cookie recipe guys\nhis link will be in the description box below but for now let's make my\nbakery style cookies so the method to making these cookies is\nsimilar to regular cookie recipes however they're quite different and\nyou'll see why as we go along and my bowl have butter vanilla and I'm going\nto cream that with my white and brown sugar if you're new to my channel\nwelcome make sure to subscribe and click the bell I post new videos every week\nnow if you've been following me for a while now you know I usually use just\nthe yolks in my cookie recipes however today we're using whole eggs egg whites\nwill give lift to the cookies resulting and bigger and thicker cookies once the\neggs are combined you can go ahead and add the dry ingredients this dough is\nquite thick so I do recommend you use a spatula or even better just your hands\nnow one of the things that makes these cookies so special is the chocolate you\nwant to use real chocolate guys because not only does it have excellent flavor\nbut it melts compared to chocolate chips that are designed to keep their shape in\nthe oven you want to cut the chocolate into these big chunks we want these\ncookies to be as chocolaty and as gooey as possible you do want to pop the\nchocolate chunks in the freezer just for 10 minutes or they will melt when you're\nmixing them into your dough now I'm also going to be adding some toasted walnuts\nthe cookies I was inspired by today are Livan cookies which have nuts but if you\ndon't want the nuts you can totally leave those out you're going to mix the\nnuts and the chocolate into your dough and this is why it's so important to pop\nthat chocolate into the freezer because the dough as you can see is quite stiff\nand you really do need to work those in now these cookies are meant to be huge\nokay each cookie should weigh around 150 grams I know a lot or if you don't have\na scale it's equal to two large packed ice cream scoops I know it seems quite\nexcessive it is but you're only going to have one cookie\nI hope so you're going to shape these into these big balls and you're going to\nfreeze the cookies these cookies are meant to be eaten warm so what I like to\ndo is I allow for them to freeze this will take around 30 minutes and then I\npop them in a ziploc bag and whenever you want a cookie you just take it out\nand pop it into the oven now these cookies are huge so only two or three\ncookies will fit onto a baking sheet bake these in a preheated oven at 200\ndegrees Celsius or 400 Fahrenheit for around 12 to 14 minutes the high\ntemperature will quickly set the edges and the outside of your cookies while\nkeeping the inside soft and gooey allow these to rest for 10 minutes to set you\nguys if you like warm cookies with a crispy outside and a gooey almost cookie\ndough inside you have to make these just look at these heaven for the second\ncookie recipe head

if you want to make homemade Nutella head on over a rock and Robin's cooking check out the video and subscribe because she's gonna show you how to make this at home the first step is to take a stick of butter and this is at room temperature so I'm just going to add this to a bowl followed by 2/3 of a cup of sugar then I'm going to take my mixer and beat this until it's fluffy and creamy after that go ahead and add in a couple of eggs a teaspoon of vanilla extract and once again we're going to take our mixer here and beat it until it's smooth and well incorporated now we're going to go ahead and work on our dry ingredients and to do this we're going to add two cups of flour to a separate bowl followed by a teaspoon of baking soda take your whisk and mix until it's well combined because the last thing you want is a big mouthful of baking soda once you've done that add 1/2 of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients then you're going to take your spatula and fold it in at the second half of the dry ingredients and continue to fold until you get a smooth mixture with no obvious lumps of flour okay now we're going to add in a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and gently pull them into the batter then culture cookie trayvis in baking spray what I'm going to do now is scoop up all I'd say about a tablespoon of the cookie dough place it in the palm of my hand and press down and flatten it out until I kind of get like a three-inch bitty pancake after that we're going to scoop up oh I'd say about a teaspoon of the Nutella and place this delicious goodness into the center of the dough what I'm doing now is grabbing all the edges and kind of folding them towards the center Pynchon shot until the nutella is sealed and entirely covered once you've done that go ahead and put them on the cookie tray and it doesn't matter if their seam side down seam side up same difference now these are a fairly large cookie and that's what I like but if you want them a little smaller use a little less cookie dough so what we're gonna do is slip these into a 350 degree preheated oven and bake them for about twelve to fourteen minutes while the cookies are baking

chocolate chip cookie cheesecake bars and they are so good I cannot wait to make this for you guys so let's get started alright so the first step we're going to do is combine our salt in our baking soda with our all-purpose flour go ahead and throw that in there together and just whisk it around I should have use a bigger bowl with something in this tiny LeBeau y'all know I don't know alright so going to set that aside in a large bowl we're going to add in some melted butter we're gonna throw in some sugar and then we're going to add in a big ol plop a brown sugar brown sugar makes chocolate chip cookie so moist and chewy I like that so go ahead and add that brown sugar in there stir it up until it's well combined and then add in your eggs we're going to throw in a little bit of vanilla extract to give it a nice little flavor go ahead and mix it up until it's combined I love that this recipe this part anyway does not require a mixer I can just mix it up with my whisk and my spatula love that okay no one's going to add our dry ingredients into our wet ingredients and stir it up until it is well combined that flour is well incorporated in the dough starts to form just like this that's perfect now we're going to work on making our cheesecake layer I'm going to add some softened cream cheese into a bowl I let it sit out to soften up really good then we're going to throw in some sour cream I really like when cheesecake has sour cream in it the texture is like perfect when you add sour cream to Cheesecake love it now we're going to put in that beaten egg we're going to mix it up until it is combined really well and they're going to add in some vanilla extract you can really just mix all these cheesecake ingredients up into a bowl at one time and it will come out perfect we're going to add in some powdered sugar to sweeten it up but not too much this isn't really sweet because of chocolate chip cookies that those two layers really don't need a lot of sweetness so there you go nice and silky beautiful and now let's start putting this bar together I have prepared my baking pan by lining it with parchment paper we're going to take half of that dough and just press it down into our pan into a nice even flat layer oh my gosh you guys next time I'm gonna use like brownie for the bottom part they'll be so good having like a brownie crust oh my gosh but today we're using this um cookie dough crust go ahead and sprinkle on some chocolate chips in a little even layer this is optional but you know so good and then we're going to spread on our cheesecake layer pop it on spread it out until it's nice and even just like that we're going to add some chocolate chip to the remaining dough go ahead and fold those in and then just go ahead and take this dough and just kind of sprinkle it over the top of that cheesecake layer it is kind of sticky but I don't know it's kind of fun doing this part going to sprinkle it into all the Cheesecake layers layer is covered up and they're gonna sprinkle it with some more chocolate chips because you know we're gonna be not a much will be really not a you know I'm saying we're going to bake this at 325 for about 35 minutes when it comes out of the oven go ahead and let it sit until it is completely cooled off and then throw it in the fridge for at least three hours I did overnight and try your best not to dig into it I was tearing this stuff up at nighttime you I couldn't wait then go ahead and cut it into little bars they're so cute look at that I love those layers yep even though these bar cookies are

sugar let's go ahead and add them it's not gonna hurt anything two days so you can add your eggs after you fluff up your sugar and better if you want to probably the smartest thing to do so that was one and a half cups of flour so we're going to need two more half cups to be two minutes of quiet [Music] we got the oven on preheat I like to bake chocolate chip at 350 degrees so it's at 350 degrees [Music] and while that finishes get mixed up good I'm on [Music] now what we're gonna do was at our chance I'd like to add half a bag of milk chocolate and a bag of semi-sweet [Music] I think to make these extra good I'm gonna add another teaspoon of vanilla [Music] why not I got tons of it right girls look on that turn it off I'm never gonna get these and drop them out on a cookie sheet you can use parchment if you want to it's easier to clean up if you if you have time my parchment is expensive but if you buy it in large quantity it's not as expensive so I didn't like to buy my parchment from wholesale clubs or online and larger watch these the parchment that I have now is actually something I got off Amazon you can buy this online anything you see me using whether it's even down to the parchment paper I have leaked if you go to www.qcnet.com now these cookies because we didn't add the oatmeal and the pecans are a little bit softer they'll be really good if you want to cut them out then you have to refrigerate them first but there's no reason why you have to do that if the cookie has a drier batter or it's been refrigerated I would use a cookie scoop but today these are fresh it's still nice and creamy I'm just gonna use a spoon I'm actually using a tablespoon because I want them to be nice to be chewy in the middle crispy on the outside cookies and of course the bigger you make them the more you have to spread them apart all right we're gonna get this in the oven come on why add just a little bit to this one because I don't have quite as much open yes you think Chris for those big dirty yeah we'll try thirteen minutes timer 13 start we'll see you in a minute so we make cookies when I was growing up I never had one of these I couldn't you know it was simple I didn't have parchment paper and I didn't have one of these but it's best to have cookies when you get the power to let them cool just a minute or two and then slide them off and put them on here because they will continue to cook on this the good thing about using parchment is you can just pull over and you can use another piece of parchment or you can wait till they cool down and just slide them off and reuse your parchment let's see how these look nice and chewy that quick while they're nice and hot everybody wants a nice warm gooey chocolate chip cookie delicious hey y'all we didn't make two patches the first batch was a little lighter than the second match against the oven is warmer so if I were you I would set the timer for 12 minutes on average to get a lighter cookie like this to chew me let me show it to you nice and chewy in the middle crunchy on the outside the perfect chocolate chip cookie made with better I hope you have enjoyed watching card Valley cooks the kids are gonna love having chocolate chip cookies and sloppy joes for supper [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "ImtgKF5G_ro": "all right so Abilene and I made a chocolate chip cookie bars the other day and emmalin said these are so easy and they're so good I think we should tell everyone about them yeah we always bring them we have together with other families and everyone else loves them and they're like please bring them but the the secret is like they're so easy Emily makes them all I mean and like a good cook now excuse she can make more sophisticated things but she makes them all the time by herself the ingredients are super easy to keep on hand so am I why don't you hold up the ingredients and we'll just it's four it's only four ingredients all right you need one bag of chocolate chips one yellow cake mix one stick of butter and two eggs it come together super fast and you only get one Boulder nice so we're gonna get started making them and show you how quick they come together okay so step number one we are gonna melt the stick of butter just in a mixing bowl in the microwave all right so we usually put it in for do to a minute to start with do 30 seconds to start okay okay and we're gonna preheat the oven to 350 degrees okay so that was about 45 seconds there's just a few small pieces or just totally fine now Adeline is gonna crack the eggs into it but I also think it would be really fun if you wanted to like surprise a neighbor or someone from school or a friend to get these ingredients together and drop them off at their house and we even made a cute little printable with the recipe and a note that you could put with it so I think that without visa would that be a fun surprise for you if you got this yeah all right so then we're gonna mix those together [Applause] okay so once your butter and ank are combined to just pour in your cake mix I mean seriously this takes like one minute into the mix up ever to get everything together and then why is mixing that I am just going to spray the pan real quick you want to spray it pretty well they can stick a little bit okay and then once you have those mixed together you dump in your whole package of chocolate fix Texas semi-sweet yep Oh somebody sweet yes good call right and no it is not too much chocolate chips don't you worry about that at all it it seems like a little bit it seems like a lot right when you first dump it in it is the perfect ratio of cake to our cookie - chocolate chip you'll see see it like really you can tell it now it doesn't look like any chocolate to Civello yeah no it's perfect right okay so last step we're just gonna dump this into the cake pan you just kind of have to push it all around and spread it all out throughout the pan it does not have to be perfect but try and kind of work it to all the edges so it should look like this and it's ready to go in the oven for 22 minutes awesome and now we wait well actually it's only 22 minutes ago wait that long lips yes formated so I think it'd be fun if you either wanted to get the ingredients and drop them off for someone or you could just make them but also give them the recipe so that if they really like them then they can make them those yeah what else I really like about these is that it's super easy to keep all of the ingredients on hand and so whenever you're just like oh shoot I need to bring something somewhere you just whip them up and take them with right all right we just pulled them out of the oven and they look awesome and so what I like to is I like finding recipes like this that are just really quick easy I can make them I mean I don't have to think about the recipe or the ingredients so I love having recipes like this that are just kind of like our go-to quick simple easy so this is definitely a favorite oh and then when they taste good too like this right I seen on the cake or I seen on the - chip cookie bar so how would you describe these Evelyn what are they what would they do they taste like well yeah I would say like yeah if you can time it so you bring these when they're still just a little bit warm like even better yet right all right well thank you for joining us for a baking lesson and with Katalin and we will see you again soon hey so how much of this pan could you eat by yourself I don't I already told gage that I'll leave a tiny little spot here that corner piece so well you guys shoot the thumbnail for this I can eat all no yeah you guys get outside gonna let this cool all that guy canceled he got it up the way you wanted I go what are you gonna do it's really hot who don't want to do that you think you want to do that it's hot Oh seriously it's hot maybe that's gonna be your piece wasn't it hi [Applause]", "EqGMev7IeO0": "so this is what I've been working on the past couple days trying to perfect the chocolate chip cookie and as you can see here first attempt second attempt finally we've done it we're ready to share with you attempt and I'm going to show you exactly how to make these perfect every single time put the cookies down they're tempting I know we're going to start with our dry ingredients so in a bowl you want to get one cup of almond flour to that almond flour we're going to add half a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder the special ingredient we like to call The X Factor in our house xanthan gum real quickly before I add this let me show you the difference so these two do not have dancing them and this one does have Anthon gum and you can just see the difference from looking at them this is more like just a uniform cookie you can see the graininess in this these these actually are also a little more on the chewy side this is the perfect crisp cookie and when I say chewy I mean like bready not the good chewy like that you know you get in chewy packets of cookies these are the perfect combination of crisp and chewy that's why we think the dancing them is important however if you don't have it it's not a mandatory ingredient so we're going to add 1/4 of a teaspoon xanthan gum and then - the salt for the pista we're going exact and we'll give that a stir mix it well and set your dry ingredients aside moving on to our wet ingredients we're going to start with 4 tablespoons of butter add your 4 tablespoons of butter to a microstate microwave safe Bowl and microwave it for 30 seconds to your microwaves butter we are going to add half a cup of erythritol we've tried a bunch of different sweetness levels and we think we have it down to a science so give that a stir and then to this we're going to add 1/4 teaspoon vanilla ten drops of liquid stevia and finally one egg I like to add the erythritol vanilla and the stevia before the egg since the butter is really hot you don't want to add an egg directly to hot butter we don't want cooked eggs so now that you have your wet ingredients done we are going to slowly add our dry ingredients in two batches as we combine and that my friends is the perfect batter consistency this is exactly what you're looking for not too thick and not at all liquidy so now for the fun part the chocolate so here we're using unsweetened baker's chocolate so it's 100% cacao can be pretty bitter I'm still not used to it but Matt loves to eat this just after dinner by itself so we decided to go the route of baker's chocolate because you'll find this in a lot more grocery stores as opposed to Lily's chocolate chips that is also a great option we've used we actually use the chocolate chips in this first cookie but we ran out so we decided that this was a better route if you do find yourself using Lily's chocolate chips you can omit the stevia we decided to go with two sweeteners because this is a bitter so we want to cut that bitterness with some extra sweetener so we are going to use one ounce of baker's chocolate and then just roughly chop it up if you like little chunks you can make them smaller we like pretty big chunks perfect you're just going to add it directly to your batter give that a stir and that's it it's your perfect chocolate chip better we have the oven preheating to 350 right now and we're going to use our good old cookie scooper to make your batter will make anywhere from 12 to 13 depending on the size we're going to go with a solid 12 that is 12 with the little spare you can eat out of the bowl so we are going to put these in the oven anywhere from 20 to 25 minutes time will vary so definitely give give give them peak at 20 minutes and here they go it's time to taste the cookies and I've been tasting a lot of cookies over the past few days trying to get this recipe right and we have it right first thing a lot of people seem to be concerned with is the consistency of a chocolate chip cookie as what we learned and this is definitely on the harder side we're going to work on a soft baked cookie too but this one is delicious let's give this a taste look how nice and marbled with chocolate that is classic chocolate chip cookie I think it's a vanilla that really adds like that brown sugar enos that you would normally have in non keto chocolate chip cookies these are really good all the nutrition and instructions and everything is going to be in the blog post linked in the description of this video on point with the flavor you're looking for in just a traditional chocolate chip cookie give these a try let us know what you think [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "nGlnvWWb294": "Kito double chocolate-chip cookies is what we've got on tap today each one of these cookies has less than one net carb and these are some incredibly fudgy Kido cookies no you do not need avvocato to make these I know avocado is a very popular ingredient in making fudgy chocolate keto cookies but not today so if putting avocado in baked goods is not your thing these cookies have got you covered but that being said let's jump right into things make some low-carb keto double chocolate chip cookies all right first things first we're gonna preheat our oven to 325 degrees and then we'll want to take out our food scale and add a medium-sized bowl to it once we've done that we're gonna get out a stick of unsalted butter and we're gonna cut that up and add two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of it to our bowl once we've done that want to get out some keto chocolate chips to really add some intense chocolate flavor to our keto cookies lately I've been obsessed with these zero net carbs semi-sweet ones by Lily's so that's what I'm gonna be using for my keto cookies today anyways we're gonna add around one and a half tablespoons or 25 grams of those to our bowl and then we're gonna melt deep butter and the chocolate chips together so to do that we're just gonna microwave our Bowl for around fifteen to thirty seconds after we've taken care of that we're gonna bring the bowl back over to our food scale and as you're seeing here we'll want to use a spatula to mix the butter and chocolate chips together until a chocolate sauce forms once that happens we're gonna add the rest of our liquid ingredients for our keto cookies so we'll just want to crack and add a large egg to a small dish and then we're gonna give that a quick whisk with our fork we're just looking for the yolk to fully combined with the white and when it does we're gonna add that to the chocolate sauce we just made last but not least we're gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then we're once again gonna mix everything together with our spatula until combined now at this point we're gonna start adding the dry ingredients for our fudgy double chocolate chip keto cookies and the base of today's low-carb cookie recipe is almond flour so that's the first thing we're gonna add to the bowl having said that we'll want to use 2/3 of a cup or 74 grams of almond flour for the cookies next we have to sweeten up our kedo cookie and to do this we're gonna be using my favorite keto sweetener which is confectioner swerve the reason I love this stuff so much is because it has zero net carbs and also zero calories so it's perfect for keto and as you're seeing here for today's low-carb double chocolate chip cookies we're going to be using a heaping third of a cup or 60 grams of it so now we're gonna add some more chocolate to these keto cookies and I've been really digging the special dark cocoa from Hershey's lately each serving only has one net carbs so you can use this stuff in a ton of different keto recipes but it truly gives these low-carb cookies in particular some super rich and decadent chocolate flavor anyways for our cookies today we'll want to add three and a half tablespoons or about 18 grams that stuff to our bowl we're also gonna add a half teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt and about 3/4 of a tablespoon or 14 grams of those keto chocolate chips from earlier now at this point we're all set to get our spatula back out and mix the almond flour and the rest the dry ingredients into our wet ingredients eventually a thick fudgy chocolaty ball of cookie dough will form like this that's we can get out our cookie scoop and start forming our keto cookies and just so you know my cookie scoop is about a tablespoon and this recipe will make 11 cookies using that size scoop so once you've added all the dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper we're gonna flatten our keto cookies with either a spoon or a spatula and then we're gonna top each one with two or three of those keto chocolate chips now we're all set to get these in the oven and we're gonna bake them for around eight to ten minutes the cookies will likely be very soft when they come out but don't worry about this because they will firm up and set as they cool down in the track once they do fully cool down check this out these double chocolate chip keto cookies are incredibly fudgy so soft and chewy and so delicious as always for more info on today's a low-carb keto cookies check the video description below and I hope you like them", "HuddALJH92s": "hey guys welcome back to the ku chronicles after three weeks five recipes time for the final episode so the question is after testing some of the Internet's most popular and most viral chocolate-chip cookie recipes which is my favorite um what did I learn now that's actually what public ated to answer because really I'm not sure that such thing as the best chocolate chip cookie recipe each of the recipes up maiding the suits have been delicious and I would make every single one of them again but each of them have things that I loved about them that I'm gonna see if I can take smush together and form is for me my perfect touch of cookie so for this recipe I love it it's kind of nostalgic feel its simplicity and of course it is the original trouble chip cookie so we're gonna stick with its drop cookie style so this cookie the pan bangin cookie I'm gonna keep the pan banging because I loved the texture it gives the edge of the cookie it can take a slightly chewy cookie and add this crisp edge which I love so this recipe I love its style and its simplicity by using melted butter it makes it incredibly easy so we're definitely keeping that with this recipe because it's a slice and bake cookie we're not going to take the dough but we are gonna take a big tip from it and that is the use of salted butter because it gets mixed into the dough it seems to flavor the dough a little bit better so we're gonna do that as well so this final recipe from Bon Appetit it also uses melted butter like Tara or Brady's recipe but it takes it one step further and Browns it and that is another level of flavor and something that I love so we're gonna do that as well so now we know what we're gonna borrow from the five previous recipes we need to think about how we're gonna put this recipe together so the ingredients for my perfect chocolate cookie are very classic very familiar ingredients there they are basing greens that we've used the last three weeks for all of our recipes but there are a couple differences firstly the butter is salted which we're gonna then brown and then we're also gonna add some egg yolks along with a whole eggs because I think those extra egg yolk can really add an extra level of fuzziness to the recipe so the first thing we need to do for this recipe is take our salted butter and brown it now I've already showed you how to do that earlier on in the series but I'm gonna give you a quick reminder add the butter to a pan place over medium heat until melted separate and then foam and then cook until the milk solids underneath that foam have browned so just a quick note on browning salted butter because it does behave differently from unsalted butter it'll go through the same process but when it gets to the foaming that foam will kind of hang around on the surface and you need to make sure that you mix this constantly because there's a chance that the salt will clump with the milk solids so you want to make sure it's distributed evenly also because the foam doesn't dissipate as easily you need to make sure that the browning is happening whilst the foam is still there so the easiest way to do that is by smell but also if you lift your silicon spatula out of the heat you'll be able to see the little bit to brown on there as well so once the butter is brown reed's pour that into a large bowl to stop it cooking immediately we're then gonna let it cool down for a couple of minutes at this point the recipe should feel very familiar because it uses the same basic method we've seen in Terra a French recipe from last week and the Bon Appetit recipe from Tuesday so all we're gonna do is whisk in our sugar mixing until it's roughly combined and then working one a time we're gonna add our eggs and our egg yolks followed by the vanilla at this point we're gonna switch to our spatula a dry-goods and mix those together to combine once our flour is mixed in we can talk about chocolate so throughout this series I've used even the katar wafers all the chocolate chips and I'm really stuff about which one to choose because I've loved all of the recipes using both of them so I'm not going to make a decision I'm gonna make versions with both styles but what I have done with each type of chocolate is I've taken a small amount of it and roughly chopped it and that's going to go into the dough with the whole pieces because it's gonna give us a nice uneven texture and that means we get different variations of chocolate throughout the recipe so we're going to add our chips to one half of the dough and just mix that to combine and the wafers to our second caution of dough obviously if you want to make just one batch just add one style of chocolate to the whole batch so now that cookie dough is nice and cold we can form them into cookies now we've had the fado in the fridge for about four hours so it's nice and cold it's firm but it's not rock solid it's still pliable so we're gonna do this pump until balls that are about 85 grams per cookie so you can use a scoop or you can do this by hand as well we're just gonna follow mr. cookies sprinkle them with a little bit of flaked sea salt and then they're gonna go in the oven he only needs to be preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and they're gonna go in there for about 18 to 20 minutes these are slightly bigger cookies and they take a little bit longer and we want to make sure that we get a nice crisp edge but don't worry we still have that beautiful soft chewy inside to get that pan banging effect once the cookies have been baking for about 10 minutes remove from the oven and give a firm rap on the work surface do this every two minutes until the cookies are golden brown [Music] so that is how you make my perfect chocolate chip cookie it's incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious you still got that beautiful fudgy middle it's got a nice hit of salt and it's got real nice crisp edges it's so so delicious and I'm so happy with this recipe I also wanted to say a big thank you for supporting this series is the first time I've done something kind of this long this big on the YouTube channel and you seem to have really liked it so thank you very much and if I did another version of this series but not cookie this time a different style of recipe what would you like me to try leave a comment down below I also want to say a big thank you to Qatar chocolate for partnered with me to produce this series the only question left is do I prefer the ones with wafers all the ones with chips or do I turn it into an Ice Cream Sandwich either way I'm off to eat more 200 cookies until next time I'll see you later", "5gx5jWbk2Ic": "nothing says comfort quite like warm chocolate chip and pistachio and ate cookies on my goodness and our next guest he's gonna take them to the next level welcome back to celebrity chef Aarti Sequeira hi guys this kitchen smells amazing you know I had a very high bar to jump over because my husband's favorite dessert of all time is a warm chocolate chip cookie to the point where he collated a list of the top ten in LA it's very controversial Wow there are some questions you don't want the answer to married I'm gonna keep it that way or another child so that you said I'll let chocolate chip cookie dog live yeah that will make it chocolate chip pistachio and dates yes well sometimes you know sometimes they just great the way they are would II think maybe yeah dig in Pedro when Cameron is our dad you know I grew up in the Middle East and so dates are you know it's like it is the fruit there and pistachios are not right so I was like this is gonna be like an oatmeal raisin cookie except it's gonna have dates pistachios and chocolate chips in it it's the same thing it's here's I truthfully I like dates better than raisins cuz raisins were to get a bad rap yeah dates are sweeter they're almost like gods candy that fudgy they're Dino's fudgy and I and you actually supposed to eat a lot of them because they have so much 5 of them and they have a very low glycemic index so this is healthy the dates yeah yeah so welcome party over here we have creamed together this is butter okay and two different kinds of sugar I've got white sugar and brown sugar the brown sugar gives it a little bit of chew not too much true but just a little bit go ahead and cream that together and then this is just flour baking soda and salt and then if you would add the spices for me okay what do we have here so that's ground cardamom and go there too that's fine all right nutmeg tail oh you wanted an EI really don't worry it really doesn't matter so then we whisk it together and what you're doing when you're creaming is you're incorporating air into that butter and then the sugar kind of backs it up okay so that gives you a nice light cookie so at home we're not gonna do it here but you want to cream it for five solid minutes oh come on walk away you know and then come back these feel light but they're actually like dense and gooey right middle right you don't want them to do both well cuz I creamed the heck out of it yeah we've got 2x okay go ahead and do that and then I'll add the vanilla so you cream it without the eggs for five minutes yes Wow alright cuz you want to give it as much chance to get the air in as possible okay then you're gonna add the flour okay and you want to do it in batches so that it has a chance to incorporate so you want to do two batches and then when that's all done we'll add here now do you fold in the dates and the chocolate ribbon beside you I don't like to do it in here I'd say I like to take this out and then fold it in altogether okay now I know you also like to chill your dough I jammed or what what's the purpose of that so I like to let those flavors really come together I mean you've got all those spices in there you've got the chocolate of sashes you want all those flavors to come together and also you've given it you know this dough a bit of a beat and we wanted to just relax okay that means you can make this the night before oh they're talking about a beating or do you have redefined the chocolate chip cookies well thank you this Meyers are you listening Brendan [Laughter] okay there we go once we fold these in shall I just go get the chill dough yeah you go get them and I will fold in cuz this is too much fun not to finish yeah so oh my goodness the do magic of culinary without even anything in there the nominal yeah so um then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use an ice cream scoop okay so I'll tell you another thing you can do with this dough which is it you can just knead the dough right there I use an ice cream scoop because it's a little easier to make perfect cookies and you want to leave a little room between each one because they are going to Express is you take some coffee ice cream and you take two warm cookies and you put the ice cream in between because in Dubai you have dark black coffee with a date that's right so did they do that in Greece yeah they well they have the black coffee too and they do dates or those too sometimes they do other sort of dried fruit yeah yeah and it's just the most exquisite thing it's still one of my favorite at four o'clock when you get you're off to you and coffee you have a date I'm not gonna ruin your dating life then how long do we pop those in the oven so 12 to 15 minutes at 350 okay and then what I like to do come on out sucker is I also like to put a little flaky sea salt on top oh and when we went looking for all the best cookies in LA because you know of course I had to I had to be part of it mm-hmm I was my cross to bear our favorite ones always had sea salt I mean I know they tell you not to eat the dough but I know and what I often do is I'll make those little balls with the ice cream scoop and then put them in the freezer and then when I want to cook them I'll just bake them straight is brittle bit longer but they're so small these seem like they'd be the perfect things to make around the holidays keep on a hand maybe give us gifts yeah that great yeah they would and especially because they have some of those Christmas Eves or a spice man you can even take it over the top could add a little bit of cinnamon I mean the cardamom really thought of them yeah cheers my friend if I can just finish Julia I can tell everybody to find this best bit of our home and family fall harvest cookbook also available at Hallmark Channel calm check it out everybody's so delicious Artie you're amazing thank you so much for being my favorite cookie", "6c-oQmPZ6bU": "Hey you guys! It's Adriana Harlan and today we're going to be baking some \ndelicious flourless chocolate chip cookies with only 6 healthy ingredients  and lots of chocolate. This recipe is quick and easy to make but best of all the cookies are chewy, \nsoft and moist inside. Not only are these cookies delicious they are healthier than most other flourless cookies and if you like a good cookies like I do\nyou\u2019re going really enjoy these. They\u2019re gluten free, dairy free and Paleo-friendly  and I even give you substitutions to make them \nVegan and Keto-friendly Check out the blog post on my website \nfor all the additional details, the link is in the description of this video. We're going to start with ingredients \nthat you may already have in your pantry.  Using almonds and pecans we're going \nto make a creamy nut butter to replace flour and to make the cookies nice and \nchewy just like peanut butter cookies. So add both the almonds and \npecans to your food processor, or you can use a high speed blender, and let's process the nuts until \nthe consistency is liquified, creamy and pourable \n(this is very important). For this need to pause, scrape \nthe sides of the bowl a few times until it turns into a smooth nut butter \nand this may take a few minutes. Now this nut butter is a little warm from \nprocessing so we want to cool it down  to room temperature so when you add \nthe chocolate it doesn't melt  and there's no separation of the nut oils.\nAnd here's a good tip, I'm goign to put this in the fridge\nfor 10 minutes and give it  a quick stir within 5 minutes of chilling. While the nut butters chilling \nlets preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F  and mix the other ingredients in a bowl. Add an egg,  vanilla extract, the sweetener, I'm using raw honey and a pinch of salt. Give it a good whisk. And lets mix in the nut butter. See how creamy and pourable my nut butter is? This is the texture you are looking for. With my spatula I'm going to mix \njust until the dough comes together and thickens. We don't \nwant to over mix it so there's no separation of the nut oils. Now my favorite part, lets add the chocolate chips. Actually my favorite part is eating the cookies \nbut OK let's mix the chocolate into the dough gently.  Now here's a tip I want to give you. \nThe best chocolate to use in this recipe  are these mini chocolate chips. \nThis is because the chocolate is so small, they get evenly destributed throughout the entire cookie \nand every bite is super chocolaty. I'm going to line a baking sheet \nwith parchment paper and using  my cookie scoop, I'm gonna scoop \nabout 1.5 tablespoon of dough for each cookie.  You guys are going to love these flourless cookies. They store well in your pantry so you \ncan enjoy them for dessert the whole week.  Now let's flatten the tops slightly with our fingers,  and since we are all chocolate lovers here \nlet's sprinkle with some more chips  to make them look beautiful. Ready for the oven!  Bake them for just 10 minutes or until the edges \nand bottom start to turn brown.   We don't want to over bake them so \nthey nice and chewy. Place them on a wire rack to cool. And you know \nhow I love a warm cookie, fresh out of the oven?   Well these cookies I actually like better after \nthey cool or even when they\u2019re frozen.  At room temperature they have a soft texture \nwith melted chocolate inside it\u2019s so good, and when frozen they\u2019re still \nchewy but nice and cold. Now a lot of you may have questions about \nmaking the dough in advance, substituting the nuts  for something else, using maybe store-bought \nnut butter or even making them Vegan without eggs,  and I have a lot of these answers for you \non my website LivingHealthyWithChocolate.com.  Be sure to check out the blog post for more \ninformation and to print the recipe. There\u2019s nothing better than freshly baked \nchocolate chip cookies  oozing with melted chocolate and \nthese flourless chocolate chip cookies are amazing Look at this texture inside, \nI think you\u2019re going to really like these. I hope you get a chance to make them soon \nand after you do I want to hear hear from you. So please leave your comments below \nletting me know how it goes. And tell me also, what kind of cookies are your favorite? I wanna maybe come up with a \nhealthier version and share it here. Thank you so much for watching.

of baker's chocolate she improvised by breaking a semi-sweet chocolate bar into small pieces instead of melting the chocolate merely softened dotting the cookie with chocolate chips they look homemade and they taste homemade but this ho is a factory each ingredient goes into an industrial-sized mixer starting with white sugar then brown sugar then butter [Music] the mixer thoroughly blends these first ingredients until the butter becomes soft and creamy and the sugars are evenly dispersed then it's time for the headliner chocolate chips they're semi-sweet which is a mixture of bitter and sweet chocolate next flour followed by baking soda to make the dough rise and salt to add flavor the final ingredients are whole eggs beaten combined with vanilla made from beans harvested in Madagascar Africa mixing resumes until everything is well blended which usually takes about five minutes the company closely guards recipe specifics but if you're curious you could probably figure them out by multiplying the ingredients of a home recipe to the yield of a production batch workers transfer the cookie dough to a machine called the former it pushes the dough through round eyes producing row upon row of round pieces weighing 1.4 ounces each one of several sizes the factory produces the factory then flash freezes the dough rounds for sale to foodservice customers such as restaurants and hotels which bake the cookies in their own kitchens the freeze tunnel uses liquid nitrogen to create the frigid temperature the passing dough rounds solidify in approximately 5 minutes exiting the freeze tunnel the dough rounds pass under a metal detector to ensure they don't contain any metal particles this safety measure is standard practice in the food industry the packaging system is entirely automated the first station erect the box the second station lines it with plastic a conveyor belt meanwhile feeds the frozen unbaked cookies onto automated scales once the scale hits the per box weight feeding pauses the bottom swings open and the cookies drop into the box awaiting directly underneath the next stations seal and label the boxes which workers then load onto pallets the pallets go into a storage freezer where they stay until it's time to ship them out by freezer truck to the customer this company also sells gift tens of cookies online and by catalog for that market they bake the cookies in-house workers lay out the dough rounds two inches apart on trays lined with parchment paper this prevents sticking making it easy to remove the bake cookies without breaking them the dough rounds are nearly one and a half inches wide by one inch high as they bake they flatten out and double in diameter the trays remain in the oven for seven minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit a turntable inside rotates them so that the cookies bake evenly throughout the tray a few cookies per batch go to the quality control tester who unfortunately doesn't get to conduct the assessment by eating the samples rather the tester measures the diameter and height to ensure consistency in size and chip content in the online and catalog order assembly area workers line the bottom part of the gift tin with the decorative cellophane bag then they carefully layer the correct number of fresh cookies inside in a staggered configuration this not only creates a nice presentation it also prevents damage in transit they close the bag with a gold twist tie to seal in the freshness close up the tin then pack it for shipping this is how to give a gift of homemade chocolate chip cookies without ever setting foot in the kitchen", "ePpfcpPoEws": "[Music] hi I'm Jana and today I'm fielded foodie we're gonna make banana chocolate chip cookies and I've got my little helper here Adam so last year at Christmas Adams class had a cookie exchange party and all the parents had to bring in their favorite cookie recipes and a lot of mine on my blog were like super healthy there wasn't and he liked butter and down there like you know date cookies and coconut oil cookies and things like that so um I went to my friends site who has a lot of kid-friendly recipes for cookies and I got this banana chocolate chip cookies recipe from little Luna and so Adam helped me make it for the first time and we loved it so much we ended up adding it to the blog so he's gonna be making today so the first step is um because its uses banana now we're gonna go ahead and wash up a banana so why don't you go ahead and do that Adam we can do it at this goal and while he's doing that I'm going to preheat the oven at 350 I'm gonna hold a bowl for you while you mush first we're gonna go ahead and cream the sugar we're gonna add half a cup of granulated sugar with a third of a cup of room temperature butter so go ahead and let me let me lift this up alright go ahead and add it perfect and let's add the 1/3 cup of butter just drop it in there there we go now let's put this down I'm gonna lock it and we're gonna slowly it'll take two minutes to cream the sugar after about two minutes we're gonna go ahead and add the egg in while the mixture is still running Adam can you add that in nice and carefully okay when the oven is preheated all of it very good and then we want to measure 1/2 a cup of the banana so it's usually about one whole banana but you're just kind of measure it just to be on the safe side that was one large banana we had [Applause] okay Adam can you put the banana in there now you can keep it running at the banana and very good with the thought we'll put that in here and then we're also going to add half a teaspoon of vanilla extract so to make it like oh yes then there wonderful while the mixtures going we're going to mix the dry ingredients we have in here 1 and 1/4 cup of flour and we're going to add a teaspoon of baking powder in here yeah half a teaspoon of salt and 1/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda now while that's going Adam we're gonna slowly put in the flour don't you slowly put it in there little by little now you can turn it off and here's the fun part we're gonna add the chocolate chips we're gonna fold them in yes ok so now everything is well mixed we're gonna go ahead and do Adams favorite part we're gonna add the chocolate chips you can toss the whole thing in there Adam yay that's gonna be a lot of job yes it's about a cup of chocolate chips in there yes and now we can remove the bowl and Adams gonna stir it all up together give it one good stir so every bite of the cookies gets a nice big chunk of chocolate chips No yeah but first we have to make them into tiny little cookie dough balls right I thought after we bake it and now we're ready to UM scoop them onto the prepared baking sheet you can grease a baking sheet or you can just use some parchment paper ice cream scoop works pretty well so we'll just go in to plop them in here look at that add on well good right yeah all right and we're going to bake this at 350 I know we'll do another one we're going to bake this at 350 for about 10 to 12 maybe 14 minutes depending on your oven my favorite part is the chocolate chips in this recipe so I like that extra on top oh let's do that that way we can see them right plop them in with this alright these just came out of the oven and they've been cooling for about 5 minutes so I think we're ready did again I didn't want to do a taste test yeah which one do you want okay awesome that one or the big one you made them nice and wide how does it taste me taste one oh they're so delicious and look at the inside very chocolatey very soft and moist and it is so good you can also taste the banana they're good but they're a little bit stuff they're a little bit soft exactly so actually the fact that we use bananas in here means that we have to use we get to use less butter and less eggs and then also it just gives it a nice cake like texture so they're super soft and they actually stay moist even for a few days you like it Adam your shirt is enjoying it too should they try Adam yeah yeah you really like it I hope you guys try this thank you so much and if you really like this cookie

thank you thanks Adam", "fBaT3qKmZcw": "[Music] hey guys it's checking pressure luck and today I'm going to do another recipe that has nothing to do with the instant pot you know stop isolating and quarantine and all that stuff makes me want to explore a little bit more of my traditional cooking styles you know what I mean before the instant pot came into play as much as I love it I want to try making a few other things outside of it and guys today we're gonna make something you just can't make it an instant pot I'm talking something that's gonna make a certain Sesame Street characters eyes go googly googly googly because c is for cooker and that's good enough for me guys we are going to make the most amazing crispy / baked chocolate chip cookies you've ever had in your entire life just one bite of these babies is gonna make you lose your mind and it's so simple to make and is ridiculously delicious and it's gonna be a huge hit in the matter where you go whether you bring it to a party where you save all home for yourself plus it makes a ton of cookies so let's go right to the stand mixer or hand mixer and then into the oven because you're about to have the greatest chocolate-chip cookies in the world so the first thing I want to use is a stand mixer if you have one if you don't definitely a mixing bowl and a hand mixer but if you have a KitchenAid or something of this nature it's gonna be your best friend for making a cookie dough the first thing I want to add to the bowl is two sticks or a half a pound of salted butter some recipes call for unsalted butter for cookies I like to use salted you can use on-site that if you want but I feel like this gives it more flavor and by the way the butter has to be softened but if you don't feel like leaving it out for about two hours from the fridge or overnight because it takes about two hours to get to that level you can easily zap it in the microwave for 10 seconds and then flip the butter over and then put it in for another 5 seconds total and it should be perfectly softened now that my stand mixer I want to add my paddle attachment here this is a nice little fancy paddle attachment because it has a nice rubber edge to scoop up anything that comes on the edges I like that and I also realized my syntax there was maybe a little inappropriate regardless um you know what I mean but if you have one of these pedal attachments that's fine too and I'm gonna lower my mixer lock it and then I want to cream my butter and I'm gonna put this on about a number two speed to do that and then I'm gonna off into a four and after about 10 to 15 seconds of mixing I'm gonna turn it off and voila we have a nice creamed softened butter a rubber spatula is gonna be your best friend here too cuz we want to make sure that we get the butter off of the mixer here the paddle attachment and we want to just put it in the bowl as best we can there we go great moving on now it's time to add in our sugars I want to add in 3/4 of a cup of a white granulated sugar 3/4 of a cup of a tightly packed light brown sugar I would prefer using light over dark brown sugar for this 1 teaspoon of regular iodized salt and yes I know I use salted butter but still I add it in as well 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and my secret ingredient for these cookies one tablespoon of maple syrup the real stuff guys if you can get your hands on it it's lower mixer back in and now let's put it on a low to a two speed and then just mix everything up in there alright and we're gonna let that mix for about 20 seconds and now we're going to add in 2 large eggs I'm just gonna crack them in and add it right inside the bowl one at a time and let that mix together for about another 20 seconds and again this is on a two speed and I'm doing this alright and I'm gonna stop it well lift up my mixer here and then again use a spatula to make sure any of the stuff that's on the paddle is inside of my ball and get the sides as well and scrape them down even though I have my fancy paddle attachment with the side scraper it's better to just double check and make sure you get everything inside the bowl again alright and anything that's on the spatula just rub it back onto the paddle so it goes back in the bowl eventually now what we are going to lower our mix are back in lock it and then we're going to turn it on to the lowest speed it can possibly go okay that's just the star speed and now I'm going to add in two and a quarters of a cup of an all-purpose flour you do not need to sift it and all make it nice and easy and I want to add in about half of that amount first on low speed always keep it on lowest speed guys because flour will go all over the place that this thing is beating on high so add about half of this in there once it begins to incorporate you can up the speed to it too and then we're going to bring it back down to a low speed again and then add in the rest of my flour this is on just simply the stirrer speed it's the lowest possible starring spit setting that you can go and once the flour begins to get nice and incorporated into the dough we can go on a two-speed for about another 10 seconds all right now let's turn that off and lift up my paddle one more time and you're gonna see we're getting super doughy here unless again take our spatula press our dough back inside of the bowl and then get the sides scrape it down from anything that might have been stuck there some flour that didn't get mixed in yet okay and now I'm going to add in some baking soda I'm going to add one teaspoon of baking soda and a little tip that I learned is to add in one teaspoon of hot water to the baking soda and mix that up into a little bit of a slurry in here and then we add that right back into our batter /tao get that in there and give it a final mix on our number two setting and we do that for about another ten seconds and then we can turn off our mixer lift the little head up there one more time get all the dough inside of the bowl it can remove our paddle attachment now and now I want to add in between 12 to 16 ounces of your favorite type of chocolate chip if you want them super chippy go for 16 ounces and you can use any kind you'd like I'm using semi-sweet because I think that's the classic for a chocolate chip cookie but you can use milk chocolate you can use white chocolate you can use toffee chips you can use peanut butter chips any kind you want and I'm not adding these because I can't stand walnuts on my chocolate chip cookies however if that's your thing by all means feel free to add in some chopped walnuts about a cup worth if you want about a half a cup to a cup worth and now I'm just going to not use my stand mixer but this is my spatula to mix all of my chocolate chips into the cookie dough really get in there and mix it up so all of that dough gets tons of chocolate chips mixed they go out and this is the exercise portion of this recipe you should feel good afterwards you're gonna reward yourself for all this hard work and perfect now what we want to do because this is really critical is we want to make sure that our dough is nice and chilled so we want to pop this in the refrigerator between one and two hours before we begin to bake that is really key guys for the perfect evenly baked chocolate chip cookies definitely a pop the dough into the fridge an hour or two prior to baking we're about to bake let's preheat our oven to 375 degrees and now it's time to take our dough out of the fridge and that's been in there for about an hour and a half and it's gonna be nice and chilled alright now let's get a baking sheet there we go a nice big 21 by 15 baking sheet I have this is perfect in my opinion however if you have smaller baking sheets you can totally use those I want to line my baking sheet with parchment paper all right there we go and there's the shadow of my camera and now I want to take my dough and I want to take a tablespoon and then scoop it up in there so we get about a tablespoon worth of dough that's the exact amount you want and then just take it out of the tablespoon wet your hands with cold water and then take the dough and then squish it in your hand kind of like in your palm like this until it's about 1/2 of an inch thick just like this you see that perfect now what I want to do is I want to lay it on the parchment paper just like that and guys from all this cookie dough we're gonna make about 40 to 50 amazing amazing cookies so you're getting so much your money's worth out of this one and we'll just repeat the process for all more dough but what hands everything in the situation you want to lay your half-inch flattens cookie dough about two inches apart from each other okay and there we go we're gonna just keep repeating this until we can fill up our tray and the key to really doing this properly is to make sure that your hands are wet with cold water constantly don't dry your hands and by the way another note on parchment paper I can't recommend it enough over anything else it doesn't stick to it at all you don't need to grease it it is perfect use parchment paper all right and here we go I got thirty cookies on this gigantic twenty-one by fifteen baking sheet now I still have remaining cookie dough left and I'm gonna be able to make more cookies after this in a second batch but I'm gonna pop this back in the fridge too it keeps cool in the meantime all right let's pop these babies in the oven now I want to adjust my oven rack so it's second from the top not in the middle just one above it and then place my baking tray in the oven so it's just like that and shut the door by the way the reason why I don't have my knobs on is because I typically have a cover over my solvent I don't want to you know accidentally bump into it and turn on myself very responsible and I want to bake these cookies guys from between 12 to 14 minutes keep an eye on it as all ovens vary we want it to be a beautiful golden brown not too too dark but just the right color and in that halfway through my cook time after about six to seven minutes I'm gonna open up my oven and to evenly cook my cookies already looking beautiful I want to turn my tray around here to give it a 180 not the easiest thing to do with one hand doing that and the other holding the camera I'm a little bit low-budget sometimes and now well let it continue to bake for another six to eight minutes or so we want to go for about twelve to fourteen minutes until it's a nice golden brown and now at 12 minutes have passed and oh boy guys look at how beautiful these cookies are the perfect golden brown color which is exactly what I was looking for all right I'm gonna take these out of the oven alright guys and here are my beautiful cookies make sure you get a wire rack at first when I first started making cookies I'm like I don't need a wire rack whenever I said you needed one I'm like you forget I'll just put them on a plate believe me they make a huge difference and they're super affordable and they makes them cool down to the perfect perfect cookie consistency so make sure we transfer all of our cookies to this wire rack and look at the bottom of my cookie you guys look at how perfectly brown that is it's not burnt it's perfect the color nice crispy bottom and a nice soft top and by the way if any of your cookies have kind of fuse together because they went into each other space and stuff even though they should totally be social distancing right now just use a spatula and you can just break them apart like that very simple but make sure you do it now sooner than later because this is when it's easy to separate them this is they cool they're gonna become a little bit crispy which is exactly how we want these cookies to be and as our cookies are cooling on the wire rack it's okay if they're touching near each other at this point it's fine and there we go all of 30 of my cookies from the first batch all done looking absolutely perfect and we're gonna let these cool for 30 minutes on here in the meantime I'm going to realign my baking tray with fresh parchment paper and then take my chilled it out from the fridge and make more cookies bake the second batch on the tray and here is the rest of my cookies from my other batch and there we go 43 cookies look at that I set it to be between 40 and 50 and we got 43 a nice odd number guys I cannot wait to try these I'm just going to make sure they're all cooled down these have gone for about 15 minutes and these will go for 30 so we're going to try them out and they're gonna be perfect I'm so excited and I know the waiting for them to cool is the hard part but believe me wait it's well worth it and the whole place smells amazing right now all good things come to those who wait all right guys or our cookies are all done and I have a helper of course who wants to help eat the cookies what's on your finger I would think oh okay yeah it's blue okay well alright ink what and let's try out our cookies here mm-hmm oh I go for crispy outside and chewy inside our first problem they're both white sighs mm-hmm I love having a crispy outside and a slightly chewy inside but the more they set the crispier they're gonna become in general and that's how I like them honestly I like them like it's kinda like those Tate's cookies dira have low stakes Hampton cookies like that but in my opinion the better the homemade no my secret is to these cookies one put some maple syrup in them mm mm it's a nice punch yeah do you like that yeah are you doing the cane syrup rehearsal around the edges use milk chocolate chips or some misery semi sweets but you can use milk chocolate chips yeah and you can do anything with these cookies guys if you want what macadamia nuts put them in if you want almonds even though I don't know if it's Amundson cookies but a Walmart what no not for me I don't want those in there alright next I'm next I like to do half a batch and you could have walnuts in your really any tree nuts pistachios from trees nothing like those do you hear the crispy I'm gonna have dinner so alright get out of here before you know my cookies knuckle so I have a real Cookie Monster over here hey guys look at how many cookies this makes again I got 43 out of that battery so it's a lot guys a little tip for you by the way if you have a couple of cookies make it shift which with it get some vanilla ice cream if you like haagen-dazs vanilla flavored is a really good universally available choice scoop some of the ice cream out put it on one of the cookies the bottoms of one of the other cookies how much ice cream you wish to add is up to you entirely take the other cookie and sandwich it on top and you have a chip which if you have sprinkles or jimmies or whatever they call wherever you live you can roll it in there and you can have jimmies on the edges or crushed Oreo cookies anything you want but we made a Chipwich let's try it OOP my ice cream is softened look sure ice cream is firm that's a real real good since I have a good trip which guys if you enjoy these videos check out pressure law

chocolate chip cookie right enjoy Oh [Music]", "h1-XHTPUaTE": "calling all Cookie Monster's guys I am not joking today I have the recipe for you it's a skillet chocolate-chip cookie gonna show you I'm baking it in this skillet cast-iron skillet cookie mmm chocolate chip cookie the best kind of cookie if you ask me my heart has a special place for chocolate chip and the great thing about it is you don't need any machinery nothing complicated I'm making it all in this bowl you are going to freak out and you make it so please if you don't make any other recipes make this recipe so so delicious I'm starting off with 6 tablespoons of unsalted butter soft room-temperature okay a third of a cup of packed dark brown sugar and half a cup of granulated sugar and then you just cream everything together by hand if your butter isn't soft enough this will be a really challenging task I don't know if I ever told you that story about when I was young and I was learning how to bake and I guess I didn't have a mixer or my mom didn't want to give me the mixer and I was making chocolate chip cookies kind of like this and my butter was really hard and it didn't cream properly and it was really challenging as the butter flies all over the bowl and it's not soft enough I think they still tasted delicious but it was really hard take a tip from me and make sure your butter is nice and soft do as I say not as I did when I was 10 once everything is well combined it's not gonna get light and fluffy because remember there's brown sugar in there and that affects the fluffiness factor you can add your egg add 1 large egg I love baking by hand no machines to wash and then a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and then add your dry ingredients 1 cup of all-purpose flour scooped and leveled please it's particularly easy if you have one of these huge canisters like I have and then you just add your flour and your lemon or which is a half a teaspoon of baking soda and your salt 1/2 teaspoon of coarse salt your cookie is almost done all that's left is to add one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips it's done well it's not done I mean it's done for me I'm just gonna sit here and eat this raw batter no I'm not I'm gonna bake it at 350 degrees for 16 to 18 minutes and then I'm gonna eat it warm now you're really ready to bake I have a 10-inch cast-iron skillet then I'm gonna bake it in you don't need to butter your skillet or anything like that because there's plenty of butter in here and a properly seasoned cast-iron skillet it's virtually nonstick and you serve it right out it's skillet spread it pretty evenly in your pan don't worry too much about it though it will sort of sink down and spread out as it's baking this is kind of a smallish on the smallish side of 10 inches cuz it's 10 inches at the top and a little less at the bottom so if you had something like a 9 I bet that would work just as well bake the cookie at 350 degrees until golden brown and set in the center in 20 minutes 18 to 20 minutes later you have this which is so fantastic you really should wait five minutes to eat it but the great thing about it is serve it warm and maybe with a glass of milk Oh oh my gosh when we were developing this we made it like I don't even know how many times and I'm sure we only really needed to make it like once or twice and we just kept making it and make and tweaking it you can put walnuts in it if you want or pecans that would be a really nice addition if you like nuts in your cookie but this is an eat your cookie with a fork kind of cookie try to keep your portion small but I think you'll be hard-pressed to do that because it's so delicious you're gonna gobble up the whole thing before you even know it I'm just gonna gobble up one tiny little bit learn so but it's the way to go don't forget the milk I was like the perfect cookie in every way the milk really enhances flavor hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you

okay this video has been highly requested by all of you and today is the day that finally Israel is going to show us how he makes his famous vegan chocolate chip cookie a picture of who and it gets over a hundred thousand life these chocolate chip cookies the vegan chocolate chip cookies that Israel brought me in bed that I worked hard to master honestly when I hear vegan cookie I think really I am a cookie lover my stop your city snob come as you are if you're a cookie I'm gonna give you a shot but because she is vegan and because I'm trying to adapt more to that than guy is for a few weeks no he's he's thinking when I'm not actually very impressed so I thought I'd really really drill down and get this recipe right I think really they are incredible he originally found the recipe on a random website and we've made some adjustments we're gonna show you a little video of the first time we made this attempt and [Music] we put their time that matter I can't figure out what I think I'm getting like I'm tasting what grass smells like are you concerned yeah this looks a little weird okay guys we almost made it cookie pie but we're gonna zest in here one two three what so you have figured this out yep I think I may not hope no you guys they are so they're really so good since I've been the judge of your vegan cookies and I say that they are absolutely incredible we have two new little judges yes my niece's are here Jett and Beau and we're gonna see if they notice she's a little chocolate chip cookies and the first thing you are going to need is word culture vegan but we found mio Coase we were definitely calling it mikonos for the last two weeks for criteria [Music] it is half a cup of coconut sugar coconut sugar and Bob's Red Mill is the best stuff we've got real pure cane sugar no flow did we mention that this is also free recipe fun fact people so what else baby baking soda I got baking soda I got baking soda by Bob's right now can we discuss the fact that a lot of our ingredients are by Bob's Red Mill Ultraman I had actually never heard of Bob's Red Mill before attempting this so shout out to the balls Red Mill this is not sponsored but hey what if Bob and Miyoko are like married [Music] some recipes call for cashew milk almond number we like old milk so vanilla with oak vanilla extract boom I already had that in my kitchen we're gonna add some sea salt just a little bit of sea salt Oh cuz technically these are sea salt vegan cookies yeah okay but this salt does not supply iodide unnecessary nutrients it's enough good enough and then we're just doing some chocolate chips it's very important that they get that they know that these are being free from gluten wheat peanuts tree nuts dairy soy eggs sesame sulfite snoop and mustard fish shellfish crustaceans it's free of all of that well when we're gonna combine our flour just we're using all-purpose flour and coconut flour Bob's coming through again baby are you okay yes sorry I am wait do you know anything not really you're gonna need two mixing bowls you're gonna need a large one and you're going to need a smaller vulnerable he's got a smaller small inch I'm gonna do one of our cups all-purpose okay that's it that's a cup of coconut flour okay this is how it really goes in real life people maybe start too much okay it smells so good well then we're using coconut sugar as well so the combination of those two because originally when we did this you guys he thought that the cookie batter smelled bad why do you think it's not bad smoke my grass but I think it was no it was in his mind he's like oh it's plant base so ya know it had a grassy I see no aftertaste let's kind of maybe not all of it okay that's cool let's go no no it's good guys we're gonna add a half a teaspoon of baking soda that's it happens almost kind of strange yeah go for it much of the salt in it just a quarter teaspoon of salt so not much was it a half a quarter of a teaspoon actually yes mix it mix in how do you do all that mixin did anybody have an easy bake oven growing up I just want you to know that the way my family's poverty was set up is why I don't know how to bake so guys we've moved on to our wet so we probably should let you know that hold on oh okay and now in your wet mold in your wet way you are going to put what we're gonna do our vegan butter first of course we always put a little bit more of the vegan butter than the actual recipe called for because I just thought that in my spirit no no no we didn't put a little bit more mm-hmm okay there we go now that's gonna get woman this vegan butter is kind of amazing it smells like cream cheese it really does have a cup of coconut sugar half a cup of coconut sugar I don't have my glasses on so I'm like squinting guys fun fact I prefer a stroll without his glasses I feel like he has beautiful eyes and he should show them all baby it's so sweet you well what how much of that public oh you know you're doing baking soda [Music] you need to remember that part I said about my glasses I swear you guys he does this on his own downstairs and Bobby too there's been many mishaps really that I just don't know about yeah don't think the one we brought up and you posted was the first try ever just mom were there's like bad batches that I don't know about yeah just inedible stuff in edible okay that's good yeah how much are you doing half a cup okay that's our coconut sugar it's going in coconut it's not baking soda boom I caught a cup of the pure cane go for it I'm so confused how are these our wet ingredients hey the wet was the butter basically I'm gonna add this it's pure cane syrup but it gives it a molasses vibe nice and that is to taste we're gonna go with vanilla now wait where's the good school it's

"DKQ1RYpdbNE": "welcome to high falutin low carb the random web series where we find and test the best low carb recipes this crazy Internet has to offer today we're tackling cookies specifically low carb chocolate chip cookies stay tuned alright folks low carb chocolate chip cookies can it be done well if you're like me you've probably made several recipes from online and other cookbooks and they all seem to be variations of the exact same recipe they take a traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe they take out the wheat flour and put in almond flour or coconut flour or some combination of the two they take out the sugar or brown sugar and substitute an alternative sweetener sort of like erythritol or xylitol if I want some sugar-free chocolate chips and you wind up with a shortbread with some chocolate chips thrown in it you know it's crumbly it doesn't have that chewy bendy texture and crispy edges that I love about a chocolate chip cookie that's what it's missing if I wanted a shortbread cookie I make a shortbread cookie there's plenty of recipes for those so I have chosen two recipes today that promise me that they are going to deliver on the chewiness and the crispness that we're looking for now the first of those they were they're actually both of these are recipe developers we have we have made before on this channel the first of those is Nam Nam Kham gnom G and om comm our recipe is Kido chocolate chip cookies 1.5 grams net carb and she's got two special ingredients that are supposed to deliver on that to factor in that crunch factor and I haven't made these we're gonna find out together and the second recipe is by keto connect dotnet our good friends over there Matt and make up and their recipe is almond flour chocolate chip cookies chewy so they have a special secret ingredient in their recipe as well so these two we're gonna try out here together and see if they deliver on the chewy crispy chocolate chip cookie now before we begin I need to give a

sponsoring this video I appreciate it all right so let's get started on our first recipe and this is keto chocolate chip cookies by nomnom calm and if you've been on this channel any length of time you know that I don't give exact measurements these are not my recipes I didn't create these these are somebody else's hard work we're just testing them so I'm gonna send you down to the video description below there'll be links to all of these I am here on the screen below where you can find exact measurements for all of these recipes so please go check out these channels and their websites to get these exact recipes if you've been here you know that so all right we're gonna sift this right you know me and the sifter so we already have coconut flour and almond flour in our sifter and you know I was going to mention some prices from thrive market the almond flour I was able to find here I used Bob's Red Mill that's the brand I prefer it was 1329 on Amazon when I looked it was 11 I'm gonna put some screenshots it was 11 19 at my grocery store my local grocery store and thrive market had it for $8.99 so you can see there's quite a price difference there but don't get onto me if the prices aren't exactly as I'm saying here prices are volatile this is the price when I've shopped in September 2019 when you're going to view this so if things are different in price you know that that's understandable so we're gonna sift this this is our oops this is our almond flour and our coconut flour to this we are going to add some arrowroot powder that's one of the ingredients that's gonna she says bring us this crispy and chewy Niseko from this and also this is going to be xanthan gum another one of those secret ingredients baking soda and kosher salt right so let's just sift all of this together and get these lumps and bumps out of there see that you do not want that in your recipe get those out push them through and we're gonna set this these dry ingredients to the side if I don't make them too much of a mess too late get in there all right give this a quick whisk and make sure that's combined we're gonna set that aside now we're going to turn our attention to the butter and we've got room-temperature butter here and our mixer and we're just gonna cream this for about eight minutes I believe she said okay we're gonna cream this for one to two minutes just the butter and then we're going to add our sweetener which is the low canto I have not tried low canto before the low canto brand gold and sweetener this is another thing that I got from thrive market I was gonna buy this online on Amazon the low canto was 1395 on Amazon on thrive market 879 it's a pretty good price so we'll add this to our butter after two minutes and then we're gonna let this thing cream for ten minutes total that's the secret to her recipe you've got to get this butter light and fluffy so I'll meet you back here in about 10 minutes [Music] all right that's been two minutes we're gonna add in our sweetener now this is the low kanto golden if you want to know how much check out a recipe down below and we're gonna let this go for eight minutes and we're gonna keep you know knock it down with with a spatula every few minutes so just so you it all gets incorporated okay [Applause] [Music] all right so this has gone for ten minutes total two minutes with just the butter by itself and then eight minutes with the sweetener and boy it has really grown it's huge now to this we're going to add a teaspoon of vanilla oh I didn't open it come on now yeah Oh Lord that's plastic Lantana metal one okay we need a teaspoon of vanilla and an egg crack it in a cup first save yourself some heartache guys add our egg and let this run for just a minute or two until it's combined and then we're going to slowly add in our dry ingredients while the mixer is on low so let this skip get moving and now while this is on low we're gonna add half of our dry ingredients let it mix and then add the other half so carefully don't throw this all over your kitchen [Music] now we're gonna fold in our chocolate chips and she called for pecans pecans is what I would say but she calls for pecans I do not like nuts in my chocolate chip cookie I just don't so I'm just not gonna have that so here's our Lily's chocolate chips and you know we were talking about prices I also ordered this from thrive market and Lilly's my local store does carry Lilly's I'll put a screenshot up here when I went to the store they were 7:49 thrive market was $5.99 per pack and I now you know if you know me I live in Florida and it's the middle of summer I mean it was a hundred and ten degrees that I ordered these so I was like oh I'm gonna get a bag of chocolate ganache when it arrives no it was I eco-friendly packaging but came in like a cold pack inside the box with the other stuff that's another thing about thrive all of their packages the whole company is carbon neutral from the packaging to the national shipping and that even their certified even counting their employees commute into work every day completely carbon neutral so you know they're it's something you can have to feel good about so fold in your chocolate chips and your pecans or whatever kind of nut you may be using and from here this goes in the fridge and that's another one of her secrets to making this kind of chewy and that crispy edge is you've got to chill this for an hour and I know that's a pain in the butt because you're like I want to eat my cookies well you don't have to simmer down for a minute so scrape the bowl down get this into a nice little compact ball all right so we're gonna cover this in plastic wrap and in the fridge this goes for exactly one hour and we will be back here in just a minute and we're gonna start on recipe number two it does not require refrigeration so I'll meet you back here in just a minute all right so now let's start on our second recipe and this is the recipe from keto connect dotnet and it's for almond flour chocolate chip cookies chewy now again all the recipes are down below in the video description as well as on the screen right here so we're gonna begin this one much like our other one but it's a lot less fussy I guess you could say we're going to start with almond flour and again sift almond flour as you know I keep like I've said before I keep mine in the UM I keep mine in the fridge if a freezer because you know nut flours have fat in them and they can kind of get rancid unless you bake regularly with them so I keep mine in the freezer so this also our sweetener I'm gonna use the same low cantos sweetener just to since you know it'll it'll avoid differences in the recipe so we can sort of be testing the way the sweetener works also a little bit of baking powder and here is their secret ingredient this is beef gelatin right so this is what they're saying makes this chewy like a chewy cookie and the beef gelatin you know we were talking about thrive market the beef gelatin I wanted to get the one that they recommended the Great Lakes gelatin it's pasture fed beef and grass-fed and pasture raised and it's a little pricey um you could they said you could also use just regular unflavored gelatin from the store but I'm specifically one of this because I'm gonna try to make some of those gummy bears gummy worms you know like um low-carb gummy worms anyway the Great Lakes gelatin on Amazon no story locally had it here for me was 2150 and thrive market had it for 1699 so there's some savings to be had there I got to tell you so let's just sift this out and we'll be right back look at that you would never get that out nightmare alright so we just sort of mix this together make sure that's incorporated well and set this aside and turn our attention to the wet ingredients and this is going to be melted butter they save some time here make sure you get it all out of there they save some time I guess you could say you know the other recipe she was adamant that that thing needed to be quit and you needed to aerate that butter for ten minutes she was not joking gonna add the egg and a little bit of vanilla all right it's good get the egg and the butter combined make sure your butter is cooled down a little bit you know don't don't do it fresh out of the microwave when it's melted because you can scramble that egg if you do and then in two batches we're gonna mix this dry ingredients all right now get off of there try not to sling it all over me get off of there from here we fold in our chocolate chips pull this together and again our Lily's chocolate chips I love the Lilly's brand they are good so now this recipe does not call for it to be chilled we're gonna go straight from here onto the pan and into a 350 degree oven so I'm trying not to work this too much but you do want to get your chips kind of combined so from here let's get our pan all right so we're gonna line our pan with parchment paper and nom-nom doctor I have I have some of the seal Pat's as in fact I spent a small fortune on seal Pat's and was gonna use those Nam Nam Kham specifically said do not use a Silpat because they will not spread and to get the chewiness and the crispy edges it's got to spread now keto connect didn't say that but they did specifically say to line the page with a blend of the pan with parchment paper and then I'm gonna take a portion scoop and we're gonna lay these down you get they asked to get 16 to 20 out of these all right so that's about as meetings well you don't wanna get into clothes in fact I may already having to close because they're gonna spread out a little bit so in these go into a 350-degree oven for how long should say 15 15 minutes or until golden brown and they got to cool for at least 20 minutes before we can try them so in there going and I'll meet you back here in about 20 minutes we still have a little bit to go before we put our chilled other recipe in the oven so I'll meet you back here in just a bit all right guys these are out of the oven and they look good they're a little thick little taller than I thought they might be but I didn't tamp them down I didn't flatten them at all because that didn't call for it in the recipe the UM the the Nam Nam Kham did so what I'm gonna do is these are gonna cool here they have to cool for at least 20 minutes they said shoo shoo shoo shoo shoo those are hot Atlee and i'm tearing this apart hold on they have to cool for at least 20 minutes now yeah go what's happening to me they have to cool for at least 20 minutes before we can eat them and test them but the second batch I have tempt them down lightly with my fingers we're gonna put these in the oven and these took about 18 minutes instead of 15 I bet these might take a little bit less because they're flatter we're gonna come back in just a minute it'll be time to scoop the chilled ones and put those in the oven okay okay guys so the the rest of the cookies are in the back like IDO connect they're cooling it specifically says that erythritol and sugar alcohol based baked goods the cookies they need to cool for a couple of hours before you taste them so we're gonna do that but we're ready now to scoop up our recipe from nom nom calm that has been chilling for an hour maybe an hour in ten minutes or so and we're gonna just scoop this out it should be how it's an interesting texture it almost feels like ice cream and we're gonna put these on a tray again you're gonna try to she said you can make twelve twelve giant cookies or eighteen regular-sized cookies and how long you cook them of course will obviously depend on what size you make them and she also said the flat out if you like a thinner crispy or cookie flatten them out somewhat and I did one with flattening and one without flattening on the keto connect we're gonna try but so I'm gonna flatten these lightly she said once you have the dough shaped for these you can freeze the dough and then bake them added a couple of minutes to baking time so you can just make a cookie or two so you're not left with eighteen cookies for Wesley to sit Nate which is a concern so we're just going to debe these up alright so these are gonna go in the oven for nine to eleven minutes she specifically said to turn the pan around 180 degrees halfway through so I'm gonna scoop the rest of these out I'm gonna flatten these down let's do that now I'm gonna flatten these down just slightly gonna um cook these and the next time you see me we'll be testing all these guys alright so in the oven these go I'll see you back here in five four three two one alright guys we're back it's been a couple of hours I had to go run some errands and truth be told get out of the house that had 36 chocolate chip cookies in it but we're back and both of these looks super good I'm excited to try these out one of them looks a little bit more like a traditional chocolate chip cookie perhaps than the other but we're gonna give them both a fair shake all right the first one here is by Nam Nam Kham these are the keto chocolate chip cookies and if you make eighteen cookies out of this recipe one cookie has 149 calories you got 13 grams of fat you got to a 2.2 grams of protein total carbs you got three grams you got fibers a gram and a half so that gives you 1.5 grams of net carbs per cookie now the second recipe here this is by keto connect net these are their almond flour chocolate chip cookies chewy these are the ones that have the beef gelatin in them if you make 16 cookies out of this recipe one cookie is 130 calories you've got 5 total carbs 3 point 3 grams of fiber 4 total of 1.7 grams of net carbs you've got three grams of protein and 12 and a half grams of fat so they look kind of different I gotta say I'm super excited just by the looks of it this looks more like the you know Nestle Toll House cookies that we you know all sort of know but we're gonna give them about a fair shake they've had time to cool and you can see this guy here it's kind of thin and here's the test it didn't really bend but it does feel kind of chewy it doesn't feel super cakey that's good it's crispy on the bottom there's there's definitely a you know it's kind of firm it's very delicate it doesn't hold together as well as a traditional chocolate-chip cookie but I have no problems with that I could eat that entire plate right now easily hold on I need some more okay yeah I got to tell you those those are great I haven't even tried the other ones yet I'm sure they're gonna be tasty too all that needs is a glass of milk and you just go hide in the corner you wouldn't see me for the rest of the day now these are the keto Connect net these are the chocolate chip keto cookies almond flour chocolate chip cookies chewy and their recipe did not say to flatten them down but I did flatten some of them these were just as they were made and and you know you can see that there can you focus on that not my big fat head they're kind of thick right there they're pillowy and thicker if you knock them down just tamp them down a little bit before you bake them you know they're more like a traditional cookie they did not spread as far as the nom nom cookies did to make them thinner but let's see what that tastes like I want to test one of these against the thinner one of those hmm there's also can you hear that they're good okay both of those are very good for my personal taste by a long shot it's the Nam Nam Kham cookies though I don't know how they had similar amounts of sweetener in both recipes and it's the same sweetener it's that low canto golden which is an erythritol based blend that's mixed with monk fruit far less of the erythritol taste for some reason in nom noms cookies and if you remember we whipped the devil out of that you know we creamed that butter and the sweetener for ten minutes and we pumped that thing was like three times larger with all that air perhaps that's somehow worked those crystals of the erythritol you know they set in there and ground up against butter for ten minutes and I got to say I feel like that must have dissolved the sugar somehow because these do not have the granulated grainy taste of the erythritol that I can definitely detect in these now I'm not saying that these are bad at all but if I were making these again this took of our chillin this took ten minutes of whipping and it had a couple of other fussy ingredients instead of gelatin we used arrowroot you can also use the konjac or cognac flour there's several things she gives you that you can use there and the xanthan gum so for this one I got to give it to Nam Nam Kham those are beautifully traditional chocolate chip cookies so there you have it folks low carb chocolate chip cookies apparently it can be done I want to give another big thank you to thrive market for sponsoring this video without sponsorships that's

kitchen at the house of a young my name is Suren herrera and i am here to share my love of texas food with all y'all so today I'm sharing how I make a texas-sized chocolate-chip cookie these cookies bake up nice and thick they're golden on the outside but they're soft and gooey on the inside we're going to load these cookies up with some chocolate chips plus some crushed up pecans and believe me when I say these cookies are deserving to be called texas-sized okay so let's get started I'm going to use my stand mixer for this but you could use a hand mixer as well the first thing I'm going to do is add my butter and this is half a cup of butter it's unsalted I always use unsalted when I bake that way I can control the amount of salt and it's been spitting out so it is at room temperature you know nice and soft you could press your finger in it and make a mess into my mixing bowl oh it's messy next up I'm going to add in the sugars so to help make these cookies thick and soft we're going to use mostly light brown sugar using light brown sugar give a thicker chewier cookie as opposed to using mostly white sugar so we're using 3/4 a cup of light brown sugar and I'm using 1/4 cup of white sugar and now we're going to cream this together we want this mixture to be light and airy [Music] okay so the butter and the sugars are creamed and now we're going to add in our next ingredients we're going to use one large egg okay and we're going to use a teaspoon of vanilla my original recipe called for a tablespoon vanilla I really like vanilla other people told me it was too much so I'm cutting back cutting back the vanilla and lean one teaspoon but you could add more absolutely if you would like okay I'm going to go ahead and mix this up okay so we got that all mixed in next up we're going to add in our dry ingredients two cups of all-purpose flour actually but over here okay half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of baking powder and the baking powder is another reason that our cookies are gonna become so thick it's because the baking powder we're not using a baking soda which would give us a crisper cookie so add that in and then we're just gonna mix it up again okay so the dough is mostly together at this point kind of crumbly you can see the texture it's not you know completely formed that's what we want we don't want to compress our dough we want to keep it light and airy and again that's going to help with the thickness of these cookies so now I'm going to add in my chocolate chips I am using how much I'm using a half a cup or 3/4 a cup how much using 3/4 of a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips those add it in and then I'm also using 1/4 cup actually it's a little more but about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans because Texas I can't walk outside without getting hit in the head by following pecans from the trees they're all over but if you can't get pecans you could always use a walnut or you can just not put nuts in oh I'm gonna add those in and then we're just going to take carefully gently just stir this into our dough a little bit and then I'm going to have to get in here with my hands okay again we want to be gentle with our cookie dough no we have to use our hands and this is going to help get all of the chocolate chips mixed in while still keeping our dough light and airy you can see the dough is coming together now [Music] now I told you that we were gonna do Texas ice cookies and I wasn't kidding with this amount of dough we are actually only going to make six cookies now I've had this recipe on my website for a while and I have a lot of people who make normal-sized cookies with this dough and they still turn it out thick and soft just how they're meant to be and I get it if you need to make a smaller cookie you know portion control or you know little kids or whatever you can make a smaller cookie but I'm just gonna go for it and we're gonna make them epic texas-sized chocolate chip cookies okay now I'm just gonna carefully grab I say carefully I mean just gently grab about a handful of the dough and I'm just gonna gently press it into a cookie size shape here okay kind of like a what soft like a baseball I don't know and then I'll put it on my my sheet pan okay so I'm just grabbing about a handful of dough and gently pressing it just for it to come together [Music] okay so we made a six large cookies with that dough that we made and now we do need to chill the cookie dough I know everybody just wants to dig in right away but we do need to chill the dough for thirty minutes because that's going to help the butter that we used it's gonna harden it up some more so that when we put our cookies in the oven they're going to hold their shape better so thirty minutes in the refrigerator during that time you can preheat the oven for 375 degrees so in the fridge we go my cookies have been chilling for 30 minutes the oven is preheated for 375 degrees Fahrenheit and we are gonna bake these for 18 minutes okay and now they are baked oh my gosh cute guys can you see how just big and thick these cookies still are I mean of course we use a handful of cookie dough to make them but they hold their shape just how you want them to while they bake they're not gonna melt down flatten out they are going to stay thick and just a hearty sized cookie these are my Texas size chocolate chip cookies and so they're just out of the oven they have to sit for at least 10 minutes before you dig into them because the inside is still gooey the chocolate is all melty in there and I don't want y'all to burn your mouth okay so let's give them ten minutes to sit and then we can dig in [Music]", "vsCaw1i52rk": "I have found an incredible way to make\nthese chocolate chip cookies in less than five minutes. It's a Refika\ntechnique and I strongly suggest you to watch this video. Before we start, I would like to ask you\nto subscribe to our channel because it's a marvelous one and I don't want you to\nmiss any fun, any good information that we are giving here; so please subscribe.\nWe're looking forward to it now we have two, in Turkey we call this lavash bread,\nyou can call wheat tortilla, floor tortilla. These are 65 grams, 130 grams\ntwo of them together. We're going to use this as a dough. So it's a Refika\ntechnique and with this technique, you can do many stuff. So I'm tearing these\nlike this, if they are a bit dry it would be even much better and I'm adding this\nto my small food processor. I don't know whether this, is this food processor? And\nlearning from you guys, you tell me. In Turkey, these are usually known by the\nbrand. So to this, because it's like cooked dough, I want to take it back to its\norigins and make it a dough. To do that, I'm going to add 2 tablespoons of water, like\nthis. First it's small bits like this,\nat this stage don't give up, go on, we want to make it like a dough. Now, it became\nsomething like a dust. To this, I'm going to add two tablespoons of tahini but if\nyou're not a tahini person, you can also add peanut butter, without added sugar.\nYou know the real peanut butters for the sports people used. To this, I'm also\nadding two tablespoons of brown sugar. This is also going to give that crunchy\nfeeling and you know how chocolate chip cookie, you know falls apart, sugar\nhas a role in that too. Also to make it into a dough a tablespoon of butter and\nthat's all. And putting into this my small processor again and make it work.\nOne of the mostly asked questions is which products that I should use in the\nkitchen. These food processes are very much used in Turkey but I found out in\nthe United States and Europe, these are almost never used but these are very\neasy to use when you do small toppings and as the families are shrinking as\nnumber of people living in the house is less. This is the thing that will save\nyour life so keep in mind and it's better, if the container is small and\nthere are at least two pair of knives. So I kind of made the machine do the\nkneading, it's almost ready, now looks like this. When I squeeze this in my hand,\nit becomes like a dough and tastes really really nice. Yes you can eat it right now,\nit's already cooked. So the dough is ready, the second part is the chocolate\nchips so I'm using dark chocolates around 40 grams and with my knife, I'm\ngoing to roughly chop it. There will be small chunks and there will be bigger\nbigger chunks. No, I believe it goes well together so it\ncould be this or it could be milky chocolate as I know that you all guys\nlike. And now, I have 30 grams of roasted not salted peanuts. They could be salted\nas well, it also tastes nice. I am also roughly chopping them.\nSo, I'm going to first put the mixture roughly squeeze it like this and add\nchocolates and nuts and just to bind them and make them stick together, I'm\ngoing to knead them for 30 seconds. I do not knead it very much ,why? Cause in dough\nhow wheat works is if you knead so much, you wake up to gluten which makes it gummy\nfor the cookies, you want them to like fall, you want it to crumble in your\nmouth. So, I knead the dough for about 30 seconds and it becomes something like\nthis. This is.. would you like to taste it? How does it feel? Now, you can eat it like\nthis or you can like slice it and then make\nit into a shape of a cookie, like this. Some of the recipes when I try to invent\nthem because this is like a really big shortcut. You can use this for this\nrecipe but also in your mind you can get this little salty dough into other\nshapes. You can make a another salty or maybe a bit chilly cookie or something\nor use it in different ways. To be able to discover it gives the chef to me a\nreally big satisfaction and for a week I'm happy and I smile to people. That's\nhow I like to invent when I was in high school I was the physics and the math\nperson and I liked inventing there and now I do the cookies. So now, they go to\nthe oven upper and lower heat is on, with the fan. It's about 250 Celsius and I put\nit in the second level, almost close to the upper level. In four minutes, the\ncookies are going to be done. Probably, you can use  microwave, I'm never a microwave\nperson, I never suggest you to use microwave so it's mingles with the cells\n etc etc. So I tried doing this on the stovetop, it doesn't work\nwhen it is just plane, you can use the pan and add the baking paper and then you can\nmake it that way but it's never as good as how it is done  in the fridge.. in the oven. \nWhile it's there, I would like to show you some other\nthing and that is this. This is cookie dough what did, we do with it, we froze it. Yes, but not so much, like two hours in\nthe fridge. For eating like this. Now I'm going to make it taste it.\nIsn't it a trend in USA like this? I remember I saw like cookie dough recipes.\nBefore the plate is full, he started to eat it, anyways. It's a bit cold, so good. I\ndon't know if it come from lavash or peanut but saltness is just\nperfect, I think comes from both. Banana also would great with this. That's why, we have\nthe bellies. Turkish one. This goes to Ms. Bahar Kitap\u00e7\u0131, from the chef to the director. Now, the cookies are here. Whoo,\ncan you hear the sound, sizzling. It is, actually we have ready-made store-bought\nchocolate chip cookies as well and I would like you guys to taste it. When\nthese things are freshly out, they're really soft. I put them on the wire rack\nto cool down and not on the plate because on the plate, when it's cooling\ndown, it gives out water instead of making crunchy, it will become soggy. So\nwe don't want it. Enlightening moment but the enlightenment moment hasn't finished\nyet. Now, I'm going to make something small,\nthere is also one more tortilla here, a smaller one and this recipe will come to\nyou Tun\u00e7. I'm going to throw this to the tray and into the on for one\nminute. The bottom side is now changed a bit of\ncolor and on top now I'm going to put some chocolate. I think you have figured\nout what I'm doing. I'm going to put two then I make, I know it's kind of stupid,\ncookie dough pizza. This is what I was\ntrying to do make you horny, anyway. So these are the chocolate chip cookies,\nthis is one of the chocolate chip cookies that are sold in Turkey. One is\nlike this, the other ones like this. so store bought, not the great version one but in Turkey we aren't able to find so\nmuch. So this is the one that you can make in really five minutes. So you\ndecide which ones to do it. You want to go crazy, enjoy it with your boyfriend or\nsomething or have a bad breakup and you want to make up for the things that you\nhave lost, this could do. Or your ice cream person, the summer is coming you\ncan use this instead of an ice cream or you can use it with ice cream you decide.\nAll good. So this is it.. I hope you like what we're trying to do for you guys we\nwant to keep the recipes as simple as possible but give small details that you\ncannot find on the other YouTube channels or on the Internet, even you\ncan find not so much fun.

going on anytime why are you filming this video like a tick tock well i have now gotten almost a billion views on tick tock 141 million views on reels so this style of video clearly works that's fair let me bring it to youtube so this youtube video is going to be filmed in the style of a tick tock reel filled on my phone super fast crazy in the kitchen let's get cooking this cookie recipe it's from bon appetit it is ba's best chocolate chip cookies they're insanely delicious i've tried to make my own chocolate cookie recipes and nothing compares to this let's get baking take a frying pan with hot and place it on the stove top a stick of butter and let it fully melt we're going to continue cooking the butter until the butter starts to brown which is when the milk solids start to caramelize it's going to make an incredible flavor and you just want to keep an eye on it because it can go from brown to burnt very quickly and you'll smell it it'll smell super nutty and delicious while that was fast it was not even able to capture a brownie but there you go you now have nice brown butter and now i'm going to add in half a stick of butter into there as well we're gonna let that melt it's important that you brown some of it but not all of it so just stir this until the stick of butter fully melts with the residual heat all right now we have this beautiful golden brown butter and now to this i'm going to be adding in a cup of brown sugar and a fourth a cup of white sugar and mix it up bam egg number one oh i'd be the best but the egg got in since i try to be extra fancy for the camera and i make a little bit of a mess sorry let's try that again egg number two pretty good as well no shell got in there and then finally egg number three we are just going to use the yolk and i really think the best way to separate out the yolk is just with your fingers obviously make them washed and bam and i'll go wash your hands so the thing is i can't pause my camera so now my camera's just going to keep rolling while i wash my hands so maybe i'll just talk to you while i do it anyways i'm washing my hands very important mix until fully combined i wish you could smell how incredible this smells vanilla extract mix it up again one and a half cups all purpose flour oh god i spilled some 3 4 teaspoon baking soda and a teaspoon and a fourth of salt and now gently fold this together you do not want to over mix and create any gluten in there because we do not want a tough cookie so just mix until it's just combined okay i'm still spelling more flour our dough is fully mixed together and seed is a little bit runny it is very important that you let the flour hydrate and what that means is let it really soak up all of the fat and all that stuff so we let this sit down for about 10 minutes while we're doing that we're also going to let the butter cool it's still a little bit warm over here because of the brown butter we're gonna let it cool then we're gonna add in the chocolate and then it's baking time i'm so excited to eat this it's now just 10 minutes and look at how insanely thick it is now it is literally like magic and time to chop up the chocolate i am now chopping up a bar of chocolate i'm using some semi-sweet you can use bittersweet chocolate i like to chop up the chocolate instead of using chocolate chips because then you get little unique pieces of chocolate some are big some are large some are small some are little shavings and it really just makes a more unique cookie in every single bite asmr and add the chocolate into the cookie dough and now just mix it up until it is fully combined even though you guys know i'm not the most patient person you're actually going to let this rest for another 10 minutes to really develop those flavors and then we're baking it now take two spoons you're going to scoop up balls of about two tablespoons worth and place it onto a baking sheet and plop and top each with a sprinkle of flaky salt i already know there's gonna be some in the comments that's like a time why are you putting salt on a cookie the saltiness balances out perfectly with the sweetness do it and trust me you're never gonna make cookies without salt ever again now place the oven at 375 for eight to ten minutes until nice and golden brown oh snap the cookies are done the kitchen smells incredible look at that after letting them sit on the baking sheet for about a minute now place onto a cooling rack to cool completely now the cookies at the oven right away i'm gonna do something that might make you feel like your whole life has been a lie we are actually going to add some more chopped up chocolate on top of the hot cookies press them in slightly so that they melt and that is how you get a perfect top on your chocolate cookie you actually add even more chocolate on top now i know people like cookies different ways some people like them crunchy some people like them chewy some people like them cakey i think this is perfect it has a crunchy outside on the edges the inside's nice and soft it is the best of both worlds you guys have got tries again this is not the recipe i've tried to go up the recipes that are even better or comparable to this but in my opinion this is the best chocolate cookie recipe ever and maybe i will continue on my quest to make an even better chocolate cookie recipe

"AA9dKKSnzqU": "hey guys welcome back to my channel so I know things are a little bit crazy right now and some of us have some extra time so I thought what better time to try a new chocolate-chip cookie recipe than right now I know this is different from my normal sugar cookie videos but I've been wanting to share this recipe for a while and I thought now was the perfect time to start off add 1 cup butter 1 cup white sugar and half a cup of dark brown sugar to the mixer and mix on medium until well blended I always use cold butter straight from the refrigerator so it will take a few minutes to come together [Music] next add one teaspoon vanilla extract and two eggs and mix until blended [Music] add two and a half cups flour one teaspoon salt and one teaspoon baking soda in a separate bowl and whisk until blended I always get this ready while my butter and sugar is mixing so it's ready to go [Music] add half the flour mixture to the mixer and mix on low until combined then add the rest of the flour and mix until everything is incorporated I'll usually scrape the bowl down near the end to make sure I have everything mixed together really well [Music] [Music] next add two cups chocolate chips and mix on low until they're mixed in really well [Music] drop mounded tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 375 degrees until the edges are just starting to brown the amount of time will vary based on your oven and how big you like your cookies I make my cookies pretty big about three and a half ounces each and in my oven they're done in around fourteen to fifteen minutes I also use an air bake cookie sheet which may affect the bake time slightly I like them to be a bit browned around the edges and just barely undercooked in the middle when I pulled them from the oven they'll continue baking for a bit on the cookie sheet as they cool and this results in the softest chewy as' cookie ever this is the recipe I get asked for more than anything else I made and I hope you all enjoyed them as much as our family does [Music] the full recipe is in the description box and hopefully you have everything on hand to give these a try if you do please let me

My name is Regina. Today on the Leelalicious I'm going to show you how to make Coconut Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies! These cookies taste like bakery- style chocolate chip cookies with chewy\ncenters, crispy edges and everyone loves them. And they also happened to be gluten free, with options to make them paleo, vegan and even keto.low carb! To make the cookie dough start with 1 large bowl and add 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil or\nmelted butter to it. Next up add 1/3 cup of all natural nut or seed butter.\nSomething like peanut butter almond butter or even Tahini work really\nwell in this recipe. And now 1/2 cup of coconut sugar or sugar-free sweetener,\nlike monk fruit sugar. Use your hand mixer to combine these ingredients\nreally well until they're fluffy and creamy looking. Then add 1 egg or flax\negg substitute, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Use your mixer again to\nincorporate those. On top of the wet ingredients add 1/2 cup of coconut flour. And be sure to measure the coconut flour correctly. Otherwise you might end up\nwith too much flour and your cookie dough will be dry. So don't dip your\nmeasuring cup into the flour. Instead use a spoon to fill up your measuring cup. And also add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt. Mix those\nin with a spoon or spatula and then finally stir in dark or sugar-free\nchocolate chips. Now that your cookie dough is ready, you\ncan shape the cookies. I like to use a cookie dough scoop or you can also use a\nsmall ice cream scoop. Place the cookie dough balls on a baking sheet and\nflatten the tops. At this point you can also add a couple more chocolate chips\non each cookie and a slight sprinkle of coarse sea salt. Bake the cookies in a\npreheated oven at 350 degrees until the centers are just set. That takes about\n10 to 12 minutes. Then let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes\nbefore transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once the cookies are\ncooled, you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to\n4 days. But seriously, they never last that long in our house. And I doubt they\nwill in yours. Thank you so much for watching and baking along! Like and share this video and be sure to subscribe for more healthy and delicious recipe videos.\nAnd I will see you again soon.

sometimes even twice a week end because we an entire batch in one sitting so trust me when I tell you they are that delicious the list of ingredients is short and sweet but they're all the right ones you'll need some almond flour almond meal which I'll talk about in just a minute baking soda and salt chocolate chips of your choice you can use dairy-free whatever your heart desires some coconut oil coconut sugar egg some natural almond other system and natural almond butter you can use any almond butter and some vanilla extract and that is it they are just to die for but you want to make sure that when you're buying almond meal but you buy the kind made like with blanched almonds and then it's really fine almond meal I don't like a chunky I made me I feel like it doesn't blend well and it tends to separate a little bit throughout you know in when I'm making something so just look for a blanched almond almond meal it'll be just pale the same color is this no skin and it's nice and fine alright let's get cracking because these come together in minutes but they do need to say in the fridge for a bit the dough does so in the large bowl you're gonna add your coconut coconut oil what I've done to my coconut oil I just popped it into the microwave for a few seconds just to melt it I need my coconut sugar if you think these are gonna be overly coconutty they're not they have a tiny hue of coconut in the background but they are fantastic you need a little bit of almond butter I like a natural almond butter because I think it works really well here you need a little bit of fat you need that little like I said that little bit of fat is good that's it's just what I always keep on hand it's my kind of my favorite arm almond almond butter to keep on hand anyway then you're just gonna add your egg basically you're just adding all of your wet ingredients now and you're gonna stir them really really well you also need a good splash of vanilla and just whisk to combine everything that is perfect I'm going to just set this aside and now I'm going to add my my dry ingredients and the chocolate chips all at the same time and you're just gonna want to make sure that you give everything a really good mix I'm just gonna use a spatula but you can use a wooden spoon because you want to make sure that all of the almond meal is really well incorporated into the wet and it could it could feel a little rough at first but it's too dry but trust me it's exactly what you want okay this looks fantastic now I'm going to do is I'm gonna cover this with some plastic wrap and I'm gonna pop it into the fridge for half an hour just a half hour and I'll show you what they look like when they're done and in the meantime get your oven preheated to 350 and get two baking sheets ready lined with parchment paper all right my cookie dough was in the fridge for exactly half an hour and now I've got my oven preheated to 350 I've got a large baking sheet ready with some parchment paper and I've got my small ice cream scooper cookie scoop you just want to make sure that it's the right size you can make them bigger but it's just gonna take longer for them to cook this is about the equivalent of one tablespoon which I think is the perfect size for a cookie but hey if you want to make them bigger by all means and then what I do is just you make your little cookie right little cookie dough and then I just take my the palm of my hand or you can just take your fingers and ever so lightly kind of flatten them just like not really flat just kind of get rid of that dome shape so I'm gonna continue to do that probably gonna just do about three across because I like my cookies they have some space right last one I'm gonna save the rest of my cookie dough I want to pop it into the fridge and I'm gonna bake fresh cookies tomorrow with it because like I've said to you before we demolished the entire thing so I don't want to bake all of them because we will eat all of them but if you're gonna do the same thing just make sure if you take it out of the fridge about 20 minutes to a half an hour before you go to bake them because obviously it's gonna harden a lot more the longer the cookie dough is in the fridge so that's just a heads up I'm gonna pop these in they only need to be in there 810 minute I don't want to over bake my cookies because then otherwise they don't become nice and chewy so I'm gonna leave them in there for about eight minutes and then I'm gonna let them cool and show you what they look like when they're done my cookies baked for exactly nine minutes I've let them cool for like five minutes they are still really really warm and that's just how I like it I'm gonna go for this one right here because I want you to see what the inside looks like and it is I mean they're still really hot so they're really soft oh my goodness look at that look at that not a piece of dryness in sight praising the cookie gods because this it's the best I'm not even kidding mmm not dry at all perfectly perfectly chewy when you're good if you're not gonna eat them wonder nice and fresh and when you go through eat them again and say you want to serve them tomorrow pop them into the microwave for just a few seconds like five to ten five to ten seconds and then get some really soft again and it gets that chocolate really lovely and melting to die for little are in the kitchen calm I hope you enjoy spending time with me get this recipe make it this weekend you will not regret it I promise I promise I promise pasta next time bye [Music]", "MTD-O-Q466Y": "hey everybody welcome back to my bake like a pro YouTube channel in today's really fun video we are gonna make some amazing chocolate chip cookies for our recipe today we need 1 cup of salted butter 227 grams half a cup of white granulated sugar 100 grams 2 cups of chocolate chips 400 grams and I am using semi-sweet chocolate in my recipe today 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract 10 grams 1 teaspoon of salt 5 grams 1 teaspoon of baking soda 5 grams 1 cup of brown sugar 233 grams we also need two and a half cups of all-purpose flour 375 grams all purpose flour is also called plain flour in many countries so those are the ingredients so let's get started for our first step all of our butter into our bowl and I am using salted butter but I'm also adding a little bit extra salt because I do like my chocolate chip cookies a little bit more on the salty side all of our granulated white sugar and our brown sugar and I'm using a lighter brown sugar but you can use a darker brown sugar if you wish and also note that whatever you were measuring brown sugar make sure to pack it into your little measuring cup so now we'll just mix this up speed number one always start off at speed number one when you start your machine because you don't want everything flying out of your bowl [Applause] so at this point what we want to do is get all of our stuff well combined and well creamed [Applause] so that's about two minutes of creaming and then we will add in our eggs you can add them in one at a time or at the same time it doesn't really matter and there's our two eggs then we'll incorporate that and what this is going to do it's going to loosen this whole mixture and it's gonna make it that much more creamy so that's a good minute of mixing on a higher speed and you can see how nice and creamy our mixture is I'm gonna add in my pure vanilla extract I'm just gonna give that a little mix it's good so now what we're gonna do is switch over to the dry ingredients so to our all-purpose flour which is also called plain flour we're gonna add in our salt and our baking soda just mix that around and then we're gonna add in all of our mixture and now speed number one and let's mix this in [Applause] so this is about 30 seconds of mixing I'll just turn that off lift it up at our last ingredient all of those chocolate chips and I am using semi-sweet chocolate chips you can use any type of chocolate chip that you wish if you don't have chocolate chips you can take a chocolate bar and just shave it into little pieces and then pop that in and the amount of chocolate doesn't matter either it doesn't have to be accurate as I did in my recipe here you can put whatever amount that you like into your cookies close this down speed number one so just keep your mixer going until it looks well incorporated and that's it for the recipe I wanted to just show you how nice this dough is this is really really nice dough so we're just gonna scoop this up so what I do is I scoop it up and I push it against the side here just push it and then scoop it right out look at that nice get nice and round that looks good and just continue on you don't want to have these too close together that looks nice I think for this recipe I am going to use another size scoop as well just to see the comparison I'll just give you a little difference between smaller cookies and larger cookies well that dough sells amazing okay that's perfect for the first tray so you can see I've arranged them so that they don't melt into each other I'm gonna pop these now into my 375 degree fahrenheit oven I'll bake these off I'm going to do another batch with a slightly larger scoop and we'll see how those are so off to the oven and I'll be back in a little while for my next batch I'm gonna try out a slightly larger ice cream scoop or a cookie scoop and we'll try this out just for comparison you can see much larger so my oven will stay the same 375 degrees Fahrenheit I'm gonna leave a lot of room and hopefully I will remember to weight each cookie because I know a lot of people like to know the weight of the dough ball so there we go that looks good so I'll go bake these and I'll come back when everything is baked hey everybody I am back I have finished all of my baking so let's quickly go through what we did number one on the plate I have two samples I have the larger scoop here which is a total of 80 grams and the small scoop is a total of 30 grams so 30 and 80 so we have a difference of 50 grams and you can see that this one here is substantially larger than the small one for the small scoop we have 16 cookies here plus one here is a total of 17 and then we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 here 7 8 9 10 so a total of 10 here Plus that one 11 for the large scoop for a little bit of a variation I took the same scoop which is this one here so this one here created all of these and also this so before I put these into the oven I just press down the cookie dough so you can see that it's rounded I pushed it all down and you can see the difference I'll just lift this up so you can see so there we have the one that I pushed out and we have that there and both of these were created from the larger one here and the last bit of important information all of the small cookies were baked for a total of 10 minutes these ones here were at 12 minutes because they are thicker and then because I press these ones out I only did these for 11 minutes so I'll take these these are completely cool now and you can see how nice these are really nice and chewy I can already tell even before taking a bite but of course I got to go in and taste a little bit mmm that is good if you're gonna go with the larger cookie and you want a cookie that's a little bit more moist don't push them out these here are going to be a little bit less moist because they are larger so that's it for today's really fun video recipe I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a

you guys, welcome back to the kitchen\nhere at Little Spoon Farm In today's video i am going to show you\nhow you can make the most delicious sourdough\nchocolate chip cookies. We have been in our kitchen\ntesting and testing and testing trying to get the ratios right,\nso that you can use your sourdough starter discard\nto make these cookies with. These are thick, chewy bakery style cookies\nand let me tell you they are so good. So if you want to learn how to make\nthese, go ahead and stay tuned, and let's get started. The key\nto making these cookies nice and thick and chewy is to not over\nmix your batter, so to start, we're going to take the egg,\nsourdough starter and vanilla and beat that together in a bowl\nand set it aside. Then you're going to measure out\nyour bread flour, your all-purpose flour, the baking soda and baking powder and\nsalt, and use a whisk or a fork to combine\nthese ingredients. Set that aside and\ntake the cold butter and chop it into cubes. Use the\npaddle attachment on your stand mixer to get that started. We're going to be\nmixing everything on a low speed and once you kind of have that\nbutter a little bit broken up, we're going to add the\nlight brown sugar and the granulated sugar to the butter. Don't forget we are not trying to\nmake a light creamy fluffy butter mixture like you do in other\ncookie recipes, everything's going to stay as under\nmixed as possible. Go ahead and put your stand mixer on\na low speed and take a look at this sugar. See how\nit's still kind of clumpy with the butter a little bit?\nThis is kind of the texture that you're looking for.\nWhat we're going to do is, we're going to add our chocolate chips\nto the mixture right now, and i know this is usually the last thing you add\nbut we're going to add it right now and we're going to let\nthe ingredients mix together and these chocolate chips are going to help\nget the butter and sugar mixed more evenly. So this is what you're looking for, just\nkind of almost a crumbly mixture. Now we're\nadding the dry ingredients and we're going to\nmix this on low speed again, and it doesn't take long. We are looking\nto get these ingredients mixed together without overworking a wet dough and\nthat's going to help to reduce the cakiness, we want\nthick chewy dense cookies. So take a look at this, see how you\ncan still see some of the butter? I'm taking a spatula and I'm just\nkind of breaking those pieces up and mixing it just a little bit more to\nget all those butter pieces and everything incorporated together. Now it's time to put in our egg,\nsourdough starter and vanilla mixture that we beat earlier.\nSo we're going to pour that in and again we're gonna mix this\nuntil the ingredients just come together, and it doesn't take long\nprobably about 30 seconds is all it takes. See the dough how it just kind of comes together? Check to make sure all the wet\ningredients have been mixed in, and there was still a little bit on the\nbottom so you know i'm processing this for about\n10 seconds and that's it. You can see that dough is pulling away from the sides of the bowl. This is what you're looking for. Okay,\nnow we've got this dough mixed and you know we haven't overworked the dough, here you can see the texture, I recommend using a cookie scoop\nto portion out your dough into balls and i'm using\ntwo scoops per cookie. This dough is going to make about a\ndozen cookies maybe a couple of more of this size. If you don't want this big\nof a cookie, you can just use one scoop but i recommend you you know going ahead and making these big, they're really\ngood. After you've portioned out the dough,\nit's going to be a little bit sticky so i like to shape it into a ball. I kind\nof roll it in into a ball with my hands and we're\ngoing to take this dough and put it in the fridge right on this\nbaking sheet, you don't have to cover it, you can if you want to,\nbut you're going to put it in the fridge and you're going to let it chill\novernight. I would say a minimum of two hours. I'm putting it onto parchment paper\nlined baking sheet to go ahead and bake, the oven is preheated preheated at 375\nfahrenheit. I like to\nroll these firm dough balls into really nice round balls because i like a nice pretty round cookie after they've\nbaked. By doing this you're going to make\nsure that your cookies are uniform and even,\nbut this is totally unnecessary, you don't have to do this part if you\ndo not care what your cookies look like. Another thing that i like to do is\njust sprinkle a little bit of this flaky sea salt on top.\nIt really enhances the flavor of the cookies but you do not have to do this\nstep. It's just recommended if you have some.\nYou can use regular salt but don't use a whole lot. After the salt goes on the dough\nballs, these are going to be baked in a 375\ndegree oven for around 15 minutes\nand once they're finished you want to remove them from the oven\nand leave them on the baking sheet for about five minutes\nand then transfer them to a cooling rack to go ahead and cool the rest of the way. you can eat them warm, you can eat them after they've cooled off,\nbut either way they are perfection. You are definitely going to really enjoy\nthis recipe. It's super easy and it's so perfect for\nyour sourdough discard. Look at the chocolate in these things, I\nmean guys, these are so thick and chewy and delicious. So that's it that is how easy it is to\nmake these cookies. If you can make a double batch, because\nonce you portion out the dough into the dough balls\nyou can actually freeze them and they will stay good in the freezer\nin a freezer safe container for a couple of months.\nThe uncooked dough will also stay good in the fridge for up to a week\nso go ahead and make an extra batch and that way you can just grab some out of\nthe freezer when you have a sweet tooth and you know,\njust pop them right into the oven from the freezer. You'll have to cook\nthem a few more minutes than if they were just coming out of the\nfridge, but that's it. These are so delicious and I\nknow that your friends and family are going\nto absolutely love them. They are thick chewy\nand just perfect. You are going to love them.

Today we're making this wafer\nthin, crispy, beautiful chocolate chip cookie. This is a pretty basic\nchocolate chip cookie; for this recipe you're going to need flour, granulated\nsugar, brown sugar, butter, vanilla, egg, salt, and baking soda. So this is the\nperfect cookie for someone who likes them wafer thin and crispy. I'm not\nusually a real fan of these but I kind of like this, kind of like this a lot. So\nthe first thing you need to do is weigh the butter right into the mixing bowl. I\nknow I know most you guys want volume measurements in cups and teaspoons. All\nthat information is in the recipe, it's also there in metric and I'm also giving\nyou Baker's percentages so that you have full power to make this recipe whatever\nyou want. Now you start creaming the butter to soften it up while you weigh\nout the two sugars. now you add the sugars to the butter and\nyou start creaming it and this is where I would normally tell you to really\ncream it well but one of the one of the secrets to getting a cookie this thin is\nto only sort of cream it you want to cream the butter and the sugars together\nto mix them but not so long that it's really light and fluffy and that's the\nfirst step to getting a cookie like this. While that's creaming together weigh out\nthe flour add the salt and the baking soda now the baking soda is the second\ntrick to getting a cookie this thin. This particular recipe has a baking soda\npercentage or a baking soda amount that is higher than the average\nchocolate-chip cookie. So the effect of baking soda is threefold it inhibits\ngluten formation which which helps the cookie be this thin. Speeds the Maillard\nreaction which helps the cookie get so dark and crispy, and the third effect is\nit tenderizes but you know this is so thin and crispy tenderness really\ndoesn't matter. Now with the mixer running adding the vanilla and the egg. Now a very important key overlooked step\nis scrape down the bowl even if you have a mixer like ours that has a little\nscraper on the paddle, you still need to scrape down the bowl, scrape up the\nbottom make sure it gets all mixed together. As soon as the egg is\nincorporated into that batter spoon in your flour mixture and you only want to\nmix the flour until it disappears don't over mix it that just causes other\nproblems down the line. Oh and make sure the mixer is on low so that the flour\ndoesn't go everywhere. Take the bowl off the mixer and with a rubber spatula give\nit a little bit of a mix and then stir in the chocolate chips. Now if it's a\nreally hot day and your dough is really loose maybe stick it in the fridge for\n15-20 minutes just to firm it up a little bit before you portion it out and\nput it on to the baking tray. Of course if you can leave it in the fridge\novernight or for 24 hours before you bake them your flavour is going to be so\nmuch better... but who can wait that long I can't. Now when you're portioning out your\ncookies I used a fairly small ice cream scoop you could use a much larger one if\nyou want. It depends what size cookies you want and of course you can use a\nspoon. Spoon works just fine. Toss those in the oven and bake them until they're\ncooked depending on your oven that could take somewhere between 12 and 15 minutes.\nPull them out let them cool a little bit on the baking sheet and then move them\nto a wire rack to cool completely. These are great cookies I really like them but\nthen as you're gonna see if you continue watching this series I pretty much like\nany cookie! So give these a try and if you don't like this style of\ncookie check out one of our other chocolate chip cookie recipes in this\nplaylist Thin Crispy Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe  ", "3NepEepB0lU": "[Music] hi welcome to chris cook for you too i'm doing this uh video as a remake this is the chocolate chip cookies that are just so delicious i don't make them my daughter makes them and even though you're going to hear my voice doing these instructions or this tutorial she's going to be actually doing the preparation of the cookies now i've done this we had done this video but for some reason and i'll say it's technical difficulties this part of the video did not show up so it's just the first part that i'm gonna be redoing everything else is going to be the same and the ending the ending is supposed to be where she puts the little twist on it and she prepares them like i like them and the only thing that we're going to do at that stage even though you won't see it is to just add walnuts because i like walnuts in my chocolate chip cookies these cookies are very delicious i think if you try them you're truly going to enjoy them and so will your family so let's get started you're going to need flour this is all-purpose flour sugar granulated white sugar and brown sugar i'm using light brown sugar eggs softened butter semi-sweet chocolate chips you're gonna need some hot water i didn't put it in here but we will have it at the time that we get ready to mix everything together you're going to need some vanilla extract now this vanilla extract i don't even know if you can buy it here uh we got it on a trip to mexico so i think that uh if you just regular vanilla extract will do but i don't want you to see this bottle there and say oh where'd you get that big bottle from can i purchase it i don't even know exactly what store where it actually came from you're going to need salt you're going to need baking soda now as usual i will put your ingredients at the bottom of the tutorial okay this is going to make roughly about two two and a half dozen cookies but i want you to try this recipe not only at the holiday time and i'm gonna be doing a lot or we're going to be doing a lot of sweets because we're preparing for thanksgiving christmas and for new year's but you can try them out you have enough time to try them out decide which ones you want to try and then go for it now the only twist again i will say is just going to be the walnuts and that's going to be at the end of the video so all you do is just save some of the batter add walnuts and then go ahead and bake them off now when you look at the thumbnail on the video you're going to see the chocolate chip cookies without the uh walnuts and you're going to see a little bitty plate in front that shows the walnuts that's just the way i like it so if you want to add something different just save out some batter and go ahead and add it i'll be right back to put together this delicious recipe both me and my daughter be right back okay now we are at the mixer and the mixer is on um is on low and as i told you my daughter would be doing this so because she's the one that makes these chocolate chip cookies but this is very very good so what you see her actually doing now is combining the sugar and the um brown sugar and the granulated sugar she's combining that with the softened butter now we had added the butter when um we started the video up so all now she's doing is just adding the two sugars to it doesn't make a difference if you add the brown sugar and then the and this is light brown if you add the light brown sugar and then the granulated white sugar or if you do granulated white sugar and light brown sugar okay but you want to blend that very well and that's the same thing that you do when you're making your cakes you want to blend your sugar and your butter very well and most of your cakes will start out what you're doing the sugars and the butter first and then you'll add just like she's doing the eggs now these eggs are being added one at a time and as always i'm gonna put the uh the directions in the description box because since i don't really make these cookies i don't really know them but i'll have them in the description box so you can go ahead and make them again i tell you you will really really enjoy these cookies now you want to make certain that once your butters are creamed together real good along with your sugar you want to make certain that your eggs are the same and you want to scrape that bowl down on the sides so she's going to stop that mixer and she's going to scrape that bowl that's just to make sure that you get all of your ingredients uh all blended well together um you've already preheated and if you haven't you can go ahead and do that now you want to preheat that oven to 350 degrees okay you want to use a baking sheet but you do not want to grease the baking sheet so don't put anything on the baking sheet just leave it like it was the butter or the oils that's in your uh cookies will be enough to prevent your cookies from sticking now she's adding the vanilla flavor to the mixture and all of that is still being creamed up together now what she's going to do i'm sorry i stopped talking because i wanted to uh warm her water for and she's gonna add the baking soda to the water now why are you doing that because a lot of times when you bake cookies you can taste the soda in the cookies and that's not good flavor when you're baking cookies so one of the ways to dilute that taste is by mixing the baking soda with whatever liquid you have and in this case it's going to be water so let me get it now it's just a small amount of water and it's a small amount of baking soda as well and you want to mix that together and then you want to add that mixture to your cookies now this whole process takes about 10 minutes so that's not a long period of time and i wanted to tell you that if you want to change your semi-sweet chocolate chips you can change it to whatever kind of chocolate chips you know you want to use whether it be milk chocolate sweet semi-sweet you can just go ahead and change that to whatever it is that you prefer okay so once you get that baking soda in and it's real this recipe is real good and it's a good thing that you mix the water and the baking soda together because you do not taste the baking soda in these cookies you really don't taste it so you're gonna enjoy it now once you've added that baking soda to it then you're gonna go ahead and add in your salt all right now we're back and she's uh getting ready to put the cookies down i want you to look at that scoop this is an ice cream cream scoop that i'm using but when you're making the kit the cookies or when you're putting them down just go ahead and use a tablespoon okay because that's going to give you just the and kind of over dip the tablespoon and that's going to or put a little bit more on top and that's going to give you a thick cookie but a rich enough cookie or a filled enough cookie where you'll get a good chance at the store okay she's gonna take these cookies out and that's what they look like we cannot move the cookies because they need to cool for about four to five minutes so once they cool then she's gonna repeat that process she's gonna take it off put some more on and keep on baking until she gets to the ones that i want now they smell delicious and you want to leave them on your baking sheet until they cook okay now we're back and the cookies are completed here they are these are the ones that are without nuts and these are the ones that i love the ones that i love are still a little bit warm just wanted to show you that's the ones with the walnuts now i want to show you something look at these cookies don't get the cookies any darker than that a lot of people burn the back burnt cookies are not good so don't get the cookies any darker than that and look at something else see it that's the size of the palm of my hand okay so that's how you want these cookies to come out and if you look if you use the amount of the cookie mix that she put in the scoop in ice cream scoop and then she put it into um the pan that's what you're gonna get and these are manny a little bit smaller but you can see the chocolate chips you can see the walnuts and i got the crunch of the cookie this is gonna be so delicious this would be a good cookie to crunch up or to crumble up over your ice cream and make you a sundae out of it it also be a good cookie with a glass of milk even though i prefer mine with water okay that's what i have for you today my daughter is baking up her famous chocolate chip cookies her picture is going to be in the side of this video i couldn't get her to come on screen but you'll be able to see her anyway next up is going to be that curry chicken and my other daughter is making the curry chicken and as always thank you for watching chris cook for you too stay safe bye [Music] you", "JfFshrKQTJE": "Today on Sugar Spun Run,  I'll be showing you how to make crispy chocolate chip cookies. Hey Sugar Spun Bakers, Sam here and I am so excited to be sharing another carefully tested, well researched, and perfected recipe. These cookies are pretty different from the ones I normally share. They're not soft and chewy, they are thin and they are crispy. I've gotten a lot of requests for these cookies. So, I think a lot of you are going to love them. So, let's go ahead and get started. First thing that you want to do is pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit. The first thing you're going to want to grab is one cup or two sticks of softened unsalted butter. We're going to add this to a large bowl and you're going to want to grab an electric mixer or you can use your stand mixer and we're going to beat the butter until it's nice and creamy. Now, the next thing you need is my secret ingredient for the crispiest best-tasting cookies. We are using 1 cup, that's not a full can, just one cup of sweetened condensed milk. Now, you'll also want to add one cup of granulated sugar and one cup of firmly packed light brown sugar. Now, we'll beat everything together until it's nice and creamy and well combined. And I almost forgot the vanilla extract. You're also going to need two teaspoons of vanilla, so we can go ahead and add that now. That would have been an unfortunate miss. So now that we have everything nicely combined here and all of our ingredients in the bowl, we can set this aside and you'll want to grab another bowl for 2 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour. Now I\u2019ll add 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of baking soda and we\u2019ll whisk everything together until it's nicely combined. Now gradually we\u2019ll add this into our butter mixture, and I'm using my electric mixer. And, I like to add the flour in like for three or four parts. Now, this is a super soft dough. So it's not going to take much to get everything well combined. But, after mixing I do like to grab my spatula and just scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Now, of course you need your chocolate chips will be adding 1 cup of regular semi-sweet chocolate chips. And I also like to add 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. Now, I also like to have a few mini chocolate chip set aside. I'm going to be using them after I bake the cookies. I'll show you how we do that in a couple minutes. We'll just use our spatula to stir everything together. You really don't need your electric mixer at this point. We'll scoop this dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. I'm just going to be using about a tablespoon of dough per cookie. And while you could just drop it right on the baking sheet. One thing I like to do for nice round cookies is I like to just roll the dough briefly between my palms. This is a really sticky dough so it can kind of be a pain to do this but it just makes the cookies look a little bit nicer. It's up to you whether you skip that step or not. We'll take these over to our 325 degree preheated oven where they're going to need to bake for about 17 to 18 minutes or until they're a nice golden brown color all the way through. Now, if you'd like, you can grab some of those chocolate chips you reserve from earlier and gently nestle them onto the top of each cookie while the cookies are still warm. And that is how you make these nice crispy chocolate chip cookies. I want you  guys hear that snap. Hopefully you could hear that. I hope you guys enjoyed today's recipe. And if you try this one, please let me know what you think. I always love hearing from you. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time. Hear that crunch?!", "H9TAg3-muGU": "[Music] greetings my beautiful lovelies its Emmie welcome back today I'm going to be making an American classic and it is chocolate chip cookies now if you are a chocolate chip cookie lover like I am you know there are thousands of varieties of chocolate chip cookies thousands of recipes but in general there are kind of characteristic set some people like some people like a chewy cookie some people like a crumbly cookie some people like a crisp cookie some people like big cookies some people like small cookies all different kinds of chocolate chip cookies today I'm gonna be making a particular style and it is this one and these are teeth bakeries chocolate chip cookies you can just buy these at the supermarket and this style of cookie is very buttery and crispy and thin and no hugely popular I actually had these for the first time not too long ago we were on a road trip and I picked them up at the store and my son's really really enjoy them and I did too I was kind of surprised because generally speaking I like my chocolate chip cookies on the kind of chubby side not necessarily soft and cake like but I like a nice chew but a Christmas on the edge of my cookies now the recipe I'm gonna be testing today comes from the legendary Stella Parkes she wrote this book brave TARP which is amazing if you are not familiar with this book you should definitely check it out so what I really love about Stella and her recipes is that she really knows how to break it down she knows what characteristics and what portions create what flavor profiles what kinds of textures and flavors I love that and she does not disappoint that's her own take on classic American brands including Oreos Fig Newtons animal crackers Thin Mints I have to try that one this is the next one I want to try is the McDonald style Apple turnover the apple pies from McDonald's do you remember McDonald's apple pie back when they deep-fry them I only had it once and once was enough they're absolutely incredible in terms of a pie that comes close I would have to say would be the Jollibee peach mango pie which is just dror de neri in its own right a completely different flavor profile but the whole deep-fried fritter thing they've got that candy bars including Reese's peanut butter cups crunch bars Snickers bars and she even has a whole section on tempering yeah if you didn't see my video where I make my own chocolate bar and I talked about tempering yeah I'll put that link up above and down below that was probably the most epic recipe that I've ever attempted to make and I took a cocoa pod and I made it into a chocolate bar and boy howdy did I learn a lot alrighty so let's go ahead and make ourselves some chocolate chip cookies we're gonna begin with preheating our oven to 350 degrees place the rack right in the stinkin middle and then in the bowl of our food processor we're going to start to combine our dry ingredients we're gonna add our flour our brown sugar and our raw cane sugar so Stella says it's very important to use the right type of sugar in this recipe you must use light brown sugar dark brown sugar will be too dark too much molasses and you need to use raw cane sugar raw cane sugars also known as turbinado sugar and it too contains a little bit of molasses so that's really important to get that kind of caramel flavor that's found in these cookies then you add your salt your baking soda and then you're gonna pulse this until everything is well combined next we're gonna add our cold butter which we've cut up into little tbsp portions and pulse this until the butter is chopped up into kind of a dry crumbly crumb no big chunks nice and even and then we're gonna add our chocolate chips and just give this a couple pulses to kind of break the chips up a little bit so sell also says that you can store this mixture it can be your chocolate chip cookie mix in an airtight container or you can go ahead and make cookies which is what I'm gonna do so dump this into a large bowl so add one cold egg and your vanilla mixes with the spoon it's gonna seem very very dry but it will come together next you're going to take your impeccably clean hands and work all of the wet ingredients into the dry and magically it becomes a dough they're gonna take a half-sheet pan so instead of a silicone liner we're going to use a piece of parchment paper use a 1 tablespoon ice-cream scoop or in my case just a tablespoon and dole out 12 balls of cookie dough and then we're gonna place this in the oven for 15 to 16 minutes until the cookies look nice and golden and crisp and then allow them to cool to room temperature before you do anything don't move them because the cookies are gonna be really soft and delicate oh here are my cookies I baked them up and I did not leave enough space between them as you see I have little snowmen and I used a little paring knife and I cut them apart when you make yours give them more room so they can spread and grow anyways they look pretty stinkin amazing nice and uniform in size and they look beautiful already let's go mo taste oh no one feels small this one looks perfect let's do a little side-by-side comparison let's open up the Tate's and see what these are like packages like this when I scoop these out onto the tray Mike whoa those are gonna be small cookies but now I see it Stella I see the light these cookies are pretty small dates versus all righty so this is pretty exciting cuz Stella's cookie looks a lot like Tate's cookie and in terms of thinness girl she nailed it the color is a little bit different but that could be simply because of my baking these are a little bit more golden on the outside this is the homemade while the store-bought are just a little bit more even the homemade one definitely smells more buttery while the store-bought one smells more kind of artificial and vanilla and in terms of number of chocolate chips I would stay homemade has more chocolate chips than store-bought although let's make sure by looking at other examples actually I would say the ratio is actually pretty similar alright enough with the physical characteristics let's go ahead and eat some cookies let's try Oh G first here we go Tate mm-hmm that's a pretty great cookie very sweet nice chunks of chocolate in there very thin and crisp actually like that texture buttery flavor is present not overly strong but delicious chocolate chip cookie all right so let's compare that with the homemade version and because I forgot to say if they're backing us it's a ducky Maas yeah I like Stella's version better the homemade version has a very clear pronounced flavor of rich fresh butter and the chocolate chips taste better and they're bigger and it seems that the chocolate is better quality as well mm-hmm there's more bitterness to the chocolate chip which goes better to me with the very sweet cookie base which actually has a good amount of salt in there as well which again goes really well with the chocolate let me try the tapes again besides flavor I also like the texture of the homemade one better too there's a slight chewiness particularly in the middle of the cookie along with that really crisp outside mm-hmm another difference is the crumb texture of the store bob is a little bit finer in terms of choosing a winner Stella's wins by a landslide really great wonderful buttery fresh chocolate chip cookie flavor as opposed to store-bought cookie which tastes like a store-bought cookie but a very good one the homemade version does a great job in capturing that signature thin crisp cookie style and it does much better in terms of capturing the essence to me in a beautifully made chocolate chip cookie granted it is a bit unfair to compare homemade versus store-bought in the sense that store-bought cookies are designed to have a very long shelf life although Stella says these will last six weeks in an airtight container six weeks that alone should convince you to make these cookies already thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you guys enjoyed that one I hope you guys learned something please share this video with your friends follow me on social media like this video subscribe and I shall see you in the next one to leave take care [Music]", "5OCO0klXrO0": "[Music] one thing that i strongly believe in is that you can never have enough chocolate in life which is why i'm making double chocolate cookies an incredibly simple recipe that is sure to make you smile let's get started i'll start by adding half a cup of salted softened butter into a bowl make sure your butter is not too cold or hard or completely melted it needs to be at room temperature i'm just slightly losing it a little with my spatula and now to this i'll add in half a cup of sugar i'm using super fine sugar here and half a cup of brown sugar as well now using my spatula i'll cream the butter with both the sugars until i get a mixture that's light fluffy and pale this looks good and now to this i'm adding in one egg and i'll mix it in as well if you want to make these cookies eggless all you need to do is to replace the egg with a flax egg to make one flax egg you need to combine one tablespoon of flaxseed powder with three tablespoons of water just give it a good mix using a spoon and let it sit on the counter for about five to ten minutes until the mixture thickens and resembles the consistency of an egg now coming back to my cookie dough i'm also adding in a teaspoon of vanilla extract i'll mix it in as well and once that's in i'll start adding my dry ingredients dump in one cup of maida which is all-purpose flour half a teaspoon of baking soda one tablespoon of corn flour which will make our cookies chewy and 1 4 cup of cocoa powder all my dry ingredients are in and now i'll just mix everything together until i get a nice and thick cookie dough and to take my cookie dough to the next level i'm also adding in a tablespoon of coffee mixture my cookie dough is ready but before i can make the cookies this needs to go in the fridge and chill for at least half an hour or until the butter begins to set so my dough has been chilling in the fridge this is an extremely important step i know it could be annoying to just wait for half an hour but this is super important if you skip this your cookies will basically spread too much in the oven which you don't want now i use an ice cream scoop to scoop the dough out on a baking tray lined with silicon mat now if you don't have a silicon mat you could use a parchment paper or two layers of aluminium foil this helps me make sure that my cookies don't burn in the bottom so my oven is preheating at 180 degrees celsius i'm putting more chocolate chunks on top and i'll bake these cookies for about 10 to 12 minutes [Music] do [Music] i hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and these double chocolate cookies if you did let me

the raw egg so thank God Ronna from edible showed me how to make it safe and eggless it's super easy put all the ingredients into the bowl two sticks of butter softened 1 teaspoon of salt 3/4 cup of granulated sugar 3/4 cup of brown sugar 1/4 cup of applesauce and eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg 2 cups of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 and 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips and then I'm going to fold in the chocolate chips at the end now you'll notice that we're using applesauce well that's actually what's going to give the texture of cookie dough replace the egg give us a little bit of a binding agent there we go now you can also use a hand mixer but I kind of like getting a little work out for the baby goods okay so now we're gonna add our mini chocolate chips and I love using mini because you dip that little baby chocolate in every single bite this looks fantastic and now I have no problem licking the entire spoon now if you want to take this chocolate chip cookie dough to the next level check out our chocolate chip cookie dough stuffed Oreos dipped in chocolate what we should show them all right hit it [Music] are you drooling yet well thanks so much for watching if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up and subscribe to pop sugar food it all see you next time bye [Music]", "uSG_ti_glJo": "[Music] they were making oatmeal chocolate chip cookies these cookies are big thick crisp at the edges chewy throughout and they're loaded with chocolate chips not raisin if you want to learn how to make this recipe then be sure to watch this video all the way to the end because I'll be sharing my best cookie baking secrets my name is Tessa and I'm from handle to eat calm where I love to share sweet treats with a sprinkling of baking science and all of the ingredient measurements for this recipe can be listed down below now to get started we're going to mix together the dry ingredients so in my bowl I've already weighed out my all-purpose flour so that I'm going to add a little bit of salt baking soda baking powder and a touch of cinnamon this is optional but I really like the flavor it gives these cookies I'm going to whisk that together now I like to use baking soda and baking powder here you can learn more about the differences between both in another video on my baking science playlist so next up we're going to cream together the butter and sugar I always use unsalted butter when baking allows me to control the amount of salt in any recipe and when you're making cookies you wouldn't be sure to use butter that's at a cool room temperature if your butter is too warm that will cause the cookies just spread out into like those sad little puddles while they're baking in the oven which we definitely don't want here just going to add some granulated sugar and dark brown sugar I like dark brown sugar in this recipe because it adds more moisture and that butterscotch flavor I have a whole video on how to DIY your own brown sugar and how to store brown sugar so it doesn't get all hard so I'm just going to attach my beater attachment here and then we're going to beat this for about two to three minutes on medium high speed the key with cookies is you don't want to over beat the butter and sugar with cake you can beat it for like 3 to 5 minutes but with cookies just a couple minutes will do if you over beat your butter and sugar then you can actually add too much air and what will happen is the cookies will puff up and look beautiful while they're baking and then when they cool the fly and look really sad we don't feel you don't want that here so I'm just going to beat for two minutes okay my butter and sugar looks nice and creamy and fluffy you can see that it's like got this specific texture that you're looking for it's fluffy and light but not super pale and so next up I'm going to add in eggs so I'm actually using two eggs and one egg yolk that extra egg yolk is going to lend richness and chewiness to these cookies it's a great trick for any cookie recipe and actually I have a full free cookie customization guide that shows you how to make any cookie recipe more chewy or cakey or crispy whatever your heart desires I'll link to that guy down below so you can download it so my eggs are at room temperature so they blend in cohesively and I'm just going to add them one at a time [Music] [Music] okay and lastly for my wet ingredients is just a splash of vanilla extract okay so even though I'm using one of the attachments that scrapes the bowl as it goes I still see little pockets of unblended sugar and butter so I'm just going to scrape down my attachment and then get into the bottom of the bowl and scrape that down too if you've ever made a batch of cookies we're almost all the cookies looked perfect except a few look like they kind of exploded in the oven it was probably a little hidden pocket of butter that didn't get blended in with everything else next up I'm going to add in that flour mixture so I've added in my flour mixture and I'm going to start my mixer on low speed so I don't end up with a cloud of flour all over my kitchen okay so now for the star ingredient oatmeal I'm actually using quick cooking oats because it's all they have the store you can use old-fashioned oats or quick cookie notes pretty much interchangeably the only difference is that quick cooking oats have a finer texture they've kind of been ground slightly more than old-fashioned oats and the blend into the cookies better if you use old-fashioned oats you look your cookies will have a more rustic kind of loose texture but either way they'll be delicious and then I'm also adding in semi-sweet chocolate chips now if you did want to use raisins instead you totally could but as a chocolate lover I have to go with chocolate chips and just give that a mix until it's all combined [Applause] okay the dough is ready and I actually get asked a lot of questions about oatmeal chocolate chip cookies can you just add oatmeal to your favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe the answer is usually no because oats will actually suck up a lot of the moisture in your cookies so if you just added oats to a regular chocolate chip cookie recipe the result would probably really dry maybe even crumbly so I definitely recommend using this recipe if you love oatmeal chocolate chip clip so to shape our cookies I'm using the large cookie scoop it's a 3 tablespoon scoop because I like these to be really big and chewy and I'm just going to scoop them out onto a parchment lined baking sheet now I typically like to use parchment instead of silicone baking mats because when a silicone mat is just another thing you have to clean but also I find that if you allow cookies to kind of cool on silicone mats for too long they get slightly soggy instead of crispy at the edge contrast of a gooey chewy Center with crispy edges so I love to use parchment paper okay before I set a soft to the oven to bake I'm going to do a little trick to make them look picture-perfect so I'm going to roll each fall between the palms of my hands and then flatten it slightly and then add a few chocolate chips on top so they look like they're from the bakery okay my cookies look good they're ready to bake in a 350 degree oven for about 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown at the edge right the cookies are out of the oven they look and smell amazing perfectly golden brown I cannot wait to take a taste these are perfect with a tall glass of cold milk if you try to make this recipe and be sure to take a photo and hashtag it handle the heat so we can all see your amazing cookie creations the full recipe is listed down below and don't forget to download my free cookie customization guide I'll link to that down below as well now it's time for a taste mmm these are so chewy and moist crispy at the edges and you gotta love the chocolate chips thank you so much for watching if you like this video be sure to give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you next time [Music]", "jjjtH4Ipr5o": "[Music] [Applause] what's up guys it's Nicole also known as Nikki vegan and in today's video I went on Pinterest in search of the perfect vegan chocolate chip cookie and I found a lot of pictures that looks really good but there was a little part of me in the back of my mind that was kind of thinking the picture looks really good but how do I know that it's actually going to taste that good or that I'm gonna be able to recreate that at home and have it turn out like the picture so I'm sure some of you guys have thought that when you look at Pinterest recipes sometimes they look so beautiful and then you make them at home and they're not quite as good so I thought I would actually test a couple I narrowed it down to three all of which which have very different ingredients and kind of different processes as well I did find one I think is the clear winner above all it's maybe one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had in my whole life but not only that I learned a lot of tips and tricks about baking that you can use for any cookie recipe if you already have one that you currently love at home a lot of the things I'm going to share with you in this video can help you make a better chocolate chip cookie no matter what recipe you're using so I really hope you guys loved this video I teamed up with dr market to buy all of my pantry ingredients things like organic vegan sugar and vegan chocolate chips and even vanilla extract vanilla extract like good Mendell extra can be a little bit pricey sometimes so I like to pick up all of my dry pantry goods on thrive market I save a ton of money when I do that and it makes finding vegan ingredients really easy because I just clicked that little vegan filter and it's always always always cheaper than at my regular grocery store and since I was making quite a lot of cookies that came in handy so if you guys want to try that market there is a code in the description box below for you to give it a shot I hope you guys enjoy shopping there as much as I do and with all of that said let's make some cookies so the first recipe that I found was what looked like to be the most classic homemade chocolate-chip cookie so I picked that one and then I found out that it was actually made by sweet simple vegan who I love so I was even more excited to try it and for this you just mix together white sugar and brown sugar in a mixing bowl and then we add coconut oil one of the reasons I chose this recipe was because it does have coconut oil in it and I was really curious to see if the cookies would end up tasting that way and also it has applesauce which I have never seen in a cookie recipe but this acts as an egg replacer so you don't have to use eggs and you don't have to buy any fancy egg replacers you can just use applesauce apparently and I was really interested to see what this was going to do to the texture so you add that to the bowl along with some vanilla extract and stir all the wet ingredients together one of the things I love about this recipe is that it's a One Bowl recipe so when I was reading through I was like okay this is really easy and it seems really practical and I love the idea that everything just goes into the bowl you scoop it onto a cookie tray and bake it really really fast and easy so I just mixed in the flour the baking powder or baking soda and salt it has a full teaspoon of salt which I thought was interesting as well normally a good amount of salt and a baked good is going to give it that buttery nice flavor even a pinch of salt in your oatmeal in the morning will really make it taste creamier and have kind of a richer flavor so I love salt but using a whole teaspoon I was like ooh interesting this way more than the other recipes I saw so I'm interested to see what that's going to taste like then you just mix all of this together until it's well combined and stir in the chocolate chips I've been using the thrive market vegan chocolate chips for a couple of years now if you watch my videos because they're really nice and creamy sometimes chocolate chips can be kind of chalky especially if they're dark chocolate and these are vegan and they're organic and I think they're really nice and melty so that is what I put into the mixture I scooped this with a tablespoon scooper and then I put them in the oven for it said 13 to 14 minutes actually my oven worked better with about 12 to 13 minutes every oven is a little bit different so you can adjust it as you need this recipe makes 36 cookies so you get three dozen which is a really nice amount if you're gonna make cookies might as well make a bunch of them and you can actually freeze the dough as well which I liked at the recipe included some freezing directions they spread out a little bit but not too much and that's what they look like oh that's really good this does not taste like coconut oil though which is the main thing I was looking for because honestly I don't love the taste of coconut oil and baked desserts of any kind I just feel like it's always kind of lingering in the background and I think the reason it doesn't taste like coconut oil is because I used refined coconut oil as opposed to virgin which is a much more mild flavor and also there is a perfect amount of salt in this cookie which really gives it a butteriness and a richness I'm shocked that you can't taste the apple sauce or the coconut oil but I'm like pleasantly shocked so thousand they're very good cookie this next one I was so excited to try because I actually watched a YouTube video from food fifty-two where they called this oven Lee secretly vegan cookie a genius recipe and it's because it's from a bakery that's actually not a vegan bakery but this happens to be their best-selling cookie and it just also happens to be vegan so what you're gonna do here is mix together flour baking powder baking soda and salt and whisk this together in a bowl and then something that's also kind of different about this recipe is you actually mix the chocolate chips in with the flour and lightly coat them and I'm assuming this is because you kind of coat each chocolate chip with the flour and it helps it not clump together in the cookie I don't know if that's true but I've never done this with a cookie recipe so I thought that was kind of unique so for the wet ingredients you're going to mix together white sugar and light brown sugar and with the light brown sugar you want to make sure that it's packed tightly into the measuring cup and then you also add canola oil and water and this is really interesting because this is what's replacing the butter and eggs that's traditionally in a cookie recipe and I thought it was cool in the video because they explained that butter and eggs are essentially water and fat so you can replace the water in fat with a plant-based source like a canola oil and water and this will have a very similar effect on the overall product so I thought that was a really interesting way of thinking about it and I also found a really nice canola oil on thrive market this is a non-gmo organic canola oil so I added that the recipe says to mix this part for two minutes which actually felt like a really long time I was doing it but apparently it's a very important step so I mix this together and I think it's because you want to break down the sugar as much as possible before adding the dry ingredients one of the main reasons I wanted to try this recipe is because they believe in a technique called rehydrating the flour so instead of scooping this and baking it right away you actually have to let the dough sit in the refrigerator for a full day for 24 hours and this apparently rehydrates the flour and creates a really amazing texture in the cookie this is not something I've ever done before with a cookie recipe so I was intrigued so I scooped out the chilled cookie dough that's been resting for 24 hours onto a baking sheet I did find that it was very crumbly and I was a little worried about that but it said to use an ice cream scoop and to make sure that they had some space in between so I did that and then the next kind of weird thing about this recipe is that you still don't make these cookie dough balls yet you actually put them in the freezer for 10 minutes so I was like what on earth is this gonna be like how different could a cookie be by doing all these extra little steps but they're super easy I mean you just put the dough in the fridge it's not like extra work I was just intrigued so anyway you put these into the freezer for 10 minutes and then you sprinkle on some sea salt and bake them for about 12 minutes and this is what they look like when they come out of the oven oh my gosh they were beautiful they only spread out a little bit and some of them the ones that were really crumbly that I didn't put back together actually did look a little bit strange and misshapen but the ones that I scooped and then kind of lightly pressed together ended up looking like this which I thought was beautiful these were really thick really big cookies they look like something you'd get at a fancy bakery and that little sprinkle of sea salt is just a really pretty touch on top this is beautiful it reminds me a lot of the big massive cookies that you get at a bakery when I lived in New York there are so many bakeries that would have these kind of epic chocolate chip cookies that have almost like this like crispy crust on the outside that almost encapsulate s' like cookie dough like soft cookie dough it's a completely different type of Wiki than anything I've ever been able to make at home normally if I end up with like kind of a dome-shaped cookie at home it's because I did something wrong with the recipe and it's kind of like cake like and a little hard and kind of dense and not that delicious but this is not that oh my god Wow I cannot believe I made this that was one of the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had period and I've had a lot of chocolate chip cookies to be on Wow are we recording what was that you what did he just think I said it seriously Nicole those are the best cookies really ever you really like them yeah perfect amount of salt fluffy a little doughy yeah and what was most interesting besides actual cookie itself because that was very pleasurable but the process was very very interesting I learned a lot here and apparently the same technique can be used for any cookie recipe that you already love so the idea of rehydrating the flour by letting the cookie dough sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours that was something I've never heard of before I've never tried but apparently that's what really creates that perfect texture on the inside and in watching the video that goes along with this recipe they said that any cookie recipe will benefit from sitting in the refrigerator for 24 hours so if you already have a cookie recipe at home that you know you love and you know turns out well they said that you can still put that recipe in the fridge and then bake it the next day and they said that it will only benefit from that resting time in the fridge but what I did really want to do is test it with the sweet simple vegan recipe because I already knew I liked that cookie but they're very different in texture and in flavor so I thought I would give this theory a shot with the other cookies and see what happened so here is the sweet simple vegan cookie that I made the day of and here is the sweet simple vegan cookie that I refrigerated overnight same exact recipe but actually this one was refrigerated now granted it's a little bit larger but you can see the difference in texture and even in color it was really really interesting this is the one that I refrigerated and frozen minutes before baking and you can see that there is a little bit of a difference between all three of these cookies I would say there's not a huge difference between the one that I refrigerated for 24 hours and the one that I refrigerated and then froze for 10 minutes I would say you could probably skip that step but definitely refrigerating for 24 hours changed this into a completely different cookie and actually my sister couldn't even believe that I made these they were so good Wow this is you know so I loved the cookie recipe before this is the original one where you just kind of make it all in one bowl you scoop it out and you bake it but really you'll see a huge difference in texture and even in the feel when you pick it up and touch it so different so here's the texture if you bake it right away and here is a texture on the bottom if you let it sit overnight so I'm definitely going to be doing this with all of my cookie recipes from now on it makes a really big difference the last recipe I wanted to try looked so good on Pinterest so this was a vegan double chocolate cookie recipe by Liv B who is someone else that I just think is super talented and all her recipes look so good so I was excited to try this one and for this you're just gonna mix together flour cacao powder baking powder and salt and you just mix this together in a bowl and then another reason I wanted to try this recipe is because it's the only one that uses vegan butter so you add some softened vegan butter to a mixing bowl along with some sugar and you cream this together now you can do this with an electric mixer and it would go faster but I did it with a wooden spoon and this is a little trick that I remember learning from my grandma when we would make cookies together is that once it's at this point you might think that you can stop because the butter and sugar are mixed together but actually this is where you need to put in the work and the final outcome will be so much better for it so you're going to keep creaming the butter and sugar together kind of pressing the wooden spoon up against the side of the bowl until it's really soft and fluffy and you have kind of a soft smooth dough like I have here that's when you can move on and add the rest of the ingredients so this recipe actually called for some plants milk so almond or soy milk and vanilla extract and was really interested to see how adding a vegan milk would change the cookie because normally I think of adding milk to something like a muffin or a cake recipe so I was interested to see if it was going to change the texture of the cookies in any way so you mix that together add the dry ingredients and then add your chocolate chips something that was different about this recipe was that you actually roll it into balls instead of scooping it so I just did that and then baked these they only have to bake for nine minutes which I also really liked and when they came out they looked like this I love that she only has you cook these for nine minutes in the oven because they stayed really really soft and kind of pillowy which I thought was nice they do spread out a lot they definitely spread out more than some of the other cookies that we made in this video and I will say that I needed a little bit of space a little more space between each cookie on the pan because they spread out but they have this kind of pillowy soft texture and this crackling outside with the gooey a little bit cakey inside and they turned out really really well and this was a super fast and easy recipe Wow I'm very impressed I thought there was gonna be one that didn't really work out one that I didn't like as much but honestly these are all so good and this one isn't too rich sometimes a double chocolate cookie is like chocolate overload and even though that doesn't seem like it's possible you know what I mean when it's just too intense and rich this still tastes like a chocolate chip cookie but it just tastes like a chocolate chocolate cookies if that makes sense it still has that brown sugar flavor you still get the vanilla and some of the saltiness kind of balance out the sweetness so it tastes like a chocolate chip cookie but just with extra chocolate so I really like this it's like a little bit brownie like and the texture and I think that's because of the plant milk which is why I wanted to try this recipe in particular the plant milk I thought would make it a little more cakey and I think I was right I think that's what makes this just so fudgy and cakey this one has the most visibly interesting texture I think because it has that crackling outside and then you can kind of see that really chewy fudgy cookie on the inside and these in particular smelled like absolute heaven while they were baking so that was very enjoyable as well all of them are really delicious but I do think there was a clear winner I think the oven Li cookie is just next-level I'm impressed that I was able to make it at home because honestly making a cookie like that like I said it's a that's a gourmet cookie that you would get at a very fancy bake shop that you can make at home so that one was great one thing that I learned from making these cookies also is that you can easily refrigerate or freeze cookie dough I love the idea that you're making cookies and you can make some for now freeze the rest and that way in the future you have really quick and easy options for a dessert or if you're going to a party or a movie night or whatever occasion calls for a cookie I think it's I think there's just something really cozy and homey about having prepared food in your fridge and freezer and this is definitely something that I'm excited that I now have in my freezer I have all three of these recipes in my freezer so I'm good on cookies for a while I'm really glad I did this experiment I learned a lot about baking and a lot of tips and tricks along the way I hope you guys found this helpful and interesting if you're gonna make any of these recipes make sure you check out the description box below I will put all the links and all the information you need there as well as a thrive market code because honestly that is an excellent place to get really high quality ingredients you can get organic flour you can get great vanilla extract you can get vegan chocolate chips I think vegan chocolate chips can sometimes be a

it's everything you want in a cookie. everybody has a\nchocolate-chip cookie recipe that they love and adore and claim as the best\never. today I am here to show you my\nlife-changing brown butter chocolate chip cookies. I'm partnering up with\nKitchenAid using their awesome stand mixer -- something that has always been\nin my life for years and years my grandma had one my mom had one. so let's\nget started and do it up. first step to this recipe is to brown the butter so\nyou're gonna take a pan and put it over a medium heat. we're gonna add in two\nsticks of butter. the first thing you're gonna notice when you melt the butter is\nthat it's going to crackle it'll be nice and loud and you want to stir\nconsistently during this process because what's happening is the milk solids are\nfalling to the bottom of the pan and that's what is caramelizing and causing\nthat nice, really nutty flavor. next you'll notice that the butter will start\nto foam along the edges and so this is when the browning of the butter is\nactually happening and where you have to keep a really really close eye on it. so\nas soon as you see the butter start to turn that nice amber color you want to\nimmediately turn off the heat, take your pan off of it, and then you can either\ntransfer it to a bowl or you can just set it aside on a different burner to\nallow it to cool. so we're gonna let this cool for at least 15 minutes. you\nwant to make sure you scrape all of those delicious brown butter bits off\nthe bottom of the pan. our brown butter has been cooling and it's ready to go so\nthe first thing that you want to do is add the brown butter to the stand mixer.\nnext we're gonna add in our dark brown sugar so I like to use dark brown sugar\nand my cookie recipes because it just adds a nice molasses flavor there's a\nlittle more molasses in dark brown vs. light\nbrown so I highly recommend using this in this recipe we've got a little bit of\nregular sugar. so here we've got an egg and an egg yolk we're not using two eggs\nwe're using one egg and one egg yolk and make sure they're at room temperature. if\nthey're not they will hurt in the butter and that's not something that we want in\nthis cookie recipe. we're gonna use this flat beater from KitchenAid which is\nawesome for mixing cookies. now I don't know if you guys know this but\nKitchenAid also makes like ten different attachments it's not just for baking\nthey've got everything from making spiralized pasta with vegetables to\nactually using a sifter attachment it's really really awesome. so we're gonna\nplace this on a medium-low speed until it's nice and well combined, smooth and\ncreamy. next we're gonna add in our vanilla and then yet another secret to\nthis recipe is using Greek yogurt. you could use sour cream or Greek yogurt it\ndoesn't really matter but what's important is that it adds a nice\nmoisture to the cookie and contributes to that beautiful crackly top the cookies will have when they come out of the oven. mix again. next we're gonna add\nour flour mixture so I'm gonna add some baking soda and salt to the flour then\nI'm just gonna give it a little whisk so that it's well combined. we're gonna add\nhalf of our flour and then give it a mix and then we'll add the other half. it's outstanding! you can bake these as\nis and they would be perfect but what is life without chocolate? today we're using\ntwo types of chocolate chips which I think is essential to creating depth in\na chocolate chip cookie flavor so we're using semi-sweet and milk chocolate but\nyou could also use semi-sweet chocolate and dark chocolate if that is your preference. look at this glorious cookie dough you guys. I'm smelling it it smells incredible I cannot wait to\ndig in why it's so important to chill your\ndough for at least two hours is because the butter will start to solidify and\nalso absorb some of the sugar which will help to create nice crispy edges and a\nchewy middle that is truly unforgettable. the dough is done chilling and we're\nready to roll these into balls, place them, and bake them. we're gonna bake\nthese for 9 to 11 minutes until they just start to get golden brown\nalong the edges. it is very very important to not over bake these because\nwe want a chewy cookie not a crispy cookie. because I didn't want to bake all\nof the cookies right away I am gonna freeze some for later so I rolled these\ninto nice cookie dough balls I'm gonna place them in a reusable bag and then\njust stick them in my freezer for up to three months. once I'm ready to bake them\nI'm just gonna place them on a cookie sheet and put them in the oven as I\nwould with the normal batch of cookies and just as a reminder they may take a\nfew more minutes to bake in the oven so just be careful and watch them as they\ngo. so this is what I mean by just a little bit of golden brown along the\nedges they look a little bit underdone and that's how we want them. so we're\ngonna wait for these to cool and then give them a sprinkle of sea salt because\nI love sweet and salty. I hope you guys have loved learning about my famous\nlife-changing brown butter chocolate chip cookie recipe I first made this\nrecipe seven years ago when I was trying to perfect the best chocolate chip cookie\nrecipe I used my KitchenAid mixer back then and I'm super happy to still\ncontinue to be using it today so let's dig into these bad boys. so good!\nso good. go grab the recipe on the blog and let me know below if you've ever made\nthese before and be sure to use the hashtag #ambitiouskitchen on Instagram\nso I can see all of your creations.", "EYYMXVO3e-k": "Taryn Varricchio: No\ndessert is more classic than a deliciously gooey\nchocolate chip cookie. And that's why people love\nBang Cookies in New Jersey. Customer: The best way\nto describe it is, like, those cookies that you used\nto have in the cafeteria that are really ooey and gooey, but, like, it's cooked more. They're better than those. Taryn: Three years ago,\nBang Cookies was selling a few hundred cookies a\nday at farmers markets. George Kuan: We sold\nout in the first hour, and we didn't expect that. Ever since then, we've sold out first day, and then we kept on selling out every single day at the farmers market. Taryn: Now, George's team bakes more than 20,000 cookies a month with a recipe he spent\n15 years fine-tuning. George and his team source ingredients from all over the world. Whether it's grass-fed\nbutter from New Zealand, chocolate chunks from Europe, or macadamia nuts from Hawaii, each one affects the way\nthese cookies bake and taste. The shop's best seller is\nits most classic rendition: the sea salt chocolate chunk cookie. This recipe uses a mix\nof white and brown sugar, locally milled organic flour, grass-fed butter, and both milk and\nsemisweet dark chocolate. George: Different chocolates\ngives it different nuance of flavors. So it gives it more complexity. So, it kind of counterbalances\nthe difference between the sweetness of the actual milk chocolate versus the semi-bitterness\nof semisweet chocolate chunk. Taryn: Each cookie is\ntopped with a sprinkle of sea salt, because... George: When it hits your\nmouth, it hits it in a way that you're biting into the cookie, and then you're tasting the sweetness and the saltiness in combination. Taryn: Another popular\npick off the menu... Customer: We love the s'mores. Customer: The s'mores,\nI really love that one. Customer: I know they do a\ns'mores cookie really well. It's, like, nice and gooey\nbut with a crunchy outside. Taryn: This one's notably\nmore time consuming to make than the rest. George: Every single\ns'mores cookie that we do has to be pieced together\nwith broken graham crackers that we break by hand and\nthen manually put it in. Taryn: Finally, each\ncookie is individually packaged in plastic so customers can see exactly what's put on the inside. It also keeps them fresh and soft. Customer: I feel like\nit's gooey, it's big. I can taste that it's organic. It's, like, good ingredients. Taryn: Bang Cookies didn't\ninitially attract customers for cookies, but rather the\nname of the shop itself. George: We wanted a\nname that would be able to draw attention because we didn't have, like, the marketing funds at all. And we wanted something that's outlandish, 'cause we're the new players\nin the farmers market. So we started to call\nourselves Bang Me Bakery in the very beginning. A lot of customers would look over like, is that a real name? Like, yeah, it is. Just\ntry the cookies now. And they did. Taryn: The name changed to\nbe a bit more kid-friendly, but the customers kept coming. Customer: 4:10! [laughs] 'Cause Jessica at the pizza shop said we have to try them, that they are so awesome. And plus to please get her a T-shirt. Taryn: And with so much demand, Bang Cookies has already opened two locations in Jersey City. And they've got plans for more to come. That means more cookies for\ncustomers across the country, who've already had them shipped to states like California, Alaska, and Hawaii. That is heavenly. That chocolate is so melty. It's so deliciously melted. You're not getting hit over\nthe head with sweetness, because you kind of have\nthose two chocolates that balance each other out. And then you have the\nsavory-sweet component in every bite, which is great. That's why I think the\nsea salt chocolate chunk is probably one of their\nbest-selling cookies. It has great texture. Like, the outer edges are just\nso lightly nicely crisped. And that, like, chewy, gooey inside, that still holds up. Like, it's not falling apart in my hand. Sometimes you get these\ngiant, massive cookies and they could have that,\nlike, dip in the middle where you know it's been undercooked, but this is not like that. Customer: I have a cheat day once a week, and every Tuesday I have\nto have Bang Cookies. We always have it in the\nfreezer. They're amazing. They're so good. They're\none of my favorites. Customer: I would say at\nleast, like, once every month we make it a thing to, like, we definitely need to get it. Taryn: That was such a good cookie.

call mo I mean she just has to see these cookies Emma what's up have you seen these cookies that are all over Instagram they're like the ones from New York and there's even the ones from Orlando they look insane yeah I've been wanting to renew your cookie oh my gosh you totally should do the New York ones I'll do the ones from Orlando what do you make cookies what you didn't know how to bake cookies Marc you have not been watching my channel ever thanks for this recipe right here for these chocolate chip cookies I'm making the Gideons bakery inspired chocolate chip cookie take a look I'll leave a link in the description below for their Instagram make sure after this video you head over to Emma's goodies to see her levain bakery inspired chocolate chip cookies leave a comment on Emma's channel that you came from saw stash and make sure you click the subscribe button on her channel so let's make these Gideon's bakery inspired cookies Wow are they gonna be wildly good so for this chocolate chip cookie recipe that I'm gonna kind of modify into Gideon style all you need is one stick of room-temperature butter 2/3 cup of brown sugar 3 tablespoons of white sugar 1 room-temperature egg one and a half cups flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda quarter teaspoon salt a lot of chocolate chips and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla so the first thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna have to cream together our butter and sugars I'm gonna do it in a stand mixer because I've gotten complaints about my butter sugar creaming before but you can definitely do it in a bowl with a spoon so the cream that we're gonna start with the room-temperature butter I'm just gonna stir this real quick then we're gonna add our sugars and then stir together until the sugar is incorporated into the butter it should be a buttery airy kind of mixture I'm gonna add the egg I'm gonna give that a quick mix then at this point I'm gonna take the mixing bowl off the stand mixer and we're gonna sift in our dry ingredients so here's our flour baking soda and salt I think you're supposed to add but now I'm gonna add the vanilla down in there and then I'm gonna sift these guys together I love the way that looks you know it's like a snow tree here I don't know where I get snow and snow and flour and and then we're just gonna mix this guy together and this should be some cookie dough hopefully if I follow the instructions right we have to add in our chocolate chips I have about a cup of chocolate chips instead dump these guys in here and we're gonna mix them in now I think normally you would probably want to add a little bit more chocolate chips but we're gonna be adding a ton of chocolate chips to the top of this thing I mean that looks like a chocolate chip cookie dough okay so now at this point all we have to do is form these things into pre large balls Gideon's cookies are big they say they weigh about a quarter pound each so that's what we're gonna do so I'm watching a ton of videos on these things and they make big cookies at gideon's they're about the size of their palm I mean I'm sure Emma gave me this recipe is for about a dozen regular-sized cookies so I wanna make sure I can get probably at least six which is exactly what this recipe worked out the base okay so at this point we're gonna drop these in the refrigerator and let them set for at least an hour okay okay these are have been in the fridge for about an hour they're nice and firm now the next step to making these Gideon's cookies is we're gonna press these things in chocolate chip so these cookies are pretty firm I'm gonna press down into the chocolate chips and just make sure they're completely coated and I saw when they did gideon's I me got to push pretty hard to make sure they're in there I know a gideon's they are not messing around these things are loaded so I am pretty happy with that you got them pressed in there pretty good that's just so crazy so if you do decide to make these you are literally gonna be using more chocolate chips for a cookie than you've ever used before and the only thing that's not getting chocolate chips is the bottom let's throw these in the oven I have my oven preheated for 350 degrees we're gonna bake these for about 20 minutes let's see what happens okay this is it these things look in red about incredible so I actually lost one I baked off a test one just to see how it go didn't go that good so this is the final five so with gideon's they always top theirs with a little bit of salt so we're gonna do the same thing they use sea salt I'm gonna do kosher salt cuz that's just what I have these things look incredible just incredible go ahead and pop one open I mean just your chocolate goodness perfect cookie baked all the way through I mean just amazing gonna give it a bite mmm this is wonderful oh this is wonderful the salted chocolate is unbelievable our taking a Hoover these cookies Emma your recipe is insane oh my god I want to thank Emma's goodies for doing the collaboration with me helping me make these cookies because these are crazy good mind blowing head over to Emma's goodies channel right now to watch her take on the LA veins bakery in New York her cookie which is it's gonna be an incredible cookie it really is", "SDF7UahsaaI": "[MUSIC PLAYING] -Hi. Welcome to \"Homemade Healthy.\" My name is Lisa. Today we're going to be\nmaking chocolate chip cookies with almond flour. And we're also going\nto add some walnuts. It's going to be amazing. These cookies are easy. There's not a whole lot\nof different ingredients. The main ingredient\nis almond flour. And in a previous\nbiscuit video, I did show you this Honeyville\nblanched almond flour. You can get it on Amazon\nor at honeyville.com. So what we're going\nto do first is we're going to mix all of\nour dry ingredients together, and then we're going to\nmix our wet ingredients. Now, parchment\npaper is your friend when you are doing any\nkind of low-carb cooking. So make sure you\nline your baking sheet with parchment\npaper first. We preheated the oven to 350. The cookies are going to\ncook about 10 to 12 minutes. Keep an eye on them. First of all, we've got two and\na half cups of almond flour. To that we're going to\nadd a teaspoon of baking powder and a couple of\nturns of the sea salt. And Stevia. Let me talk to you a\nminute about Stevia. This is a great sweeter,\nbecause it's natural. Splendas and erythritols and all\nthose are not natural sugars. So this is going to\nbe the best choice. If you're used to regular\nsugar, you're used to honey, you're used to Splenda, this\nisn't going to taste as sweet, it's going to be very different. So once your pallet's\nadjusted and you're off all carbohydrates\nand all sweeteners, this will be delicious. So I'm going to use a quarter\nteaspoon of the Kal Stevia. And I use like a heaping\nquarter teaspoon. And that's just going to go\nin here in our almond flour. And I can tell you, my\n10-year-old loves sweets, and I made brownies with the\nStevia, and she loved them. So pallets can get adjusted. So what we're going\nto do is get a fork and just mix that well together. OK. I have a half a cup\nof melted butter. And I use Kerrygold, because\nit's from grass-fed cows. It's the best for you. You can get it at Trader\nJoe's, local grocery stores. We're also going to do vanilla. We need a full\ntablespoon of vanilla. And two eggs. We use cage-free eggs. And the cage-free eggs are\na little bit more expensive, but the benefit is worth\na little extra cost. OK. Now we're just going to beat\nall this together real quick. And then we're going to\nmix our wet ingredients with our dry ingredients. And once you get the dough\nall mixed, you can taste it. If it's not sweet\nenough for you, add a little bit more Stevia\nand get it to your liking. So we're just going to\nmix this all together. Once we get this\nall incorporated, we're going to add our walnuts,\nwhich I've chopped half a cup, and our chocolate. I use anything between a 60%\nand a 100% dark chocolate. This is actually the 60%\ndark chocolate chips. And I only use like half a cup. You can add as\nmuch as you'd like. And I chop them into smaller\npieces, because they're so big. When you make the cookie,\nit's almost overwhelming. All right. Now we're going to add our\nwalnuts and our chocolate. And it looks just like\nreal cookie dough. Yum. Now, you can put\nthis in the fridge and let it harden a little\nbit to form your cookies, or you can cook\nthem just like this. So let's take-- there we go. And you can make them\nwhatever size you like. They're going to hold\ntheir shape pretty good. So whatever size and\nshape you make them, that's what they'll\nbake out to be. They don't spread a\nlot like your average, normal cookie does. But these are so fast to pull\ntogether, and they're great. The kids love them. You could use this in\nyour muffin top pan and spread them out into that. And then get some\nwhipping cream and whip it and take two of the cookies with\nwhipped cream in the middle. Oh, delicious. All right. A couple more, and we'll\nthrow them in the oven. Like I said, it's going\nto be 10 to 12 minutes. Keep an eye on them. You want to take\nthem out-- well, it depends on how you\nlike your cookies. I like mine chewy and\nsoft, so I take mine out when the perimeter\nis just starting to get like light brown or tan. Oh, wonderful. If you cook them\na little longer, they end up a little bit\ncrumbly and not quite as good. So we're going to put\nthem in the oven on 350. Set the timer. 10 minutes. I'll probably\ncheck on them at 8. And we'll see you\nwhen they come out. OK, the cookies are about\nready to come out of the oven. I ended up having to\nput them in about 1 more minute, so 11 minutes. It all depends on your oven. And they're ready. Oh, delicious. Ta-dah. Now it's time to try\nthese delicious cookies. I've put them on a plate. They're going to be so good. I will tell you they're\nthe best when they first come out of the oven. You can store them in\nan airtight container in the refrigerator and heat\nthem up in the toaster oven, and they get their crunch back. But they will soften\nup as you store them. Here we go. Mm, so good. The chocolate's nice and dark. They're not overly sweet, but\nthey're a little bit sweet. Delicious. You're going to love these. And if you don't like nuts,\ndon't put the nuts in them. Walnuts are just\nreally good for you, so that's why we choose\nto do ours with nuts. Thanks again for watching. Keep your eye out for my next\nepisode of \"Homemade Healthy.\" Have a great night.", "P1gqm9CG8sw": "it's our last day here in New York and Gemma has sent me back uptown to levan bakery to get her one last cookie before we go home and it's such a shame that you can only get these in New York because they are absolutely amazing so I thought that maybe when we get back to London we could get the CNT gang together put our heads together and kind of come up with our take on the levant cookie welcome back to France and doilies now Gemma is still off I'm afraid she's at home resting up thank you for all your messages they're really cheering her up and hopefully she'll be back with you guys soon but Dana and I are here on our day off at the bakery because we are both craving those levan style cookies from New York and so we have been here all morning experimenting with all different types of recipes to come up with what we think is the best replica and we're going to share that with you but why don't you come over here and see what we've been up to you this morning now like I said we have been up for hours coming up with hopefully what we've perfected the levan style cooking we're looking for a really chewy soft Center and the chocolate chips that kind of melted inside a little bit half-baked and that is exactly how the cookies work from the back yeah and my favorite bit was that the outside was still kind of crispy but then the inside was like doing so kind of half-baked and gooey and delicious it's not been as easy as we thought like all kinda principally I mean if we look at this one for example this looks just like you I mean it's so delicious video it's huge that's not what they look like in New York I mean if we break it open you can see it's just kind of I mean it's just too thin yeah so that one is out the window I'm afraid and then your this one here as one is kind of the shape that we want so it's nice and thick and that when we break it open it's really so the chocolate chips are kind of melted but when you eat it the texture is a little bit cakey and it's not that kind of half-baked gooeyness so we've kind of come up with this one was the closest we got to it and it's nice and light in color it's gooey on the inside it's got a nice crispy shell and there's a few tweaks we've made to it and now we think we've got it so why don't you come with us and we're gonna show you our recipe so first I'm going to talk to you about our kind of additions and we're gonna do the walnut and milk chocolate version of the cookie we've found that walnuts have a really strong bitter taste and actually when we were eating the levan cookies you couldn't really taste the walnuts it with more adding a buttery crunchy texture to it so we need to get the skins off these walnut and that can be really kind of Fafi because they're kind of funny shapes and the skins all over them and it takes a long time to do it by hand so what I've done is I've popped a whole tray of walnuts in the oven for about five minutes and I'm now gonna put them into a tea towel and rub off the skin so what I'm doing is just kind of rubbing the nuts between each other and the tea towel and that is just gonna help pull off the skin as you can see when we open it now this nut has got completely skin which is exactly how we want it so we're gonna use 100 grams of these nice skinned walnuts along with 400 grams of the milk chocolate you can use whatever chocolate you like but because it's a lot of chocolate dark taupe it can be pretty overpowering at the best of times and 400 grams of it is going to be like intense so that's why we're going for 400 grams of milk chocolate okay so now it's time to start making our cookie dough yeah so we've got 250 grams of cold butter and it's really important especially that the butter is super cold and affect the overall texture at the end okay let's go inside and then we're just gonna yeah put this on the mixer and we're just gonna break it up a little bit so maybe like 30 seconds who's like then said we don't want to over beat it anything yeah it looks good it's kind of broken up a little bit but it's not super cream yes what we don't okay cool so next we're gonna add we've got two types of string I've got caster sugar and soft light brown sugar 160 grams of each they're going straight into the bowl and that's gonna go back on for about kind of 30 to 45 seconds yeah in the bowl you'll see that the sugar in the butter have kind of form a little nuggets which is kind of what we want so this is where everything goes a little bit strange normally at this stage I'm making cookies or cakes or something you'd add your eggs but we're not gonna do that we don't want to find anything we don't want to with anything so we're gonna go in with our chocolate and our walnuts yep and I think I'd be fair to say at this stage you could if you don't have a family to like this one you can just do it by hand because we're not trying to whip anything or cream anything we just literally want to combine them together okay so that's just combined again to bring it all together not to wit anything and now we're gonna put our dry ingredients in yeah so in this bar I've got 200 grams of self-raising flour 300 grams of plain flour 1/4 teaspoon of salt quarter teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and 2 teaspoons of baking powder if you didn't catch all that all the ingredients are in the description box but they okay I caught it and we're gonna tip all of that in again just combine it so that's had only again about 30 seconds yeah if you come a bit closer you can see that this is just that really fine powdery breadcrumbs and that is exactly what we want and then once we add that egg into it it will kind of bring it together and combine it a little bit to give that chewy dense it's not too cakey or creamy texture that we're really looking okay so we've got two large eggs in here oh my goodness and we've already whisked it out because we really don't want to beat this for long at all so we've already done a part of the job by whisking it together when I've dumped all of this into the mixture turn it on and combine it all okay that is the cookie dough made and we just mixed it and it all kind of came together as one big joke yeah and it's kind of clean the sides of the bowl because it's a really thick paste it's not quite it's already wet and we're going to weigh out our cookie so it will nice and even and we're gonna go for a hundred and twenty-five grams we tried all sorts of different sizes and 125 seems like a good quantity of cookie and then we're just gonna take it and push it together a little bit like this but we're not rolling it into a ball and I think this is gonna make about 12 cookies and then the sad news is that they do have to freeze for about 90 minutes so we're gonna bake them straight from the freezer but do not fear we've been here a day and we have a perfect waiting in the freezer for us yeah I'm not spread about this is that you just leave them in the freezer if we don't gonna make all of them straight away from this bake them from frozen because that's what we're gonna do right now yes so you've always got cookies in your freezer [Laughter] [Music] okay that is our last cookie we've got 12 even cookies here Jane's gonna get those wrapped in cling film and tried in the freezer and we've got up and set to 180 degrees C with a fan and that's hotter than normal because we want to get that nice crispy outside shell that keep them gooey in the middle and we've also got a baking sheet in there heat C which is a tip we kind of found out through trial and error and it's really great because that's hot so it's gonna get the bore of your cookies nice and crispy as well so our oven has got to temperature the baking tray is really really hot so I'm gonna pull this out really carefully and Danes gonna flop on six cookies really well spaced out because they will spread that with me you don't want to end up with cookies they're also stuck together okay and then they're gonna go in for 17 minutes and the outside will be a little bit golden and the inside will be nice and gooey [Music] they're out with the other men and they've cooled down for about five minutes yet just sort of let them get the heat off but they're still nice and one which is the best way too young and they've gone nice and golden and they're still kept their nice chunky shape and the bottom of them is nice and cooked and golden too and that's because we put them on the hot and baking sheet that was already in the oven yeah so stick it let's dig it okay let's see what they look like inside today three two one oh good they are just the half baked gooey goodness inside that we are looking for and they've still got that crispy shell on the outside juicy crunch and then the goo exactly and if you make these be sure to Instagram them and use the hashtag cupcake Gemma so we can see all of your posts absolutely and if you're wondering what to buy yourself or as someone else for Christmas don't forget that we have all our lovely puppy p.m.

she'll get some of these maybe I mean we might eat these ones yeah I hope we have to eat every day okay [Laughter] [Music]", "TPcRbti4-6g": "hello everyone welcome back today we're gonna be doing some chocolate-chip cookies and if you guys follow the directions right you're gonna be rewarded because these are like really really really yummy soft chewy chocolate chip cookies everything you're gonna want in a cookie and I promise you I promise you if you do these cookies right I I'm expecting to hear like oh my god these are some good cookies but no seriously guys I'm um being I'm being really serious these are outstanding chocolate chip cookies and they're huge cuz I like to make big cookies so let's go ahead and get started you're gonna be needing some chocolate chips I like to use the Grande chips but a cup of them this thing it's the grand chocolate chips that Ghirardelli I love Ghirardelli I use a cup of these and then a cup of their regular Ghirardelli chocolate chips just a regular sized ones but you'll be needing two cups of semi-sweet chips you can use regular if that's all you have but I'm a chocoholic so I like these ones here and they are good it's good quality chocolate okay but meanwhile I'm gonna go ahead and get two sticks of butter has to be real butter in these because we don't want these spreading out a whole lot and if you're going to be using margarine that that has quite a bit of oil in it make sure cookie spread more and we don't want that so please use the real butter with this okay let me get my spoon I seem to always forget a spoon here where my big spoons at well we're gonna go on with a regular tablespoon here okay I got it get my sugar we're gonna be using regular granulated then we're gonna be using some brown sugar Wow so you gonna let me get those out here all right I just was not prepared I haven't changed up my brown sugar container so I'm gonna scoop it out of the bag but you want it cup of lightly packed you don't want to pack it tightly just lightly packed one cup of brown sugar you're going to be needing a half a cup of white sugar half a cup of white okay and what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna put a cap full of some canola oil goodkat full in there and use the rest of it oh just your regular ol cap good tablespoon or so of some canola oil or vegetable easier one will work and I'm gonna cream this I'm gonna get this together cream if you have your mixture go ahead and crank it all out but I don't like those like I said they're too bulky I'd rather just do it by hand but I'm gonna beat this up maybe a minute or two and we'll be back all right how I beat that up for maybe a minute just until it's nice and fluffy about a minute and do make sure your butter is at room temperature and your eggs that way them eggs work in there better so we're gonna do two eggs and to that I'm gonna add in a tablespoon of vanilla okay we'll just get this all mixed in just until these eggs are mixed in here you want them mixed in there good and that should do it now on top of this get this stuff out of the way here on top of this I'm gonna be adding in let me get my flour I'm gonna be adding to this three cups of all-purpose flour well actually it's three and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour all together but make sure your flower is fluffed up as I always say you don't want to pack your cup because then your measurements will not be correct and your cook you won't come out right you don't want too much flour but we're gonna add three and a quarter cups right on top here too and there's three and now our quarter cup okay okay out of the way over top of this I'm just gonna drizzle 3/4 teaspoons of salt I'm gonna be adding in 1 and 1/4 teaspoons of baking soda 1 in 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda not baking powder I always say that a lot of people hear baking and then they think baking powder nope baking soda okay so we're gonna go with 1 and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda I'm gonna go with a pretty big tablespoon of cornstarch 1 tablespoon of cornstarch now what this does is keep your cookie nice and tender so it's suggest using it just a pretty good sized tablespoon a little bit more than level all right now I'm just gonna gently steer all my flour in my baking soda and my soul and my cornstarch I'm not really touching the bottom wet mixture I'm just kind of just mixing it here All in One Bowl you don't go too dirty to bowls just slice lightly mix it before you go into the wet on the bottom do you do the best you can this way okay now that's mixed up so now I'm gonna start stirring it up now once I get this mixed up we'll get them chips in there alright let me fix this thing here it looks a little crooked alright I got that fairly well mixed up there's still a little bit of dry there but now I'm gonna add in one cup of regular Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips use your choice of chips this is the regular chips this is one cup of the Grand Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips I love a real chocolate cookie chocolate right I can eat those things by the handful okay now if you have it you can add in a half a cup of chopped walnuts or chopped pecans and I I do that a lot I like to toast my pecans up or my walnuts and then let them cool completely because you don't want to put hot pecans in with this chocolate you'll have a mess but if that's just a suggestion for you off you want to throw yourself some nuts in here of your choice now after this I get it mixed all up I don't want to mess with it too much just get those chips in there and they're all mix through there we're gonna chill this dough it's important don't skip this stuff because you'll have a runny cookie you want to chill your dough at least a good half hour stick it in the freezer it'll go faster that way but at least a half hour you want this chilled so I'm gonna get that in the freezer I'm cheating meeting the dopes I'm gonna get it in the freezer and we'll be back I'm gonna chill it for a half hour so all right I've been chilling my deal now for a half hour so and as you can see that's nice and firm and that's how you want it now like always always make my cookies probably probably quarter cup size I would think at least quarter cup I've done this before because I want to make sure the measurements are right but at least a quarter cup or so that way you guys get the same thing I'm doing here yeah but do about a quarter cup and I'd like to make them in little fat little logs so they'll stand up and there'll be a much thicker cookie instead of a little old thin thing so what I do is just roll it until it's a little log and stand it up you want to stand it up and slightly press it so it sticks to that paper see there how I have it it's more tall looking and that'll give you a thicker cookie but I'm gonna get these on and as I always say ovens vary so you're gonna be doing a quarter cup this is my measurements now if you're gonna do your own measurements you'll have to play with the baking time probably 10 minutes for a good sized tablespoon but um the cookies are gonna be looking underdone do not overbake them just like my other cookies they got a lot of brown sugar in them so they're gonna look like they're underdone but they aren't gonna firm up as they set so don't overcook these guys and we're gonna put them in the middle rack like I always do cuz I don't like a thick crust on the bottom of my cookie so I cook them on the bottom for at least 10 minutes and then I move them to the top very top rack and let them finish cooking there so they'll cook probably 15 to 20 minutes depending on the oven but do put them in the middle rack 10 minutes then move them to the top for the remaining remainder of the baking but I'm gonna get these on here and get them baked up we'll be back okay yo there's the cookies I think I got like 20 of them out of quarter cup scoops that I made I think I've got 20 cookies I ended up cooking mine at 20 minutes exactly like I said keep an eye because all ovens vary on cooking time so there they are like I said 20 minutes quarter cup this is what I used and I'm gonna wrap these individually and some saran wrap they're good for lunches or just a quick snack or they do really well wrapped up or put a few and some little Ziploc bags like I always say they keep your moisture that way they stay a lot more moist in plastic than they do in containers the the plastic bags work really well but let them cool first but anyway I hope you guys enjoy subscribe please didn't like and share it and I appreciate you guys watching until next time you have a wonderful day and we'll see y'all later enjoy the cookies by the way they're delicious", "Krr18aM3WVg": "these are incredibly easy to make you need soft unsalted butter to start off with which you beat together with soft light brown sugar this brings a bit of good the texture along with caramely sweetness I'm using a mixer but a bowl and a wooden spoon would be just fine once the mixture is soft and combined add vanilla paste or extract and then beat in an egg I've got some plain flour ready in a bowl and before I go any further with this I need to add a little salt and bicarb then beat this into the butter and sugar mixture just gently until it coheres when my children was small they'd have eaten most of this batch by now finally fold in some chocolate chips I like very dark teeny chocolate chips for this and the pots I cook these in a small - I hate the word ramekin but it's ramekins I need for these so there it is I'm making six even though I'm feeding four as I've said before I am never knowingly under catered one final touch I smooth the tops with a crank spatula they'll need around 15 minutes in the oven", "RIdBVGLZ_DM": "hey guys on today's episode we're gonna be making six different batches of keto chocolate chip cookies and I'm also gonna include a bonus seventh one I know the struggle of what it's like to spend a lot of money on erythritol trying out a recipe I found online having it failed where I end up having to throw the whole thing away or eat it angrily so have no fear because I am here to burn things for you so if you want to find out which one I burnt and which one I nailed then keep on watching the keto chocolate chip cookie recipes we're gonna be using in this video belong to clean eating with a dirty mind keto Connect fat for weight loss nom nom peace love and low carb and keto and pearls I'm gonna be sharing with you guys the things that stood out and the things that I learned from making each of the recipes and I'll also share how they taste at the end of the video also I want to say thank you to Lily for providing the chocolate chips we're going to be using in this video they're the best chocolate chips to eat on a keto diet because they're sweetened with stevia so sixty chips only have five net carbs so the thing that stood out to me in this recipe was that it had me sift the almond flour it had a used baking chips and baking bars which I didn't really understand the reason for the baking bars until I got to nom noms recipe and I learned the importance of oven rack positioning I learned that it makes a big difference whether you leave it on the top or the bottom and how long you stay how long it stays in there I ended up with a big poufy one and a regular one and yeah that was a very interesting realization the thing that stood out to me in this recipe was that they claimed to be chewy chocolate chip cookies and that made their recipe before and it didn't come out chewy so I was hoping that I could find a redeem it the second time around and it actually came out worse I ended up burning them and it could have been that I didn't use a baking rack for each tray that I had or that I didn't periodically check on them or that I baked them on the lowest rack it could have been all of that but they still didn't come out to eat so the thing that stood out to me in this recipe was that it specifically recommends using grass-fed butter because it helps your body burn fat more properly and cleanly so the second thing that setup to me is that the recipe asked for almond meal as one of the ingredients or so I thought I actually went back on his page to see where I went wrong because yes I went wrong and once I clicked on the affiliate link I saw that it actually linked back to almond flour not almond meal so I guess in Australia there's they're synonymous but your girl used almond meal so that explains a lot why did not look anything close to what he had in the picture which is okay because I already knew that the cookie wasn't gonna come out like it's supposed to because he does specify that the reason of his cookies come out exactly like his is because of the type of sugar he uses and you uses a hundred percent natural erythritol and swerve which is what I'm using likes to cut their sugar with other ingredients so the thing that stood out to me in this recipe was that it uses arrowroot powder which according to nom nom it gives the cookie that extra tenderness and best overall bite I also learned that the golden rule is the cream butter until it's light and fluffy which means ten minutes but I did like seven I also learned that chocolate chips weren't designed to melt completely that's why I adding the chocolate bars will help you get that gooey chocolate chip cookie so the thing that stood out to me in this recipe was that it describes itself as a flourless chocolate chip cookie which I could not understand how that was even possible but apparently it is and I learned that the trick to getting them nice and gooey was to take it out at the ten minute mark so the only thing that stood out to me in this recipe was the amount of chocolate chips you had to use it required one whole bag of at least chocolate that was like half my stash so the last and final bonus recipe isn't actually a recipe it's actually a prepackaged mixed by keto Candy Girl and the theme that stood out to me was the amount of chocolate chips they gave you in the mix they did not skimp out so stay tuned for my husband's review he freakin loves cookies and he's gonna spill the tea on how my cookies tasted leave a comment below with suggestions on what recipes you'd like to see me make in the next video [Music] [Music] so this one the one that we're gonna try this one sceeto connects yes um point as they said it was chewy and I kind of burnt it but this is the first chocolate chip cookie ages definitely not true no no I burned it though it is crumbly I like I like my cookies a little bit more overdone or well done yeah like I'm crispy so I don't mind uh you know HR eNOS if I just like I definitely prefer I guess a crumbly cookie yeah I made these before and I never thought that they were actually chewy though so these are the first chocolate chip cookies I've ever made it's really good though I like the the flavor it tastes good it's definitely chocolate chip taste like with this recipe what stood out was that I had to buy these flaky sea salt and it's so cool and then also on top of it this one also this one asked for arrowroot powder which I've never used before but I really really liked how this one came out cuz they reminded me like a by McDonnell chocolate-chip cookie I mean it looks like I mean that one looks like the most like a Quartermaine like cookie and I know and you had salt to the top of your cookies it tends to bring out a lot of your flavors but this is really good I really like this basalt definitely brings out the chocolate in here there's like nuts in this one too all right this woman I don't know where they came out really brittle but I already knew that they weren't gonna come out like they were supposed to because I didn't use the same sugar he did so I mean despite the very brittleness think what do you think about the overall taste mmm here's my favorite tasting one really oh yeah what my favorite tasting one why I don't know to me this just tastes like a like a homemade cookie that your mom would make like when you and I just want cookies this tastes like a legit homemade cookie this is my favorite one so far so good I actually learned a lot from this recipe I made two different batches from this recipe and when they cooked for 12 minutes and the other line cook for 10 and they made a significant difference in how I came out I almost wasn't gonna make this one but I'm so glad I did because I really liked it it's good I mean it's definitely a lighter cookie feels like it's a little bit more airy this probably would work really well like with milk or something just have it on the side very very like fluffy kind of a chocolate chip I like to do I liked how it came out and it was pretty pretty good-looking a low carb brownie Mesa perfect keto cookie okay so that's what this one and also I did forget to add the water that it needed for the recipes so I don't know that changes are completely compared to how it should have been yeah it definitely tastes like a brownie I feel the brownie lake yeah texture I remember being a chocolate chip cookie but yeah definitely like a brownie cookie I saw I really like how this one looks super deceiving it looks like a regular like chocolate chip cookie doesn't know I don't know there's a taste on the back end throwing me off a little bit come to what it is they're coconut I don't know I don't think so no there's enzyme effect this one they required the whole bag of these chocolate okay so this last one is a bonus one because it's actually a prepackaged mix that I got sent and I wanted to make it with all these other cookies cuz if I could see whether I could just buy this instead of having to make my own cookies wanna see how this came out oh by are good things about it okay yeah how thick it is yeah and I'm more of a crispy cooking person so like the it's not super brittle but you get a little bit of a crunch it's kind of flaky this is a really good cooking did the chocolates come with it already or so you don't have to buy separate out that's pretty cool well even this one if you wanted to take it up a notch I feel like if you added a little bit of salt right on the salt right now so I was like huh really good okay so from all the cookies which cookie did you like yeah hard one the only one is it the salty one is it because right now for sure it's between the last time we tried the prepackaged one and they're both so really good out of all the homemade cookies which one did you like the most homemade cookies just based on how like yeah homemade cookies for me was that top one okay so fat for weight loss the big one the one I said that was yeah yeah the one you thought I messed up but it's actually really good so tastes always that one tasted the best aesthetics and like kind of a little bit more complex flavors kind of like hey I'm gonna have to so there's a little side dessert with noms and yeah the salt tonic it's got a really unique like flavor profile it's not really heavy on the chocolate it's very balanced but the salt doesn't bring out some of those extra like flavors so that's a really nice one I kind of have I just like did a little bit better because I guess it's like a childhood type cooking that it's just it's a straight-up chocolate chip cookie you can have a bowl and not hate yourself okay obviously thought it's Quito candy girls what did you think of hers which one's own that's a prepackaged one yeah it was super good yeah yeah don't sleep on that one that one's so good yeah that's it all the recipes are really good try them out and let me know what Ruthie yeah you", "yC2QScYYJe0": "hi guys I'm shampoo daddy no welcome back to my channel today we're making chocolate chip cookies and it's an eggless recipe so I've been making this recipe since I was 13 so that's 20 years give you my secret but all jokes aside I have made cookies with eggs not eggs every kind of cookie every style of cookie but this one is I think my favorite I love it the most it's the most delicious it's really easy to put together you can make it and store it and yeah I just think that it brings me a lot of happiness and joy so I hope you guys enjoy it [Music] okay let's make these cookies to make these cookies you're going to need first up we're gonna mix our butter with both our sugars and vanilla we're gonna whisk this listen I soft and fluffy the minute this is done I'm gonna add my flour in all of it it's been sifted before and just mix us in very gently now this is the only recipe where I don't add my baking soda with my flour but what I'm gonna do instead is add hot water into my baking soda and pour it into the batter once I mix it in you'll see it coming together like a dough this is what it looks like you want I'm gonna add up chocolate chips you can add milk chocolate white chocolate raisins cranberries anything and just fold it in now ideally you dress this dough overnight but Who am I kidding I'm impatient so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna shape them into these round balls and I'm gonna put them in my freezer for half an hour and then directly into the oven for about 12 minutes at 165 degrees and we're done these cookies are great they taste the best when they're just out of the oven I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe don't forget to Like share and subscribe [Music]", "PMQhCJWCiUk": "these are the cookies that you want with a glass of milk and Saturday morning cartoons I don't know why you're eating cookies on Saturday morning but still that sounds good to me hey guys I'm Brenda but tasty producer and I'm here today I taste two studios and that's because today I will be comparing chocolate-chip cookies homemade versus store-bought so I'm just gonna get my things ready right here and get cooking all right let's get started with the homemade version so I was very lucky because our producer Alvin had already made this recipe and he shared with me his strengths he says that this is the perfect one because it mixes the right amount of white and brown sugar which gives it that chewy but not too chewy texture as the dude from Men's Wearhouse would say you're gonna like the way taste I guarantee you now I'm gonna mix it up basically what you want is to stir these sugars so much that they turn into this caramel looking liquid and that's what we're looking for that's the beauty of homemade you get to add as many chocolate charms as you wish all right so now we're down to Toll House chocolate-chip cookie dough and all this requires is for you or to open up the package and then place the doll on the tray because guess what they even cut the little squares for you and you're ready to bake maybe if you thought that pre-made cookie dough it's already easy you know there's at the top of the top right here because all these really really requires is for you to open up the package pick the prettiest girl in the pack and enjoy I feel like I know which ones homemade but I think I'm gonna have to go with this one it's just a good classic after-school cookie so if I had to choose one of these cookies that's my favorite I'm going homemade it's nice and flat it's perfectly bendy there's just something about this cookie that really these are great totally 100% store-bought but nothing wrong with it because it's chocolate chip and it's cookies these I feel like are the kind of cookies you get it like a bakery or coffee shop which is awesome like these are like the cookies that your mom makes when you're having friends over there like made with that touch of love that TLC perfect chocolate chip cookie perfection my favorite has to be the whole need one it's chocolatey it's soft it melts in your mouth we'll need for the window is I love chips or cookies I just like how crunchy they are all the way through it's like dry and crumbly but in the best way it's chewy but it's not like Joey or undercooked and the chocolate it's like when you pull it you can see the chocolate in it like this is what I want to talk it's pretty clear that it comes down to these two versions right here from scratch and pre-made dough the majority of the people and for the homemade there's so much love and chocolate that went into this that I'm just not surprised at all if you don't have much time then you can just go ahead and grab a couple of squares put them in the oven in 10 minutes later you got beautiful warm chocolate chip cookies I also asked people on Instagram based on looks it would go for Oh me from scratch all you have to do is add 10 more minutes to your schedule and you can go from this which is not bad at all to this which is 50 times better I have to say well that's my opinion and the amount of chocolate this is remedied to all the problems in your life just go through this", "mOhL46sN1y0": "- \u266a

I know flat, crunchy chewy\ncookies are white hot, but I wanted to show off\nthese fluffy chunkers. They are perfect for dipping while sipping on some ice cold whole milk. I love it when after a\nlong night of cooking, feeding kids, doing dishes,\nbath time, story time, and finally bed time, Trish and I slip downstairs, sit on the sofa with a blankie, pull a little side table close to us, because we don't have a coffee table, and dip our yummy chocolate\nchip cookies in milk while we watch The Office, just living our best lives. Preheat oven to 350. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Yes. The oven's already there. The oven's already there, everybody. Thank you. (upbeat music) Trishie always makes, I don't think. Me and Trish\nhave been together for what? 20, like almost 22 frigging years. Frigging years. Okay? 22. We've been together longer\nthan we haven't been. That's amore. That's amore. In a bowl with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, sugars beat on medium until\nlightly fluffy, five minutes. We're making chocolate chip cookies. So, we're gonna add it to a bowl. So, we got some baking soda,\nbaking soda, baking soda. (bell ringing) I'm not a pastry chef. I'll tell you that. Pastry chefs are incredible, incredible smart individuals. This is a teaspoon. One and a half. \u266a Do, do, do, do. \u266a One. Two and a half cups. (playful music) So, this is a half cup. It's the only one on set. Perfect. So, I'm going to do two and a half. That's four, five of these. One, two, five. Baking. See, I'm a good baker. Trust me. I'm going to have to put\nthis in another bowl I feel, 'cause I got to do the\nfucking shit in this one. See, baking. Stay here. See, I'm already, The bowl was wet. The bowl was wet. This is already ruined. (heavy metal music) Now, I gotta wash this. There we go. Back to normal. Back on track. I think I'm going to add, I think I lost a little\nbit of the baking powder. (cap popping) Let's get it. Okay. Now, drop heap in a bowl. Medium speed. Reduce. Salt, vanilla, eggs. Beat until mixed, one minute. Add the flour mixture and then combine. Okay. Did we measure this? We didn't measure this? Perfect. Perfect. Unsalted butter. Perfect. Couple eggs. Beat it up. And the vanilla. We gotta add the vanilla, everybody. It's cookie time. (mixer whirring) Mix it up. Yeah, we'll put some salt in there. Okay. Now, you got a nice mixture.

There we go. Cookies. Cooking, baking's so easy. See? See, baking's so stupid. Look at that. We're good to go. We're rocking. I'm getting a sugar rush. I'm getting pumped up on dough. I'm realizing a few people are like, \"Ew. He's eating the\ndough with raw egg in it.\" Guess what? You ever see Rocky? Egg yolks all day. Whole eggs, guzzle 'em down. Hit a big shot of beef. (punch clicking) (boxing bell rings) When Rocky was eating a raw egg smoothie, he was pretty much just\neating cookie dough. So, it's the same kind of thing. - Science - Cookie time. Okay, we got a baking tray. I'm just gonna make a\nlittle cookie with my hands. I'm just gonna take the\ncookie and be like ba-booch. That's a cookie. It's like making meatballs,\nbut cookie balls. I'm gonna do three across. I think the recipe for\nthis says you can get 36 cookies out of it. Maybe these are a little big. I like using my fingers, 'cause then I get to suck on 'em. (lips smacking) Oh my God. (lips smacking) I think I just ate too much sugar. (lips smacking) Man. Little chubby chicken like me, and you, you put me, This is why I don't make cookies. I can't stop eating the cookie dough. Let's batch it out. In the oven. Middle rack. Trishie says eight minutes. Let's go eight minutes. Time it. (countdown beeping) Put the cookies hot on there, And then the next batch. Let's get the next batch going. Nice parchment paper. I'm sure you could use an ice cream scoop. I'm sure there's lots of things that I do that are probably wrong or you could do different. And that's the thing\nthat makes us so together and so far apart. Just go down to the comment section. Let me know how I've destroyed your idea of chocolate chip cookies. But I think these chocolate chip cookies are the ones that mean the most to me. When Trishie says, \"I'm gonna make some\nchocolate chip cookies.\" You're like, \"What?\" I'm still like a kid. When Trishie's like, \"I'm gonna make some fresh\nchocolate chip cookies.\" This is just an old fashioned\nchocolate chip cookie for the dunking of the milk. Famous to me. Now, famous to you, because once you put it on YouTube and post about it on Instagram, it's wildfire. Everyone's going to be making these. These are gonna be the\nhottest cookies in town. Let's get to it, everybody. Okay, everybody. Let's look at the cookies. The cookie's a little golden brown on top. Once they achieve a little\ngolden brown on top, because we want 'em eewy gooeys. Just because they're big, fluffy, we don't want 'em cooked\nall the way through. We still want that eewy gooey. I think a little more time. A little more time. An extra minute, extra minute. Every oven's different. Every oven's different. Every cookie is different. You know? Every, every, every baking. Science. Science is happening. - Science. - The science of cookies that are, cookies are good for you. That's the science that we're getting to. - Science. - Let's take 'em out. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And we're gonna put the other one in. And by the time these ones are cool, these ones are done, and we got fucking cookies. (countdown beeping) We take them off. Let's see the bottom. Nice golden brown. See, I\nfeel I could have made these maybe a little bit smaller. Because the thing too, with\nthe chocolate chip cookie that Trishie always makes, Trishie always makes the cookies so you can perfectly dip 'em. You can perfect, these might be a little\ntoo big to go into a nice, nice rock glass filled with ice cold, you know, homogenized, 3.25 whole milk. So, now we patiently, you don't eat the cookies now. You'll burn your mouth. You don't eat them now. Okay? You don't eat them now. What you do is you sit\nthere, and you think. (heavy breathing) And you think. And you're like, do not eat the cookie. Do not eat the cookie. Do not. I already ate so much dough that I don't even really\nwanna eat the cookie, but oh. No. No. Let's check it out. Gooey cookies. Smells like fresh cookies. \u266a It's cookie time. \u266a So, get your cookie. This is my milk. Okay? You get your milk. (cow mooing) (milk pouring) Oh. Isn't that cute? Isn't that cute? Shall we? Which one? Here we go. It doesn't really gooey. 'Cause the recipe says 36 cookies, and we got 3, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. I made them a little bit bigger, so 24. I think I ate 12 cookie\ndough balls worth of cookies. But let me tell you this going to be my last cookie of the day, and these cookies are righteous. This is, this is like, you want a dunky cookie?

back with yet another amazing recipe i am so excited today because today at the young's house gina young is going to share with you all how easy it is to make delicious oatmeal cookies this recipe is amazing it's so easy to make it doesn't require a lot of ingredients and you know making a young salad it's going to be so tasty y'all never had my oatmeal cookies before you better make you some here are the lovely ingredients you will need of course you're going to need some oatmeal so right here we have some oatmeal now these are the quick oats you can use any kind of oats that you have at home you're going to need some sugar and the sugar that we'll be using is we'll be using granulated white sugar we're going to use brown sugar we have some all-purpose flour and you're going to need some things to bump up your oatmeal cookies we'll be putting walnuts in our cookies today and semi-sweet chocolate chips we're going to put a few raisins in and you're going to need some softened butter so the butter that i'm going to be using today is the kerrygold irish butter it's delicious and it's unsalted and of course you're gonna need a couple of spices so we can spice everything up you're gonna need some pumpkin pie spice instead of using cinnamon we're gonna use the pumpkin pie spice we're gonna need some vanilla you will need baking powder and salt make sure your hands are impeccably clean let's get started with this really quick and simple yet so tasty recipe okay everyone so one of the first things that you want to do when you're making this recipe is you want to make a dried mixture and we're going to have a wet mixture so let's get started on the dry mixture we are going to use one and a fourth cup of all-purpose flour okay let's move all of these other ingredients aside i think it's amazing to use this pumpkin pie spice and replace of the cinnamon because it's fall time you want these cookies that kind of taste like the holidays you want that fall taste if you can understand what i'm talking about okay so i'm going to measure this out just like so and then what i'm going to do is i'm literally going to take the back of a butter knife and i want to level this off when you're making desserts you want to be precise with your measurements that way whatever you're baking can turn out right okay so let me grab my knife and i'll be right back okay everyone so when we're measuring our flour out you don't have to pack it like when you measure brown sugar you know how you pack it down into your measuring cup you don't have to do that okay you get a uneven uh it won't be measured right you're just going to do this and then you're going to level it off in this manner that's one full cup all right and what we're going to do let's go ahead and put the flour in here that's one cup and then we need a fourth cup just like so and you see that i have my cup sitting on the platter that way i can take that leftover anything that's left over and just put it back into my bag of flour this right here is 1 4 cup we're going to go in with the salt now listen here if you are using a salted butter then you will skip this part you don't need the salt if you're using salted butter we're going to use a half a teaspoon if i can find it of salt okay i'm not using sea salt today get that half a teaspoon in just like so in this manner and then we're going to use a teaspoon full and i'm going to level it off by using this here of our baking powder just like so in this manner it's going to make them nice and puffy okay so now we're going to use a half a teaspoon of the pumpkin pie spice it gives a great taste i love to make these cookies during the fall time okay in we go with that half a teaspoon just like so it smells so good all right and what we want to do is we want to take and mix up our dried spices and our flour okay mix it up well get that baking powder mixed in just like so when i come back i'll show you what we're gonna do with our wet mix okay so now we're gonna start on our wet mixture now there's one ingredient i almost forgot to tell you about but it's never too late you're gonna need two large eggs okay so in the eggs it's part of the wet mixture and the sugar is part of the wet mixture so let's go ahead and measure out three fourths of a cup of brown sugar and we're going to pack it so i'll show you how to pack it all right it's pretty simple you just take your hand or your spatula a spoon whatever you'd like and pack it down that's how you measure out the brown sugar correctly okay just like so and the brown sugar gives you a really chewy taste who loves a chewy cookie i know i do especially when it comes to oatmeal cookies i'm not a fan of the hard oatmeal cookies i want my oatmeal cookie to have some nice chew to it so this is three-fourths of a cup just like so nicely packed and i'm gonna put it right here into this bowl in this manner and the next thing we want to do is we need to measure out our white sugar okay now as far as the white sugar we're only going to use 1 4 of a cup of the white granulated sugar i hope you all are having an amazing day today let me know in the comment section below if you have a great oatmeal cookie recipe or if you've ever made them yourself okay so this right here is our 1 4 cup just like so and then we're going to go in with two sticks of butter all right let's kind of move everything around just like so now you want to make sure that your butter is nice and softened and room temperature and if you don't do that your cookies are not going to turn out right i took this butter out of the refrigerator early this morning so it's had plenty of time to reach room temperature and get nice and soft you don't want to try to soften it in the microwave you're just going to totally mess up the recipe if you try to soften it up in the microwave okay so we're gonna put these two sticks in and i'll show you what we'll do next okay everyone so now it's time to crack our eggs i'm gonna crack these two large eggs into a separate bowl just to make sure that they're nice and fresh okay you always want to crack them into a separate bowl that way you don't you know if you were to get an eggshell you could fish it out easily from this bowl rather than if you put it in your mixture it's going to be hard to fish out okay two nice beautiful eggs in we go to our wet mixture our brown sugar white sugar and softened butter get all that goodness into the bowl and we want to use a teaspoon of vanilla extract but you all that are familiar with me you know that i just kind of go in with the vanilla i love the flavor and i love the smell that it's going to give i never measure my vanilla you all laugh at me but i i can't i can just can't measure my vanilla all right if you wanted to that's fine just get you some in there just like so in this manner that's good all right so now what you're seeing here is you'll see the dried mixture that we have here minus the rolled oats and this is the wet mixture we want to combine the two but before we combine the two we need to cream together and i'm just going to use a handheld mixer here okay i'm going to turn the speed on low i'm going to cream this together until this mixture gets nice and fluffy okay so we're getting it nice and fluffy you want to make sure everything is well combined and you'll see the difference when this mixture starts to get really airy okay everyone so i want you to take a peek down at our wet mixture and what yours should look like nice and fluffy alright so now here's what we want to do we want to measure out two cups of the rolled oats i'm just going to use this measuring cup okay just like so you want to make sure that you have two cups kind of shake it and make it nice and level in this manner okay let me take a peek down at it and we have two cups okay so here's what we do here's where everything gets so much fun and everything happens so fast from here so let's take another mix with our dried mixture just like so and i want to take my wet mixture let's get my beaters off and the first thing that i want to do is i want to recover all of this i don't want any of that to go to waste all right get as much off as you can just like so and now we're going to take our soft spatula and we want to spoon this right in let's see did i guys do that where did i put get it together gina okay come on i'm ready to put my wet mixture right in with my flour just like so we're going to use the handheld mixer but before we get started we're going to take that two cups of your rolled oats put it on top and give it a nice mix just like so when i come back most of this will be mixed up and i'll show you what to do next so now if you're the person that wants to use i can't stop laughing guys all right listen here if you come on gina okay i've got it together guys okay what i was gonna say is okay everyone i'm back and i'm so sorry my husband had me laughing and i just couldn't stop but as far as that sends later on i'll tell you what i was trying to say if i can say it without laughing okay so now what we're going to do we're not going to use the raisins we are going to put a cup and a half of the semi-sweet and make sure you get semi-sweet okay and it's gonna make your cookie taste amazing all right just like so we have a cup and a half that seems like a lot absolutely it is and it's gonna make this cookie over the tip top all right there's a half and then if you wanted to use the raisins you can use a half a cup all right and now what we need to do we're not gonna use the mixer from here we're gonna fold all of these other ingredients in using our handy dandy soft spatula right here i have my walnuts and what i'm going to do is i want to go across them just like so just to break them down a little bit okay you don't want whole walnuts in your mixture okay everyone so we have our walnuts nice and chopped up not too fine you don't want to crush it into powder okay just like this all right so now we're going to take our rubber spatula all right i'll need to use a little bit of elbow grease to get everything nice and mixed up just like so in this manner now once everything is well combined i'll come back and i'm going to show you what size scoop you can use to make that perfect cookie so now these cookies are going to cook in the oven on 350 degrees for 11 minutes no less and no more okay 11 minutes is going to give you that perfect cookie and what's nice about this recipe is you don't have to take this cookie dough put it in the refrigerator before you cook it we're going to cook it right now so now right here i have this cookie scoop this is not an ice cream scoop and i just got it in a knick-knack section of walmart and it's going to give you a tablespoon and a half worth of dill okay and you just use it just like a ice cream scoop okay and we're just going to put it onto our sheet and you see that i have a parchment paper that i have cut okay if you want to you can take your cookie and kind of make it a little bit more into a ball but i like to keep that bottom nice and flat okay just like so i'm going to fill this cookie sheet up and then i have a smaller cookie sheet we're going to cook these on that middle rack make sure you don't use the top rack all right just like so okay everyone so we have all of our cookies onto our sheet here and what i did was i took my fingers and i kind of patted it down just a little tiny bit now keep in mind that you don't want to put your cookies really close together so only do a few on a tray we're going to put both of these in just like so in the oven we go okay everyone it's been 11 minutes we have that perfect color and when you see them they're gonna you're gonna feel like they're not done because they're not golden brown but the bottom as long as that bottom is nice and golden brown you have a1 cookies take a look oh yeah oh yeah now listen here at this point what we want to do we're going to gently go in we want to grab them and put them onto a cooling rack so that they can cool down you want to at least let them cool down for a good let's just say seven minutes before anyone bites down into them okay listen here everybody if you all enjoy this here video give me a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe make sure you click

make you some genus young style and as always god bless you all thank you all for watching good night", "Ch7ocMk_JEQ": "someone asked on instagram if i had ever done a Tate's chocolate-chip cookie cookie cat and I'll be honest I'd never heard of Tate's cookies and I had one it was pretty good I was surprised it was like super thin super crisp super buttery so I got really excited and decided to make some Finn and Chris chocolate chip cookies how things happen it's a thin cookie it's a super thin cookie what's wild about this cookie dough is I'm making it in a food processor it's not normally how cookies are made it's very handy for making a super tender cookie which is what we want this to be in goes the flour light brown sugar and cane sugar it still has some of its natural molasses content those last two ingredients are important because in this particular recipe we're trying to nail a very specific kind of copycat flavor profile which means if you use dark brown sugar it's not gonna taste right you use white sugar instead of cane sugar it's not gonna taste right it's not gonna look great and it's not gonna spread right this is the right combination to get a very specific kind of flavor profile spread and color so if you don't care about those factors it's okay to kind of play around a little bit but if you're wanting a copycat it's worth the effort the other unusual thing about this recipe is that there is more sugar than flour and that ensures that you spread a ton sugar is a really influential factor and spread for cookie dough all those ingredients go in plus some baking soda and salt and we'll pop this lid on and process it all those ingredients are very well combined I'm adding the butter and at this stage I'm only gonna pulse it until the butter disappears into a powdery mix I don't want it to get wet and clumpy so I don't want to run the motor too long or too hard it could cause it to warm up see what I'm talking about it's very powdery fine and dry now chocolate chips normally I'm a big fan of chopped chocolate and chocolate chip cookies but in this case commercial morsels work better because they give more of a copy-cat vibe in terms of flavor and appearance but I'm gonna bust them up just a little bit in the food processor all right now I'm gonna pop this into a mixing bowl so we can complete the recipe and then I'll just like soon it'll be a whole new scene shoo okay so once the dough is mixed up gonna shake it out into the bowl wow this is gonna be it's gonna be a real challenge as bowls not as big as I thought really laughing is this bowl okay so now that we've got this mixture in this little bowl gonna add my vanilla extract and 1 large eggs and start incorporating them with a spatula you might be thinking this already and you'll certainly be thinking it when you try and make this this mixture looks ridiculously dry and that it's not gonna work but it's gonna come together you just have to have faith believe so at the moment the butter is functioning more like a dry ingredient because it's still cold and solid but as you start to mix it it'll warm up and soften a little bit and create a little bit more of a dough like texture especially it once the egg gets incorporated just get in there and knead it together until it forms a very traditional looking kind of cookie dough only this is a little Bowl you guys so this is only been a few seconds of mixing it's already obviously a very moist and sticky dough we should definitely come by disgusting now that our hands are clean and exfoliated it's time to scoop up some cookie dough I'm using a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop because that gives a perfect three and a half inch cookies you've got a larger scoop gonna be surprised at how much these cookies spread so for each one of these it's important to not only make sure you pack the dough really well into the scoop that it's filled up also that it's level on the side otherwise if you have a really raggedy shape the cookies gonna spread and some unusual and unexpected directions quick tip so with this or any other recipe I never under any circumstances bake off all my cookies at once mostly because what am I gonna do with all those cookies I'm going to a party it's a lot so I always freeze my cookie dough for later it's a little gift to myself it's a little gift to my friends my family the important thing is to write the date and the instructions on the bag that way you don't get the cookie dough's mixed up so from there the real question is how many cookies do you want at any given time I like to scoop them onto a little bit wax paper parchment Belly sheets whatever so once the dough is all scooped out I just fold the wax paper around it and then just tuck it into the bag and press the air out seal it tight and I've got a little packet I can toss in the fridge freezer it'll keep in the fridge for about a week or up to three to six months in the freezer humm cookies any time okay now these cookies are portioned up let's bake them up [Music] so when these cookies are straight from the oven you know we can do this they're gonna be fragile look at that that's just a mess you gotta let them cool off it's sacrifice that guy for the team they jackal actually a really long time not only until they hit room temperature but another half an hour after that these cookies actually improve with age which is not something that many cookies can say several hours after making is when they'll hit their absolute peak crispy crunchy action I want to like Mike a cookie and like snap one open so you can hear how crisp they are oh we could really do that this is the silliest day of my life I've just miked a cookie ready that's it all up so I just made all these chocolate chip cookies they're crispy as heck they're buttery they're butterscotchy they're delicious they're my favorite you can't have them unless you get off your butt and start making them that's too confrontational I don't wanna be that confrontational", "pi7WJ5RVzM4": "[Music] hey you guys it's vijaya and in today's video I'm going to show you how to make chocolate chip cookies but not any type of chocolate chip cookies I'm gonna go out there and say that they are going to be the best the best chocolate chip cookies you will ever make at home and for me personally I love a chocolate chip with the effect thin that's crispy but that's chewy and melts in your mouth at the same time and these cookies are exactly that and this recipe is so darn simple and it's foolproof anyone can make it okay so you're gonna jump on the bandwagon before we get started don't forget to hit me up on my social media channels you guys know how much I love that of course if you're looking for the full recipe just click that info box down below and everything you need is there as little big cookies like Cookie Monster so just like any cookie recipe we're gonna start off with a little bit of butter and some sugars so I have some unsalted butter here I'm going to add that to my stand mixer if you don't have a stand mixer at home that's totally cool you can use a wire whisk or a wooden spoon or even a hand mixer any of those things might just require a little more extra muscle but you know you need to burn those calories before you eat those cookies anyways right so I'm going to go in with some unsalted butter and to that I'm going to add some white sugar and the secret ingredient in order to get that shoe is some dark brown sugar I'm gonna pop on my paddle attachment to my stand mixer and we're gonna lower and cream this until it's nice and flush [Music] okay so you know you've done a great job when the butter and sugar sticks to the side of the bowl of the bowl singular and I'm just gonna scrape everything down and now it's when we start to add our other ingredients so I have a little bit of vanilla that's gonna go in crack in one egg mix and then we're gonna crack in the second egg once everything's well mixed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and Wow look at that it looks like the best caramel buttercream frosting it is creamy it is silky it's exactly the way that I wanted now let's work on our dry ingredients now our dry mixture is super simple I have some all-purpose flour and to that I'm going to add a little bit of salt because remember we used unsalted butter and that way we can control the amount of salt that are in our cookies as well as some baking soda which is going to help the cookies slightly pop up but not too much because they're the thin crispy type that I love so give that a nice mix around and we're gonna add the flour in four portions to our wet mixture so that it's nice and combined we're going to mix it until you can no longer see any white streaks so in goes the first part and we're going to mix that up [Music] oh my gosh it looks so good look at how light and fluffy and creamy now because these are chocolate chip cookies I'm gonna go in with some chocolate but instead of using conventional chips I am gonna go in with lay chunks I like a big chunky chocolate because here's the thing with me a chocolate chip cookies I like the bits where there are no pieces of chocolate and then the bits where there are huge chunks of chocolate so I can alternate between the two everyone offers an amazing balance to the cookie so you have one and a half cups going in and in though the terms all of them and we're gonna blend this for like a couple of seconds just until the chocolate is incorporated and now I'm just gonna take off this is lush okay if even if you sit here with the bowl and don't make the cookies and just eat the cookie dough on its own I won't blame you because it's honestly so tasty so get every little bit off the paddle and then they'll be ready to make the cookies I have a cookie sheet that I've lined with a little bit of pressure paper I have my epic cookie dough here and in fact this makes or cookie sheets worth of cookies because each sheet only makes six so the thing with these cookies is that they spread out so you have to put only six on the tray otherwise they'll meld into one another not like that's an issue or anything but they'll end up being like a huge cookie and so two individual cookies so let's get the whooping [Music] so each of the scoops of cookie dough are separated by about two and a half inches and as you saw I use handy-dandy a spoons I'm gonna be dead the little ice cream scoop to scoop them out so easy and now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna top them off with a few more chocolate chunks and I think that this is really awesome because first of all when you're making the cookies the chocolate chips or the chocolate chunks get baked into the cookie you don't really see them and this is a nice way to garnish them and let's be honest get more chocolate in there as well [Music] my oven is preheated to 350 degrees and I'm gonna pop these guys in for about 15 minutes or until they're baked up and they're golden and caramelized on the edges let's do it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so I pulled these cookies out of the oven about 10 minutes ago and I've been waiting forever for them to cool down because they smell incredible and I just want to eat them which is what I'm gonna do right now this guy loves the perfect like look at him super thin crispy let's do it like I'm salivating honestly let's do this mmm did you hear that French the exterior it's so caramelized and crispy and crunchy but the reason why I was chewing for so long is because it is chewy in the middle people exactly the way that I want it in fact when you look in the middle it's so thin it's almost caramelized and then with those huge chunks of chocolate dispersed off goodness there's a reason why I call this the best chocolate chip cookie ever it is so simple to make and the outcome is unbelievable I mean you can heat up your favorite bakery or patisserie or whatever and this cookie is gonna stand out for sure I hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope you guys enjoy cookies okay and if you do feel free to give me a big ol thumbs up you know

chocolate chip cookie recipes variations on a base recipe to\nshow you how to do a cakey cookie a crispy cookie a chewy cookie different\nflavouring options and then it occurred to me we should show you how we came up\nwith the base recipe. The very first recipe all of the steps that you go\nthrough to make a cookie recipe. So I'm calling this anatomy of a chocolate chip\ncookie. You want to make a chocolate chip cookie you're gonna go to a\ncookbook you're gonna go to the internet and you're gonna find a recipe and\nyou're gonna make it. Great! But all baking is based on formulas and the\nformulas were figured out a very long time ago. While baking\nrecipes fall within a general guideline of these formulas. So a cookie, a\nchocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie and the base formula for chocolate chip\ncookie is one part flour one part sugar one part fat. A whole lot of variation\nwithin those three ingredients but we're gonna start off with all-purpose flour\nwhite sugar and butter and that one to one to one ratio is based solely on\nweight. So just to make it easy I'm gonna do everything in grams and I'm going to\ndo a hundred grams of each. It's going to make the math easier as we move forward.\nAnd it's gonna make less cookies, I don't need a whole lot of cookies. And once you\nknow the formula you can scale it up or scale it down to whatever you want. So\nstarting off I need about 100 grams of butter. There you go, 100\ngrams of butter. 100 grams of white granulated sugar. There you go.\nSo I'm just gonna set that aside and I will weigh out the flour pretty standard\ncookie cream the butter and sugar flour a little bit at a time so that is the basis of a drop cookie at\nthis point there's no flavoring there's no leavening and there are no eggs but\nthis is the foundation of where we're going to take our cookie so I'm going to\nbake this off and then we'll see where to go next\nso first batch and you can see kind of what we're working with here quite dark\nbrown and lacy around the outside I mean these are both just a starting point it's the flavor and texture I think\nwe're up to good start but I think the next iteration is going to be one two\none two one one part butter one part brown sugar one part flour\nlet's get those mixed up and in the oven so this set is quite a bit darker\nthey didn't spread nearly as much so you can see these ones were put in the oven\ndirectly after mixing these ones went into the freezer for 15 minutes and then\ninto the oven not as much spreading darker color much\nmore like a cookie color that we would want and the texture the white ones were\nchewy the brown sugar ones are crunch here a lot better flavor so on to the\nnext variation same proportions except we're going to do half white sugar and\nhalf brown sugar so this set is exactly what I would\nexpect from half white sugar half brown sugar the color is about the same as you\nwould expect from a chocolate chip cookie\nthe texture is pretty good the flavor is incredible too buttery at this point but\nthat flavor will round out as we add the rest of the ingredients if you think of\nin a chocolate chip cookie and those are eggs vanilla salt and baking soda or\nbaking powder and so the next version of the cookies will include these\ningredients and the formula or the average formula for these is pretty well\nset up bakers formulas are flour represents whatever the weight of the\nflower is represents 100% of chicken I'm working 100% of the recipes so flours\n100 percent sugar 100 percent fat 100 percent all the same weight eggs\nrepresent about 25 percent of the weight of the flour vanilla is about 5 percent\nof the weight of the flour salt is about 4 percent of the weight of the flour and\nbaking soda is about 1.5 percent of the weight of the flour and then of course\nthe chocolate chips it can be up to about 75 percent of the weight of the\nflour so let's mix up the next set of cookies and see how those turn it all right so here we have the starting\npoint for our exploration of the chocolate-chip cookie this is a formula\ncookie and it needs tweaking but now we know what the basics are we know what\neach thing does and how it works and we just slowly start to change the\npercentages to get what we're looking for this is exactly what I thought would\nhappen with the addition of the baking soda baking soda lowers the pH which\ncauses a whole range of other things to happen it will tenderize the cookie\nwhich I don't know yet because I haven't tasted one\noh they're chewy crispy and chewy with a lower pH it speeds the my yard reaction\nwhich causes some really nice crispy browning keeps it tender and it also\nstops gluten formation which has allowed them to spread really spread if you are\nlooking for a flat chewy crispy cookie this is perfect for you if you're\nlooking for a cakey cookie not quite what you're looking for and if you're\nlooking for something in between again not what you're looking for so using\nthis as our starting point I'm going to take the formula and we're gonna play\nwith how much fat is in it how much butter we're gonna play with how much\noverall sugar is in it and then the composition of white sugar to brown\nsugar because that changes it and we're gonna do probably five or six different\ncookie recipes and we're going to sit down we're going to taste them all we're\ngonna give you the formula so you can make this at home and you can you can\nplay with it yourself once you know those numbers anything's possible so if\nyou don't want to know any of that the recipes will be in the show notes\nso come on back and see all of the cookie variations", "LV99_0ji4q4": "Hey guys I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make the fudgiest chocolate cookies known to mankind! The cookie dough alone is super rich in chocolaty flavor But then there's melty morsels of semi-sweet chocolate swirled all throughout the cookie. It is a chocolate lover's dream cookie. It is so so indulgent All right, let me show you how to make it. So the first thing you want to do is measure one cup of all-purpose flour and make sure you spoon it in and level it off with a knife Measuring that flour properly is super important when baking. Now place a fine-mesh sieve on top of your mixing bowl and add the flour along with 1/3 cup of Dutch cocoa powder, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of baking powder. Now gently sift those dry ingredients into your bowl. If you see any large clumps appear just take the back of a spoon and kind of mash it up. It'll go right through. Now set aside your dry ingredients for later. In a separate bowl add 1/3 cup of unsalted melted butter along with half a cup of granulated sugar, and half a cup of golden brown sugar. Now using a whisk thoroughly mix the sugar and melted butter together Now add one large egg plus one large egg yolk Then pour in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Now grab your whisk again and mix it in very well. You want the consistency to be very smooth. So this might require a little bit of elbow grease. See that ribbony consistency. That's exactly what you're looking for. Now grab your sifted dry ingredients and add them to the butter and sugar mixture and mix gently with a spatula. Now before adding 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. You want to reserve about a quarter cup of that. You'll use that later when topping the cookies before baking. Ok now makes your chocolate chips into the cookie dough as evenly as possible Now by this point, if you've lost all control and started eating cookie dough by the spoonful I highly encourage you to just grab a cup of milk and enjoy the moment, no judging here! Now line your baking sheet with parchment paper and grab your cookie scoop Scoop out heaping mounds of the chocolate cookie dough mixture onto your baking sheet and make sure to space them out at least two inches apart. Now you can leave the cookies as they are or I actually like to roll each ball into my hand for a prettier cookie look, but that's totally optional. Now top each cookie with a few of those chocolate chips you reserved earlier and bake them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about nine minutes. Once they're baked let them cool just slightly before enjoying them. Alright it is time for the taste test! All right decisions decisions. Which one do I want to pick? Let's go for this one and I want to give you guys a nice good close-up to show you how fudgy these cookies really are.   Oh boy, look at that. Oh, yes! All right That is so yummy! It's so fudgy mmm. This is all it's missing What a delicious cookie. If you love chocolate This is literally gonna be your next best friend. These cookies are so good!

the founder and editor of ciccone and today I'll try to upgrade the famous Double Tree Hotel chocolate-chip cookie for those who haven't heard the Hilton has recently released their cookie recipe now there's some mixed reviews about it some really really good and others not so much it's all ok there's always room for improvement and that's what we're focusing on today so improvement but like for a cookie so I have the recipe written down I'm gonna make it exactly as it's written down give it a try and then see where there's room for improvement so first things first my butter is at room temperature so it can the whip nice and fluffy white sugar light brown sugar almost equal parts there's a tablespoon more a white sugar a lot of cookies start off this way cream together our butter and sugar until light and fluffy if you don't have a stand mixer you can always use an electric hand mixer and if you don't have one of those you got the mixers you were born with alright this looks right to me I had two large eggs at room temperature it's kind of rule of thumb when you're baking your ingredients that could be in the fridge or at room temperature some vanilla extract and also asked for lemon to activate our leavener it's not really gonna flavor the cookie to taste like lemon like four drops we're gonna beat it some more first on low for thirty seconds go for another two minutes like what am i doing with this lemon I don't like wasting things so mmm alright this is looking mighty fluffy and now on to the dry ingredients tuna quarter cups all-purpose flour and then a little bit of oats like a smidge half a cup of that's going in there some baking soda now this is why they wanted the lemon but it's it's a cookie doesn't needs it's not cake but you know and it goes some salt teaspoon of that and the last ingredient cinnamon so I'm gonna mix this on low speed for 45 seconds being careful not to overmix which I could feel like 45 seconds is a lot it's been like 20 seconds and it's already incorporated so I want to stop mixing can I saw mixing dear God I cannot I cannot let this go for 45 seconds these cookies will be frisbees so this recipe calls for a very particular brand of chocolate chips so that's what we are going to use 2 and 2/3 cup of chocolate there's only so great the cookie can taste if your chocolate is 1 and 3/4 cup of walnuts this is more walnuts and I've ever seen going into any single baked good just with the spatula I'm gonna fold this together I've never made a chocolate chip cookie dough this pale before baking sheets lined with some parchment paper normally I chilled my cookie dough before baking it but this doesn't ask for that it's good been dropping so it's about 3 tablespoons of cookie dough a cookie this dough the recipe says you can freeze it if you want to and these guys these are going into the oven 323 minutes so it's kind of a lower temperature bake them until they are golden on the edges and nice and tender in the middle cookies are out the oven and they are they're the same color as my parchment paper they're not lookers I wouldn't swipe right it's a lot of walnuts looking back at me these are worse than I thought they're gonna be I really thought they're gonna be like fine these cookies fell flat in many ways but I have some ideas of how we can build on the foundation of this recipe and make them the best version of themselves they can be it is a cookie makeover y'all time to make the cookie upgrade first thing is the butter I am going to brown the butter it's gonna help bring out this nuttiness that the other cookie wasn't having pop this on some heat me medium-low the goal is not to burn the butter I want a nice light caramel it's like the butter is seasoning itself when it Browns keeping a very close eye on it because once it hits that line from brown to burnt you can't come back in the meantime I have a baking sheet lined with parchment toast the walnuts in the original recipe they were giving me flavor just like my butter I'm gonna Brown them I'm using significantly less walnuts cuz I don't want them to overpower well the main star in no oil no anything they go and dry there's a natural oil in the nuts 350 degrees 5 to 7 minutes also keeping a close eye wash after your butter and your nuts like they are your children butter is beautiful golden brown like you will smell it check these walnuts these are awake that's all you're doing in the oven you just waking them up I have my butter beautiful and brown it's gonna carefully pour now you want to be careful not to get all those burnt and milk solids in there brown and white sugar but I am switching the quantities brown sugar makes cookies soft so I'm doing 2 to 1 ratio of brown sugar to white sugar so I have 1 cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of white sugar all you need is a whisk the butter is already melted so this should come together really easy every stir is just like fragrance fragrance fragrance if you see any brown sugar lumps just break them up with the head of your whisk you want your food to talk back to you this is telling me it's gonna be delicious so using it sexy phone voice like hey girl how you doing I'd like to introduce myself my name is brown brown butter brown butter is magic y'all I'm adding in eggs same as last time 2 large eggs room temperature look at this beautiful beautiful brown and you know this stuff is done once your batter slowly flows into each other I really want to accentuate the flavors we're working with there's just 1 teaspoon of almond and this will really help bring out a a flavour same amount of all-purpose flowers before the same amount of oats and baking soda give it a good gentle fold using a spatula we're the salt I'm going to be using some sea salt sea salt is a beautiful complement to chocolate it's okay if there's little speckles of white flour chocolate chip cookies key word chocolate the best chocolate you can find is the chocolate you want to use I'm using this bar halfway between semi-sweet and a dark chocolate and cut this chocolate into chunks a little bits that way it's like a complexity of chocolate you'll have a chocolate shard a chocolate sliver slide a mountain I'm gonna put in these walnuts and fold them in until it's nice and evenly distributed so I'm gonna cover and chill this dough for two hours or overnight this chilled it is firm I'm so excited to finally bake these so each cookie dough ball is around two ounces each working quickly it's going to compress it together in that curvy part of your hand and just shape it into a quick little ball you don't want to play with us too long because your chocolate will melt it can smell all the beautiful flavors in there so just a tiny sprinkle of sea salt on top of these cookies is gonna help bring out that chocolate flavor I'm gonna bake them 350 so harder than last time for 12 to 15 minutes wow look at the first noticeable difference is shape and size complex and texture there's so many things going on it is just like a happy party I do have to wait for them to cool but not an hour it may be just 15 minutes so they can relax this is the best part about a warm cookie it's just breaking it oh man [Music] these are wicked these cookies are a problem today for these cookies in hotels they wouldn't be able to kick them out be like girl it's checkout time what I love about this upgrade is that there's so many things you can do to this recipe to make it better with the exact same ingredients upgrading doesn't always have to mean spending more money I hope you give my upgraded Double Tree chocolate chip cookies a try and if you do show me the goods I want to see the cookies you're making and until next time hey bit do you do", "v8-KJ94uL8I": "hey everybody I'm chef Tom with ATB be calm and this is the brown butter chocolate chip cookie today I'm going to be walking you guys through one of those recipes that everyone should really have in their back pocket at all times this is the chocolate chip cookie it's not barbecue there's no meat involved but it's a really great recipe to have on hand because who doesn't love chocolate chip cookies so let's jump right into this we're not gonna do it completely straightforward it's going to be an interesting recipe we're gonna start with browning our butter so I've got a skillet over medium heat here I'm gonna add two sticks of unsalted butter so we'll just get these melted down to start with and then we're gently gonna start browning the solids that are in the butter and what that does is it adds a really interesting depth of flavor that you normally wouldn't get out of just raw butter so you guys saw how this is kind of simmering away we're gonna keep it at a nice low simmer like that because it's really important that you don't over brown your butter brown butter can very easily go from nice and toasty to scorched and bitter so go over low heat and continue to move that butter around so that it doesn't sit in one spot and scorch so this has this really nice toasted aroma to it now so kind of got that golden brown color going on there now I want to pull some of this out of here so you can kind of see in the spoon what it looks like when it's done we get rid of some of that foam so you can see it's a little bit more of a golden hue a little bit of brown solids now it's a good idea to go ahead and taste it now and you want to do that because you want to make sure that you haven't scorched anything if it's got any bitterness to it start over do it again it's not gonna be good if it's bitter that's just really nice and toasty though so that's exactly what we're going for all right so we're gonna transfer our brown butter to the bowl of a stand mixer you could also do this with a hand mixer if you like we're gonna add to that a cup of brown sugar as well as a half cup of white sugar so with the paddle attachment you want to get this going over medium high and this is what we call the creaming stage of the cookie making process even though we just have sugar and butter going on in here the aroma is incredible because of toasting that butter off now typically when you're using the creaming method to make cookies you're starting with like room temperature or softened butter not melted butter and that stuff really fluffs up and it becomes a lot lighter in color and texture this is going to do that a little bit but since we've melted our butter we're not really going for the same thing this is gonna be a bit of a denser chewy or cookie all right so you can see incorporated all of that butter and sugar together it's lightened up just a little bit but this is going to look quite a bit different than a normal cookie because of the brown butter involved the next thing we're going to do is work the eggs in here now I've got one whole egg as well as one egg yolk that we're going to work into this batter and that egg yolks just to add a little bit of extra richness so once that one egg gets worked all the way in we'll add the yolk and again you're gonna start to see this lighten up a little bit next I'm going to put in about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then we're gonna turn this down and start to work in the dries so here I've got 1 and 3/4 cup all-purpose flour but add to that some baking soda as well as some whiskey barrel smoked salt and I'm gonna work about half of our dries into start let that incorporate and once it looks incorporated we'll add the rest it makes that just until it gets worked in there and then we're gonna add our internal garnishes so obviously we're doing chocolate chip cookies which means we're adding chocolate to this today I'm gonna split it between semi-sweet and dark chocolate and I'm also gonna have a couple of different textures right so this is in a bar form we'll chop that up with a knife but it'll still be a slightly different texture than the chips themselves or these little morsels we also have something a little unconventional that we're gonna add today and that is potato chips we're gonna put kettle potato chips in here just salted potato chips adds a little extra salt to a cookie which is always a good thing and it also gives it a really interesting crunch so I'll add half of our chocolate there in the form of the semi-sweet morsels so we're just gonna break down this dark chocolate here chop it up give it kind of a rough chop it'll break down a bit as it mixes into the batter as well and then we're going to take our kettle chips and just kind of break these up and we're going to look to add about one cup of our broken down chips call that a half cup another solo speed now just till this batter comes together everything's distributed evenly that'll do it alright so we're gonna go in here with the scoop now should be able to get about six to these on each sheet pan alright I'm just gonna press those down a little bit they'll spread on their own as well all right I'm gonna load up one more sheet pan and we'll get these baked off all at once today will be baking on our ys6 40s it's running at 350 degrees set up for indirect grilling [Music] I'm gonna set a timer for about 10 minutes to come back and check on these we might just rotate them around so that they Brown evenly all right so here we are about ten minutes in now definitely see that the bottom ones are cooking a little bit faster than the top one so we'll go ahead and rotate these around but these like are looking really great that one's already firming up on the edges so we'll be back to check on these in another five to ten minutes so we're sitting right at about fifteen minutes total time now and these are fully set up so we're gonna pull them off so you can see how that's completely holding together slightly browned around the edges but still really soft in the center so if you get to eat these hot straight off the pan I love to put just a scoop of ice cream right there on top start melting that down let's get in there and taste it Oh homemade cookies you can't go wrong there and it's just so tender in the center great crunch to the outside just the right amount of saltiness that's exactly what we're going for but thank you guys so much for watching be sure to check out ATV BQ comm for all the products featured in today's

is which is better Aaron I love chocolate chip cookies awesome there are so many chocolate chip cookie places in the world and I've been thinking which are the best in New York City I don't know if you've noticed this but I am a chocolate chip cookie connoisseur and I shot two videos for insider at two different locations we have best friends that has the cheapest chocolate chip and we have Ben's cookies that have Chocolate Chunk cookies we're gonna watch the insider videos and then we're gonna try them out and by the end of things hopefully we'll see which is actually better awesome I am ready to eat some cookies this is the best friend whoa that's a lot of chips telling you I mean they're called the chippy astrak-- ilat chip cookie is for a reason if i'm not mistaken there are three different types of chocolate chips that go into this those cookies are pretty big huh yeah they're good and they have milk there too yeah nice so big then you can't even put it in the milk cup and what they do is like when they bake it they take it out Midway and then they add more chocolate chips and bake it again so it's like a two-step process they're really package right they're really packing it in there okay okay okay yeah so I'm gonna be honest with you just look at this video I mean they look good but they don't look like amazing you know you have seen chippy err chocolate chip cookies okay I haven't seen chippy or chocolate chip code I think add more in like after like after they like halfway bake it okay and this guy he was a sweetest paw paw Park what up all how many do you eat when you were there okay all right and they're under an infrared light so when you get them they're like still pretty warm nice all right I admit that looks really good yeah exactly they're not like your average like mom makes you cookies mm-hmm and this was the first time you'd had one of these cookies in this video right and the cool thing is they they break it up into pieces there's so many ways you can eat it oh hell yeah I want that that's a cereal situation or you can just dunk it or you can just go to town however you want no I like that yeah it looks pretty good I still remember like when they were passing it over to me at the cashier I was like wow that's a lot of calories like this is definitely gonna go to my cheeks yeah facial cheeks I wish y'all get a look at that girl if that isn't food porn I don't know what is this is already my style I want big melted gooey chocolate falling out of my cookie I'm to my hands and face this looks really yeah just visually alone it's like okay okay okay more my style more my style we're definitely gooier and if you don't like the crunchy crispy kind of cookies these are definitely probably more you're tight I gotta say visually chunk looks a little bit more my style than ship sorry to all the other chip heads out there 17 flavors yeah so I mean you can never get tired of one how many flavors are the last-place have one yeah all right yes yes I'm loving how that dough's looking this guy's shoving that thing into that thing in the fold net thing I'm assuming you make a cookie have no idea they're baking all day every day yeah so you always have a warm cookie I mean it's not heated when it's on display but all day your rest-assured going to get a fresh cookie I feel like people like the chip cuz that's what you're used to looking at with the chocolate everywhere but I feel like that's the big glove right and is cuz I mean always doesn't end that way that is just because we picked out the prettiest one as you can see it's not always gonna give you that right interesting so your concern is quality control yes okay okay when you open the rest or when you open the when you open the door yeah you just get this waft of like homemade homemade cookies because they're baking cookies every day yes you remember that these cookies were a lot less sweet it ultimately boils down to if you like really really sweet chippy cookies mm-hmm or these like soft kind of like half baked cookies with like a gooey Center okay so what we have in front of us right now are the best friend cookies look a lot better in person yeah [Music] [Laughter] that's all right it's the Internet when I see like these like grease stains you can tell there's so much oil hey you're doing what I do but we're gonna make it cute I'll do it ready come on give me um okay I can do this job this is so easy the reason why they package it in this way is because when you lift it up you're supposed to see that chocolate melts I mean that's I mean in person that's pretty appetizing I would have to say but this isn't which looks better this is which tastes better right [Music] it's less sweet remember I love the fact then you get that crunch from the outside yeah the chocolate chips make everything soft and warm that cozy feeling you get when you eat chocolate your cookies is really good like I would definitely get it if I even knew where this place was I would definitely recommend it and we definitely eat the whole thing if it wasn't on camera and feeling incredibly self-conscious about shoving a cookie in my face in front of volume but when I'm eating this cookie I'm gonna want to rip it into pieces because I have a very small mouth as you all have pointed out to me but by doing so I'm gonna have hands like this so imagine you and I we were dating right like aside from your wife and my boyfriend we get these cookies we're eating them it's like our first date while I'm eating I'm gonna thank you so much this is so good and then afterwards I look at my hair that I'm like well oh my god he's gonna think that I'm a swabbie peg or like scenario two we just ate these cookies I am not aware of that my hands are chocolatey and then I'm just like you have something on your face and then I just go Smee and both these scenarios it didn't matter if we weren't a date or not because texturally flavor-wise everything that I could ask for now can Ben's cookies beats best cookies what's this place called best friend best best friend breast how about this I'll just throw it to you okay this cookie where we just ate from best friend is really good but can it beat the cookies from go we're about to find out on which is bad please be packaging wise Ben's cookies is a lot more thoughtful presentation so far I'll give him an a open it up yo it's like yes is very cute it's like got a low like oh man and later okay yo shout out the bed with the presentation good call presentation really matters these days especially for Millennials cookies [Music] so I want I want this one okay touch to every single one make with your eyes you can immediately feel like on the center you know this thing is like kind of starting to cave on the bottom oh it's a goo enough from underneath yeah whoa how's that look it looks good from where I'm sitting where is it where is the chunk it's on the side okay well honestly why would it be and it's smaller than in chocolate-chocolate distribution already an issue it's definitely like half-baked but that's the kind of cookie I also very much like been cooked those cookies bro when you immediately buy into these they're so texturally different than best friends this one's just like biting into like like a cloud a chocolate cloud turn the chip cookie cloud I do not like this cookie really no it's not as good as the other one all right this one's so much better I thought it was a chunk man but that cookie but the chocolate distribution ridiculous it was mostly like a sugar cookie with a bite of chocolate in it I like that the other one the distribution of the chips actually keep actually key for the cookie I felt like I was just like every bite was like oh man there's more chocolate than the next this one it was like I mean at least two bites in there were always just the dough and that's what I'm saying I think you may have just gotten a bad bite because they're not evenly distributed and you see this no mess I think it ultimately boils down to them whether you're a chip person yeah or whether you're a chunk person this video this video flip me I'm a chip guy now I can't blame a chip guy oh my god I'm everything I hate oh my gosh I think these are means better all right we got to go to the tiebreaker our camera crew now you'll notice that these cookies over here are kind of missing chocolate what's your estranged cloud their judgment the texture on these on the bins cookies are definitely better mhm but the taste of this is hands-down better interesting and your your thoughts come on get in the shot get into the shot come on I don't like these giant get out of the shot sanity - interesting we ate all the chunks yet there's so much cookie left that's so weird and the huh how do we you know the chunks of that yeah plenty of chunks on this plate your criteria my crazier you could be totally different I'm looking at quality of ingredients yeah looking at overall sweetness sure whether or not it's balanced true just like me yeah yeah texture yeah and cookie batter okay got it what are you I'm going with taste if you think best friend is taste butters and I mean in my book you're wrong okay I'll respect it I never thanked you for that respect and if you want a chocolate chip cookie that has no chocolate in it and that's what you're looking for hey to each their own this has been the first episode the chocolate chip cookie episode of which is better we'll be back next time week with something else we'll be back probably this has

well i feel like it's it's like basic to say i just like a plain you know chocolate chip cookie but it's just something that i am nostalgic for i grew up eating homemade chocolate chip cookies baking chocolate chip cookies eating the store-bought kind and i just can never really get enough of them they're the thing that i i go to when i just want to bake something easy and so do you bake chocolate chip cookies a lot right now yeah i've made a couple of batches during the like pandemic since the spring yeah and now for our audience we should point out very clearly even though i just mentioned it earlier that you are baking my recipe but adapting it uh to vegan baking yes of course i am vegan 100 and so it's actually just very easy swaps um you offer up the egg substitute which is a flax meal egg so we're going to use ground flax and water to make like a gooey egg-like textured substance it's not something i use all the time in my baked goods as well and then i'm going to use vegan butter but you also mentioned you could use coconut oil which is very much like the texture of butter but i like the vegan butter sticks it's exactly like regular butter uh okay well you know what this is exactly the sort of thing i'd like us to chat more i've got my butter measured in my bowl it's 115 grams or half a cup and it's softened to room temperature now i'm using unsalted butter and then i'm adding salt when you're baking with vegan butter is it unsalted or salted or can you make that choice it's actually all the ones like there's a few brands you can get and i've noticed they're all slightly salted but i actually still add salt um because i don't know i like when there's just that little bit of salty it's not overly salty as you know but i just think it i don't need to reduce the salt and i you know based on your measurement i know that's going to work so i'm going to leave the half teaspoon in and the butter is still slightly salted you know i'm with you on the salt thing or sometimes you sprinkle a little uh flaked sea salt on the top of the cookies before they go in the oven oh just to get that little bit of a crunch so i'm with you on that and now do you like your chocolate chip cookies crispy chewy or a combination usually a combination so i like when the outside has just like a bit of a crispness to it or like a like a flakiness maybe and then the inside kind of is softer chewier and i'm excited for your recipe because your signature is adding cornstarch and when i saw that i was like that's brilliant of course anna did that so a mix i've never had a cookie that had that in it so i'm excited all right and we'll talk about why i add the cornstarch and i'll even share how i came up with it because i've been actually i've been making this recipe since in this exact format for two decades now wow um but i've been making some similar version probably my whole life like i imagine like did you start baking when you were younger like a little kid in the kitchen yeah i remember being i don't know what age but definitely under 10 uh 10 years old and we would just me and my grandma and my sister we would just follow i think the recipe on the back of the chocolate chip bag like the toll house chocolate chips or whatever or the baking chips like i don't remember the recipe but i mean there's always like slight variations between people's cookie recipes and i guess it just results you know there's like more than a dozen different sort of final textures you could get right mm-hmm you know i i'll take a cookie it doesn't really matter i don't care they're all delicious to me so yeah we would just follow that recipe on the back and keep it pretty easy but yeah i just that's like one of my earliest memories of of baking anything i think chocolate chip cookies were one of my earliest too so why don't we jump right into mixing have you softened your vegan butter it is softened and you told me today we're not going to use any appliances and so i will be honest with you i always use appliances because it's just so much easier so to cream with a spatula i've never really done it but when it's soft it should be fairly easy right it should and you'll find i think once we add the sugar so i've got half a cup of granulated sugar and half a cup of light brown sugar measured so in metric that's 100 grams of each and you can add them at the same time to your butter that's softened you know what i didn't ask oh yeah it's packed light okay that's what i did packed light brown sugar and granulate it i'm adding that now and then what do you just like squish it yeah so creaming is actually the process of i'm gonna hold this up to the webcam here like smearing the butter and sugar along the side of the bowl and that friction of the sugar as it mixes with the butter aerates the butter a little bit and it helps give the cookie structure so it'll hold together better so you can't over mix it at this point okay you can't over mix it you're the best at explaining the technical science of baking because i've seen your cooking demos as you know we were together at an event and you're so good at explaining the technical science and i'm just like from experience and watching food network and shows like like you had on food network i just know like cookies are supposed to have creamed butter and sugar but it's not like i just learned that from watching you and other experts but i could never explain why but you explained things so well when we did to give our audience context lauren and i were guest presenters at this amazing event in the rocky mountains called christmas in november and it gives everyone who participates up for the holiday season and you just spend the whole day going from cooking demo to cheese tasting to wine tasting back to another cooking demo and so we both sat in on each other's sessions and i learned so much from you lauren and your style of presentation and making people comfortable with making that leap into vegan cooking and baking because you're so approachable um you explain things just as well and so i feel like we're on the same mission but mine is leaning towards baking and yours is towards vegan cooking thank you yeah and there is i mean i guess it's just that there is of course a science and a chemistry going on but i think sometimes i get intimidated because i'm self-taught right so it's not like i went to school and like learned it all as an exact science but you really do learn by doing and like putting in the hours right i learned more from my mistakes than successes if something comes out fine you live with it you accept it or you question if you're being critical enough but when something doesn't work out you have to figure out why and that i love that challenge me too yeah so this looks really creamy and good here why don't you hold it let me take a look here's mine what do you think oh yours looks really good but it could be it could be the temperature what what is your temperature outside is it 68 70 or is it a warm day it's a warmish day is that why also though i'll tell you what maybe the other thing is you're probably using a very refined white granulated sugar and i just used like an organic granulated cane sugar and it is fine but it's not as fine as the sugar you're probably using well that would make a big difference but it won't make a difference in the outcome because once that sugar melts into everything we'll be fine and um i think something worth noting is i bake with when i'm adapting to vegan baking i i usually call for i play with coconut oil first is what i'm trying to say because that has a common predictability where vegan butters you know they can vary yeah um but i found if i use coconut oil in this recipe that you know how coconut oil is so firm even at room well especially at room temperature i melt um a quarter i melt some of the coconut oil to then soften the whole base up so it mixes more smoothly otherwise you get those little bits of coconut oil in the batter itself yeah and do you actually use do you use virgin coconut oil that's refined or unrefined i've only worked with the refined what should i try using unrefined oh no i was just wondering yeah i know refined is good because then it doesn't taste like coconut yes yeah yeah then you can focus on the chocolate chips and cookies okay now is where i would add the egg but you're going to use a flax egg i am i should have had it sitting already but i didn't no that's okay we have to we have lots of time normally i would mix that first because you get to just crack your egg in but i'm going to mix i have three tablespoons of water in a dish and then i'm using um golden flax meal so that just means the outer husk is removed so it actually helps these cookies stay nice and like golden color without any flecks whereas if you use ground flax meal with the husk you'll get little dark flecks in the cookie it doesn't really matter but just that i just tend to use golden flax for like all my baking so two tablespoons i'm gonna mix with the water oh that's interesting i don't know that i've ever thought of making that distinction i'm gonna have to go check my my ground flax i actually made a vegan version um before we started because i just wanted to play with a different uh type of vegan butter um but i did the flax meal and i'm trying to think i'll just have to check the packaging because i don't see the flax it really only matters to the look and it's very subtle so it doesn't really matter most people might only be able to find ground flax with the husk on it which is most common but i have noticed now in the baking sections at regular grocery stores they have bags of this golden flax meal so i guess it's just becoming more popular people are on to onto your fabulous tip there yeah but you only have to let that sit um the three tablespoons of water and two tablespoons of ground flax only has to sit for a minute or two basically yeah it's very it's amazing how you see it it changes and it kind of becomes slippery looking it you know what it does it makes you appreciate the importance of fiber in our diets because when you see how that flax seed just holds the water and that's what it does when we digest it and that's so important so but the fact that it holds together our chocolate chip cookies in place of an egg is like a bonus free with purchase if you notice then because you wouldn't you've been making these for so long with eggs and butter do you notice a drastic like taste difference if you use the flax versus an egg or the butter versus the like regular butter well i will tell you a live story just uh i think it was an hour and a half ago my producer jennifer and i we had we all had a cookie one of the vegan cookies and she and i while we're not vegan appreciate vegan food but we could notice the flax seed where tj who is vegan yeah didn't notice the difference at all so i think you just become accustomed to it i don't find that the taste difference dramatic if anything in adding or using flaxseed in place of egg adds a subtle nuttiness that suits baking anyhow you want that kind of caramelized taste on the outside of chocolate chip cookie in my mind it belongs there um and how is your flax doing has it soaked up some of the liquid is it ready to pretty much yeah i feel like once it jiggles and it's you don't see the liquid it's pretty much good to go so i can add that in now to the butter okay and i'll crack in my egg okay and you just use room temperature water don't you for your flax egg i always make sure when i'm adding my eggs to baking if the butter is at room temperature then my egg is at room temperature because they'll combine better together do i add anything else at this stage uh we can add do you have your vanilla handy yes i do one teaspoon of vanilla are you going to measure i free pour my vanilla i'm just going to splush it right in i'm going to just do it because i'm with anna olsen so i just don't want to mess a little bit extra is not going to make a difference yeah okay and we continue this creaming motion yep well you can switch more to stirring now this is the point where i find your version because um the texture of the the flax incorporates into the butter you'll be faster than i will because the egg kind of breaks apart in little globules and so it just takes that extra moment to bring it together so i'm just sort of slapping around smearing it around the bowl but it's now fluffy how's yours looking laura yeah it looks really nice it's nice and fluffy sweet you want to hold it up to the webcam so we can just okay ours looks so right [Laughter] but in the end it's going to come out yeah yeah that's what's kind of amazing about it really and the intensity of course of the color of the brown sugar is going to change the color tone too and the weight of it i do 50 50 white sugar and brown sugar because i find if you do too much brown sugar the cookie becomes too dense and heavy i mean a chewy cookie is a good thing but when it's just heavy i don't want to use the word heavy in chocolate chip cookies no it should be light yeah okay so now i think we're ready to add our dry ingredients and i'll make a confession lauren when it comes to things like chocolate chip cookies and even muffins i don't bother sifting even though i say to sift in the recipe it's a good habit i always always always always do it with cakes yeah when you need that aeration but for chocolate chip cookies i'm trying to keep it to one bowl keep it simple so i'm just going to add the dry ingredients and i kind of stir in the baking soda and salt into the flour and then i stir it in okay i can do that too i had my little strainer oh you're right just sift because i was ready because i was like maybe she does the sifting's really important for these signature cookies to be really light but when i make cookies too i've never sift unless and i just recently did a cookie with cocoa in it i sift the cocoa because the cocoa is always lumpy always and if the cookie has icing sugar i always sift because the icing sugar is the same way yes okay we're on the same team there so now i have my all-purpose flour one and a quarter cups so we'll just add that how is she doing it she's got it measured i'm doing it i'm doing it live here so i'm scooping oh i have some other ingredients to measure okay i'm scooping from my this is correct you scoop with a spoon into the cup and then you level it yes so that way you're not patting down the flower or if you scoop into the canister the first thing i do is i stir the canister with a fork to lighten it up because it settles right and especially with humidity um it will settle and become dense so you'll end up with too much flour in there or you also offer weights which is something i've never really done so that is helpful if people want to weigh but you know i started following some recipes um where there was weights and i was like oh yeah this is really easy because you just put the bowl on the scale and you just add stuff and it doesn't matter how you get it from the canister to yeah the bowl it just get it there and a gram is a gram and i find you get more consistent results that way so if you love a recipe i would try try weighing it right you'll produce the same recipe because chocolate chip cookies can be real sticky that way that one batch to another can be different in the way it spreads or the height it has and so that could be the temperature of your butter or it could be a slight mismeasuring of the sugar you get a tablespoon too much in there and all of a sudden you've got flat cookies well hopefully that doesn't happen today okay so i did one and a quarter cups here great and now we'll do the cornstarch and i have to measure that too okay i had my pre-measured cornstarch love it when i was um a restaurant pastry chef i would do chocolate chip cookies and i was making them around the same time as i was making pavlovas the meringue dessert and when you make a pavlova which is simply whipped egg whites and sugar if you just bake the meringue made from whipped egg whites and sugar and bake it it becomes crispy all the way through but all you have to do is add a little bit of cornstarch to that meringue and all of a sudden it is crispy on the outside and soft in the center like a marshmallow because the cornstarch holds moisture to itself and i thought oh what if we apply that to a chocolate chip cookie and i found out indeed even if you accidentally over bake the cookie a little bit you retain that soft center to the cookie that's amazing so that's the whole weird place in my head that produced that well i love it now i'm gonna have to do that to all my existing recipes that i have and my book and stuff do it go for it i don't care i just happy to share this is what a baking day is all about is sharing that information so i've got my baking soda in hand my half a teaspoon that i'm just going to add on top of that tablespoon of cornstarch me too i'm just sifting my baking soda very because sometimes there's lumps in mine very astute and then the salt i'm doing the salt yeah i'm adding salt i have pink salt because i just always have that but i find it's fine oh nice i know i'm just using my finger to stir in those little measurements into the flour but there we go and now it's easier to just stir together so this is we'll take our time now okay yeah so i'm stirring all the dry but we don't have to be too delicate with it i'm just being trying to be tidy okay and now you're already in the butter okay i did not add it in the butter yet adding it in not in sections i can just dump it no it can just go all at once yep now can you over mix in this stage once everything is combined and you no longer see visible bits of flour you know you're well blended it's not like a cake batter where you need to mix to a certain point to achieve a certain visual texture to know you've mixed it properly this is mix it until it's combined do you like making cakes or cookies better oh that's a tough question lauren i think actually my favorite thing to make uh are tarts oh i love the complexity of the tart because you have that cookie-like or pastry crust then you have a filling then you have the topping and then you have the decor on top of that and i find that so interesting on a plate because of the textures and flavors a tart is a lot of work yeah but i love that gratification of the step-by-step process and the multiple techniques involved so i think that's why i like tarts but if it's a choice between cookies and cakes i think i'd go for cookies yeah they're different cookies again are like my go-to like i'm just like i want to treat i know i can whip up cookies and have them ready you know in like under half an hour but then cake i really like making cake because it's so fun and i have some staple like cake recipes now that i can just go to so i can make them round i can make them sheet cake and it just works every time or cupcakes so those are good for like if i just want to make them usually like making a cake you're doing it like for an occasion for somebody um but yeah i think they're just different i like both one is just more fancy and elaborate and like more impressive and the other is just like for me like the cookies are for me and the cakes are fun which there are different motivations for why we bake not just what we bake but you know what i want to talk to you about cakes and also different egg substitutes so let's keep mixing our dough and we'll take a quick break so we can have a word from our sponsors embrace the mess

and i are making my signature chocolate chip cookies but of course lauren's version is a vegan one how is your batter looking dough batter dough batter it's looking really nice and mixed yeah yeah oh yours is nice and smooth and creamy looking yeah i feel like mine looks a little more moisturized moisturized we'll have to see how it bakes up it's amazing though how ingredients can vary country to country um and even within a country in terms of like you were talking about the grind of the sugar but speaking of variants we were talking about flax eggs using for a cookie recipe like this or for muffins simple things banana bread where you don't mind the speckle what do you reach for when it comes to replacing egg in something like say you're making a vanilla birthday cake what what do you prefer to use i don't necessarily always know the technical science but like my i have this um in my first cookbook vegan comfort classics i have a base cake recipe that i have four different flavors so like chocolate vanilla i do apple spice and a lemon and so that's like that recipe doesn't have any flax in it and it doesn't have like an obvious um egg substitute but what i do is i use um non-dairy milk like soy milk with apple cider vinegar and then that makes almost like a buttermilk and then that reacts to the baking soda and there's baking powder in it so that you get both the rise and the leavening so you might know more than me where i'm like i don't actually know what the egg is but it doesn't need it the cakes end up really moist really nice texture but i don't use flax in that case oh that's interesting but i can understand why you would use the cider vinegar because that that's a common ingredient in gluten-free baking to help bind ingredients together so that's part of the function of the egg so i can see why the vinegar would help do that and i know when vinegar reacts with the protein in the flour it creates a little more structure so that kind of makes sense but the fact that you just you don't even look for a one-to-one substitution is fascinating but you just adapt yeah and it i just like how you explain see i wouldn't have known the protein and the flour creates structure with the vinegar like i didn't really know that but you just did it and it worked so you run with it and then i did well i did another cake recipe recently where i did a bit of a different thing and i'm actually to be honest with you i have it sitting i made it yesterday and it's sitting out uh to be cool and iced today because i have to take a photo of it so it's actually a new recipe and in that one i did do quite a bit of flax egg because it was more of what um i had done some research online is like it's a butter cake so the cake actually has like quite a lot of butter and eggs in it but i ended up using the golden flax meal as the egg substitute and it created a really light fluffy batter like very different than my other cake recipes so i haven't tasted it i'm curious to see how it ended up i'd ask you for a sneak peek but if you haven't even shot it you can try something new you got to keep that under wraps for now and what if it sucks i don't want to show it on i don't want to show it i don't doubt that on that same egg topic you work i've looked at some of your recipes and you work with uh softer silken tofu now and again yes sometimes i use silk tofu or soft tofu and then depending on for what i can you can go all the way up to almost a firm tofu as well that has less moisture in it like what kind of recipes do you favor that for i believe i mean you can get away with using a medium or soft and i have a creme brulee recipe that is tofu based and then i also have a custard recipe like a sort of like a classic vanilla custard recipe and that's tofu base as well and for that one i think i use more of a medium to a firm tofu and i still even like squeeze the excess water out i use i don't know if you use these nut milk bags but they're popular for vegans because we make sometimes we make like homemade nut milk by blending almonds or cashews and then straining them through these nylon bags so oftentimes i'll strain tofu that way too just to really get it nice and dry and then i reconstitute the recipe with other liquids like something like coconut milk for more flavor and fat or maybe you're adding lemon juice or something like this so i just get rid of the water from the tofu but sometimes you still need another liquid to blend it into whatever texture you need but tofu really is great like that because it's so it does no taste it's very neutral and when you're adding sugar you really can mask sometimes there's a bitter like soy taste but you can mask that with sugar and citrus and all kinds of things like that that's amazing now i've only worked with the software silken so i can't wait to try playing with the medium or firm and i like your tip about straining it so it allows you to concentrate the flavor and of course then you're concentrating the protein and therefore the set in whatever it is you're making amazing and now shall we measure our chocolate chips into our cookie batter yes i did pre-measure those ones so that i could get rid of the packaging now this is definitely one part of the recipe where measuring is a loose term i tend to be very precise when it comes to measuring the butter and the sugar in the flour but chocolate chips yeah it's a few extra spill in these look this is gonna be a good amount of chocolate chips to dough i have to say whoa i will say that's one change i've made in this recipe i used to have a cup of chocolate chips and one time i actually measured how many extra i was putting in and it was a full half a cup extra and i just thought we need to own it we just need to own it i am all about this amount this is a lot and i like it i was gonna add the pecans you suggested okay do it i don't have the pecans here so you add them i'm adding those and i really really like toasted pecans in a cookie this is now the adult version of this cookie for me it truly is now and i want to ask you about your chocolate chips so you you have vegan chocolate chips you're baking with yeah there is a brand that is specifically vegan and sometimes they'll be labeled like dairy free or vegan but actually too a lot of the brands and you just got to check the ingredient like a semi-sweet chocolate chip which i think is that what you use in this yeah but i'm going to tell you about what i'm actually using in a second i want to hear you if you finish your chocolate chip store well most of the most of the semi-sweet chocolate chips are just sort of accidentally dairy-free um because it's like true you know chocolate liqueur cocoa butter cocoa powder sugar that's it um so usually you're okay but i would just always double check the ingredients if you're worried about dairy that's good to know and these are like the chips for baking because i'll admit what i have added are my cuvette baking chips so they're the chips i use when i need to melt chocolate to make a cake batter or a mousse or a frosting because the one thing i have found where if you buy the the bag of chocolate chips they're designed to hold their shape and they set up quickly after they cool where i find the baking chips stay melted for a lot longer so even when the cookie is cooled you still get the melted chocolate chip in the center and i absolutely adore that oh that's interesting yeah because you're right these chocolate chips will hold their shape like when you see them on the top of the cookie so that's interesting yeah okay here's now we're looking pretty hey yup well it's definitely about the chocolate chips the chocolate chip to cookie dough ratio is definitely one to one in this recipe so those those chips that you're using are they a little bit bigger and flatter like a disc a little bit so they are they looked a little bit different from a conventional chocolate chip but um they stay they hold their shape when they bake they don't melt into the cookie dough but you could do the same thing with a chunk of baking chocolate and chocolate chunk cookies it's going into my drawer because i've got my trusted ice cream scoop to portion the cookies are you going to use two spoons or how do you like to do that i have the same thing now i always i'll be honest with you these scoops they're all different sizes this one is a one and a half tablespoon because i measured it and i have one that's more of like a two two and a quarter tablespoon so which one do you think i should use mine is one and a third ounce oh gosh okay so that's two that's like two two plus tablespoons okay then i'm gonna switch to my bigger one i'm going for jumbo cookies here okay so you're just scooping and putting them on the tray yep and i'm scraping the scoop against the edge of the bowl so that i have a nice flat level scoop and then it sits flat and won't roll off my baking tray now normally if i have time i actually prefer to chill my cookies for an hour i find you get a better bake you get that kind of rough ruffle as the chocolate chip cookies bake we're going to go right to the oven okay because we just need cookies in our day today i get nervous about the spreading so i'm leaving two inches between yeah i think that's smart if you've got a big scoop like i have a big scoop but i find once i've chilled the cookies because there are only two of us in our household so to make a whole batch of chocolate chip cookies we're not getting if i bake them i'm gonna eat them as much as people might think i live on cookies i don't so i what i prefer to do is i'll chill them and you can scoop them close together so they fit in the fridge but then i'll just bake off say half a dozen and freeze the rest as the scoops and then you just have to pull them out and bake them when you want to i usually do that also because i don't want 24 cookies lying around i find i've put the dough in like you know just a container and it never really gets totally frozen right because of the amount of fat and sugar so you're able to scoop it from frozen and that takes up a lot of less space you know how you can buy those types of doughs in the store it's the same thing but homemade which i kind of like true very true here's my trays that look correct to you yep i think we're on the same page all right let's take it to the oven i think mine are a little smaller than yours okay yours might bake faster than mine yeah i really went with jumbo cookies today and it really does depend on the size of the cookie but i find if i'm taking them if i've chilled the cookies i prefer a lower temperature oven to give them time to melt before they start setting where i'll do a slightly warmer oven even up to 375 for cookies going direct but these these are so big that i want them to set and crisp up on the outside oh what should i well mine's at 325 should is that okay you think i would turn it up to 350. okay but the nice thing about cookies is they're not so delicate it's not like we've made a sponge cake and oh panic you know the oven's not the right temperature these are cookies so they're going to be fine and they should take about 10 minutes to bake okay that's what i said yep when i think of the whole category of baking in the world of sponge cakes and angel food cake and chiffons and meringues egg whites are just not a part of vegan baking no how do you feel about aquafaba aquafaba is pretty cool so it's taking the brine from a can of chickpeas you can actually even use like cannellini beans or navy beans like a light colored bean as well and that liquid you would normally toss down the drain you save that so one vegans are obsessed with beans so we have a lot of aquafaba lying around i accumulate it in a container and i keep it in the freezer oh okay then i can thaw that i usually have it pre-measured in half cup amounts um so that's always in my freezer i use it here and there i don't use it a lot uh i actually personally don't eat a lot of um chickpeas but um i i buy them for the aquafaba but it's really cool because you can take like a quarter cup of this brine and you whip it just as you would in your stand mixer or your hand mixer like for egg whites and it's the same viscosity and it does the exact same thing so it will it will transform into the volume of fluffy you know white peaks there was a chef like i think a french chef that discovered this and then it became very trendy a few years ago so i started experimenting with it when that happened there's like a community online like a facebook group of everybody exchanging ideas and talking about it and the guy sort of said like it's it's free to use like everybody like learn from each other so it's kind of cool for the community i used it i made like a lemon meringue pie tarts in my first cookbook and i tried and tried and tried to make this aquafaba following sort of just the standard whip it to the egg white texture add cream of tartar and a little bit of sugar and it wouldn't hold it would like deflate after a while so that wasn't very good for like keeping your tart stable for a whole day and i kept trying to look on other people's recipes and no one was doing anything different than that so i ended up adding xantham gum to the mixture and that created like a marshmallow ear hold to it so it actually stabilized the aquafaba meringue and it didn't turn into liquid after a while because i think egg whites would hold but this stuff didn't for some reason i guess the water content is higher anyway so it takes a lot of some experimentation but this was like a secret that i discovered and i was like okay the xanthan gum is all you need you just need i needed like a quarter teaspoon of it or something and xantham gum is a binder that you would normally see in gluten-free baking when there's no gluten in the flour that's your cornstarch yeah exactly i was totally thinking that that's an amazing tip oh my gosh now i can't wait to play with it because i've only played with the aqua faba in the most basic way yeah but in terms of flavor do you find using white bean over chickpea is there a choice in terms of do you taste it no you and what's so funny is you don't taste well i i don't and again i could just be used to it just like the flax but i don't taste bean anything it's completely neutral and when by the time you add like cream of tartar and a little bit of icing sugar it is exactly like egg white like it's like when you're making a meringue anyway for like lemon meringue pie it's pretty identical um i did another recipe so i took this cake a cake recipe that my mom had from when we were young and she'd make it all the time it's this four layer it's called hazelnut torte which is just i think the german word for cake or something but the recipe has a lot of whipped egg white in the batter and so i ended up doing the aquafaba egg white in replace of this and it actually worked amazing and the cake was very i would call it more like i guess sponge cake like very airy a lot of bubbles really light this cake ended up being exactly like how i remember eating it when i was a kid and it wasn't vegan so it worked really well in that instance but i have yet to try like angel food cake i haven't tried that um you know i think there's a lot of other i haven't made a pavlova with it so i don't know but i've seen recipes of people doing that this is why we have a baking day because now you've got me convinced to try it because i've always been a little bit leery i tell you what i will try making an angel food cake you using the aqua faba and i'll share the information but i totally want to look up that hazelnut torte my background's eastern european so i love those styles of desserts oh yeah this is a good one like a lot of people it's like a labor of love like it takes a while plus you're making four layers of cake so you have to do two separate batches of like you gotta do two at a time uh but i obviously you could handle it and it's uh it's really rewarding if it takes three days i don't care that's fine yeah i'm gonna dive right into that this is some amazing information um i think this is a great opportunity to take a break for our sponsor while our cookies bake and then when we come back of course we have to do the big reveal and the taste test and i want to hear about what other new projects you have coming down the line for sure all right we'll be right back if you're hot for lauren toyota's craveable vegan cooking then i know you're going to love oh she glows for dinner by angela lidden now you might know angela from her new york

hottest cookbooks go to penguinrandomhouse.ca cook and enter by december 7th that's penguinrandomhouse.ca cook and some restrictions do apply all right we're back and the chocolate chip cookies are about to come out of the oven lauren how are your vegan versions they're looking the right goldenness i believe and they've got nice body to them they're not super flat yeah they have the perfect body to them and i'll give you one last trick here are mine let's see if i can hold them up without them flying oh you know what i do i give the pan a smack as i'm setting them down to cool just like that what does that do it collapses the center of the cookie so it condenses the middle of the cookie so as you smack the cookie tray it flattens the cookie and then that center is guaranteed to stay nice and chewy i'm gonna do it well i didn't do it right that was a good smack and it's also fun okay i'm gonna do my second tray there we go yours okay yours though look like actual bakery chocolate chip cookies i've had a lot of practice i have made i i'm in the thousands when it comes to the cookies let's see they're pretty soft no i can still lift them i'm gonna lift mine me too okay in most cases i leave my cookies on the tray to cool yeah so many can be so fragile that they end up just crumbling if you try and lift them but these are holding their shape so i think we're good yours look like i would go to a really fancy bakery and then buy one to go and eat it but i feel like mine look like the kind that come in those like plastic containers at the grocery store bakery that's not good that's good no that's good they just we just have different looks to ours different looks what counts is they look homemade yeah because that's right you don't want someone to think that they were machine made at all so i love those little imperfections like i don't have even though i used a scoop i have some cookies here that are a little lopsided and i have some with more chips than others and we don't want tears and fights over that no but with the amount of uh chocolate chips you add in your recipe they're pretty evenly distributed and there's a lot of them throughout so it's nice you mentioned when we were chatting earlier about how long you've been vegan so how long have you been vegan it is going on year 10 right now do you mind me asking what the choice was why you made that decision oh yeah nah not at all um i i feel like my whole life i've always been i mean i've been into food but i've always been kind of like concerned about what i'm eating like i i just was always curious what am i eating what am i putting into my body and i always dealt with a lot of digestive issues and just not feeling good eating a lot of animal products so in 2009 i sort of had to start making this switch because i was just really not feeling good i was in a transitional period of my life with career and stuff so it was a good time to just sort of pay attention to my body and when i did it really was like you've got to cut out the animal products and not just me because i had been vegetarian as well for a bit of my life and always flip-flopped back and forth so it really was a it was a health and a physical issue for me that i wanted to solve but and i would say layered into that was just the guilt that i always felt uh eating animal products i just it never really sat right with me so um it was inevitable i think i'd have to go vegan and when i finally did it made a world of difference it's nice to hear that backstory but what i really admire is your approach in how you share your recipes and your cooking philosophy because you do it so easily and so relaxed that if someone is just approaching veganism or cooking for loved ones who are vegan you make it just so easy and accessible and the the style of your recipes in the style in which you present them i think is fantastic so thank you commend you and i i really hope you keep doing what you do well you have to because you're just so well loved and so popular you have no choice um can you pick up a cookie i can they're still hot do you find here's my thing with cookies is i'm always like mine are definitely like half the size of yours i had a bigger scoop yours look good too good no they look good they're just so isn't it funny how they settle differently exact same recipe but so different i find cookies are the type of thing although you want to eat them when they're warm they actually taste better when they're cooled off when sugar is warm it tastes sweeter like you think of drinking a sugary soda well you wouldn't drink it at room temperature it just could be unpalatable but ice cold it's delicious well the same goes yeah there's a point not a hot cookie but a warm cookie is is just spot on good analogy with the soda that's true um i think i have chocolate on my face oh yeah um what do you think well i'm a huge fan of the amount of chocolate chips in there it's basically chocolate chips with a little bit of batter surrounding with the thought of cookie dough all the work went into the dough and all we had to do was just eat chocolate chips yeah these are a great texture and it just it when you break into the cookie you can feel that sort of half inch of crispiness on the outside but then it is soft through the center and the chocolate is still melted right now and the aroma just wakes up the minute you crack into the cookie you can smell that combination of the brown sugar and chocolate which i think is just delightful it's no wonder these are a comfort classic right oh yeah big fan adding the pecans i like the pecans oh good yeah i forgot you added the pecans i i have mine oh natural mmm now that's you know a buttery taste you would describe it as buttery but of course there is no butter involved there so that's what i've always been amazed by when i started making the substitutions with vegan baking because i was asking you if you could taste the difference between flax and egg cookies i know now when there's egg in something it doesn't oh the taste to me tastes metallic like i don't like it i'm very turned off by it or i can even smell it and i found when i started baking vegan i was like oh everything has like a different like a more vibrant taste to it because it i could always just taste egg and i'm just weird like that where i didn't like it that's amazing to hear you describe the aroma as metallic but i know sometimes if i'm baking something like a genoise sponge which is all eggs um it does have an aroma that's different than say a vanilla butter based cake or another like that egg aroma baking is has its own yeah it's in its own world i'm so glad we were able to make these cookies together now you're constantly creating you're constantly creating new video content but you're also writing new recipes what new do you have for us that we can look forward to well i've been spent i spent the last year and a half making a new cookbook that comes out march 16th 2021 it's called hop for food all day my first book was called vegan comfort classics it was like sort of show stopping comfort food like classic stuff that you grew up with very nostalgic and i i cook like that all the time so i've taken that and just sort of infused it into everyday cooking the new book is a little more stuff that i just whip up myself on the daily a little more achievable a little easier less steps and another element to the book i'm doing in hot for food all day is i'm showing you how to take something you've made like let's say a corn chowder and then leveling up the leftovers into sort of two or three newly transformed recipes you take the soup and you like blend it i have it you blend it into a pasta sauce and you add other stuff and it totally takes on a new form and then you're tackling uh and avoiding food waste because that's another hot topic that sounds incredible i can't wait to check out a copy and i i like this approach too and your approach in general because would you say and tell me if i please tell me if i'm off track but there are some that might feel that jumping into vegan cooking is challenging or difficult or there's so many steps and so many ingredients um do you get asked that or you find that's a common misconception i think it's just the adjustment it takes to sort of understand the swaps of ingredients um and you know there are some new techniques but in general most of the cooking i do is all very standard stuff just with ingredient swap so in terms of techniques like you know frying or sauteing or any of these things it's all what you would do anyways with you know meat or fish or something like this but we're doing it with tofu or tempeh or certain vegetables what i learned early on when i started to cook this way was that it's the same amount of work and effort but i had to get used to just the sort of change of ingredients so i try to just talk people through that as best i can without it you know sounding pushy or intimidating but you kind of just have to dive in and start experimenting right but that's a logical way to approach it so it's not that the technique all of a sudden becomes radically different it's just how you look at the technique as the new ingredients are applied so that makes sense to me and you've made a lot of sense uh throughout our baking day because wow i have learned so much so many great tips i'm serious i am going to try the angel food cake so you'll be hearing from me with some results we'll see we'll see how the photos come out yeah i hope it's not a disaster i've been reading online about the angel food cake and so many people have had trouble but if anyone can do it i know that it's you and i'm so glad that you shared your signature chocolate chip cookie recipe with me because this one's gonna just i'm just gonna get rid of my recipe and use yours now that's fine just own it i'll just tell everyone these are anna's oh well lauren it's been so fabulous spending time with you today and i know our audience has just gleaned so much information and if they don't already have the oven preheated to bake a batch of cookies now well then we haven't done our job but at least we've got a full batch of cookies baked in front of us so lauren thank you so much and uh maybe we'll get to have another baking day together soon i hope so thanks for having me anna this is so fun cheers bye thank you for being a part of our baking day i hope you picked up a few baking tips along the way and had a few laughs i know we sure did you can buy your own copy of baking day at your favorite bookseller either online or in person or you can download the ebook version so you can have your very own baking day see you soon", "Zh6MorAIi7w": "hi everyone my name is Kevin Garvin and I'm responsible for the restaurants at Neiman Marcus throughout the United States and today I'm here to talk to you about the famous Neiman Marcus chocolate-chip cookie recipe see for me it started in 94 the first week on the job I got a letter in my office from a customer berating me for charging somebody $250 for a chocolate chip cookie recipe I knew nothing about this so I took it out into my office and I asked my team members out there tell me about this and they said you know this urban myth has been going around the country for a long time as the story goes someone came into one of our restaurants loved the chocolate chip cookies asked for the recipe the server said that they didn't have the recipe but they'd be happy to mail it to her the end of the month the customer got her bill and on the bill was 250 dollar charge for a cookie recipe now that's how the urban myth goes I will tell you it's never been true we've never charged anyone 250 dollars for a recipe period in 1994 I was told to take the letter down to PR PR would send a customer letters you know what it's not true and thank you very much for your time I ask PR at the time should we create a recipe and they said no no we just wanted to go away well in 1995 the web starts and that chain letter finds its way older than web and it blows up so I go into the kitchen and I create the recipe for the neiman-marcus chocolate chip cookie because I felt it would be better for us to be very proud about something and actually share with people the right recipe because what was on the web was not ours and I didn't like it to begin with and that's how we came up with the chocolate chip cookie recipe so a couple of things that you need to know about the recipe you know every day around 3:30 I would go into the restaurant looking for a cup of coffee and something sweet so as I was building the recipe with one of my clothes at the time we decided why don't we put the coffee into the cookie recipe well we put quickly decided that we needed to make sure it was decaf and so this is 94 early 95 and you know this is before Starbucks was on every corner long before the third wave of coffee companies around the United States so decaf really wasn't being drank by that many people so to find a decaf it was really hard but we had sank it in the office and Sanka was like the go to instant decaf for many many many years so we opened up a pack of Sanka and we use that after all these years though we do go into the kitchen and find a really really high-end meet half espresso we grind it really fine and that's what we use inside the kaabah chocolate chip cookie a couple of things to note about the chocolate chip cookie recipe we talked about the coffee now let's talk about the brown sugar because I go until a lot of kitchens sometimes and these cookies will be really super dark and I know right away that they use dark brown sugar so I'll go into the pantry and I'll find it I'll tell them no you need to use light brown sugar so make sure you use light brown sugar we talked about the decaf espresso so let's get started first thing we want to do is we want to add the butter to the mixer and you'll notice that I have a paddle attachment on here really important you want to have the paddle attachment so we add the butter and we're gonna add both sugars the brown sugar and the white sugar and this we're going to mix for about six minutes until it's nice and creamy why don't you come over here and check it out let me show you so see the way that's cream that's looking for you're looking for to be pruned no we're gonna slow down add our egg we're gonna add the vanilla now we're going to add the rest of the ingredients except for the coffee powder and for the chocolate chips we're gonna salt the baking powder baking soda one thing you want to make sure is when you add the chocolate chips and the coffee powder you don't over mix it because what will happen is the coffee powder could darken the cookie dough and I've seen it happen and you really want to just let it go for maybe a minute [Music] now you're gonna say 4 that's a lot of chocolate chips but you know what there's never too many chocolate chips in a chocolate chip cookie [Music] what I like to do is just kind of work the dough a little bit and then I'm gonna refrigerate this dough for about an hour before we scoop it and make it into what we call little cookie pucks you know one other thing that I just want to you know tell people about this dough if this if the butter is too soft all right what will happen is is that that will start to also activate the coffee powder and that will also turn the dough dark so you don't want the the butter to be too warm just one just perfect room temperature I think all right and that's it we'll come back in about an hour and we'll make the pucks all right you see the log of cookie dough has been in the freezer for about an hour and it can stay in the refrigerator overnight too as a matter of fact you could just actually make this into a long log and then just cut it as you need it but I'm gonna cut it about probably about a half an inch and then what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna form it a little bit with my fingers and I'm just gonna put it down there and that's a actually a sprayed pan stainless steel pan so no paper just a little bit of spray and that's how I'm gonna form the pucks just like that [Music] hey everyone just pull these out of the oven then we're in for about 20 minutes at 300 degrees and you'll notice that there's not a lot of color on them but at Neiman's we like to serve them soft and chewy so this is when we pull them and if you want to get them a little bit crispier leave them in for about another five to eight minutes and they'll crisp up really nice but this is the way we serve them at Neiman Marcus and this is what you're used to so enjoy everybody thank you [Music] [Music]", "6w0KCA5ieQY": "welcome back to how to cake it I'm Yolanda and this week I am taking giant chocolate chip cookies six so we can each have two cookies yes you're right make these six giant chocolate chip cookies I started by baking nine pounds of my ultimate vanilla batter and I divided the batter evenly between six 8-inch round pins naturally I folded in some chocolate chips and something to tell you guys I'm not sure if I've ever done this on how to make it I did not level these games there is no ruler in this out at lunch and like talk to it so basically what I'm going to do is just carve each one of these cakes like a cookie I also did not cut the carmelization off the bottom of these cakes Who am I I don't even know who I am anymore this is a really easy cake to carve you can't go wrong all you have to do is use just rated knife to create like peaks and valleys in whatever direction you want on the cookie just like a cookie okay I'm gonna let you guys in on a little insider information normally when I'm carving a cake sorry guys I only told the VIP it's not very important but it's interesting that's the kind of stuff that we include in our VIP videos which go out every Monday night and they also get a first look at that week's cake it's time for sir squeeze to roll up and simple syrup these cookies [Music] it's now time to crumb coat my cookies and I've decided to use chocolate ganache I think it just goes with the chocolate chip eNOS you know what I'm saying there's also no buttercream because ganache is quite thick it will dredge up the cake crumbs as your icing so you definitely don't want it to be on the thicker side if your ganache is too thick you should warm it up quickly for a couple of seconds so that it's nice and spreadable this okay but first cake hoodie as well as our best-selling hoodies are all on sale right now and had a cuckoo clock I got 99 problems but a cake hoodie ain't one I have more news you know how I always say crumb coat and chill right well I crumb coated them all and I put them on the side table and because ganache sets up quickly and it's so chilly in here I didn't end up chewing them I just crumb coated them all then I did another thin layer right over the crumb coat because like I said there was crumb dredging so I needed it to be a bit smoother so technically there was no crunch oh I know I know this might end up on TMZ but don't worry guys after I did that second ice of ganache I chilled the cakes so there was still a chill it was more like crumb coat and ice and chill Oh guys share this episode who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies I colored some fondant a tan color when you ice a cake with ganache and you have it in the fridge it tends to sort of dry out on the surface and so when I took my cookies back out it was on the hard side so I knew that the fondant wouldn't really stick to it so what I did is I just brushed a little bit of water around the edge the bottom edge of the cookie to make sure that the fondant when I pressed it on it would stick to the cookie then I rolled out my fondant nice and thin a little bigger than each cookie draped it over and I just used my to smooth it all into those grooves I created and around the side and then I push the excess fondant into the cookie all around and used a sharp paring knife to cut away the excess fondant I said excess fondant twice I said I pushed the accident well done it was great to meet so many of you at my book signings but I really wanted to be able to give this gift to the people who couldn't attend or perhaps live in countries that I didn't visit right now we have a limited number of cake books signed by me and had a cake accom so head over and pick one up before they're all gone now I've covered all six of my cakes and even though they look good I feel like they don't look like the chocolate chip cookie that I made before on this channel if you remember I did the Ice Cream Sandwich like the double-decker Ice Cream Sandwich so I went on my own blog I'm not joking and I remember that when I did that cake I flipped my fondant over and I pinched it like to create wrinkles and I don't know why I completely forgot I did that until I checked my own blog so I came up with a new idea I chilled the cookies for a bit so the fun it would get just a little dry in the refrigerator and then I used a brush like a dry paintbrush to just sort of mark out pathways if you will and then I simply used like my thumbs and my fingertips to pull out the fondant because when I pull the fondant naturally cracks and tears and so does a cookie I have nothing against smooth cookies but I just haven't seen a lot of them by the way the Ice Cream Sandwich cake that I just talked about is in my new ice cream cakes compilation over on how to take it step by step and you can watch it right here I gotta think of a new ice cream cake guys you can leave your ice cream cake ideas below thank you these cookies look good but they don't look like they were baked well you know what I mean yeah they look a little underdone so I just want to like give them some umph yeah chocolate chip cookies need mmm so to do that I'm not no I'm not using ivory I know what you're saying there was no ivory used in this video I dusted my cookie cakes with cocoa now you got to be careful I didn't use Dutch process cocoa which is what I like to bake with I used regular cocoa powder which is a bit lighter and you want to use a nice soft bristled brush so I actually have a makeup brush that I use here that I bought just for cakes and I applied it's like applying contour it's like blush you just want to lightly dab on the cocoa I mean recipes always say bake until Brown at the edges so that's what we're creating it's time for me to add the chocolate chips to this cookie but guys I just want to remind you I make a new cake every single week so please subscribe hit that notification bell and leave a comment below and let me know what you want to see me cake for my chocolate chips I'm using chocolate kisses because I think they look like giant chocolate chips I've always felt this way I'm going to use a little bit of melted chocolate to glue them to the cake I am gonna press in but I want them to stick to the fondant if I didn't put chocolate chips in it would it even be you know hydrant I told a beautiful the chocolate chip is the minimum amount of chocolate that requires in a cookie to be coming quickly you're right you're right unacceptable that's what's great about making a chocolate chip cookie cake you can put as many chips as you want that's you're just covering it orhan would be like there well I'm off to eat some giant chocolate chip cookies now you guys can check out my chips and dip tutorial over on how to cake it step by step right here and my lunch cakes compilation also on how to kick it step by step right here bye I'll see you next week", "ulqPugE0ApM": "- Hey, it's Geoffrey Zakarian for Delish. - Hiyo, I'm Chef Judy Joo. - Hey, Delish world. Andrew Zimmern here. - Hey friends, it's Chef Millie Peartree. - What is up, everybody? What's up Delish? It is Adam Richman. - Today we're gonna make one\nof the most delightful cookies on the planet: a chocolate chip cookie. - Today I'm going to show\nhow to make the ultimate chocolate chip cookies. (upbeat music) And it starts out with\nsome cold, cubed butter which I'm going to put\ninto my KitchenAid mixer. (bowl clanking) Cream that\n(mixer whirring) with two different types of sugar. I have some regular sugar. This is actually a vanilla\nsugar 'cause that's all I had. But you can use regular\nsugar if you want to as well. Some brown sugar, and you're gonna whip together\nwith the paddle attachment the butter and the sugars together until they come up nice and fluffy. Make sure your butter is cold. This also whips some air\ninto the butter as well to make a light, fluffy cookie. And then two eggs, one at a time. And then I've got two\ndifferent types of flour. I have cake flour as\nwell as regular flour. That's because the cake\nflour makes it nice and soft, a bit more tender, but you need the regular flour\nalso for the protein content so it has a structure. And a bit of corn starch\nalso, or corn flour which is gonna help with the tenderness. We'll put that in. Some salt, I'm using\npink Himalayan sea salt. A bit of baking soda. To mix my flour in, I'm going to put that in with a spatula 'cause otherwise it's\njust gonna go everywhere. First. (bowl clanking) And then cake flour. I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I'm just using regular chocolate. Of course, you use chocolate\nchips if you have them. I am mixing two different types, semi-sweet and bitter-sweet, and this is Amedei chocolate which is super, super,\nsuper good, very luxurious, but you know, why not? And I like to add walnuts into my chocolate chip cookies, too. If you don't like nuts, you don't have to, but I love walnuts in\nchocolate chip cookies. And then there goes my\nchocolate in there too. So, you don't wanna over mix\nit, so you put it on low. (mixer whirring) Just to mix it until it's incorporated. (mixer whirring continues) And that's good enough. And then we are are gonna\nmake gigantic cookies. So, I've modeled this\nafter my favorite bakery in New York City called Levain Bakery which is on the upper-west side. People line up on the\nsidewalk to eat these cookies, and I am guilty of doing this. Very rarely will I ever,\never line up for food, but it's because they're just,\nlike, the perfect combination of gooey versus cakey,\nand they're really big, and I like all the stuff\nthat they have in them, and they're just nice cookies. So, I decided when I was creating this ultimate chocolate chip cookie, I'm gonna make 'em big\nbecause size does matter at the end of the day. Oh my god, this is like a workout. I'm only gonna make eight\nhuge cookies with this. Probably about six ounces per cookie. Ugh. (cookie sheet rattling) These are gonna be so tasty. I mean there's nothing like\nan extra, extra big cookie. And so, those are my cookies,\nI have eight in total, and then I'm going to\nbake these in an oven for about 9 to 12 minutes, we'll see. Ooh, that's good. Ginormous cookies, I love this. Oh, so satisfying, just done. And those are my ultimate\nchocolate chip cookies. - Hey, Delish world, Andrew Zimmern here. This is the recipe that\nI make, not for me, but for my family 'cause\nit's the one that they love, especially my son. I tend to get really crafty, and, you know, oblique with\nchocolate chip cookies, and I have some real chocolate\nchip cookie fetishes. But this recipe is tried and true, and it's absolutely spectacular. First thing I do is I take my baking soda, I add it to my flour, and then I sift that together into a bowl. That's really important\nso that your baking soda combines with your flour, and that way you don't have\nany clumps that are in there. When you add your dry ingredients\nto your wet ingredients, they're gonna be\nincorporated more smoothly. Sugar goes into my standing mixer. Melted butter goes in there. And then of course, my corn syrup. I have many sweeteners\nin here for a reason. And my third-of-a-cup of brown sugar. Andrew Zimmern, why is\nthere sugar, brown sugar, and corn syrup in your recipe? Really easy, the sugars melt, caramelize, and provide crispness. The corn syrup makes sure\nthere's the chewiness in there. So I use all three sugars. Lock that. (mixer whirring) This goes to 10, I got it on six, right? And I'm gonna combine that for a minute and a half, two minutes. The more you mix this, you\nwant the sugars to melt, and you want it to cream in the butter, and you can see in there now\nit's actually doing that. So I'm gonna stop it because I don't want tons of air in there. Even though this isn't a cakey cookie, the more you mix, and the\nmore air goes in there, the cakier this is gonna be. In goes my vanilla, my milk, my egg yolk. And I'm just gonna turn this back on. (mixer whirring)\nWoo. And I'm not worried about getting all of that incorporated because those wet ingredients\ntend to incorporate really well, and really quickly. 10, 15 seconds, no big deal. And we're gonna incorporate\nour dry ingredients. And that's gonna include\nalso my pinch of salt. And then at this point,\n(mixer whirring) one, 'cause if I crank this up, it's flour, it looks like a episode\nof \"I Love Lucy\", right? (mixer whirs and clicks) And now I've not overmixed that. I've also cut down on the number of bowls that I need to wash later on. Let's get all of our cookie batter off of our paddle attachment. And then what I wanna\ndo is just scrape down the sides of my bowl towards the center, and give one turn of\nthis just to make sure that I have a nice,\nhomogenous cookie dough. Really good chocolate chips. These are Guittard, a French company. You can take a really good\nchocolate bar and break it. I don't like milk chocolate in my cookies. This is a bitter-sweet,\nbut I like real chocolate. Please, no letters, but like, Hershey's Chocolate\nhas, like, so many... it's just not even really chocolate. I like real, pure chocolate\nin my chocolate chip cookies. And then my favorite thing is pecans. I love 'em, sorry walnut people. I don't like walnuts, but I love pecans. And I toasted those before hand. And I'm just gonna stir this together. Oven is preheated, tray is\nhere, baking paper is down. With this particular cookie,\nI don't like to do... If I'm doing shortbread\nor something like that, I love making minis. This particular recipe\ndoesn't make minis so well because by the time you\nhave that crisp chewiness, the tops are overcooked. This one is just, that's a\nmonster, monster cookie, right? The other thing that you could do is get two like-sized spoons. (light music) Now remember, all this is gonna melt so it's great if they are\nstanding up like that. You can also always moisten your finger and squish them down. I'm just gonna space these apart onto my trays so that I have lotsa room, and I know they don't run together. I'm just making that the batter is tight so as these bake, they don't\nhave big holes of air in there that would cause me to\nhave cracks or fissures, or cookies that aren't\nuniform in thickness 'cause I'm just say it would horrify any of my pastry chef friends. I'm just gonna squeeze\nthat extra one in there that's gonna go against the side. It's kind of like a tester. So we're gonna go at 375,\nusually like 8, 9, 10 minutes. When they're down, and the\nedges starting to crisp, I bring 'em out. You can drop 'em, and do the bang thing. I love the texture of that, I love the way it flattens 'em right away, and then we cool 'em, and eat 'em. Other thing to remember, they're gonna keep cooking\non that hot pan, right? So once you see some browning\naround the edges and stuff, start getting vigilant, and start thinking about getting\nyour cookies out of there. (light music) (pan slamming) So these have cooled for,\nI don't know, 20 minutes, and you can see what's\nhappened to the cookies here. You can see the part that's crunchy, and the middle that's chewy, that's what happens\nwith those three sugars, and that's how these cookies should look. Typically when we're making food videos here in our studio kitchen, some people take a bite of\nthings and stuff like that, but unless it's lunch,\neveryone is so picky, and you know, there's\n40 people in the room, and they don't touch anything, these cookies would be gone in 30 seconds. See, crunchy bottom, soft on the inside with that chewy, sort of\ncaramely, crunchy texture. That is a world-class\nchocolate chip cookie. Like, this one could use\nan extra pinch of salt. Mm, but delish, and by the way, you can finish them like that too. If you're making a batch,\nand you taste the first one, sprinkle them with flake salt\non the way outta the oven. Mm, wow, is that good. And it's crun-chewy, which to me is what defines\na good chocolate chip cookie. - Hey, friends. So, in order to make my oatmeal,\nchocolate chunk cookies, these are the ingredients we'll need. You'll need a couple\neggs, one stick of butter, AP flour, quick-cooking\noats, chopped walnuts, bakers chocolate. It's very important, in my opinion, to use bakers chocolate\nversus chocolate chips only 'cause they have stabilizers in it, and when we eat chocolate chunk cookies, you wanna be able to have\na good bite of chocolate, in every nook and cranny of the cookie. It's super delicious that way. We're gonna use some\ngranulated sugar, salt, pure vanilla extract,\nlightly-packed light brown sugar, and baking soda. And what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna sieve it. And the reason why I\nlike to sieve my flour is to get all of the\nbumps and lumps out of it. And then we're gonna add\nour salt and baking soda. And we're gonna combine this\nto our quick-cooking oats. (sieve grinding) Simple enough, right? Now next up is we're\ngonna take our butter, and we're gonna add it to our mixer, and it's very important that\nwe use room-temp butter. We're gonna add our sugars. (mixer whirring) And we're gonna cream these\ntogether until combined. (mixer whirring increasing) So, once our sugar and our\nbutter is evenly incorporated, we're gonna add one egg at a time. And it's very important that\nyou crack it in a bowl first because you never know\nwhen you'll get a bad egg. I like oatmeal, I necessarily didn't want\nraisins at the moment even though I'm a fan of raisins. But I wanted to combine oatmeal cookies and chocolate chip cookies. So now we're gonna slow\nthis down a little bit, and we're gonna add\nour dry ingredients in. And make sure we mix\nall of our flour, sugar, baking soda, and quick-cooking oats. I'm gonna slowly add it in\njust until it's combined. And we're not gonna overmix this 'cause nobody want no tough cookies. (hands clapping) We're not doin' that today. Okay, now that our bowl is combined, we're gonna turn off our mixer, and we're gonna scrape it down. Oh, I forgot to add our vanilla extract. We can just add that in, be sure we get that nice and incorporated. Then we're gonna add all of\nour chocolate chunk pieces, and we're gonna add our walnuts. Totally omit the walnuts\nif you don't like 'em. I love walnuts. So make sure you give this a good stir. And if you want, you can\nadd a pinch of cinnamon to this if you would like. I like those warm notes\nsometimes during the holidays, but just make sure you have\nit all evenly combined. After we have all of our\ningredients combined, we're gonna take a cookie sheet, and we're gonna take a scoop, (scooper clicks) and you can do 'em however\nbig or small you want. I want a nice, big cookie. And we'll just scoop it on\nto an ungreased cookie sheet. (scooper scraping) Make sure you leave some space in between because these beauties will spread. And my hands are super clean just in case the glove police come on here and start commentin', \"Why she\ntouchin' it with her hands?\" You only have to use gloves\nfor food that's ready to eat. So, with the fact that\nwe're cooking this off, I don't have to use gloves. Okay, so we got six, big cookies. We're gonna pop 'em into\na 325 preheated oven for approximately 12 to 15\nminutes, depending on doneness. See you guys in a little bit. (cookie tray clanking) So, hey friends, now that\nthese are out the oven, we're gonna cool 'em on a rack for about five minutes or so, I guess, or however long you can wait to eat them. I like them super moist\nwith some ice cream, but we're gonna let\nthem cool a little bit, and then we're gonna dunk\n'em in some almond milk. Mm-hmm. Mm, mm, mm. Chewy, crunchy, salty. Everything you want in a cookie. Mm-hmm. (light music) - Hey, it's Geoffrey Zakarian for Delish, and we are here with two\nvery special sous chefs: - Anna. - Madeline. - And I'm dad, and today we're gonna make one of the most delightful\ncookies on the planet, a chocolate chip cookie. First things first, we have to measure and\nweigh out everything called mise en place, and have it ready so we can just enjoy ourselves. We don't have to run to the\nfridge or run to the pantry. Let's begin, what's the first step? - [Madeline] So, the first step, Anna's gonna put in the butter. I'm gonna cream the butter with the white sugar and brown sugar. (mixer whirring) - [Anna] Yeah. - [Madeline] And we're gonna\nput that on, like, medium speed so it doesn't fly everywhere. Anna, do you wanna put the eggs in? - [Anna] Yeah. So this is just an egg\nyolk and one whole egg. - This is called creaming, right? - Yeah. - We're gonna add the vanilla next. And then the baking soda, and... - [Anna] Baking powder. - [Madeline] No, soda. - [Anna] It's soda?\n- [Madeline] It's soda. - Oh. (chuckles) - And salt. I like to always scrape\nit down on the sides to get everything in.\n- [Anna] Looks good. - [Geoffrey] I like to eat it right now. - [Madeline] Do you wanna\nadd some of the flour in? - [Anna] Yep.\n- [Madeline] And we're gonna do this in parts, like,\nthree of that in parts. You can add a little. That's good. And then we're gonna do that.\n- Madeline's the baker in the family. (light chuckling) (mixer whirring) Oh! (giggling) - All right, now you wanna put some more? (bowl clanking) (giggling) Here wait, ah. - There ya go. Slowly so it doesn't foof everywhere. (mixer whirring increasing) - And you can get faster as you go. - Whoop.\n(Anna giggling) - It's fun to make a mess in the kitchen. - Yes, especially when\nsomeone else cleans up. - [Both] (laughing) - So, the real secret to\na good chocolate chip, to have really have that nice balance is the mixture of white sugar and brown sugar\n- And brown sugar. because the brown sugar\nhas an ingredient in it that makes it nice and\nsoft, it's called molasses, and that's why brown\nsugar is such a great... It makes that perfect balance between crispy and chewy, right? - Yeah. Do you wanna add some of them? (chips sprinkling)\n- Um. - Stop, stop. Now what I do is I just fold it in. And then I have a baking tray, and you set your oven to 350 degrees, and I take a little ice cream scooper, but with this one, I take it out, and this just helps me get the shape. And I'm going to put three,\nand then two, three, two. You will have extra, so I like to put that in the freezer for, like, another day, right?\n- [Anna] Or, for cookie dough? (chuckles)\n- Yeah, our cookie... well no, it has eggs in it, but... - You don't want 'em to be too close 'cause then when they bake, they go down.\n- Smoosh. - So it'd be all one big cookie. - [Madeline] That happened to me once. - [Anna] Yeah, I remember that. And then we just ate the whole big cookie. That was really good. - Yeah, I think that\nthis is a great recipe, and, you know, you can buy cookies, but it's so easy to make. You just follow the steps\nand get everything ready. - And if you have your mise en place. - Mise en place, really\nimportant, and don't over whip. When you over whip, you develop the gluten and the proteins in the flour. - Yeah.\n- So you wanna make sure you don't do that. - And also it's really\ngood, like, easy thing for kids to do. - Yeah.\n- Plus, it's fun. - It's fun.\n- And delicious. - But, it's only... what's\nthe oven on, Madeline? - 350 degrees. (Geoffrey grunting)\n- So, these are them, and then... - Hot, hot. It's hot, careful. Wanna us to share one? - Yeah, sure. - Hot. - Woo. Ah, good.\n- Mm. Uh-huh. - Mm. - That is really good. Thank you Anna and Madeline. And thank you Delish. - What is up, everybody?\nWhat's up, Delish? It is Adam Richman coming to you from my home in Brooklyn, New York. I hope you and yours are staying safe, and staying well, and\nstaying six feet apart. Anyway, I have always loved\nchocolate chip cookies. It has a massive connection\nto the memories of my youth, to gatherings with people, and the truth of the matter\nis I don't have my own recipe. I've always used the one on\nthe back of the Toll House box. But what really sets my, sort of, Toll House cookie situation apart is what I do with the\ndough once I've made it. So, let's make some cookies. Super simple. It's flour, sugar, salt. Just gonna mix it all together. I even have the wooden spoon my mom used to make cookies with. I asked her for that for this recipe, so. So, we have our dry ingredients mixed. Now we're going to mix the wet. So, I've already softened some butter. Now I'm going to add 3/4 of a cup of white sugar, and brown sugar. One time, as a little kid, I had actually messed the measurements up, and added so much butter. Let's suffice it to say I was\nplaying the old butt trumpet for a very long time. It was not the best cookie. Okay, so we have our\nsugar, our melted butter, and now we have our vanilla extract. D-E-A, delicious. First, add the eggs, and\nthen our dry mixture. Combine it all, and it's\ngonna go in the oven. Of course, it was always a\nbattle when you were a kid everybody wanted to lick the spoon, but no spoon licking in this video. The best part, adding in the Toll House Morsels. We're gonna add them in. I will try not to get\nany on the floor, sorry. My cousin (chuckles) never\nlets me live it down. (chip bag crinkling) Okay, we have our batter mixed,\nwe have our oven preheated. We're gonna drop it on an\nungreased baking sheet, making sure we leave enough space because the cookies will flatten. We don't want them to stick together. I like my cookies slightly under-baked, plus they carry so much residual heat, they're gonna keep cooking a little bit. (mid-tempo music) All right, there's our\ncookies on the tray. We're gonna put it in the oven, set the timer for about eight minutes, and then check on 'em then. (cookie sheet banging) Okay so, the thing that I'm\ngoing to do with the rest of this wonderful cookie dough that I have is make a little thing that\nI've seen called a pizookie. I guess it's sort of a\nportmanteau of pizza and cookie. I'm gonna take the rest of\nmy dough outta this bowl and put it right into my pan. Spread it out evenly. If there are bald spots, or spots where the\nbatter is a little thin, it's actually not gonna come out as great. And it's okay to use your hands 'cause you're gonna throw\nit in a 375 degree oven, so it will be a sterile environment. Excellent. And then you can basically bake it according to the same directions\nthat you baked the cookies. Let's put it in the oven. (pan banging) Oh, there's nothing like that smell on Earth, I tell ya. Come on. Having cool air underneath it\nwill help it cool even faster. Well, the proof, they\nsay, is in the pudding. Mm. Come on. Mm-hm. This is good. But I'm gonna show you\nhow to take your cookies to the next level. Now, you have to remember, the small cookies cook in 8 to 12 minutes because they're that big. The pizookie is a bigger cookie which means the center is still\ngonna take a while to set. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. The things cookie dreams are made of. Oh, the only thing better than a cookie is a great big gigantic cookie smothered in ice cream and whipped cream. And there is our pizookie. Absolutely beautiful to\nlook at, fun to share. Make sure people know it's hot, give them a bunch of spoons,\nand let 'em just attack. - Thank you so much, Delish.

do on lazy afternoons oh yes you guessed it I love to bake homemade chocolate-chip cookies and today on Davis can cook I'm going to show you how to make the best old-fashioned chocolate-chip cookies ever these chocolate chip cookies they bake up so crisp and chewy on the outside and the inside is just gooey and loaded with chocolate so if you want to learn how to make them just keep on watching okay in a medium-sized bowl I'm gonna add my flour followed by some salt and a little bit of baking soda here now I'm going to whisk it until it's nice and combined it's like that and then we're going to set it aside all right in a larger bowl I'm going to add my brown sugar my white sugar I'm going to add in some softened butter followed by some Crisco it's regular shortening and some vanilla extract and we're going to add in my slightly beaten egg and now I'm just going to give it a good mixing just to get it nice and creamy okay and then we're going to add half of that flour mixture to this wet mixture here I'm going to use my mixer to get it combined and then I'm going to add in the other half and I'm gonna use my spatula this time because it's gonna start getting really really thick all right and just keep stirring it into a dough forms never gonna add in all those chocolate chips don't be shy with these chocolate chips honey load it in there just like so all right now I'm gonna take about a tablespoon size of dough and just roll it into a ball just like that we're gonna place this on my baking stone I have lined with parchment paper I only bake on baking stones okay they are the best for cookies all right into my 375 degree preheated oven and out come these lovely little beauties I'm gonna let them sit in the pan for a bit just to finish baking outside of the oven all right that's going to ensure a nice chewy cookie and now all you do is wait the painful painful part of waiting letting them cool off oh I hate that part I never wait all right but that's it enjoy I hope you guys like this video bye-bye", "-DSHXHsEyIc": "hey lovelies so I will fully admit that I am NOT the most avid Baker out there but come the fall season I start craving some sweet baked goods and I always know that that means it is time for cookies and today we are celebrating cookies three delicious ways and I couldn't be more excited I'm gonna get started today by sharing a recipe for some classic snickerdoodles if you've never had a snickerdoodle yes the name is a bit silly but the flavor is on point it's got a cinnamon II finish that is perfect for fall and they're really really easy to make so we have got some all-purpose flour in our bowl to that I'm going to add a little cream of tartar and some baking soda the cream of tartar in a snickerdoodle recipe is absolutely essential because it gives the cookies just a touch of Tang I'm also going to be adding a little salt to this as well as a good helping of cinnamon I'm gonna whisk this all together so that it's well combined and then it will set those aside while I get to work on beating up some butter now I like using room-temperature butter in my baking it's just gonna make your life a whole lot better we're just going to beat that better butter with our beater until it's nice and light and fluffy and then we will add some sugar to this now traditionally in cookies I usually use a combination of white sugar and brown sugar but snickerdoodles usually call it for just white sugar so that's what I'm using here I'm also going to be adding one egg to this recipe as well as a good helping of vanilla extract we'll mix all of those together and then we can get our dry ingredients mixed up into our wet ingredients I like adding my dry ingredients one half at a time because it just makes for a little less mess in the kitchen and help this get nice and incorporated and you'll see that your dough is gonna be quite crumbly but it's just a matter of sort of packing it together when we make our cookies just before we get to rolling our cookies I'm going to mix up my cinnamon sugar mixture which as the name suggests just involves mixing sin and some sugar together in a bowl then we're just going to use our handy dandy cookie scoop to scoop some dough roll it into a ball and then we'll roll it in my cinnamon sugar mixture and then I'm just going to arrange these on a parchment lined baking sheet then we'll get these into the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for between 10 and 12 minutes you'll know they're ready when they're just a little golden on the bottom and they start to crackle a bit on top that is always a good sign when they come out of the oven it is critically important that you exercise patience and let them cool at least five minutes before diving in what you're gonna end up with are these amazing soft chewy cookies that are just so good with a glass of milk now what kind of Canadian would I be if I didn't have a maple cookie for you guys this fall I am making these awesome maple pecan cookies maple syrup obviously is in abundance here in Canada and I use it in just about everything sweet dishes and savory dishes they love it so so much these start once again with my dry ingredients I'm just going to whisk up a little bit of flour with the baking soda and a touch of salt once that's all mixed up I will go ahead and set it aside and get to work on beating up my butter with my hand mixer I'll be adding some brown sugar to this and once that's nice and light and fluffy I am going to be adding some maple syrup as well as an egg and a little bit of vanilla extract if you want it to amp up that maple flavor even more here you could also add a splash or two of the maple extract but totally not necessary if the maple syrup does go a long way once that's all mixed up we can go ahead and add our dry ingredients to this and once our dough has formed the final step will be folding in our nuts now if you want to keep these cookies nut free you definitely can but I think that the combination of the maple syrup and some chopped pecans is just perfection so I'm going to get a good helping of those in I really like what the pecans do to the texture of these cookies because they're really soft and sort of chewy and the pecans give them just a bit of good crunch I'm going to form my cookies the very same way using my cookie scoop I'm just going to roll them into balls and then arrange my freshman line baking sheet and to make these extra special I am actually going to be adding one pecan half to the top of each of my cookies these will head into the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes or so now of course because you're hungry you may pull these out of the oven a little too soon we think it's really important that you take a pecan see to make sure there are a little golden before you do finally my friends if you are looking for an absolutely earth-shattering cookie to change your lives then you have come to the right place because I am going to show you how to make these unbelievable giant crinkly chocolate chip cookies that will actually change the way you look at cookies forever now if you are not familiar with these cookies I certainly cannot take credit for them a few years ago this recipe was shared in the New York Times and it basically broke the internet because they are so tasty but they're actually really easy to make they start as all of our cookies have with our dry ingredients so I have got my old purpose flour in a bowl I'm going to add some baking soda than that and a good helping of salt we're adding a little more salt than usual in this recipe it just helps to sort of offset all of that nice sweet chocolate and we're just gonna whisk that together so it's nicely combined and then we will work on our wet ingredients so we're gonna start by beating up our butter once that's gotten nice and light and pale and fluffy we can go in with our sugars so I've got some white sugar here as well as some brown sugar once our sugar and our butter is well combined we're gonna go ahead and get our egg in here as well as some vanilla extract once that's all beaten up we'll add our dry ingredients to our wet ingredients and bring them together in doughy matrimony at this point the final step is going to be adding our chocolate chips which in this recipe actually aren't chocolate chips at all we're using some finely chopped semi-sweet chocolate and the reason chopped chocolate is so delicious is because you get more chocolate per bite and it sort of spreads out and makes this amazing marbled effect now when I called these cookies giant I really wasn't kidding the recipe calls for using 1/3 of a cup of joe or cookie that's a lot of dough and a lot of cookies this ice cream scoop is just a little less than that but I love my cookies being uniform so I'm gonna use it just scoop my dough and form my cookie is obviously it is really important because these cookies are gonna spread out quite a bit to give them some space on your baking sheet I think maximum for cookies for baking sheet just before baking these it is really important to get them into the freezer for 15 minutes no more no less I know guys this is science and not art so it's important to follow these instructions carefully while those are in the freezer we are going to preheat our oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and one set of them is preheated we are going to get our frozen cookies straight into the oven and let them cook undisturbed for 10 minutes at the ten minute mark you're going to notice that they will have spread out almost completely and that means it's time to go in with some other knits and give the tray a couple good slabs now I know this sounds a little unorthodox but what happens is you start to create these little ripples on the cookies and what you're gonna end up with is this incredible crispy exterior but this soft and chewy interior that is just absolutely to die for we'll let our cookies cook for another two minutes before going in again with the very same technique we're going to do this three or four times until our cookies had these amazing ripples through them and they bake for between 16 and 18 minutes at that point out of the oven they come but you will still have five full minutes to wait before you fight your husband for them and trust me when I tell you guys these are cookies worth fighting for they are crisp around the edges soft and chewy in the center and unbelievably perfect when dips get a glass of milk if I haven't yet convinced you of the awesomeness of these cookies I highly recommend you give them a try for yourselves in fact I hope you try all three of these tasty recipes and if you do be sure to tweet me Instagram me or Facebook me a photo because I love seeing your kitchen creations the full recipes are linked in the description box below you can find them there and finally if you haven't already be sure to

cookie and it's actually my favorite chocolate chip cookie of all and I have made several over the years and this one is made with coconut flour which is my absolute favorite flower to use so if you guys are ready to see this easy low-carb keto chocolate chip cookie recipe I'm going to show you how it's done so first of all you're going to take a medium mixing bowl and you're going to take 1/2 cup of golden sweetener now you can use the swerve brown sweetener but my favorite is to use the la canto golden monk fruit sweetener but like I said you do want to use a brown sweetener just because it gets that nice authentic chocolate chip cookie flavor because chocolate chip cookies the Toll House variety anyway uses a brown sugar and then you're going to want to mix in a half a cup of butter now I have gone dairy-free so instead of using butter my preference is to use butter flavored coconut oil and then one teaspoon of vanilla extract and two large eggs and you beat that with an electric mixer until everything is well blended together then you're going to stir in a half a cup of coconut flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and a quarter teaspoon of salt and then after that mixture is well combined with the butter mixture then you're going to fold in a half a cup of low-carb keto friendly chocolate chips now my favorite chocolate chips to use for this recipe is either homemade ones or the choc zero chocolate chips Chuck zero is actually my favorite keto chocolate of everyone that I've tried so if you can get Chuck zero that's the one I recommend if you don't have the time to make your own chocolate chips and I do have a video as well for how to make your own sugar-free low-carb keto friendly chocolate chips and I'll go ahead and post that link to the video where I show how to make them and there's two ways you can make your own sugar-free chocolate chips you can either chop them up in chunks or you can use little chocolate chip candy molds so you get the little chip pack shape it does take longer and it is a bit Messier to do it that way but I show you the trick that I use to make sure I get the chocolate right into each individual chip mold okay so once you've had your chocolate chips mixed into the cookie dough batter then you're going to go ahead and make your cookies like you would any cookies so I like to use a cookie scoop but you can go ahead and use two tablespoons and just spread it out on I like to use a lined cookie sheet and my preference is to use a silicone mat baking mat on them but you could use parchment paper as well so you're going to want to go ahead and shape all your cookies out and I get about two dozen cookies with this recipe now it will vary a little bit depending on how what size scoop you use but for my scoop and it might be about a tablespoon or maybe a little bit less I get 24 cookies so once you've got all your cookie dough scoops onto your baking sheet or your lined baking sheet then I slide each dough ball out with my fingers you can also use the bottom of a cup to flatten each one out then you're gonna bake them in a preheated 350 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown then you'll let them cool slightly and then remove them from the pan and put them on a on a wire rack to cool completely now I should note with low carb cookies they do tend to be pretty crumbly right after you've baked them so what I found is that of course they're so delicious you have to eat one right away right but what I found is that if I put most of them in the refrigerator overnight the next day they are really perfect and I think that's because after being chilled the fat just kind of holds everything together so if you bake these cookies and you find them to be a little bit crumbly or any low-carb cookie and you find it to be a little crumbly go ahead and put them in the fridge and see how they do after they've been chilled now I do store them in the fridge as well and these cookies can be frozen as well for up to three to six months so if you have trouble with self-control like I sometimes do you might want to hide them in the freezer so you don't eat the whole batch at once I really hope you like these low-carb coconut flour chocolate chip cookies and be sure to let me know what you think in the comments if you do give them a try and that's it for now if you'd like

day where ever you are today I'm not sure how to make some unbelievably delicious chocolate chip keto cookies now when I say unbelievably I mean it guys when I first say these cookies I was like where do I know that taste from these are so good I know this cookie from somewhere and then it dawned on me that it was from my mom's chocolate chip cookie recipe from when I was a little kid when she'd make cookies from scratch when they were not keto friendly they were loaded with sugar they were loaded with carbs and for these two tastes just like those is on real guys so I'm super pumped to share the recipe with you guys today I think you're gonna dig these cookies let's get in this one let's get cooking all right so in a large bowl I'm gonna add 3/4 of a cup of some almond flour next I'm gonna add 2 tablespoons of a your Thrall sugar substitute followed by a half a teaspoon of baking soda a quarter of a teaspoon of baking powder and just a pinch of salt all right so now at this point I'm just gonna use a wire whisk to mix all those ingredients together until they're combined once they're combined I'm gonna add 1 beaten egg 2 tablespoons of some melted coconut oil a teaspoon of vanilla extract and of course we're also gonna add about 1/3 of a cup of some sugar-free chocolate chips so at this point as you can see I'm just gonna work all the ingredients together with my spatula until everything's combined and the cookie dough starts to take shape once it does you want to scoop about tablespoon sized cookie dough scoops onto a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper and you'll want to bake these cookies at 325 degrees for about 12 to 15 minutes the tops of them should just be golden brown they don't have to be totally hard guys they'll set in the tray itself let them cool completely in the tray and once they're totally cool check this out they're soft and chewy it's so delicious all right so that's today's keto cookie recipe I hope you enjoyed it

and I will see you guys in the next video [Music]", "xinxzsvDAIQ": "hey guys welcome back to my channel in the next few tutorials you may notice a slight difference now in this period of uncertainty I don't have access to my normal recording or baking equipment because I'm also changing location but don't worry I've come up with a feed back to basic recipes which involves no fancy equipment or ingredients so I hope you enjoy these recipes I hope you try them out and most importantly stay safe ok so here it is my ultimate cookie recipe loads of you requested this one so I hope you enjoy it so what I found out with cookies it's not actually so much about the recipe it's more about how you prepare the dough and then the cooking so I'll try the best way I can to explain every single step of the way in order to achieve the perfect cookie I've also listed the quantities and ingredients on the screen here so feel free to screenshot this now for you to keep for future reference so I'm going to start with some melted butter it is unsalted butter you can use salted but I prefer adding a salt myself but before I do that I'm going to add my white sugar and brown sugar and now I'm going to add the salt I'm also going to add some vanilla and mix that all together now I only have Demerara sugar here but usually I used the soft dark brown sugar I think it gives slightly more caramel flavor however the Demerara sugar works perfectly well too so once the sugar butter and vanilla has combined I'm going to add my egg and my yolk and mix that in I'm using a whisk simply because it breaks up the egg better but now I'm going to add my flour so I'm going to change for a spatula so you can either use self-raising flour or plain flour with added bicarbonate of soda both work but I simply can't find any self raising flour so I'm adding the bicarb myself I've written both quantities in the caption box below and I'm going to stir that in until a soft cookie dough is formed now this is a great base of a cookie dough recipe where you can add different ingredients to this so I'm going with a classic chocolate chip combination but you can add some raisins or some nuts as long as you keep the quantities the same so once the flour is mixed in I can now go in with my chocolate chips I like using the small chocolate chips and I'm using dark and white I think the smaller chocolate chips disperse more evenly throughout the cookie dough and every bite of cookie you get a good amount of chocolate whereas with the larger chunks you may not get some chocolate in some bites which to me isn't OK when it comes to cookies so I'm going to mix that in until all the chocolate is dispersed evenly and you can see it's quite a soft dough now that's because I started off with melted butter but as always I think using melted butter helps incorporate all the ingredients evenly rather than creating some sugar and butter clumps that don't make sense so essentially this is the cookie dough ready now at the beginning I was talking about how you cook the cookies and that's what the important bit is this dough is way too soft so if we cooked this now the cookies will totally spread out so I'm actually going to put this bowl in the freezer to make it nice and firm even before I spoon the cookies so I'm going to firm up the dough in the freezer for 10 minutes because then I'm going to spoon out the mixture and it's just gonna make my life a lot easier if the dough is further so I've left it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and you can see how much thicker and firmer the dough is so it's gonna be a lot easier to spoon and shape now I would use an ice cream scoop reason being you get a nice bull shape and every single one will be even size but I don't have an ice cream scoop with me at the moment so I'm going with a spoon and roughly estimate the size of each cookie so I'm going to spoon some dough into my hand and create a rough ball shape and then I'm transferring them onto a tray but this isn't to cook the cookies because I'm going to freeze them again before I cook them and I'll explain why but what I want to do now is just roll the cookies into balls roughly the same size and prepare them for baking so with this quantity you'll roughly get about 12 cookies but it does depend how big or small you roll them just bear in mind that if you do change the sizes the cooking times will vary I also think the size that I'm making now creates the perfect chewiness to small ones tend to get a little drier so once again these look like they're ready to bake but I'm going to freeze them for now half an hour because I want these totally solid I think this is the ultimate tip to baking cookies because you cook them from cold they'll take longer to spread out which means the center will stay nice and chewy whereas the outside will be cooked and you get that crispy outer edge and yet too weak Center just how a cookie should be so I'm going to put this tray in the freezer for a further 30 minutes so the cookie dough balls are nice and firm and I'm just gonna roll them once again to make them a little bit more even and now they're ready to bake so I've preheated the oven at 180 degrees Celsius you need to bear in mind that cookie spread in the oven so as for straightening as it is only fitting 5 on a tray I promise you it's worth it because the last thing you want to happen is that all the cookies spread into each other you want to keep a nice round shape so I'm going to do two trays at a time and these cookies are gonna bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the outer edge of the cookie start to brown but the inside is still pale so when the cookies have baked this is what you're looking for that beautiful golden color but still quite pale in the middle and that indicates that they're still gonna be nice and chewy now as tempting as it is to take one straightaway while they're piping hot from the oven do not touch the cookies until they're completely cold otherwise they will simply fall apart and this is a real test because they smell unbelievable and are very tempting once they're cooled you can now transfer them and you can see that when I pick it up it still holds in one piece and look how perfectly cooked they are you can still see that chewy Center and they baked evenly on the bottom too now I think with cookies they will never be perfect circles but I honestly don't think that's a problem as long as they're roughly the same size they look extremely appetizing and as always I'm going to attempt to you by breaking one in half just so you can see how chewy and gooey the center is look at that and you can see that the chocolate is dispersed evenly and it's everything that you want from a cookie so there you go that is my ultimate cookie recipe try it out yourself if you do take a photo and tag me on instagram at georges cakes i have feeling that this is gonna be our new favorite recipe to try I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and see you soon with more videos on the way [Music]", "YIiHiMXOeYU": "hi there today we're gonna make chocolate chip cookies this is a really easy recipe here are all the ingredients and this is what we need we need 1 cup of softened butter 2 eggs you're going to need 2 cups of chocolate chips 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 2 teaspoons of vanilla you're also going to need 1 cup of brown sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar and also 2 cups of all-purpose flour we're going to turn all this into beautiful chocolate chip cookies so let's get started okay we're back what we're gonna do is we're going to take our softened butter then pop it in there we're also gonna throw in the white sugar and the brown sugar and the first thing that we want to do is we want to get this cream we want to cream this up now what we're going to do is we're going to break two eggs and we're gonna add that in with the vanilla what I always like to do is break the egg one at a time into a bowl so there's the first egg just so that you make sure that we don't get any shells if you're doing an omelet and you've got 80 or ten eggs and you get a shell in there it's a little harder to get out there we go there's the second egg and we'll throw in the vanilla and we'll get that going again that looks good okay now what we're gonna do is take another bowl and take your two cups of flour and take your salt and your baking soda and put that in there then you can just give it a little stir the spoon and then what we're going to do is we're going to slowly incorporate this into the batter no laughing a little bit I'll add another bit but this point the batter is done now the only thing we have left to do is to add in the chocolate chips so I'm just gonna pour them all in and hopefully my little mixer will be strong enough your mixer at this point if your mixer is not strong enough you can just simply get a spatula and fold this stuff in at this point that's it for the dough so I'm gonna clean up my work area and I'll come back and we'll bake some cookies all right I'm back and what we're gonna do now is we're going to just grab some of the dough make any size you want I usually go something like that a good tablespoon just take your other spoon and just push it off you can make them small bake different sizes if you want but if you're gonna do it different sizes you're better off to bake them on a different sheet because if you make a larger cookie it's gonna have a different baking time so if you've got small ones and large ones on the same pan the smaller ones are gonna you know they're gonna do faster than the other ones so I'll continue doing this and I'll be back okay I've finished off the tray I didn't move a couple of them around I thought they were a little close together what we're gonna do is we're gonna bake them at 375 for about 10 minutes and depending on your oven just keep an eye on them they might be done in 11 minutes they could be done in nine minutes but we'll see how they go so 375 degrees Fahrenheit all those look good so let's get these onto a cooling rack and we'll be back oh these look good when they smell really good too you", "iKInX9DJWA4": "this sweet treat is universally loved the world\u00a0\nover comes in every flavor imaginable contains\u00a0\u00a0 every topic and every item

produce\u00a0\u00a0 over 70 different ice cream varieties started\u00a0\nas a humble dairy in 1931 it has now grown\u00a0\u00a0 so big that they produce 25 million gallons of\u00a0\nice cream per year and today i am lucky enough to\u00a0\u00a0 have a tour with this fine fellow the director\u00a0\nof supply chain management derek frye who is\u00a0\u00a0 also the great grandson of the founder of turkey\u00a0\nhill that's correct turkey hill started making\u00a0\u00a0 ice cream in 1954 using derek's own great\u00a0\ngrandmother's home recipes and guess what\u00a0\u00a0 they still use some of

actually going to yield about 6 000 gallons of\u00a0\nfinished product because of uh the fact that we\u00a0\u00a0 add air to ice cream as well as other ingredients\u00a0\nsuch as cookie dough and chocolate chips time to\u00a0\u00a0 fire this batch up and sorry to disappoint all\u00a0\nyou home confectioners but turkey hill keeps all\u00a0\u00a0 their ice cream recipes top secret okay you can't\u00a0\nsee this this is censored let's light this candle at this point it's just milk and\u00a0\nsugar so sugars are coming in up here it's time to drop some science on that ice cream\u00a0\nmix that we just made this baby right here this\u00a0\u00a0 is the pasteurization unit we heat the mix up\u00a0\nto 180 we run it through these holding tubes\u00a0\u00a0 so it holds it at that temperature holds it\u00a0\nand it's it's timed out to last 30 seconds\u00a0\u00a0 from there we're going to send it over to the\u00a0\nhomogenizer gotcha and those are those pistons\u00a0\u00a0 they're actually going to make sure that all the\u00a0\nparticles the fat the actual milk particles the\u00a0\u00a0 flavoring elements everything is the same size\u00a0\nand that kind of evenness is what makes that\u00a0\u00a0 creamy feeling in your mouth and then where does\u00a0\nit go so we're going to drop it down to 34 degrees\u00a0\u00a0 before we put it into a holding tank and take it\u00a0\ndown to ice cream and the holding tanks are just\u00a0\u00a0 over here right out here follow me lead on so\u00a0\nthis is an ice cream yet this is just the base\u00a0\u00a0 it hasn't gone through freezing and it has\u00a0\nno added flavorings or cookie dough i'm very\u00a0\u00a0 curious to see how it tastes we're going to take\u00a0\none of our syringes put it in the sample port\u00a0\u00a0 slowly draw out

maybe one of the\u00a0\nbest vanilla flavors you will ever have ever\u00a0\u00a0 fasten your seat belts because we're now at my\u00a0\nfavorite stage of the ice cream making process\u00a0\u00a0 adding the flavors and inclusions inclusions\u00a0\nare like toppings but swirled right\u00a0\u00a0 into the ice cream itself this is exactly\u00a0\nwhere the mix will come into the flavor our premium white

I don't know, I just craved them. - Yeah.\n- And I thought, let's make some actual proper\ngourmet chocolate chip cookies and I found some that take two hours, I know. - Do what? - Two hours, but we're gonna compare them because isn't a cookie just a sugary fix that just give you that (grunts) to start your day? Don't have cookies for breakfast. - No, we never do, but don't tell Mommy, but this is gonna be\nthe best day of my life.

Can you tell me, are you excited today? - You are excited.\n- Yeah. - Everyone call tell that, I think. - We're gonna get goin'\non the more gourmet ones. It's gonna take a while to prepare, and then in the end we'll\njust make the botch ones and see hopefully what the difference is. Hey, why don't you get down,\n- Yeah? - what does gourmet mean? - I have no idea. - It means luxury. What does luxury mean? - Yummy. - So, in here is a bowl\nof plain flour, okay? This is some bicarbonate of soda. Tip that in, we're gonna give\nit a little bit of a rise. We don't want 'em to be flat. This is some salt. Yeah you can salt them if you want. - Yay, I love salt. (laughs) - That actually does help\nthe chocolate flavour, as well later on. So now, we whisk this through, nice and gently, that's it mate. We don't want it spillin' out, all right? (smack)\nHey! This is about 180 grammes\nof butter in total. Now, two thirds of it, we're gonna' actually melt\nit and brown the butter which is gonna be foamy. It's gonna go from yellow-y to brown. Hense, the name brown butter, and that is for an intense more caramelised, kinda\nnaughty take (grunts) flavour. That's why we're doin' it. - Okay. - We don't normally do this with cookies, but apparently with these\ngourmet ones, that's what you do. We mix in still about one\nthird of the standard butter. So, we'll come to that bit in a minute. - I'm a professional chef. - You are a professional chef, right. We are just gonna' get\nthis on a medium flame, and we're gonna' melt\nthe butter first of all. See how it's yellow? We wanna kinda get that\nnutty flavour, all right? - It's moving. This is so satisfying. - [Dad] It is, look sort of foamy. (butter sizzles) - It looks like syrup a\nlittle bit, the butter. - [Dad] It does look\nlike syrup, doesn' it? Like a bar of soap. - It's melting! - All right, so once it's at that stage, it's really important that\nyou do keep stirring it, and the colour will change. If you leave it as it\nis, it could ruin the pan so just make sure you\nkeep it moving around to darken it off. Can you see?\n- Whoa, it's so brown!\n- [Dad] You see that? That's brown right, so pull the foam away. You just browned butter, well done. - It looks like chocolate a bit. (gasp) - So just pour this over\nthe unmelted butter. (sizzles) You hear that? 'cause it is still warm, 'cause we wanna' melt the\nother butter, as well. We normally just melt butter normally. Stir around using the heat\nfrom our brown butter. We just wanna' incorporate that. Hopefully this is all gonna' be worth it. I've never done this recipe before, but it looks like your bar\nof soaps melted in now! - [Chloe] Mhm. - [Dad] Yeah? - Yes. - All right, we're gonna'\nadd some more bits to it. All right, ready? - Yes. - All right we got two lots of sugar here, which is traditional with cookies anyways, but I heard that dark\nbrown sugar does tend to make cookies more chewy, and that's what we're\ntryin' to get to today. The dark brown sugar, and then this is some\nstandard granulated sugar. Stir that through, and we wanna'\ntry and get that dissolved. - Whoa. - [Dad] In this bowl,\nhere is one whole egg, and two additional egg yolks. Now, apparently egg yolks are emulsifiers which help with holding the moisture, which will make an even\nmore chewier cookie. Nice one mate, look! That sugars dissolved! (sniffs) Chloe, this cookie mix\nsmells like the circus. Mmm. (sniffs) - I don't even know what\nthe circus smells like. - Intense. That is a lovely smooth\nconsistency, right? - Yeah. - Let's get some flour in there. So, what's in there, the flour, the salt, - And the bicarbonate of soda, I think. - [Dad] Yes, it is mate, well done! Fold the dry ingredients into\nthat intently nutty flavour. (dog growls) (Dad laughs)\nWas that you? You all right? Eh, you all right? I just realised, we forgot\nto add the vanilla extract. This is two teaspoons,\nyou wanna add that in? - [Chloe] Yes. - [Dad] Whoa, that is a lot. So, we need to get this in, as well. It's all good. Give it a smell. What's it smell like? - Smells a bit of hand sanitizer. - [Dad] Hand sanitizer? - Smell it.\n(Dad laughs) - [Dad] I know. But, now look at this folks. Can you see how much\nmovement there is in that? If we dry and dollop that onto our tray, it's just gonna kinda go all like, blah. So, apparently if we leave that, the flour is gonna hydrate, and it's actually gonna'\nbecome thicker by itself. That's part of this whole to our process, we gotta' leave it for about 15 minutes to do it own thing, right? - Okay. - So, in that time we can\nchop up our chocolate, and if this doesn't work, but it should, if it doesn't my absolute back-up plan\nis to add more flour. This is a tray of chocolate, right? We're gonna slice it up. This is actual gourmet chocolate chunks. 70% cocoa chocolate, very\nrich indeed, very naughty. Normally we'll add chocolate chips, and that is what we'll do\nwith our two minute version. Break those pieces up there mate, and then we're gonna me our\nvery own chocolate chunks for the cookies. Proper gourmet. - Chocolate. (Dad laughs)\n- Well done, mate. Nice big 'ol chunky chunks, love it. I've just got this bowl back, look at the difference\nbetween this go, look. - Whoa.\n- See? Much firmer, but while that\ndid save us a bit of time, I forgot we have got to\nstir those into this. (timer ticks) Much thicker now, look at that. (Chloe groans) Okay, so we let that rest, again. It's nice a firm now. We have got ourselves a lined baking tray. Barry Lewis baking seal patent thing, available on Amazon optional. If you want, it's up to you. You've got an ice cream\nscoop in your hand. - Ah.\n- Ah, look at that. - That looks so nice.\n- That's huge! (laughs) All right, so while you're doing that this is apparently, this stage here, is once we've done that, we've put the cookie mix in the fridge, with them rolled out, to\nmarinate, like a steak. I mean, you do that anyway to preserve it, and actually, if you chill\ndough, if you bake it, it does hold it's shape much more. So, rather than going flat, if you ever want to stop\nyour cookies going flat, do chill it, and it's like\nwhenever the custard creams, when you stamp the patent in there, you put it in the fridge. When it baked it held the design, so it does keep it stronger. They're calling this a marinade. So, that's going in the fridge once we've done this step. Wow, they're enormous. - Should I put two here? - Yes, if you can mate. They will expand. It's going in the fridge for 90 minutes. I'm sorry. All right, these guys\nare gonna' look after these boulders of cookies. So, they're going in for 90 minutes, now. That's gonna help them hold their shape. Then we're gonna bake the\nmost intense cookies ever. (laughs) (fridge door closes) All right then Chlo, here we go, look! Nice and marinated cookies, apparently. - Whoa this is freezing. (Dad laughs)\n- [Dad] Right, the oven is pre-heated. Middle shelf, and about\neight to ten minutes, they're comin' out. - Yes! - All right, so for this two minute cookie thing, hopefully it'll be done by the time these bake, we\ncould at least get it ready. You get yourself a microwave safe plate, and we're gonna grease it\nlightly with some butter. This is some butter that's\nat room temperature, which is going in the cookie itself. So, pour this in with the butter, and then add the vanilla\nextract in, as well. - [Chloe] How much? - [Dad] A little drop? There you go. All right, whisk that\ntogether, keep goin', mate! Now, apparently we need two\ntablespoons of beaten eggs. So, this is an egg that\nI've beaten off camera, but I feel like that's about\nto tablespoons, do you? - Mhm. - [Dad] Pour that in, then. Yes! - [Chloe] Whoa! - [Dad] What's up? - They look like real cookies! (Dad laughs) - They look like real cookies, amazin'! - They look amazing! (Dad gasps) - Oh wow, look at the height\non those, their chunky. - Yeah, they're so cool! - [Dad] I love that. - Same. - And we are actually gonna' stick, apparently more chocolate chunks and just as it cools down on the wire rack. Huh? - They're ready. - [Dad] They're ready? - Yes.\n(Dad gasps) - [Dad] Oh my gosh! (Chloe gasps)\nLook at the size of those! - Whoa! (smack) - [Dad] Wow! - Oh my goodness. From just balls, - [Dad] From just balls, yes. - to cookies.\n- [Dad] Yes. Just got a couple more chunks\nhere that I'm gonna sit in 'cause they'll firm up as they cool down. So they kinda' doin' a\nsemi-melt, 'cause of the heat, but they'll hold their shape a little bit, and they'll just make it look-- you all right? - Mhm. Can I go to the toilet? - Internet, can she go to the toilet? - Yes. (Dad laughs) - [Dad] We're gonna chuck in the salt, no salt made for this. We've got time, we got two minutes, but it's taken 10 minutes already. Just mix that in, and of course we need, wow that runny, but don't worry, the plain\nflour is goin' in now. Hopefully soak all that up. (timer ticks) - What's the next step? - [Dad] Well, we just\ngotta' add chocolate chips in there, now. Wanna' do it? - Yes. - 'Bout half that bag,\nall right the whole bag. Brilliant.\n(Dad laughs) No! Ah! - Oh! - I'll try and get a little\nbit off the top layer, just a few. - I'm very sorry, I just love chocolate. - That's my excuse for everything. That's gonna' be some cookie now, innit? - Yes. - It's going into the microwave, for apparently, not even two minutes. 90 seconds. (microwave buttons beeps) - Is that 90 seconds? - [Dad] That is 90 seconds, good maths! Homeschoolin'! - Oh my goodness it's\ngotten ginormous already! - [Dad] That's huge, look at that! - Whoa! (microwave beeps)\n- [Dad] All right, open it. Oh my gosh! (Dad laughs) - Um, that is one big cookie! - [Dad] That does look like a cookie, but let it cool for a moment. Yeah. - Let's call in the family. Mrs. B, BB. The point we're lookin' for here, is which one taste the better, but for the effort,\nwhich one do you prefer? So, let's have a bit of this. It's gonna' still be warm and gooey. (family chews) - It's like a pancake. - It is like a cake. - It is like a sponge cake, but (indistinct) a quick fix\nin the microwave at that, I wouldn't say it's a cookie. - Doesn't really taste like a cookie. - It's like a tough cake, innit? - Now these look like cookies. - Oh, they're still gooey. - All right ready? Look at the height on it.\n- Oh my god. - Three, two, one. (sounds of delight) - Chewy.\n- Wow. - Oh wow.\n- Now that is a cookie. - [Chloe] Mhm.\n- That is intense. Just like the... - Circus. (laughs) - The circus. I definitely confirm this one. - Oh wow, firm around the edges, but the soft, delicate,\nchewy, gooey, chocolatey. That is everythin' that you want, with that chunkiness in a cookie. I love that. - Now, this is what I call\nthe real (indistinct). (laughs) - That was worth a two hour wait. - Yeah. - I would say that is. I think the chunks was just\ngave it that little bit bigger and stickin' them\nin as they cool down. Phenomenal! Oh, that is naughty! - Thank you for watching this video. - All right, folks, give 'em a try. I put the recipe up for\nboth on the website. Highly recommend the two\nhour, what's the matter? - Is there any more? - No, there's not.\n(laughs) See ya next time, bye! \u266a Chicken level player, no\nmatta' what your style, \u266a \u266a the kitchens for me\n(indistinct) guarantee, \u266a \u266a maybe all three. \u266a - Yeah, they're big. Yeah, they're big. (Mom and sister laugh) (laughs manically) - This is what it's like all the time. This is a cry for help, save me.", "Q0ss5dcKg90": "today I'm going to be making some really really yummy chocolate chip cookies so let's get on with the ingredients I have a generous 1 cup of chocolate chips here I'm using semi-sweet chocolate chips 1 teaspoon of baking powder 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1 egg 1 teaspoon of vanilla one and a half cups of all-purpose flour 1 cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of unsalted butter so those are the ingredients so let's get started okay so for our first step I'm going to get all of our lovely butter in there and our nice brown sugar okay I'm just going to break that down a little bit before we hit it with our mixer okay let me grab my mixer now and I want to cream this together now the warmer your butter the easier this process is going to be so I'm going to continue doing this and I'll be back in a minute or so alright we're back you can see the sugar and the butter has really nicely combined out so at this point I've got my one egg and I'll get that in there and that's really going to loosen this mixture up we really want to get that really well combined and then our vanilla and I'm using pure vanilla here vanilla extract okay that's good and now for our dry ingredients I'm going to grab a sieve and I'm going to get all of my flour in there my baking powder and my salt just to make it easy and I will just give it a little shake shake rattle and roll there we go just take your hands or a spoon and just push it through perfect do you have to sift no but today I feel like it so it's always nice to sift it's fun to do and now I'm just going to take my mixer and just slowly incorporate this I don't want to overwork it I'm just on number one just get that slowly incorporated now depending on your butter and how well you measured your butter or how cold your butter is if you find at this point your mixture is not going to form little balls properly because we're going to be making little balls out of this I'm going to be scooping this out if you find your batter is a little bit too dry you can take a tablespoon of water and just add it to the mixture there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing that so I just want to mix this up until it's combined you can see now it's starting to come together okay see that there it's all coming together now perfect so then I'm going to grab all of my chocolate chips and just get those right in there sorry for the noise and I'm just going to quickly get these incorporated as well that's perfect and we are ready to go super super simple you can see this is a really really fast and easy recipe all right I've got myself little cookie scoop ice cream scoop and my tray and I am ready to go so I'm just going to grab some of my dough and I'm just going to get it out there just like that I want to have enough space in between my cookies for expansion so I'll just get another one down just like that that looks good so I'll continue to whip through these and I'll be back in a minute okay next so I'm going to do is I'm just going to push down the cookies just a little bit just like that not too much so I've got to fork the back of a fork and I'm just giving a little gentle push you can see how nice this dough is really really nice and there we go so I've got my oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm going to pop these in ten twelve thirteen minutes I'll tell you exactly how long if you want them a little bit more crispy you're going to do them a little longer I'll let you know I like them on a little bit on the chewy side so into the oven and I'll be back in a little while all right my cookies baked for a total of 13 minutes I left them in 12 and I looked at them and I thought you know what they need just in that extra minute of love just to get a little bit more color to the top of them and now they look really really good you know it all depends on the size of your scoop of cookie you know that you're putting out if they're smaller than they you know they might only take eleven minutes ten minutes it all depends on the size so there we go I wish you could smell this this smell they just smell so good really really good all right so that's the first batch so I've got that much left so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do another tray whip through those and I'll come back and show you all of the cookies when they're all baked all right my second batch is done and I did these ones for twelve minutes just for fun so you're talking you know twelve minutes thirteen minutes whatever you like so I just quickly added them up and there are a total of 24 cookies here you can see I mean these are a good size you know cookie there we go and they smell really really good this is a really good recipe I hope you try it out there we go beautiful all right I've zoomed in and I'll just show you how the cookie looks there we go and we'll just break into it and look at this really really nice these are the first batch so these are almost cool and there we go really really nice beautiful mmm well that is really good so there we have it really really easy chocolate-chip cookies I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time you", "yuWRpKWyhEM": "there are two reasons why this next\nrecipe is going to rock the first reason is is because it's portion-controlled\nthe second reason is because sometimes you're a little lazy so stay tuned to\nsee what I'm gonna make today we're making chocolate chip cookies but we're\nnot going to be making up a huge batch of chocolate chip cookies because I\ndon't need all those treats lying around the house and also because I don't have\ntime for that so we're gonna make just a portion controlled single serving this\nis gonna make two cookies for us or it can make one really big chocolate chip\ncookie I'm going to show you how to make it in the microwave the air fryer and\nthe oven and the best part about this recipe is that it involves no eggs many\nof those little single serve cookies that you see people making up in the\noven or the air fryer they involved using up like an entire egg so your\ncookie tastes like an egg so we're not doing that here we're omitting the egg\naltogether and it still turns out perfect like I said this recipe is so\neasy to make so it's perfect when you're having one of those lazy nights and you\ndon't want to get out all of your cooking ingredients it's one of the\nbenefits of making mug cakes - and I have some mud cake recipes on my channel\nyou guys can click up here to watch those those are very very easy dessert\nrecipes that you can make as well but this one is great for when you're\ncraving chocolate chip cookies to make these keto chocolate chip cookies\neverything is going to be made in One Bowl combined and then we're going to\nbake it to a small bowl we're gonna add two tablespoons of almond flour one\nteaspoon of coconut flour one tablespoon of unsalted butter that's softened to\nroom temperature 2 teaspoons of monk fruit or you can use the sweetener of\nyour choice a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt for chocolate chips I'm going to be\nusing ChocZero chocolate chips they're my favorite kind they're sugar free\nsugar alcohol free I'll have a link down below on where you can purchase them you\ncan save 10% off your order when you use my code ketofocus at checkout but\nthere's other different kinds of sugar-free keto approved chocolate chips\nout there I know Lily's makes one too so whatever brands you can get ahold of you\ncan certainly use and if you can't get ahold of either of those brands you know\nwhat works really good is just getting like a hundred percent dark chocolate or\nlike a baking chocolate bar that you get at the grocery store just chop that up\ninto chunks and you can throw a little bit of in your cookie dough we're gonna\nmix these ingredients up all together and then we're gonna portion them out\ninto two cookies or it can make one really big cookie now if you really want\nto make some stellar keto chocolate-chip cookies I recommend popping them in the\nrefrigerator for around like 10 to 15 minutes so this is after you've formed\nthe ball shape and kind of smash them down a little bit\npop them in the refrigerator just that time when it's cooling it allows all of\nthe ingredients to just meld together and taste good plus when you bake them\nthey don't spread out so much either like I mentioned before we're gonna bake\nthese three separate ways the first way is in the oven so you want to have your\noven preheated to 350 degrees we're gonna put those cookies right into the\noven the second way that we're gonna cook these keto chocolate chip cookies\nis in the microwave so just pop them in the microwave for a few minutes I'll\nhave that full instruction listed down below the last way we're gonna bake up\nthese chocolate chip cookies is in the air fryer so the air fryers becoming\nincreasingly popular for baking just because you can make these easy portion\ncontrolled desserts in them so I finished all three cookies as you\ncan see they all turned out a little bit different which was kind of shocking to\nme but also kind of expected like I figured the microwave cookie would be\nmore flat and spread a little bit more just because it's higher heat and in\norder to keep the cookie nice and fluffy you need it to just kind of chill and\nthen slowly bake in a hot place so microwave totally expected that I didn't\nreally expect it to look like somebody pounded it with a meat hammer one of\nthose meat tenderizers but you know I think it still looks pretty good the\nairfryer cookie looks good too kind of overdid it a little bit so definitely\nwatch your baking time and then the cookie in the oven turned out perfectly after trying all three of the cookies\nthey actually all taste the same and then well as we as we is the same dough\nfor each of them but even the baking methods they all turned out very very\nsimilar my favorite one was actually the airfryer one but I think that's because\nI let it go a little bit longer so it kind of had almost a little burnt cookie\ntaste to it which I'm weird but I like that it's probably because when I was\ngrowing up my mom always used to bake cookies and she always over baked them\nso the edges got a little burnt and crispy so I just I kind of liked that\nbut overall they're soft they're chewy just a perfect easy a chocolate chip\ncookie dough cookie that you can make and really it comes down to how much\ntime do you have or what appliance you have to I mean if you are just starving\nand just jonesing for a chocolate chip cookie then definitely make it in the\nmicrowave but if you have a little bit more time to spend then I would do like\nthe airfryer or the oven I hope you guys enjoyed this video make\nsure you tag me with your pictures of your single-serve keto chocolate-chip\ncookies on my social media I am ketofocus on Instagram and the ketofocus on\nFacebook", "Ggiek3iBShs": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you how to make \nChocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream Sandwiches. This is a fun and delicious summer treat. It does take some time to make it,\nbut ultimately it's still a pretty easy recipe. To start you'll need 1 cup of melted butter,\nand I'm using salted butter, but you can use unsalted as well. There's a couple of lumps in there but I'm not worried,\na quick whisk will met them right in. Then we'll add in 1 cup of brown sugar \nand 1/2 cup of white granulated sugar and we'll whisk this in with the melted butter. Then once that's mixed in we'll whisk in 1/4 cup of milk and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and we'll switch away from our whisk \nand grab a rubber spatula and sprinkle in 1/2 teaspoon of salt \nand 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour and you want to stir that in. Now if you're worried about consuming raw flour \nyou can always toast it first. You can just sprinkle it out onto a baking sheet and toast it in a 350 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes, or you can put it in a little skillet and heat it for about \n5 minutes over medium-high heat. Last we'll pour in about 2 cups of mini chocolate chips and fold them into our wet moist cookie dough. Then we're gonna dump this dough out onto a baking sheet that I've lined with parchment paper, so you'll want to get it all out into little clumps, mounds of the dough, and then we're gonna spread this out and squish it out until it's about 1/4 inch thick. Now it helps if once you have the initial squish done you can put on another piece of parchment paper, and then use either another baking sheet or like a cutting board to help squish it down flat so that it's in even thickness. Now of course this is going to be like \nthe bread part of the ice cream sandwich. You want to make sure it's nice and thin. You'll have one on top and one on bottom. Then I like to kind of square it off so that you can end up with nice clean lines for your ice-cream sandwiches. Then you'll want to pop this into the freezer until it's frozen solid, which will take about one hour. Now just before you pull out the cookie dough \nto assemble your ice-cream sandwiches you'll want to pull out 3 quarts of ice cream. You want to let it sit on the counter for about 10-15 minutes to soften up and make it easier to work with, and you can see that I am using cookie dough instead of plain vanilla keeps things a little more fun. So now that we have this solid brick of cookie dough \nwe want to cut it right in half so that we can have a bottom piece and a top piece. So I'm gonna eyeball this here and then start cutting in,\nand yes it is a little hard to cut, and I'm gonna check my work here, and oh look it's actually pretty even. So we'll set one of the halves aside for our top piece and grab our ice cream and start scooping it on. I want to squish it around here and get a nice even layer so we can slide our top on. Then we'll place that final layer of cookie dough \non top and squish it down. You can kind of flatten out the sides and fill in any gaps, then I'm gonna return this to the freezer for \n4 hours until it's solid. Now once the ice cream has firmed up \nyou can transfer it to a cutting board and then cut it into individual servings, and just be slow and it should cut right through if you use a sharp knife. Just like this. Super fun and perfect for summer. Thanks for watching. You can find the full written recipe in the \nvideo description.

really SuperDuper fine you can do this with a knife but you're going to have to make it really small because what you don't want is really huge chunks of chips so I'm going to add that in and whisk it what about and once that's thoroughly mixed just put that to one side because you're going to need it later but for now I'm going to beat some butter and sugar together and I have 115 grams of soft unsalted butter and then I have three different kinds of sugar today I've got 2 tablespoons of castor sugar 2 tablespoons of Demerara sugar and then 170 grams of light soft brown sugar I'm just going to put them all in and beat it up until it's combined so once that's combined you don't want to make it pet and fluffy or anything just just to combine leave that for a second and now I'm just going to whisk an egg with a teaspoon of vanilla extract once your egg and vanilla are all mixed together you need to work it in with the butter and sugar and just give it a little mix once that's done just grab your dry ingredients back and whack them in and I'm going to fold them in really slowly so my dough is come together and it's nice and sort of malleable if it feels too soft just whack it in the fridge for about 10 minutes before you start the next bit and the next bit is to make the cookie cut part so I have a mini cupcake pan 24 and already greased I just sprayed some effects spray grease on it you can do a butter and a brush if you like and I'm going to use about 15 to 17 grams per hole so just grab a little blob off out of the bulk of your dough and weigh it and then just roll it into a ball and pop it into your pan I just keep going until you've got the whole pan filled now they're not looking very cup like at the moment but there's a quick fix for that so I'm going to be using this little thing so if you find like Ronnie's have something similar size and shape to this this is just a little rolling pin and I've got a bowl of flour here just going to dip it in there just stop it from sticking and then I'm just going to press down on each one to make a and once all your cookie cuts are formed just pop that tray in the fridge and then get on with an exit now it's time to get on with the sponge batter part of the equation now I've only just used half of my cookie dough that amount will probably make two trays of that but the good thing about cookie dough is you can wrap it up and put it in fridge and use it a couple of weeks later so that's good but this part of it there is not really any way of dividing it any further because I'm only using one egg I mean you can give it a go and divide the egg but it's going to get really complicated so this is about as small as it gets and this will be enough to fill the whole batch of cookies so I'm going to start by putting 63 grams of soft unsalted butter in my bowl and to that I'm going to add the same amount of self-raising flour and caster sugar and to that I'm going to add an eighth of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and one large free-range egg and I'm going to mix it with my hand whisk for about one minute and once it's had a minute I'm just going to add two teaspoons of whole milk an eighth of a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then just feed that up for another 30 seconds when it's ready all right so my batters ready my cookie cups all ready and now I just need to fill them and I'm you're going to use teaspoons for this you need such a small amount it's about a third of the amount that you would normally use for a mini cupcake and I guess about a half teaspoon and now it's time to bake them and I've got my oven staff 170 degrees C and then I bake these for about 12 minutes my cookie cut cupcakes are out of the oven they're cool now so it's time to finish them off with some icing you obviously don't have to do that you can leave them as they are they're really tasty but I'm going to just make them look really nice and taste even better and I'm going to use vanilla buttercream again you can use anything you like cream cheese icing or Swiss meringue buttercream or chocolate icing or anything you like but I'm going to keep it really really simple today here goes and now I'm going to finish them off with a little bit of chocolate chip there it is and so the big reveal hang on hmm oh yeah okay that is got your chewy cooking soft squishy sponging and your lovely buttercream on top five delicious thank you so much for watching I'm gonna finish icing these take them downstairs to the shop I'll be back next week with another recipe and in the meantime if you

and give me the hashtag cupcake Gemma so that I can see your creation see you next week", "l-aRIXigA78": "hey guys if there's one dessert for two recipe you need to know how to make it's these small batch chocolate chip cookies today we're making them without an egg I'll show you how to do that this recipe makes just eight chocolate chip cookies so it's perfect for your next cookie craving let's get started the first thing we need to make a small batch of chocolate chip cookies is a stick of butter but because we're making a small batch we only need six tablespoons and a stick is eight this is nice and softened butter it's been sitting out at room temp for about an hour the softer your butter the easier it is to cream together with the sugars so I mentioned that we're not using an egg today that's either because I'm out of eggs or because you're I'm cooking for someone with an egg allergy and one of the best things I found to replace an egg is cream cheese it's slightly softened I'm gonna get a heaping tablespoon of it and that is all we need to make these cookies without eggs but first you want to cream the cream cheese into the butter now we need our sugars this is a quarter cup of dark brown sugar light works as well and then I'm gonna use three tablespoons of granulated sugar brown sugar makes a cookie really soft and chewy and so we want a little bit in there but then we still want our granulated sugar cream that into your butter and cream cheese okay now it's time to add the flavor enhancers to the dough I'm using vanilla and instant espresso powder today these two flavors just make chocolate chip cookies super sweet and they enhance the flavor of the chocolate chips so this is 3/4 of a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a half a teaspoon of instant espresso powder this part is optional it's up to you but chocolate and coffee together are super delicious and mix those in okay let's add our dry ingredients we need all-purpose flour we're doing a half a cup plus three tablespoons I know these measurements seem a little wonky but it's because we're doing small batch baking so instead of adding three whole cups of flour we start small and we do half a cup plus three tablespoons [Music] okay then we need to add our leaveners so we're using baking soda and baking powder today the same amount of each just a quarter teaspoon these make the cookies puff up a little bit in the oven as they bake and then a pinch of salt I hardly ever bake without salt we're using an eighth of a teaspoon which is really just like one big pinch let's mix the dry into the wet that's our dough but we are missing chocolate chips this is a quarter cup of your favorite chocolate chips I always use semi-sweet but sometimes when I'm baking for my daughter I do milk chocolate because they're a little sweeter and she likes that so let's mix these in very gently that's it so I'm gonna clean up a little bit and then we'll scoop out our dough okay I have a large baking sheet here and I've lined it with a silicone mat I have found that silicone mats help cookies stay together and they don't spread as much so I really like it it does even heat distribution as the cookies bake in the oven so we're gonna scoop our cookies this is all of our dough because we're only making eight cookies I'm gonna actually shape these a little bit into mounds this helps them bake up into a nice pretty round shape my oven is at 375 and we will bake them until they're golden brown around the edges and soft and chewy and melty in the Centers [Music] our cookies are done it smells like chocolate chip cookie heaven in here I love these cookies so much another reason I love these cookies is that since they're made without an egg I give you permission to eat the raw dough I will tell you never have to bake them but they are delicious baked the only thing left is a big glass of cold milk to serve them with I hope you love these egg free chocolate chip cookies for the full recipe visit dessert for two calm", "1nuH9sgYMRg": "hey wonderful human beans and welcome back to another video if you're new here my name is Randy and I see lots of vegan content and tips to help you live well and today we're gonna be making chocolate chip cookies if you know anything about me or you follow me on Instagram you know that I absolutely love chocolate chip cookies there's something about them they're just so classic so delicious never let you down just the best dessert so today I want to share my recipe with you they are so yummy but they're also secretly it's super healthy they're vegan gluten free refined sugar free and made without any added oils but they're still super soft chewy with crisp edges and they actually remind me of mrs. fields chocolate chip cookies or the chocolate chip cookies at Subway sandwich there honestly it's so good so I wanted to show you guys how to make them and I will leave the link to the recipe in the description box below let's get baking the beautiful thing about this recipe is that it comes together in One Bowl so we're starting off with some creamy roasted almond butter I like to use an unsweetened unsalted variety because we're gonna add our own sweetener so we're using maple syrup you could also use another liquid sweetener of choice but this is my personal favorite along with a little bit of vanilla extract and flax egg which is basically just ground flax seeds mixed with water we're gonna give everything a good stir until it's evenly combined and then we're gonna move on to adding some of our dry ingredients to the mix I'm using coconut sugar but you could also use brown sugar if you prefer and we're just going to incorporate this until it's completely smooth making sure to scrape down the edges of the bowl as well [Music] now we're ready to move on to the flowers so I'm using a mix of oat flour and a little bit of almond flour which is really important for the texture and the end result we're also adding baking powder and baking soda and just stirring again until completely smooth and evenly combined once the dough is ready we're gonna add our vegan chocolate chips I really like to use these mini sized ones I feel like they do the best job when it comes to cookies and we're gonna fold this in you can add as much or as little as you'd like and as you can see the texture of the dough is thick put a little bit sticky so I like to pop it in the fridge before I roll them into balls now we're going to evenly place them on a baking tray pop them in the oven and you get these beautifully golden brown chocolate chip cookies with a little bit of a crispy edge and the perfect soft texture [Music] alright guys don't forget to check out the description box below I will leave the link to

Today we are making chocolate chip cookies. One of my favorites cookies on the site. They are crispy around the edges and chewy\nin the middle. The best part is that this recipe makes a\nlot of cookie dough. So you can make a whole batch and then freeze\nenough for another day. That means you can have on demand cookies. On demand cookies at any time! So good. Let\u2019s go make them. Let\u2019s make some cookies! We\u2019re using our stand mixer, but a hand\nmixer will work just as well. For the dry ingredients, you will need all-purpose\nflour, baking soda and salt. Just add them all to a bowl and whisk until\nblended. Don\u2019t forget the full recipe is on the blog. Set that aside then add room temperature butter,\ngranulated sugar, brown sugar  and vanilla extract to the bowl of your mixer. Turn on to medium speed and beat until the\nmixture looks lighter and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the bowl at least once\nto make sure everything is being mixed. Now add the eggs. Turn the mixer onto low speed and beat for\nabout 30 seconds. It\u2019s okay if the eggs are not completely\nmixed in. Turn the mixer to the lowest speed then slowly\nadd the dry ingredients. We like adding in thirds. Scrape the bowl to make sure all of the flour\nis mixed in. Then with the mixer on low, sprinkle in some\nchocolate chips \u2014 these are semi-sweet, but dark chocolate, milk chocolate or a combination\nwould be excellent. We\u2019re ready to bake! Drop 3-tablespoonful mounds onto a baking\nsheet lined with parchment paper (you can also use a non-stick baking mat). We\u2019re using our large cookie scoop, which\nmakes this go really quickly. To make the cookies look extra chocolatey\npress a couple extra chocolate chips on top. Slide the cookies into the oven and bake until\ngolden brown around the edges. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for\na few minutes then transfer to a cooling rack. Don\u2019t forget, you can make the batter and\nfreeze it for cookies another day. We share our tips in the recipe on Inspired\nTaste. Enjoy! Thanks for watching. If you love this video we have lots more.

and my butter is at room temperature so it's very soft and i want to start mixing this around then we'll add in our sugar get all that right in there we'll start creaming this together that looks pretty good and then i'm going to grab my egg and get that in there that looks good i'll get in all of my vanilla to that we'll get in all of our flour and our little bit of baking powder and i'm just going to start sifting that in speed number one i don't want a dust cloud we'll just start slowly mixing all of this in and that's good and then our last ingredient all of our chocolate chips just get all those in there grab our mixer one last time and just mix these in a little bit just so that they all get covered with that dough and that's it for the recipe on to our next step always use a spatula and make sure you get everything out of your bowl i'll just show you a little trick just get yourself a little bit of water put your spatula into the water and what that does is it prevents it from sticking to your spatula and just makes it a lot easier to spread out and i think that looks pretty good so now i'm going to pop this into my 375 degree oven until it's nicely baked and then i'll come back here we have it exactly 14 minutes in the oven 375 degrees fahrenheit this is extremely hot and that's what i want i'm going to grab my little cutter and i'm just going to go right through i just want to make sure that it's cut and i'm just washing off my blade between cuts i'm just going to go down again because once this hardens up it's going to be extremely hard to cut so clean off my blade again one more time clean your blade and our last little cut right here all the way down and that's perfect and at this point now we have to let this completely cool now that our cookie has cooled right down i'm just going to grab another little cooling rack put it on top and flip it over and there we have it because of that parchment paper that we put in there the cookie just comes right out and then to flip it back over one more flip and again and there we have it then i'm just going to grab a serrated knife i'm just going to go over my cuts again and there we have it let's pull all these apart look at that oh and this smells really really good so i've just zoomed in and i guess i'll give this a little bit of a spin just so you can see this now i did these for 14 minutes if you want these a little bit more crispy you're gonna go about 16 minutes you might even want to do 17 minutes right now these are very very fudgy you can see how nice these are look at this oh wow that just melts in your mouth really really good look at that oh amazing that's good i had to stop the camera just for a couple of seconds because i was really enjoying that really really fudgy and delicious that's it for today if you enjoyed my video please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish i really really do appreciate that that's it and i'll see you next time and please subscribe to

appealing do i have to eat it hey i'm sarah beth and i'm a former chick-fil-a employee i'm brian and i used to work at mcdonald's i'm marissa and i'm a former employee of kfc my name is diana flores and i'm a former worker for wendy's the perfect cookie is something that tastes fresh it has to be warm a little bit crispy i wanted to see the chocolate like ooze a little bit when i bite into it i want it to be soft i want it to melt my mouth sometimes you get like a chunky piece and that's that's the good stuff right there i know everybody's gonna like these cookies from wendy's because they're really delish it's my favorite and i bet it'll be yours too this is what i want in a cookie this looks so good this has the big chocolate chunks in it it's large which is always a good thing i want to get to this chocolate piece over here i want that it's like less of like a chip and more of a chunk eat it with two hands it's so big it's not quite as soft as i would like i guess this one just tastes a little bit more like a classic chocolate chip whoa that is so good mmm i would eat that whole thing right now it's baked to perfection overall the spirit of what a cookie should be in my opinion is all there so i give it a seven i'd say it's like a 7. wow that's a 10 cookie right there if that is a 10 10. i do want this one for later that is really good the thing i love about the kfc cookies is that it comes with like so much freshness already like packaged in there and so you have that reliability that consistency my mouth is watering already what this looks like a fake cookie the edge there's no chocolate it tastes like vanilla like a vanilla cookie the chocolate's all the way in the middle this one doesn't feel like it has a lot of flavor nothing that's screaming like hey grandma just baked me i'm yours it's hard it could use a little more chocolate chips i need more chocolate chippage you know what i'm saying you know a good five is still a good cookie i would rank this as seven for the effort not a huge fan of this one let's go with a four [Music] mcdonald's cookies are very soft they're very chewy like they have the nice little chunks of chocolate chip in there and that's good it's really like the perfect cookie assuming you make it correctly it looks like something that was like freshly baked it's definitely like more brown i do love a thin crispy cookie i will say so this is looking somewhat promising to me [Music] oh do you hear that like crunch smells nice nope i don't like this cookie i don't even want to eat it i think i was kind of nervous it was going to be a little bit too crispy but no it's not at all it definitely has like a nice crunch to it like you can hear when i was biting into it it's like it's a thin crispy cookie and so i think if that's what you're in the market for this one's a good choice it's so unappealing looking like yeah i don't want to eat it so why would you sell this is there one positive thing to say about it positive it looks like a cookie that's it i would say i'm gonna give it a seven half i mean it's no kfc so don't get me wrong but it's solid we're gonna just give this one a two and pretend that didn't happen if i would rank this it would be a one the chick-fil-a chocolate chip cookie is good because it has chocolate chunks in it they're not skimping on the chocolate people and it's usually warm when you get it and if it's not warm you better ask for a warm one because that is how they're the most delicious this looks like a hearty cookie it looks like a giant chips ahoy cookie presentation is just this is a chocolate chip cookie when you look at it you feel like there's so much going on in there like you can just see the chunks of chocolate you can see kind of like the texture oh it's soft [Music] i like it i don't know if it's like melty i taste the chocolate it's really good you can see it's smearing across the chocolate comes apart decently that's nice the chocolate's like a little soft and melted so that's a good sign this you know what maybe i'm judging this cookie before i actually get to know it let's give this a shot [Music] it's a little too crunchy for me not a fan of that i will give it credit the chocolate is very melty and that's nice just a little melty right there wow there's like some dimension to the cookie and it's very buttery as well which i love this is an amazing chocolate chip cookie this one not my favorite cookie um if i had to rank it i gave it like like a five i would rank this cookie a ton yeah i like it i think i'm gonna give this one a 10. i don't know what would make it better it's like moist on the inside yeah i'm gonna give it a 10. [Music] [Applause] oh man the perfect chocolate chip cookie chick-fil-a cookies come on people they're so good i knew we'd get here um they really are amazing they're soft and warm and yummy they got the chunks in them so if you haven't tried it you need to go try it but um yeah that will bless your life and it will be my pleasure [Music] you", "IHLWDo6IIO4": "[Music] [Applause] okay [Music] i

their household you guys know i'm working on my cooking project so i've literally been here every day not looking as earthy i'm usually like sweaty from the gym but we're trying to be aesthetic today so the reason i'm doing the choc chip recipe is because a few years ago i filmed that recipe for youtube you guys loved it and then this morning i was kind of like looking over the recipe and i feel like there's just too many ingredients like now that i'm a mum i fully get that you don't have time to put in 32 ingredients into a bowl and make a beautiful healthy decadent cookie like i don't have the time for that what i did was i wrote down my original choc chip cookie recipe and i have simplified it i literally just write it with a pen and paper this is how all my recipes begin i think it will taste better it'll be easier more affordable we love that i'm gonna preheat my oven to 180 degrees five ingredient cookies coming up the purpose of these ones is for fox when he just wants to snack when he's not actually hungry but he thinks he is and he just wants to chew on something i like to have healthy homemade treats on hand for him that aren't too high in sugar because he is already full of energy he doesn't need any more you know in australia we don't actually have gluten free oats we have what do they call them let me have a look they call them gluten friendly uncontaminated oats so if you are celiac i would use quinoa flakes but if you're just sensitive to gluten then you can get gluten-free oats so i've got one cup of whole rolled oats in there and then i'm gonna put another cup of oats in my little blitzer so it's a little bit finer than quick oats but you know we're chill here it doesn't really matter so we've basically got two cups of oats in different formations then we're gonna grab two ripe bananas you know you play that game and it's like what's your favorite food in the world like what would you want to live off mine's bananas i'm obsessed i would recommend mashing these in a separate bowl because it just is going to work easier for you but i don't want to wash up another bowl so i'm going to mash them in this bowl coat literally just went up the shops to buy me almond butter because i don't have enough i think he came home with his own smoothie like he went out and bought himself a smoothie and forgot the item he was going out for we need to call him we need a coin because i need almond butter or peanut butter some kind of butter oh no no no no no but we're not going to give up we'll just change the five ingredients we'll just mix it up it just needs a fat tell me you brought the almond butter no during the run up to no nope too late too far gone gotta go bye okay okay it's fine it's fine we're to adapt okay we're going to adapt we're going to adapt it's fine we're not going to do almond butter because it'll mess with my number but we need a fat okay we're going to use trusty coconut oil i'm going to do half a cup of coconut oil we're going to mash that together and then for a little bit of extra sweetness kick i'm gonna do some honey let's start off with two tablespoons and then we can assess from there okay let's just whisk that together with a fork third of a cup of almond meal if you want to make this vegan you can definitely swap out the honey for maple syrup or coconut nectar rice malt syrup that's not enough blanched almond meal i'm gonna add another third so we've got two thirds by the way in all of my baking i always use blanched almond milk instead of the normal one i've got like one cute pink aesthetic tray and one ugly one so the ugly cookies can get the ugly tray and then the cute foxy and mummy cookies can get the pink tray our mixture is very wet but i'm feeling optimistic and just grab a tablespoon of the butter kind of like rounding it out with the spoon and then plopping it on there i'm going to squish it a tiny bit so let's do that until the end of the batter [Music] i just got them out of the oven and i'm letting them cool to room temp because i want the coconut oil to solidify again foxy's just woken up he's a bit grumpy so we're gonna see if we can make him happy with a little oat banana cookie you could be the first taste tester i haven't even tasted them this is a five ingredient cookie i would definitely recommend adding like cinnamon or raisins or like crushed nuts or choc chips but for the sake of the number they're a good five ingredient base i have one more we'll be back in like half an hour or so when fox just like wakes up properly [Music] like i said this is a easier condensed version of my original choc chip cookie recipe so hopefully it works you're going to help me cooking with mummy oh that's an egg do you want to crack it you can great job that was so good yeah i'll hold the cookie you can have it back and you've got to bang this on the side go bang bang bang gas yes yes good boy we break it up into

cookies [Music] can you do that one loki's bye-bye [Music] [Music] [Laughter] asmr they're gonna love that [Laughter] okay we're done you", "cw267POj6n8": "Every baker has a staple chocolate chip cookie recipe on hand and today I'm going to show you mine, which is a salted\ndark chocolate chunk cookie. These are super soft and delicious and I'm really\nexcited to share this recipe with you so let's get started!\nTo start you want to chop between 150 and 200 grams of good quality chocolate\nof your choice, make sure that it's something that you like to eat by itself. Make sure you take the extra time to chop up your chocolate because it tastes\nbetter and it melts better and if I find out that you have been using the\nstore-bought chocolate chips or chunks I will hunt you down and make you start\nall over again! XD So just set that aside and in this bowl I have 1/2 cup of\nsoft, unsalted butter to which I'm adding a 1/4 of raw sugar you can use\ngranulated sugar as a substitute followed by 3/4 of a cup of\npacked brown sugar it's important that you use packed light brown sugar because 1) it adds incredible flavor and 2) it makes these cookies super-duper soft and delicious cream these ingredients together for a good 3-5\nminutes or until the mixture is light and fluffy. Now add in 1 whole egg\nfollowed by a teaspoon of good quality vanilla extract which adds a lovely\naroma to the mixture and its signature in chocolate chip cookies. You're going\nto work that in with your whisk. Now you're going to add in 1/2 teaspoon\nof salt. These are salted chocolate chip cookies\nafter all followed by 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda. Soda not\npowder, no substitutions! Once you've worked those ingredients into the\nmixture you're going to add 1 cup and 3/4 of a cup of all-purpose flour\nso you just want to work it in with a rubber spatula or a whisk and once all\nthe flour has been integrated into the dough you're going to toss in your\nchocolate chunks! At this point you can also throw in some dried fruits, dried\nnuts and M&M's, whatever else you'd fancy; but I'm keeping it simple with\njust the chocolate. And once the chocolate has been distributed evenly\nthroughout the batter you are ready to bake! So using a spoon you can take two\ntablespoon mounds of dough and place them on a parchment lined baking sheet,\nabout two inches apart. And for a final touch I just sprinkle each one with a\nlittle bit of sea salt and what this does is it adds a little contrast to that bitterness of the chocolate and the sweetness of the dough.\nAnd now you're going to pop the tray into the oven for about 9-11\nminutes or until they've set and they're beautifully golden brown. If I don't want\nto bake all the cookies at once I just place some of the dough on a piece of\ncling wrap, roll it into a log shape and tightly wrap it up and pop it into the\nfreezer, and then when I feel like having cookies I can take that log out, slice up\nsome cookies, pop them in the oven without even having to thaw it(!) and I\nwill have cookies in no time! :) Once the cookies finish baking I like to transfer\nthem off to a wire rack, so that they can cool slightly, but I have to admit that\nit's really difficult to resist because these tastes so delicious warm when the\nchocolate is still easy and melty. In addition to being BEST tasting cookies\nI've made, they're also the prettiest speckled with that sea salt that adds a\nwonderful contrast of flavors. When the chocolate is still warm and gooey these\ncookies melt in your mouth. They are my favourite cookies, and I hope that they\nbecome yours too! Thank you so much for watching, I really\nhope you enjoyed learning how to make one of my favorite recipes, and if you've\nnoticed I've been a little bit slow with uploading my videos lately, and that's\nbecause for some of you don't know I'm still in high school, and this time of\nyear is always the busiest so just bare with me for a bit.

we're about to make some fat chewy delicious chocolate chip cookies before we get into the recipe hit that like button and hit that subscribe button and check out the description box for all the information below now i have my kitchenaid mixer here if you don't have a kitchenaid you can use a hand mixer if you don't have a hand mixer i suggest that you just invest in one they're about 20 maybe 30 dollars at the most but it will help you in your bacon adventures here i have some melted butter i have some white sugar and some brown sugar and i'm mixing it on low [Music] while this is mixing i'll give you one of bae's baking tips and one of my tips for baking is make sure your items are at room temperature so if you're using eggs if you're using butter if you're baking with cream cheese you want to make sure all of that stuff is at room temperature so that way it blends well so i added some vanilla extract and now i'm going to crack an egg and i'm going to add that i'm going to mix it until it's fully incorporated while this is mixing i'll give you another one of bae's baking tips and one of those baking tips is to leave the oven shut don't open it and close it and open it and close it set the timer and let it bake back in the day there was a saying and it went something like set it and forget it and that rings true because you don't want to disrupt the baking process here i've added just a little bit of salt and again i'll leave all the specific measurements in the description box below now i'm adding my flour to this mixture and this is where the magic kind of happens because it's transforming into cookie dough right before our eyes now i don't know about you but i like milk chocolate i also like white chocolate of course white chocolate really isn't you know traditional for this recipe so i used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet you can use bitter if you want to but i absolutely do not like bitter chocolate so milk chocolate for the win and i added not only milk chocolate morsels but i also took some milk chocolate hershey's and i broke those up into pieces and added them as well so i have my oven preheated i'm going to take this cookie dough i'm going to turn these into a couple cookie dough balls i'm going to bake these things in the oven for about about 9 to 11 minutes depending on how soft you really like your cookies and voila you have some fat chewy chunky delicious cookies now if possible you want to let the cookies cool off give them about 10 or 15 minutes but if you can't wait 10 or 15 minutes because i can't wait 10 or 15 minutes then head over to the damn refrigerator get some milk so we can dump these cookies and we go cool them off the manual way so we're about to break our cookie open and it looks amazingly delicious to me it looks super chocolatey um don't expect a chocolate pool from these because again i like to let them cool off a little bit so i'm not scraping the top of my mouth but in a nutshell this is beige chocolate chip cookies based banging chocolate chip cookies you guys try my recipe come back let me know how you like it and if you need some merchandise check out cutting up with bay.com and if we're not friends on social media add me but i want to thank you guys for your time you guys have a good afternoon and until next time peace out you guys [Music] [Music] bye [Music] you", "iA-L82HuRU8": "what is up guys welcome back to the channel welcome back to my kitchen baby you ready to make some anabolic gains cuz I am today we're making Santa's favorite cookie chocolate chip cookies but this is the anabolic version which means we get a lot of protein a lot of fiber a lot of cookies and you don't got to worry about setting yourself back in your diet man that's the key with this recipe or any of the recipes in my cookbook is that we can still have the foods that we think we're not allowed to have and still make results I woke up today on my lien is so far and I had like 20 cookies yesterday have this whole recipe so you can't tell me it doesn't work man can't tell me don't work these are easy to make creamy delicious you can split it up into four different meals split it into two different meals which is what I do you need them all at once man it ain't gonna kill you no one gonna make you strong as always if you bomb a cookbook one time it is a lifetime subscription so you pay for it once you get every future recipe in the cookbook so as of you watching this the cookbook has been updated it go back to the link read download it you got the latest version man we're gonna do that moving forward so if you get it one time you're investing in every future recipe right ain't that a good deal I've also so if you guys are ready to get this epic video underway then as always man I'm here to do it for you let's do [Music] first things first food scale and a mixing bowl food scales essential if you want to rescue to turn out right you got to put the right quantities of stuff in there man if you're just winging it that's how your oven ends up exploding so make sure you got one of these ma'am pro tip numero uno step 1 92 grams of liquid egg whites I literally never eat these by themselves this is a recipe thing man you can't even taste them in this free protein next up we need some flour but we need 2 different types of flours so we need 30 grams of just plain basic white flour you want these to be doughy just like regular cookies man I know some people say like flowers bad breads bad but I'm telling you guys it's not bad it's just the amount you're eating is bad I change your mindset man and then 28 grams of coconut flour if you watch the last video I did anabolic birthday cake bites I told you guys I love this stuff because of the amount of fiber in a man it's great to bake with you mix it with plain white flour oh my gosh the rise on these cookies will be tremendous baking soda essential to give these guys a little fluff I need about 6 grams got it need about 2 scoops of protein or 62 grams as always man amis in that final boss way because it's my favorite and I'm a little biased I'm hoping this stuff's back in stock here in the next couple weeks maybe got a massive order here you guys bought all the first stuff so I mean I can't complain I'm sorry for those you didn't hit me up wondering where I said I'll be back soon what it is you can find it on finalboss one man's on a collar few days you know you could already have 10 for 10% off on the website that's that's done use any protein you got there man flavor doesn't matter vanilla probably works the best but I mean any flavors gonna work man end the day it's still gonna be anabolic next up 32 grams of a peanut butter powder this doesn't make these taste like peanuts surprise me butts can add a lot of protein and some density to make these guys even more anabolic brother I don't know about you but I like my things to be anabolic so much so that I think about getting an anabolic stamp now we're gonna add some fake sugar need about 10 grams of a Splenda sucralose sweetener is zero calorie and gonna kill you I've about 10 packets here see she's about a gram so I always say man if it's artificial sweeteners that differs from you wanting a real cookie or making these anabolic ones and if it is doing harm in my opinion it's worth it if I'm being honest the only side effect I've gotten since starting artificial sugars is a shredded six-pack now we're going to 40 grams sugar-free syrup add some more sweetness to this recipe man next up 170 grams eCos plain Greek yogurt it's gonna think of these bad boys up at a lot of protein a lot of density with all my recipes man my goal is to eat as much as possible you might find some quote unquote healthy cookies out there but you only get one I want to stop a whole batch that's my goal to you guys I'm an eater man so that's the goal with my cookbook and every recipe I make is I wanna be able to eat a lot of it then we add in about 10 grams of vanilla extract boom and finally we just need 30 grams dark chocolate baking sniffs now I use this Lilly's brand because it's the lowest calorie that I can find but sugar-free Hershey's chocolate chips work well to just find whatever version they're not pumping full of sugar and you'll be straight I could do that Oh a little handful thing here I think you want to do is dump all this in here willy-nilly and go way over and just like oops see that wasn't so bad was it hardest part of every recipe is just getting all the ingredients together but it ain't that hard once you got them all here and you have a guide to go off on we're gonna go in and whisk all of this together now it's gonna start and you're gonna be like how is this gonna turn into dough but you just gotta stick with it man like I always say right when you think you're done whisking keep going for an extra minute or two because you really want that baking soda to be in every single piece you want your sweetness to be in every single cookie it's just good cooking manners people and none of this is hard man if this looks like a lot of work I promise you it's really not the benefits man when you have a whole batch of cookies and you can eat them and still make results lose weight get lean build muscle that's guys is the true payoff and I'm telling you you start making stuff you become proud of it and that is what our dough should look like man we give her a smell too man she smells gorgeous other perk of making your own food is you get to do this mmm Burrell you can see just ran out of the bowl this is so good Jers Lee freakin killer so we could go ahead and form these up now but what we're gonna do is put it in the fridge for like 15-20 minutes just to firm up a little bit if you don't want to wait on it you don't have to affected that much but I'm going to because we have all the time in the world throw that bad boy in there and while we're waiting update look who God is cast off a and he got a haircut wall God you want to play with gold why but come on oh come on get the watch the watch yeah yeah whoa God what that's not yours whoa God give me day yet that's not all God whoa God not gonna lie guys feels good to have the boy back dough has officially chill - check it out it's not near as Ronnie anymore it's a lot more sticky worth the wait in my opinion but if you're hungry like I said it doesn't matter what you need is two baking sheets I got one off camera we're gonna swap out but you want to lay down some parchment paper you want to be easier to clean up if just use the metal if you want to doesn't matter it's print white coating a nonstick spray then get you some sort of utensil big spoon works mom bought me this for Christmas I need an excuse to use it so it's officially the cookie spoon go down in here grab yeah just a little ball like this place it on your sheet here's the thing man trust me when I say do not try to do this recipe and cram it all into one tray if you make this whole thing don't do that because these cookies will expand so much more making and it's not even funny I made that mistake in the trial and error of making this recipe and it cost me dearly so I like to put one on each side and then I like to kinda make sure it's kind of a circle you know I mean gravity should do that work for you but you don't want triangle cookies D on 20/20 that might be the safe option so all said and done I got about 10 cookies here what I'm gonna do now just to make them look pretty for the thumbnail is put some chocolate chips on top of some of these like I always say man if a thumbnail doesn't look good and no one watches the video so if you're at this point in it smash that thumbs up button for me please I know people see these videos man start living that anabolic lifestyle and it's probably the best thing you can do to help the channel besides get my cookbook or hire me as a personal trainer one thing to keep in mind when cooking these is that the bottom we're working with doesn't need very long time to cook so 350 degrees for about 6 minutes is gonna be perfect we obviously want to check that so 6 minutes pull them out poke them on the top if they're kind of firm you're good to go if it kind of falls through you might need a minute or two longer but that's it these cook really fast sit this one on top rack boom set this one right below it timer 6 minutes I must see you guys in a second just pulled the cookies out now these ones were bigger so it took about seven and a half minutes to get them perfect but basically what you want to be able to do is touch the top of it and not have your finger like sink into it but you've got to watch super closely because if you overcook them you're gonna lose out on the gooeyness when you get them just right between that six to eight minutes money just get a load of how perfect these are just look at those man beautiful I want to tell you the macros you're gonna go insane but first guys let me get these on a plate on the Tri mouth let's go [Music] hi guys let's get the testing these bad boys I'm a graphic this one's a surprise in my opinion that the prettiest one right there ooh dieting does not have to be boring guys I seriously I why if you take anything away from this video or any of my videos you don't have to hate what you're doing you can be shredded you can be lean you can lose weight you can make results eating freaking cookies man look at that perfection blow my mind my mind right now man blow my own mind Wow mmm Wow promise you ma'am you do this exactly how I make it you don't overcook them you don't burn them all your ingredients in order you could give these to your kids instead of giving them like 500 calories and sugar thousand calories and sugar get some protein ma'am do some good for them they won't even tell a difference man this is hands-down probably my new favorite recipe I think the secret this whole lifestyle is simply finding your favorite recipes right having them all the time this is too good hmm whoa all right enough food porn let me break down the macros in this right in the whole recipe there's 892 calories only 20 grams of fat 100 in 1 grams of protein 77 grams of carbs 29 grams of fiber so in total I made 13 cookies pretty big cookies each cookie has what 80 calories apiece a lot of protein however to make you fool very rarely would I eat this entire batch at one time so what I've been doing is I've been testing this one is I'll eat about half of what I make I'll take the other half put it in a Tupperware container and I will throw that bad boy in the freezer because you think these things are good fresh freeze them I've been freezing all my recipes daily and I enjoy eating them frozen so for me this is two meals this will be my meal right now and then probably you know after I edit this video and I eat again in a few hours I'll do the other half the cookies or I'll save them for tonight the only two things that matter is a are you getting enough protein in and you eating the amount of calories for your goals as your goal fat loss most people just want to be lean and shredded as long as you eat enough protein you let your calories are below a certain point you will get there no matter what guys take it from me I've been eating nothing but these recipes for like the past two weeks and I'm in like some of the best shape of my life without even having to try to cut I'm not even trying to come right now I'm just eating good stuff and

is a little bit awkward for those of you unaware let me catch you up to speed really quick last week I did is scheduled to have a break from a BuzzFeed test but I had a restaurant test planned until my brand-new three-week old iPhone 10 was lost or stolen I'm really now that of course had a ton of footage on it it was not backed up anywhere so we had no video it's a long story that's the short version but we are back this week better than ever I'm in a fantastic mood today for some reason for the first time in a while because I'm promising you this month for the next three and a half weeks I'm gonna put two videos a week up it's been a while since I've done that but it is time this month goes out to all you with spring fever towards the end of a semester or a school year hopefully this will help you power through it get you through those finals so let's get into this one this week I trying to pull over on my Twitter to see what you guys wanted to see me do this week and just barely beating out the brownie bombs was the perfect chocolate chip cookies now these can live up to even a little bit the perfect brownies that I've made eight hundred times on this channel I will be very happy so let's get right into it so that the ingredients for these are pretty basic cookie ingredients but there are some surprises I grabbed some bread flour that I was able to find in Target of all places some salt and baking soda some butter and I'm supposed to use unsalted I only have salted right now let's move on some normal flour and white sugar some chocolate chips and vanilla extract a couple of eggs some espresso powder dark brown sugar and a few dark chocolate baking bars now I'm gonna start with the brown butter first because I'm most scared that I'm gonna mess this up so you basically just have to take a cup or two sticks of your butter let it come to a boil over medium heat and then just basically keep stirring it until you start to see some browning happening now unlike some other youtubers who might have tried this recipe outs if there's a little bubbling that started to happen I just pulled it off of the burner oh shoot oh shoot oh it really was not that difficult so this year is what I think is brown butter you just have to pour that back into a measuring cup and then add some cool water until it reaches the one cup line once again and let that cool while we combine our dry ingredients a cup of the bread flour a little bit less than that of the normal flour and then some salt and baking powder I did add a lot less salt because the butter was obviously salted and that wasn't supposed to be but I gave that a whisk and set it aside for now and now we can move on to the Maine cookie base basically a cup of the dark brown sugar 1/2 cup of the white sugar some vanilla extract a little bit of our espresso powder and then that brown butter mix but make sure it is completely cool first I mix this pretty thoroughly at least for three or four minutes to try to get all that moisture to absorb in the sugar you're gonna want to toss in one full egg and then an additional egg yolk and mix that in as well and then finish it off with our dry ingredient mix adding in a little bit time to prevent it from exploding all over your kitchen and now all this pretty much needs is some chocolate chips and then that dark chocolate baking bar chopped up into chunks folded in together and it smells great it looks okay but it's definitely not as firm as Tasty's was theirs was a nice pliable kind of formable play-doh type dough where mine was a little bit more runny and because of that I basically covered it up and set it in the fridge for a couple hours to let the flavors develop but mainly to let the dough firm up a bit and now all that's left to do with these is bake them in a 350 degree oven on some parchment paper i spooned about two or three tablespoons worth I used a ice cream scoop for this because I figured that would be a little helpful and they came out looking decent they do have a nice little brown and crispy edge but they're kind of really dark they do smell great though so let's give them a try I really do like the addition of the chocolate chunks because those melt a lot more for whatever reason than the chocolate chips these do kind of look like a like a either a star board or a bakery type of cookie maybe a little darker but I think I messed up the chocolate is absurdly bitter and I already know it's because my stupid behind used a hundred percent cocoa dark chocolate why I'm an idiot basically they're also really rich and kind of greasy a little bit I feel like that the butter mix might have mess it up as well I kinda expected to get punched in the face with sweetness but you really don't at all I'm kind of surprised I guess let's just see what some other people around the house think of them disgusting odd that's a nice way of saying vomit worthy about the wife your tongue off just me supposed to be anyone mm-hmm mmm-hmm delicious was tolling my first one I ate today apparently not everybody hates them what not because I do feel like most of my complaints were my fault and very easily correctable I'm gonna give these one more go but I'm definitely gonna head to the grocery store beforehand and get the proper stuff first up is the chocolates not this devil hundred percent cocoa bitter garbage this 60% stuff should do we're also going to need some kosher salt because I've read in multiple places that kosher salt is way different from iodized salt and of course we're gonna need some unsalted but not right now some unsalted butter alright guys back to the kitchen you guys pretty much know the drill I just whipped up some brown butter with the unsalted butter this time brought it back to a cup with some cool water combined all my dry ingredients threw everything together in a big bowl this time with the proper salts eventually with the proper chocolate which won't make these so grossly bitter I only refrigerated these for about an hour this time around and kind of just spooned on the batter onto my parchment paper and after I bake them for the same amount of time in the same temperature oven these are looking pretty much the same if not a lot better the one big difference I forgot to mention when I was baking these is I used equal parts brown sugar to white sugar so about three quarters of a cup of each one just because those came out really dark and I don't know maybe it made a difference who knows I'll give you guys a comparison does it look any different I think so I think these look a little bit better that's the one chocolates 100 times better they're soft and chewy but they have a slight Chris penis around the outside that brown butter pungent this isn't so strong in this one just the chewy texture of this alone is oh my god them I'm definitely gonna be remaking these in the future that's for sure but I hope you guys enjoyed today's buzz feet test with a redo at the end if you did slap a like on this one as I said I have a brand new restaurant test come in Sunday because for the rest of this month I got two videos a week follow me over on twitter follow me on instagram i'm not sure which one of those i'm gonna do the next poll on so follow me on both and keep an eye out other than that though have an awesome weekend and I'll see you right back here on Sunday you I didn't watch what's making I'm making shrimp fondue are you alright oh I think we're gonna have to end up in the hospital I'm here trying to make cookies for the family and you're tripping out the steps so there was this girl who tried this recipe yourself and at one point she had this pot on the burner and it was like boiling over and just kind of sat there and watched it as it burned her whole countertop her stove and she got roasted for it in our comments so I'm gonna send her a little a little shot maybe it'll start another comment war oh wow", "CYRWKc0CQx4": "okay I clean the pots and pans wash the countertops took out the trash now it's time for a treat and I'm thinking [Music] it was roughly 1938 and a baker named Bruce graves Wakefield wanted to give her customers something new so she decided to add chocolate to her plain cookies chocolate chips weren't around it but semi-sweet chocolate bars were used in baking all the time so she cut the bar up into little pieces and added them to her batter pretty sure to use a knife to do that but it works the cookies became popular and soon chocolate chips are produced and sold specifically for cookies can I have one nope Touche Ruth graves Wakefield Touche for a chocolate chip cookie recipe we'll need 2 cups of flour 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 ounces salt 2 sticks of unsalted softened butter 1 cup of granulated white sugar 1/2 cup of light brown sugar 2 eggs 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and of course the star of our show two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and two cups of dark chocolate chips first in a bowl mix together the flour baking soda and salt in the second bowl add the butter and both triggers use a wooden spoon to mix it by hand until it's light and fluffy you want to mix it until it's getting incorporated but it's gonna take a while so be patient then scrape down the sides of the rubber spatula and add your eggs one at a time [Music] after that slowly and the flour mix and continued then stir in the chocolate chips until the whole bowl is a nice brown color dotted with chips who want to use a baking sheet to bake your cookies it's low edges a lot of the cookies to cook more evenly in the oven and you want to use parchment paper parchment paper will rent the cookies we're sticking to the sheet as they bake for each cookie scoop up two tablespoons of dough and then roll it into a ball place them on the parchment paper about a fingers length apart because we want to give them some room to spread which they will now the cookies spread into each other well don't be ruined let us end up as one big cookie huge pink ginormous cookie so we're gonna want to chill our cookie dough before we bake it because if we make these right after making the dough they're gonna spread out and become really thin and that's not what we want so we're gonna pop these in the fridge for about 30 minutes our cookies are chilled the oven is ready okay we're gonna make our cookies for 10 to 12 minutes rotating halfway through we already get a time jump let's do musical interlude awesome they're done let's take him out and let her sit for about five minutes in the pan then transfer them onto a cooling rack and let them cool completely hmm there's nothing like a freshly baked hot cookie now if we're gonna make these cookies on your own just remember these tips use white and brown sugar so your cookie can be chewy chill your dough so that your cookies don't bake too thin and now roast what's the third one till your dough no I'm so that already use brown sugar so that too I invented the chocolate chip cookie Bruce thank you I'm a hundred and fifteen years old [Music]", "hNq8JgrJ5_A": "Hey Guys! I am Nisa Homey and welcome back to my channel. Today, I am sharing a super healthy homemade\nchocolate chip cookies. I had shared this cookies on my instagram\nand many of you requested the recipe. I make these kinds of healthy snacks for my\nchildren as both of of them are living away from home now and both of them at times are\nterribly homesick and to cheer them up, I make some snacks like cookies, granolas, and\nsavoury snacks and parcel it to them and that is also the reason why you see some kid friendly\nsnacks on my channel. Now, coming back to this recipe, its one of\nmy absolute favourite and I prefer my kids or even your kids to enjoy homemade snacks\nrather than packaged ones which contains so many unrecognisable ingredients and to understand\nthat you just have to read the ingredients list on a cookie or a biscuit packet. The best thing about homemade cookies are\nyou make it using real ingredients which you have at home. No artificial flavours, additives, fillers,\npreservatives, trans fat, or refined sugar and yes! homemade cookies keep good for upto\na month that is if they stay that long :) BTW these cookies are made with whole wheat flour\nand not with maida or refined flour. So, lets get started with the recipe. I am using virgin coconut oil, you can also\nuse wood pressed coconut oil instead. They both have very neutral flavour and taste. I am also using this brown sugar which I bought\nlocally. For the sugar part I am using this traditional\nkhandsari sugar. Khand is a type of unrefined raw sugar made\nfrom sugar cane syrup . It is neither bleached nor contains harmful chemicals or additives. It is full of minerals and other nutrients,\nmaking it a healthier choice than refined chemically treated sugar. Children living far away from home need all\nthe healthier options available. For some extra healthy fats and protein, I\nam using salted and roasted peanuts. I have measured 3/4 cup of salted and roasted\npeanuts and I am roughly chopping them up. The addition of peanuts are entirely optional\nand you can also opt for any other nut of your choice instead of peanuts. Once the peanuts are roughly chopped, I am\nkeeping it aside. Into a large bowl, I am adding in 1 cup tightly\npacked brown sugar, 1/2 cup khandsari sugar, 3/4 cup virgin coconut oil, 1 tsp vanilla\nessence and I am giving this all a mix. Add in 2 eggs and then mix it really well\nuntil it is creamy and thick and is lighter in colour. Add in 2 cups of Khapli wheat flour also known\nas emmer wheat. Khapli wheat is an ancient variety of wheat\ngrain which has a very low gluten molecule when compared to modern processed wheat, hence\nI prefer to use khapli wheat in my recipes; however, you can also use ordinary wheat flour\ninstead. Addin 1/2 tsp baking soda and lightly mix\nthis with a spoon. Add in the roughly chopped peanuts and mix\nit again. Add in 1 cup dark chocolate chips and mix\nit lightly into the wheat flour. This actually will prevent the nuts and chocolate\nchips from sinking down while baking. Add in half tsp pink himalayan salt and mix\nall this up with the spoon. At this moment, I am preheating my oven to\n180 degree C. To measure and scoop the cookie dough I am using my icecream scoop and I am\ngreasing the insides and outsides of the ice cream scoop with coconut oil and then take\na scoop of the cookie dough and place it on the baking tray lined with baking mat or you\ncan use a parchment paper. using the ice cream scoop to measure the cookie\ndough will also make sure that you get equally sized cookies. However, you can also use a table spoon to\nmeasure the cookie dough. Press down, one tsp chocolate chips on top\nof each cookie, remember that cookies will spread out when it is baked so the chocolate\nchips will spread out nicely on top of the cookies. Lastly, lightly flatten each cookie and press\ndown the chocolate chips with your fingers. Bake it in the preheated oven for about 14-15\nminute. Always remember that oven temperature varies\nwith oven. So, pls keep an eye on the cookies after about\n10-12 mins. Repeat the same with the rest of the dough\nand once baked allow it to cool down lightly on the pan and then remove it from the pan\nto cool down completely and my super healthy bakery style healthy chocolate chip cookies\nare ready to serve. Store it in an air tight glass container and\nenjoy with family and friends. So guys, do try this healthy chocolate chip\ncookies and let me know how it turned out. Dont forget to like, comment, and share this\nvideo with family and friends. Thank you for watching and until next time.

back to crumbs and doilies HQ and middle of V January I hope you've been enjoying all the vegan baking and I hope you've been doing a lot I've seen lots of your work on Instagram so well done this recipe is an absolute brillo pads recipe it is so so good if you just recently turned vegan and one of the things you're missing the most is a good chewy chocolate chip cookie then this is your lucky day because this is a vegan chocolate chip cookie and it is so delicious the first thing I'm going to do is to mix my dry ingredients together just sifting them into a bowl so I've got some plain flour here there's 300 grams of that I've also got a teaspoon of baking powder and I've got 3/4 of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and half a teaspoon of salt so just shuffle that all through so once that's all through you can put that to one side and now I'm going to mix my wet ingredients sort off because I've got some wet ingredients and my sugar so I've got a hundred grams each of caster sugar and light brown sugar going into my bowl and also I have 120 milliliters of oil and I also have 75 milliliters of water and also put a teaspoon of vanilla extract in there and then give it a good whisk so once that's all combined you don't have to risk it for too long you then need to put your dry ingredients in with your wet ingredients and give it a really good mix now once it's all combined you don't want to go crazy whisking it and then that it's pretty much ready now you'll notice it is a very strange consistency not the kind of consistency that you normally associate with cookie dough don't worry that is how it's supposed to be it's just a little bit odd but you need to wrap this in cling film put it into the fridge for overnight and then come back to in the morning right so I've just chopped up some chocolate chips just so that they're ready to go and my cookie dough which has been sitting in the fridge overnight and is firmer a lot of Fermin than it was yesterday is ready to be molded into lovely balls of yummy cookie dough so I've got my scales here because I like to be precise and I'm going to weigh my balls 40 grams each [Music] now you want to put your rolled cookie dough balls into the fridge or the freezer before you bake them but before you do obviously you're probably wondering where the chocolate chips are going to go well they're going to go all the way around the outside around the outside right so I'm just going to roll them in white chocolate chips and then put them into my trade [Music] I've always preferred using chocolate chip as in a chocolate bar chipped up by my own fur hand for chocolate chip cookies just because you then get little pieces and big piece it's a little bit more irregular rather than using like pre-made chocolate chips and obviously don't forget to make sure that your chocolate is vegan otherwise these ain't gonna be vegans [Music] so this recipe makes about 12 cookies if you don't want to make all your 12 cookies then you roll them into balls and put them in the freezer for just cover them for them in the freezer and then bake them whenever you like but for now just put your tray or cookies into the freezer for about 10 minutes just to firm up a bit so these have been in the freezer for about 10 minutes and that will just help them to stop spreading way too much but for now you want to put these onto a baking sheet lined with paper and you want to spread them out quite far apart just in case they do spread [Music] and then you just want to bake these at 170 degrees C for 12 to 15 minutes and they want to be lightly golden around the outside but it's still a little bit poofy in the middle [Music] [Music] [Music] mmm-hmm how about them they look just like real chocolate chip cookies right but they're vegan so technically they're still real and they are absolutely delicious and if you eat them in a minute like I'm about to do they'll stay all warm and gooey and they're just so delicious and I can't wait these even so please give them a go take a picture put on Instagram use hashtag cupcake Gemma make sure I see it maybe I'll even feature you on mega fan Monday if I like your picture enough but the main thing is that you just make them and then obviously eat them because they are so so good so I hope you've enjoyed all the vegan treats I've had for you this January it's vegan you let me know how you get on in the comments box below and I will be back next week [Music] Yama's seriously yes it's so dude everything is falling apart it's like an earthquake", "eJJHSbfBeZc": "hello it's Jesse here and I decided that we are going to make some holiday cookies now I'm a really good cook I will say but I'm a terrible Baker that's where Cindy comes

bet you do because it seems to me like most people like chocolate chip cookies in fact whenever I post a chocolate chip cookie on my Instagram it gets so many more likes than any other cookie so today's recipe is a chocolate chip cookie it's a cakey cookie so if you're a cakey cookie fan this is the cakey cookie for you measure out two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour now you're gonna get your cakiness by adding more flour so it's like two and a quarter cups is a little higher than maybe your standard have a teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of kosher salt you can beat that into the butter and sugar mixture you can whisk it with the dry ingredients in here I have 14 tablespoons of unsalted butter at any temperature just loosen that up just a bit add 3/4 of a cup of white sugar and a quarter cup packed brown sugar i brown dark brown that is light brown it's kind of up to you it'll have a little bit more of a deep flavor use the dark until light and fluffy this will have two large eggs it's a light and fluffy like you said and then like to crack it into I fall before those directly add a teaspoon and then your dry ingredients you can really just add it all at once if you want to not like when you're making a cake cookies are that much easier because you can just dump everything together but you guys already know that beat to mine and then for the chocolate chip factor I have a combination semi-sweet and milk chocolate and these milk chocolate chips are few hundreds I've never seen such big chocolate chips before kind of fun when everything is fully combined you can add your chips and just you can either stir them in or beat them in I always just go ahead and beat them in have your oven preheating to 350 degrees if you're gonna bake these right away if you're not gonna bake them right away nobody scoop them freeze them and then transfer them to resealable bags and then whenever you want one cookie five cookies ten cookies you just pull them out of the freezer and bake them this is a heaping tablespoon these don't spread all that much because like I said they're cakey cookies so you can put quite a few on a baking pan they only get about that big about two inches around so I guess three across on a rimmed baking sheet you know what'd be fun have a party and make cake eat chocolate chip cookies chewy chocolate chip cookies and then like something in between like a skillet cookie or something and see which one disappears fastest get these into the 350 degree oven and bake them until they're set on top that'll take about 10 to 12 minutes once they come out of the oven you're gonna want to let them cool well you're not gonna want to let them cool but you should let them cool completely before you eat them and then you have

cookie mix gift in a jar just in time for holiday preparations i know that people are starting to think about what you're going to give to your friends your family your neighbors your co-workers and this is an option for you it's super simple it's really easy i've even prepared these little tags for you i can't wait to show you how this all comes together [Music] today we're going to go over how to make a chocolate chip cookie mix in a jar this is the perfect gift that you can give to friends neighbors co-workers and just spread a little bit of holiday cheer you're also going to attach a tag to the jar that's going to have the preparation instructions and they're going to be able to take this home make it real quick with ingredients that they most likely already have on hand and enjoy a dozen or just a little over a dozen delicious warm chocolate chip cookies so i love gifts in a jar i know so many of you do as well and this is a great way to do it from scratch so what we have here is one and three quarter cups of all-purpose flour and to that we're going to add a teaspoon each of baking soda and salt and we're just going to mix that together just to get it well combined um i know some of you are going to ask me how far in advance can you make these i would say two to three months in advance there's nothing in here that's going to technically spoil i i would be very careful regarding the brown sugar so you might want to take that into consideration if you live in a more humid area if you have a vacuum sealer with a jar attachment you could always vacuum seal these and that will help prolong their shelf life as well so remember these aren't really intended to be long-term food storage these are intended to be gifts leave our flour mixture in here and we're going to want to make sure that that is well tamped down so you're going to want to bang this on your counter just to make sure it's nicely settled and you can get as much in there as possible i am using a quart jar and when you're confident that it has settled enough then we're going to move on to the next step now i have one and a half cups of chocolate chips you can use whatever kind of chocolate chips you like again you want to make sure that you shake the jar between each addition so that things are nicely settled and you have room for everything you can also use a tamper if you have a tamper i always have one of these on hand these are great for tarts and crushing graham crackers or whatever you have this just makes sure that everything is in there really really well the next thing we're going to put in here is the brown sugar this is three quarters of a cup of packed brown sugar and you're going to want to get that in there and you're going to want to pack it in there so get that in there because you want to make sure you have room for your granulated sugar which is going to sit right on the top it's also going to help seal it up a little but like i said you want to make sure your brown sugar doesn't go hard because that will be unpleasant and it will be very difficult for whoever gets this to get it out of the jar on top of that we're going to put a half cup of granulated sugar get that in there and just gently tap it and you should be good to go now put the lid on i have one of these plastic jar lids that's what i have on hand right now if you guys are big into canning you know that right now there's the hunt is on for canning jars and lid these are easy to find if you already have jars on hand another suggestion for you if you don't have mason jars or can't find mason jars because that is the case right now is that you can start saving those pretty glass jars that you get from your groceries or plastic jars you don't even have to build this in a jar you can build it in a cellophane bag tie it with a bow put it in a gift bag with your instruction card and everything is going to be fine i'm just going to pretty this up a little bit with some red satin ribbon and then i have prepared for you guys along with the written recipe a sheet with four of these chocolate chip cookie mix preparation cards that you can feel free to print out i have printed mine out on cardstock i do not have a hole punch with me right this minute so i'm just gonna get a pair of scissors and make it work you can just pop your card right on in there and you're good to go now remember you don't have to have a bow if you don't want to use a bow you know no one's going to care you can pop this jar or the cellophane bag if you're going to use that in a really cute little gift bag and call it good or you could put it in a mixing bowl that would be a cute idea too inside of like a cellophane bag in a mixing bowl and that would be cute but that is how you make a chocolate chip cookie mix in a jar all the instructions on how to prepare it all they have to do is add softened butter an egg and some vanilla and scoop and bake that's it it's super easy this is going to be a welcome gift i'm sure it's a very budget friendly gift if you have a lot of people to give to it's also just a nice little bit of holiday cheer that you can share with whoever you like so gift in a jar never a bad thing i hope that you give this a try and i hope that you love it and until next time happy holidays [Music] you", "q_-Lj5Ly33M": "the smell of your house alone

based and stuffed with a different filling in the center so when you're making brown butter you're looking for that medium brown color but you can really let it go as dark as you want I prefer to have it be a little bit burnt which may seem scary but it doesn't do anything except add more flavor and it's just delicious after your brown butter has chilled for a little bit you could start creating your cookie dome I used the creaming method as we all showed when making cookies so you're going to want to cream your butter and sugars until they have a very creamy cloud-like texture this aerates the butter and sugar which makes the cookie dough a little bit lighter since we're adding stuffing and mix-ins we want to make sure our base isn't too debts I like to gradually sift in my dry ingredients to make sure they're really well incorporated and there aren't any lumps scraping the edges of the bowl is essential in making the dough it will ensure that all the ingredients are consistent throughout and will give you the best cookie possible [Music] one kind of chocolate chip is fine but I like to add two sizes for a little variation and the many ones are just so cute in order to properly stuffed your cookies you're going to need to chill the dough for about two hours in the fridge if you don't you'll have a mess on your hands go ahead and grab an ice cream scoop and scoop out your cookie flatten it out to about a quarter inch thickness that way the stuffing won't lose out and then fill it with the stuffing of your choice like cookie butter is one of my favorites but caramel is great because that just oozes out of the center and it's so good I've been baking for as long as I can remember my mom used to let me pour the dry ingredients over the way and it's moments like that that have helped form me into the person I am today back when I was in culinary school I used to bake stuff cookies for my whole family as Christmas presents because I was a college student I started off with pretty basic flavors and I gradually started adding in crazier ingredients and they looked at me like I was crazy but after they tried them they were all obsessed I got pretty amazing feedback from my family and it encouraged me to start my own business I like to add the toppings on top of the cookie because I mean you put forth all this hard work when baking a cookie and you mix everything in the dough and no one can see it we eat with our eyes so why not put everything on top my cookies are a reflection of myself and I think that's what makes them so unique it's crazy to think that someone ran them across the states can be sitting on their couch right now enjoying one of my cookies that I handmade for them I don't know about you but I think that's awesome I grew up eating chocolate chip cookies everyone grew up eating chocolate chip cookies it's just a fundamental part of who we are so every time you take a bite it just takes you back to your childhood and that's my goal our cookies are completely customizable of course we have preset flavors that you can choose from we also give you the option to create your own cookies from scratch you start off with selecting your cookie dough stuffing and mix-ins my favorite cookie that we make is be recess cookie it's the perfect combination of sweet and salty showcases all of our favorite recess time snacks from when we were younger as pretzels potato chips chocolate chips peanut butter stuffing and a light sprinkle of sea salt on top if sweet and salty is your thing then trust me this is your cookie in my oven I like to bake my cookies for 11 minutes in 33 seconds but everyone's oven is different so check on them at 11 minutes but they can go up to 14 you're looking for them to be lightly golden fully spread out and you'll have yourself a beautiful cookie biting into a warm chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven provides you with one of the top ten best feelings in the world and with my stuffed cookies there's that extra element in the center that just takes it to the next level [Music] you", "vQnrDOsZGKA": "I shall file today welcome you all to the la Valse kitchen today i'm going to be showing you a cookie recipe which is called as eggless chocolate chip cookies so the first step in making the cookies would be to combine the plain flour along with some baking powder some baking soda and mix it well and we will keep this aside now let's proceed to the next step so a second step as we said would be to combine the powdered sugar some soft butter to use soft butter is very very important don't waste any butter and now we will whisk it well till it's nice and smooth it might take a little effort but make sure you use a whisk you can also take help of a spoon it's almost getting done as you can see and whisk it till the sugar has been well mixed we'll mix it well with the spatula as well to this we'll add some vanilla essence milk chocolate chips lots of it and we will mix it well - this will add the plain flour baking powder baking soda mixture and we'll mix it well till the dough binds well you can see it has been binded well now all we have to do is roll them into balls and flatten them to make a round cookie so we will take one portion and we'll shape it into a round put it between our palms and lightly flatten it make sure it's not very thick as well otherwise it will take a lot of time to bake and make sure the edges are nice and perfect so in the same way we roll the remaining cookies so now these have been rolled and are ready we are going to bake them in a preheated oven at 180 degree Celsius for 15 minutes so the cookies have been baked and they're smelling YUM you can see they have been nice and crisp we'll allow them to cool slightly and let's serve it so once they've been cool completely store them in an airtight container or a jar like this and enjoy it whenever you want it I'm sure kids or adults everybody

hi guys I'm Tamera the food director at Woolworths fresh magazine and today I'm going to give you my secret recipe to make the best chocolate chip out coqu\u00ed's they're soft they're chewy they're full of chocolate chips and I'm gonna give you heaps of tips along the way watch along and let's get started alright so clean hands I'm gonna run you through the ingredients that you're gonna need we've got one and a half cups of plain flour one cup of rolled oats you're gonna need a teaspoon of bicarb soda three quarters of a cup of firmly packed brown sugar some flakes salt a teaspoon of vanilla 1/3 of a cup of castor sugar and most importantly dark chocolate dark chocolates the best in this alright so I brought in my mixer because normally it's hiding away in the corner first step is pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees fan-forced and our first step here with the mixer is gonna be creaming our butter and sugar together so I've got unsalted butter here it's at room temperature so if I push it it makes a dent in there but it's not too soft that it's starting to melt and I've got a paddle attachment for my mixer so if you don't have a stand mixer you can just use a handheld feeder that's totally fine alright so butter into the mix up we're gonna start off at a slow speed and slowly increase to medium speed all right so it's looking really good and this step takes about order I don't know if you can hear me um this step takes about two to three minutes and if you don't notice it getting stuck on the sides of the mixer you can just stop it at any point and just give it a scrape down with the spatula just pop that back on and it's just gonna take about another minute but you can already see it's getting nice and pale and fluffy the hardest part is always waiting for the cookies that's the hardest part okay so the butter looks beautiful pale fluffy so it's time to talk about sugar so we're using two types of sugar this is pretty cool this is a really good tip for making cookies so dark brown sugar has a little bit of molasses in it gives it that darker color but most importantly a beautiful caramel flavor and it's also gonna make your cookies really soft and chewy and then caster sugar just make sure that you know we still have some structure to our cookie and that it's a little bit crisp on top and then just put the mixer back on and it's gonna take about a minute to combine butter sugar done you can see it's that beautiful consistent color and texture it's nice and fluffy and creamy so it's time to add the egg so just cracking in one egg and also adding in the vanilla at this stage too we've mixed a lot already and that was to get some you know air into that butter mixture but now it's about mixing as little as possible because we don't want tough cookies so this is just gonna take about a minute just until it's incorporated it's looking beautiful thick creamy still fluffy now it's time to add the dry ingredients I'm using rolled oats along with that plain flour it just gives the cookies a really nice interesting texture flour also a teaspoon of bicarb soda in this just gives your cookies a little bit a lift a little bit of rides in the oven make sure they're not flat and dense and salt is really important too just a pinch will season the cookies and as weird as that sound it is important to see them sweet as well as savory this sounds like the soundtrack to my life just positive mixer in the background so you can hear the sound of the mixture changing a little bit that's my sign that this is ready okay really important not to over mix so I think we're done we're good so it's time to chop the chocolate at this point you can use other mix-ins as well like cranberries or sultanas but I have no idea why you would because chocolate is obviously the best so let's get chopping I'm using a block of dark chocolate because I find this is better than using chocolate chips when you roughly chop this it means that you can get some really big chunks which are going to be beautiful pools of chocolate in the cookies and also some little bits as well which are going to be flecked throughout so this gives you the ultimate cookie in my opinion okay time to add in the chocolate there's no like I feel like there's no neat way to do that okay so really really low speed it's just to incorporate the chocolate now just cover this and put it in the fridge for about 10-15 minutes it means that some of that moisture is gonna be absorbed through the cookie dough it's gonna give us a better texture cookie it's not gonna spread so much in the oven and then we'll be back to bake them this is actually another little tip this is actually an ice cream scoop but it is perfect for scooping cookie dough so all you're gonna do is just scoop that cookie dough roll it into a ball just to smooth that surface look at that big chunk of chocolate in there that's gonna be delicious when we bake this so just flatten it down just a little bit working with chilled is actually really good because the heat of your hands can melt the butter but because we've chilled it first not a problem so we also want to just allow for some spreading of the cookies in the oven so don't place them too close together alright so first tray is done I'm gonna put them into the oven while I roll the rest this is gonna take about nine or ten minutes you want to make sure there's still a little bit under baked so they're beautiful soft and chewy when they come out so at this stage you can freeze them as these shaped cookies put them into a little ziplock bag and then you've got cookies on demand whenever you want them just pop them into the oven and they'll take about two or three extra minutes on top of that normal cookie time cookies are ready okay so bring them out of the oven they're gonna look like they're still a little bit under baked at this stage but that is actually perfect that means they cook perfectly they will harden as they cool I'm gonna while they're hot just sprinkle them with a little extra flake salt oh my gosh guys I have never been so excited for something to come out of the oven I can tell you this is the best chocolate chip or cookie you will try they've just cooled down but still warm enough that they're beautiful and gooey inside check this out young for more great recipe inspiration check out your latest copy of Woolworths fresh magazine [Music]", "xLgZsTbHIjE": "hi guys hopefully all of you are doing well today we're gonna keep it simple and we're gonna be making some chewy white chocolate chip cookies this recipe is super easy to make and it's a little cute project you can do with the kids so let's get into it we're gonna start by sifting our dry ingredients and that's all-purpose flour baking soda and salt for the exact measurements to this recipe check out GT seasoning com the link is below in the description and it's gonna be the top comment now we can go ahead and put those dry ingredients aside and work on creaming our brown sugar our white sugar and our butter together I'm using a stand mixer you can also use a hand mixer in a large bowl and I'm just gonna cream that together for about a minute or so next I'm gonna add my two eggs one at a time making sure that each one is well mixed before adding the next and then I'm gonna follow that up with some pure vanilla extract about two teaspoons and then be sure and stop and scrape your bowl down whether you're using a stand mixer or a hand mixer after you scrape your bowl down go ahead and start adding your dry mixture I do have the mixer on low while I'm doing this I just don't want flour everywhere as soon as the cookie dough comes together stop the mixer now definitely you can fold the chocolate chips in by hand but what I like to do since I already stopped the mixer is just to quickly add them in and as soon as they get mixed in stop the mixer again you don't want to get too comfortable overworking this dough it comes together really easily and quickly just like that and then I'm just gonna use a regular little cookie scoop to scoop out each cookie and I also like to put a little extra chips right on the top so when they bake those are sitting right up top where you can see them we're gonna bake these at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 to 22 minutes and there they are they are nice and chewy 22 minutes actually keeps the cookie chewy even the next day and you store it in an airtight container they are absolutely delicious thank you guys so much for joining me you know I appreciate it when you come cook with me and hang out don't forget this recipe and others can be found at GT seasoning calm and I'll see you guys next time [Music] you [Music]", "f3N_qIGqQdY": "hey guys ed welcome back to the kitchen is a new week which means a new bunch of cookie recipes to test today so spit also happens to be what I think is possibly the easiest recipe we're going to be testing this whole series today's recipe is gonna be from Tara of Reggie's beautiful book with seven spoons and it's her recipe for classic chocolate chip cookies and this recipe exploded on the internet and suddenly I've been meaning to make it for a long long time I haven't quite got around to it so today we're gonna try her recipe the ingredients in this recipe are very standard chocolate chip cookie ingredients as most of the recipes in this series use but there is one big difference and that is the butter the butters melted which means it's so much easier to make there's no mixer there's no equipment really other than a spatula a whisk and a large bowl so let's talk about chocolate choice for a second so I am using Guittard chocolate wafers because I really love the way they melt now in this recipe Tara calls for chocolate bars that I've been chopped up but the reason I like the wafers for this recipe is mainly ease a the bag is the exact amount of chocolate that Tara calls for but also I can be a little bit lazy sometimes and the benefit of having the wafers is they don't need chopping then the perfect kind of disk size for the cookies and also because they're nice and thin they melt beautifully into the cookie so you end up with layers of dough and melted chocolate dough and melted chocolate and for me it makes the perfect chocolate it could be so all I'm going to need for this recipe is unsalted butter plain all-purpose flour baking powder baking soda salt light brown sugar and caster sugar 2 large eggs vanilla extract and of course chocolate so as I said start the video this is incredibly easy it's basically mixing your wept into your dry so the first thing we do is take a unsalted butter and melt that over low heat we're not looking to brown it in this recipe we just want to melt it so a low heat is perfect meanwhile we need to work on our dry goods so we're going to take our plain flour adds about our baking soda or baking powder and our salt we're just gonna whisk that together there's no need to sieve it a good brief wasting just to combine everything it nicely it's perfectly fine we're going to set that aside until needed so once I put is melted we're gonna add that to a large bowl and then to that we're gonna add our two types of sugar slip ester and light brown then I'm just gonna whisk that together until everything is nicely combined it might look like it's gonna split for a little bit but with enough whisking it'll come together in a pan watching this then gonna add our eggs one at a time again just whisk it until nicely combined [Music] then finally we're gonna add our vanilla at this point we're going to switch from our whisk add the dry goose to the bowl and then just fold that until it's combined you don't need to mix it completely a little bit of flour is fine because then we're going to add our chocolate now we're gonna add the whole bag of chocolate wafers and then we're gonna fold that in to combine which we'll mix in those last little bits of flour as well at this point the dough is ready to bake or you can refrigerate it overnight as well if you want to prepare in advance so what we're gonna do is line two baking sheets with parchment paper preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius which is 350 degrees Fahrenheit so once our dough is ready we're gonna roll that into balls and roughly about three tablespoons in size place us onto a parchment lined baking tray leaving them at a good couple of inches apart as they will spread a lot as they bake the cookies are then going to go in the oven for about 10 to 12 minutes just until starting to go lightly golden around the edges and on top but the middles should still be really nice and soft because we want that beautiful soft texture in the middle undercooked [Music] so once the cookies have been in the oven for about 10 to 12 minutes that we really nice and golden-brown are still really nice and soft and fudgy on the middle we just need to leave them to cool before we can dig in so the finished cookies are beautiful and soft in the middle fall of delicious chocolate so the last thing we need to do is try the cookie because these look delicious hmm so I really like how the dough is still nice and soft but it's a little crisp on the outside and the chocolate really works that layering of dough and chocolate don't shock left I'll taste so far this is the closest I've got to my ultimate chocolate cookie but I think I want a little bit more texture on the outside and I really want to push that salt for a little bit but these are delicious as always the recipe is up in the corner and if you have a favorite chocolate chip recipe that I haven't covered so far in the series they even comment down below because I would love to know what that is and maybe we will make a season 2 don't forget to come back on Thursday where we will have a recipe to this week it's another delicious recipe so make sure you come check it out I'm off to eat more of these because they are so so good and I'll see you next time", "0KbfS8mQw4o": "hey guys it's brian with retired at 40 live life simple and welcome back to the kitchen today we're going to see if we can freeze dry chocolate chip cookies we're going to do four different ways just to make sure that we can do that we're going to do all that coming up so i really want to make sure that this turns out today and that's why we're doing four different ways we're going to do the first tray is just going to be cookie dough that we can eat raw so we're going to skip the egg and we're going to replace the egg with ground flax seed the second option is going to be a cookie dough without chocolate chips in it and we're going to try and add the chocolate chips in later just just in case it doesn't work which means the third is going to be with the chocolate chips added in and then the fourth option we're actually going to bake the cookies we're going to try and bake them in this pan and then we're going to freeze dry them that way so typically chocolate chip cookies have either butter or oil in them or both and we know that freeze drying and oil don't really go well together so we're going to replace the oil today with homemade applesauce so let's get into our lineup of ingredients first so we're not doing butter we're doing applesauce recommended as a one to one ratio so this calls for one cup of butter so we're going to do one cup of applesauce for the egg cookies we're going to need one egg and then for the flax seed replacement we need a three to one ratio so you need to basically make one egg you're going to need three tablespoons of water you're gonna need one tablespoon of ground flax seed and then you need to let that soak for about five minutes and then the rest is pretty straightforward we're going to need a teaspoon of vanilla we're going to need two thirds of a cup of sugar half a cup of brown sugar two cups of self-rising flour and make sure that it is self rising and 12 ounces of chocolate chips and that's it we're just going to add everything together so before i add the chocolate chips i know that chocolate doesn't always do well when we're freeze drying either but i'm hoping that because i got mini chocolate chips i'm hoping that it'll help out the batch i'm doing right now with the the mini chocolate chips they're going to be the ones that go into the oven and then the ones that um we try and rehydrate raw with the chocolate chips in them let's do this so if you're not getting the right consistency that you want you can always add a little bit of extra flour until it thickens it up to the point where it looks like cookie dough should so let's load up this first tray already this is gonna be the tray that we're gonna bake in the oven and then try and freeze dry i think we just want a real thin layer with this just like that and then we're gonna go to 375 on the oven for eight to ten minutes this second tray we're just going to use the rest we're going to do the exact same thing but we're just not going to cook it right into the oven with the harvest right tray so i have my doubts whether replacing a couple ingredients would actually turn out they're a little bit puffier with a self-rising flour and with the the with the apple sauce instead of the butter you can always use your own recipe if you don't want to use mine they sure taste okay though voila those turned out nice i'm just going to go ahead and throw these right in the deep freeze so then the second tray is actually going to just go right into the deep freeze as well because this is the one that has chocolate chips in it that it's going to get rehydrated and we're gonna try and cook it from there tray number three this third tray is the same recipe just without chocolate chips so we're gonna rehydrate this and then we'll add the chocolate chips in after it's rehydrated which is i just wanna make sure that we have every chance that we can to make this turn out there's that for tray number four remember this is the one that has the variation with the egg because we are just going to eat this raw and i don't really want to have raw eggs it really just kind of turns into a mush and we're going to use that instead of an egg and just to make sure that we have all of our options covered i'm going to do half of the dough with chocolate chips and half without now these are going to go in the deep freeze and then we'll go freeze dry so our cookies have had plenty of time to get frozen now so i'm going to put the freeze dryer on pre-freeze and that also reminds me if you have any ideas for freeze-dried videos just let me know down in the comments section in the meantime we're going to get this going start non-liquid cookies pre-frozen also don't forget to like the video if you found it helpful subscribe if you haven't already and click that bell to get notifications and new videos when they come out okay everything seems like it froze really nice and solid i think it's gonna do as well as it can do i'm hoping that chocolate doesn't do what chocolate usually does maybe with the mini chips it'll change things i'm not sure but we're going to find out in a couple days all right these have been in for 28 hours and two minutes it looks like i have my doubts that these are done but you just never know it's not looking good for the chocolates they melted that's kind of the experience i've had before which is why i wanted to do the one without chocolate and then add the chocolate chips in and then you can see these ones the chocolate just melted also but we've got those that hopefully save the day i'm gonna go ahead and put my oven on 375 first just so we can get that ready because the cookies that need to bake those are going to take the longest so here's what we ended up with these are the the pre-baked these were just the raw cookie dough with uh no egg this was our dough without chocolate chips this was our dough with chocolate chips so i have to confess i already knew what the chocolate was going to do since there's so many new people freeze drying and if you've never done chocolate before i just wanted to show you what chocolate always does in the freeze dryer it just kind of melts it but i'm still curious to see what they taste like really hard i was hoping this would be a good snack but but it's too hard and it'll break your teeth maybe the pre-bake will make it less looks like it's not going to that's a little bit easier to eat for some reason it breaks it down a little bit it's not soft by any means i'll tell you what this would be good for though what happens when you dip this into some milk i'm going to take a big old chunk of this and i'm just going to let it sit in here this has been sitting in here for about a minute now let's see what this tastes like that's actually really good it's softened up now this reminds me of something it's cookie crisp cereal i think our only hope is the unbaked because the chocolate chips are not going to store because the chocolate's all it's all melted but i made a big boo-boo when i did this because i forgot to weigh this before i freeze dried it which means i'm not going to know how much moisture to put back into this my other booboo which you probably were already expecting is that i used self-rising flour and i think it started to actually rise in the freeze dryer because of the heat right there you can see it real distinct so i'm not sure if that caused it to i don't think that was a deal killer as far as if this worked or not but it definitely didn't help i still haven't tried the cookie dough bites without the chocolate chips so i'll just do that now out this reminds me of hard tack and if you don't know what hardtack is it's a type of bread that preppers use and it stores for a really long time because it's extremely dry so i think the only way that we're going to get this to turn out is throw it in a food processor because this stuff is so hard so even if i try to get the the water to soak into this it's so dry in it that i just don't think it's gonna happen so we almost need to turn this back into a powder back into raw ingredients oh my god wow so this took a lot of convincing but i finally got it down to a powder i think that's our best shot all right so this would have been a whole lot easier if i would have done a measurement because i could just add the moisture back in i'm going to start with about a half a cup of water because the chamber the frozen water in the side of the chamber was there wasn't a whole lot there man i didn't think this was gonna work but it it might it might just work i do think it's gonna take a while for this for the water any kind of moisture to get in these little granules but i think it's going to work wow look at that so three quarters of water and i let it sit for about 10 minutes and it looks exactly like it did before we freeze dried it i'm going to add these chocolate chips and we're going to bake some cookies all right so is it going to work that's the big question i think it is it looks like it's going to work i probably should have flattened the the cookie dough out a little bit because they're real puffy but i think they're going to work they look really good just like grammy used to make except for grandma didn't have a freeze dryer i had really low expectations on these but they just wowed me they surprised me caught me off guard and i think they turned out exactly how you want them here's our one that we baked earlier in the video here's our freeze-dried one they're exactly the same and they taste good so what have we learned from this number one is chocolate does not do well in the freeze dryer chocolate chip cookies with chips the chips added in they're never gonna work number two the self-rising flour uh it actually worked but but i think it'd be fine using regular flour in fact i would i would probably recommend that you do use regular flour and number three don't eat a whole batch of chocolate chip cookies by yourself because it gives you a wicked stomachache also a really important one applesauce instead of butter don't forget to give me a thumbs up if you liked the video if you found it helpful like subscribe click the bell to get

cookie shot this recipe is an easy do-it-yourself at-home version of Dominique Ansel famous chocolate-chip cookie shots that are sold at his bakery in New York now I've had the opportunity to go to his bakery and they are absolutely divine I would highly recommend stopping and ordering one if you ever find yourself in New York City today I'm going to show you how to make an easy at-home version so that you can enjoy it even if your funds don't allow you to travel to New York to get one we're going to start with one cup of shortening and this will allow the cookies to hold their shape a little bit better than butter then we're going to add in half a cup of brown sugar and the third a cup of white sugar take a hand mixer and cream this together once you have a smooth creamy light-brown batter it's time to start adding in our other ingredients starting with one egg two teaspoons of vanilla extract and then half a teaspoon of salt we can cream this in as well once that's mixed in I'm going to add in two cups of all-purpose flour but instead of using my hand mixer to stir this in I'm going to switch to a wooden spoon to stir it all together this mixture should be a little bit more dry and crumbly than regular chocolate chip cookie dough but if you press it together it should be able to hold its shape then I'm going to stir in one cup of mini chocolate chips next we're going to shape our cookie dough into that fun cup shape to do that you can actually buy special molds on Amazon and I'll give a link in the video description to that or you can use a muffin tin if you don't want to buy a special item for this it's just a little bit of a short fatter cup for that but today I'm going to use what I like to use which is a popover pan if you have one and they are a little bit taller and thinner than a muffin tin so it works really well to form that cup shape so what I'm going to do is take a spoonful of the batter and place it into my popover pan and then I'm going to use my fingers to press it against the sides and bottom of the pan and mold it into that cup shape you want to press that dough in so that it's as spin as you can get it while still forming a sturdy wall you should end up with a little something like this and I like to make sure I clean up the edges give it a nice finished look then we're going to bake these in a 350 degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes this recipe makes about nine cups so you may have to work in batches especially if you're using a popover pan if you're using a muffin tin it should make about 12 once they come out of the oven they might be a little bit puffy so just take either a butter knife or a spoon and against the sides to reform that cup shape you want to make sure you do that while it's still warm so you get that nice cup shape next we're going to take a cutting board and place it on top of the popover pan and then gently flip it over and tap the top of the pan then lift it off and the cookies should slide right out let the cookies cool completely on the cutting board before moving on to the next step I've melted another cup of chocolate chips I'm going to take a spoonful and spread it over the inside of the cup make sure you get the bottom and all of the edges once the inside is coated with chocolate make sure you let it cool and harden completely before pouring in your favorite beverage for me of course the best combination is milk and cookies feel free to be creative with the beverage you serve in your delicious cookie cups you can find the full written recipe in the video

Welcome\nto \"Good Mythical More.\" \"BYMB-- Be your Mythical best.\" Today we want you to be\nyour Mythical best by Grammin' with Grandma. Take a photo with your grandma and post it up on Instagram, #BYMB. Instagramma.\nGet it? All right,\nso we've got cookies from the sub shops\nthat we crowned Jersey Mike's\nthe king of earlier. This is the first one. We don't have to necessarily\ngive these scores. We'll just rank them. So we'll just keep track\nof which one uh, we likes the best. I typically don't order\na cookie with my sub\nthat I also don't order. I don't either. I'm more of a chip man\nthan a cookie man, and I feel like\nI'm overindulging if I eat chips and a cookie\nin the same sitting. Cookies are for the kids,\nright? - Cookies for the kids--\n  Well...\n- ( mutters ) I love a good cookie, too. This is a good cookie.\nIt's soft... but also crunchy\non the edge. Um, who do they think we are? We're not going to be able\nto guess where any\nof these are from. Yeah, it's going to be\nvirtually impossible, But we shouldn't know, so that we can rank them. We should just rank them. Oh, look at this one,\nthis one right here. This one's got\nsome other ingredients. I touched this one. Let's both pull\noff of this one. It's got big chips in it, man. Golly. I wanna go to the middle\nbecause the middle's\nalways better. And it's got white chocolate. White chocolate\nand chocolate? - This is--\n- Better. ...four times as good\nas the first one. Mm-hm. I mean, that tastes\nlike a homemade cookie. Calling this number one. Here's number three. Keep up-- Keep up\nwith the system you're making. Okay. Now again, I'm gonna break\nthis one in half first. Ooh, this one's soft, too. I'm gonna break it\nin quarters. Here you go.\nYou take that. Stevie, what are you whispering\nabout over there? - You got a secret for us?\n- Stevie: These cookies\n look really good. Stevie likes cookies. Um, Stevie wants a cookie.  I want a cookie. Um, I didn't bite\nthis one. This is underdone.\nYou're gonna like it. It's doughy, very doughy. Mm. But... It's definitely\nbetter than one. - But not as good as--\n- I don't think it's\n  as good as two. Very chocolate forward.\nThere's lots of chunks there. Bring out number, uh, four. - Whoa, what happened--\n- Four? Yeah, number four. Oh, that's a little cookie. What happened to number four? It got dinky. They probably give you\ntwo at a time. Now, which place gives you\ntwo at a time? I don't know that. This one's better than that\nbut not better than those. It's got... This one's as bad\nas the first one. Yeah, because the--\nthe dough is kind of loafy. Loafy? It's better than this one. Well, I kinda feel like\nI gotta eat that a-chest-- - di-chest it.\n- You wanna chest it? 'Cause we just played\na game of bras. That's better flavor. That tastes like... it's got poison in it. Well, it probably does, but it doesn't taste\nlike it does. It's loafy.\nIt's going at the bottom. Number five.\nMan, this one looks... Kind of like an oatmeal\ncookie consistency. Well, it's kind of burnt\nin a weird way on top. Got a good smell, though. It d-- It has a cakey smell.\nIt smells cakey. Mm. That's a pretty good cookie,\nman. Got some cinnamon in it. They're try--\nI don't like this cookie 'cause I don't like the thing\nthat's been added. Something's been added\nto this cookie that I don't like. Cinnamon. It's better than both of these,\nthough. I don't think so, but-- You don't think that's bet--\nThis is crap, man. One and four-- they need to go back\nto their drawing board. The cookie guy\nin this place... You wanna kill him? Yeah, he should be murdered. Gah. All right, and finally... Let's see where-- Ooh, this is\nlike a big, flat Chips Ahoy! Does that excite you? No, I don't like Chips Ahoy! There's a lot of chips,\nthough. It smells\njust like a Chips Ahoy! The reason I don't like\nChips Ahoy! is 'cause I don't like\ncrunchy cookies. I like homemade\nundercooked cookies, which sometimes you can get\nat a sub shop. Almost has\na fruity taste to it. Oh, wow, this is weird. Like blueberries are in there. Are there blueberries\nin there? It really does\nhave a blueberry... You gotta give it points\nfor that. No, it's horrible. You tell me how they made it\ntaste like blueberries. Well, it's not\na chocolate chip cookie. If you can't tell me\nhow they did it, you should at least make it\nin the middle. If you order\na chocolate chip cookie, and when you get it,\nyou're like, \"Ooh, it tastes\nlike blueberries,\" what world are we living in\nwhen that's a good thing? Blueberry Town. I like blueberries,\nbut it's going last.  Stevie: Okay, you guys\n have to read me--  you have to tell me\n your numbers  'cause I can't see them. We put-- We put numbered--\nLet's start here. The worst cookie\nwe've ever tasted... I don't think so. I think it's\nthe most blueberry cookie\nI've ever tasted. - What number is it? \n- Number six.  That's Subway. Well, it's not a good cookie, Subway, quick putting\nblueberries in your frickin'\nchocolate chip cookies. I mean, we're not crazy. Davin, taste this. You tell me if that's got\na blueberry taste in it. Be honest. I don't taste any blueberries. He passed the test,\nladies and gentlemen! I think it was in comparison\nwith everything else. In comparison\nto everything else,\nit is fruity. - Yeah.\n- Is that number four? - Number four's\n  the next to last.\n- Number four's the next one. - Jersey Mike's. \n- Rhett: Jersey Mike's? Did I just say that we needed\nto kill the guy at Jersey\nMike's? - I'm sorry.\n- Yes, you did. We'll, you got great subs. When your subs are that good,\nyour cookies can suck. - Yeah, they can suck.\n- Number one... In fact, let's all take the\nfocus not off of the subs.  That is Firehouse. - Firehouse.\n- Firehouse, bad. And then number five--\nThis is the one that has\ncinnamon in it, right? That's Which Wich. I like what they're doing there.\nYou don't. But we both agree,\nthat far and away, three and two are the best, but two is best.\nWhat's three?  Three is Quiznos.  And two is Jimmy John's. Jimmy John's got\na good cookie. Who woulda thought? Jimmy John's got it going on. Jimmy John\nprobably thought that. Now, we thought,\nfor the sandwiches, that Quiznos was the best sub,  No, no, no, you thought\n it was the worst sub. No, we thought\nit was the best sub,\nbut it was the worst. We thought that the Jersey\nMike's sub, which won,\nwas Quiznos. - Yes. \n- But Quiznos we actually rated\nas the worst sub. - Correct. \n- What was the second best sub after Jersey Mike's?  Which Wich.  And the third you had\n was Firehouse  and then Jimmy John's  and then Subway\n and then Quiznos. - Subway and Quiznos.\n- Put Quiznos last, huh? Yeah,\nthe more restaurants you have,\nthe worse your food gets. What can we learn from that? Don't start a restaurant.", "LnJIqOBw6VA": "[Randy]: Does it look ok in there? [Oh yeah, you're good!!] [You're perfect.] [Randy]: Hey, thank you!! Hey everybody!! This is Randy Santel, Atlas, and I don't really know how to feel today. I guess 50% excited\u00a0\nand 50% nervous because right here,\u00a0\u00a0 I've gotta finish a 6lb chocolate chip\u00a0\ncookie!! This thing is massive!! I am back in Boone, North Carolina home of Appalachia State University!! I am at Appalachia Cookie Company. I'm taking on their 6lb Impossible Cookie Challenge!! I've got 1 hour to finish everything here. It started out as a 14-inch diameter chocolate chip\u00a0cookie and then once cooked, it expanded out to 17 inches in diameter!!  I think average is pretty\u00a0\nmuch about 3/4 of an inch thick so\u00a0\u00a0 we have a lot of sugar and fat and just\u00a0\ndeliciousness here. I've got some milk to have along with it. But I've got 1 hour, 60\u00a0\nminutes. If I fail, it's gonna be $59.99 or 60 bucks. If I win, I'm gonna get my cookie for\u00a0\nfree, I'll get a sweet t-shirt,  and I'll\u00a0be the very first person up on the wall\u00a0of fame!! Let's get this challenge started!! [Cheering & Clapping] Alright, big thank you to David, the owner\u00a0here at Appalachia Cookie Company, and his whole staff. I'm going for overall win #874. Last night's challenge was one of the hardest spot battles I've ever had during\u00a0my over 10-year career!!  So I'm hoping this one is not as difficult today but it might be because this is a lot of sugar but we're just going to shut up and eat!!  It is still warm\u00a0and ooey-gooey on the inside, a little bit crisp on the outside. We'll do the inside first and\u00a0\nget the bulk of it down!! let's do it!! 1,2,3..............BOOM!! I've got an hour but if it takes me\u00a0\nover 20 minutes I'm gonna be screwed!! *Inaudible* It is good!! This is dense!! Every pound is equal to about\u00a0\na half a dozen cookies so\u00a0\u00a0 this is equal to three dozen cookies\u00a0\nso we'll just see how it goes!! Cookie Monster couldn't handle this!! Gotta keep up this pace!! I've done a 3kg donut before; we'll see if we can do a 6lb\u00a0cookie!!  That's less than that. I gotta make sure we don't do the gallon\u00a0\nof milk challenge along the way with all this!! [Hahaha] Alright, we'll do this then we're on the edges!! [Clapping & Cheering] [There you go, there you go, there you go!!] Alright, 13 minutes, 15 seconds in. Gonna\u00a0take 15 seconds off and then go back to it!! One bite at a time!! 20 minutes, 20 seconds in!! [Come on, Randy!] I really got to finish quick; I'm starting to struggle!!  [You got it, come on Randy!!] I have a feeling a lot of this is mental and\u00a0I'm not going to feel that bad once I finish. Alright, I don't think it's going to hit\u00a0\nme as bad as I thought as much as cupcakes have and other stuff.  Oh alright, I've got\u00a0\n11 bites here plus all this.... one at a time!! I literally have no idea why anybody would do this. [Hahaha] Other than stupidity.......... [Hahaha] and love of cookies, apparently!! [And bragging rights!!] [Randy]: Yes, bragging rights!! Everything I said about taking a long\u00a0\ntime and being screwed, I was wrong!!\u00a0\u00a0 Well, hopefully, I'm not wrong!! [Randy! Randy! Randy!] [Clapping & Cheering] [You got this!!] [There you go!!] I'm gonna get this but let's please note that Appalachia Cookie Company can not only make cookies for everybody here in Boone,\u00a0North Carolina,  but they also ship\u00a0nationwide. Including this 6lb impossible cookie.\u00a0\u00a0 It's just not free if you finish it if you get it delivered. [Hahaha]  But it is gonna be free for me, baby!! [Clapping & Cheering] AHHHH!!

for watching please click the subscribe button and I will see you in the next video", "IK3-w5CGVEU": "Hey guys, Today's recipe is for The BEST vegan chocolate\nchip cookies and it's not my recipe. These are by one of my favourite vegan bloggers,\nSomer McCowan from VedgedOut.com. These cookies are soft in the middle and get\nchewier as you near the crisp edge. Everyone has their own favourite type when\nit comes to cookies but I'm not going to argue with the name of this one. They really are the best vegan chocolate chip\ncookies that I've ever had. So I've got to say thank you to Somer for\nsharing this recipe and for giving me permission to demonstrate this recipe for you. And it has a special ingredient: aqua faba! That is, the water from a can of chickpeas\nor white beans. You can also make it saving the water from\ncooking your own chickpeas or white beans from scratch. The liquid is vicous, kind of like raw egg\nwhites and you can use it as an egg replacer in some kinds of baking and cooking. You may have seen me make vegan meringue or\nthese strawberry seafoam candies with it. This recipe starts with a stick of room temperature\nEarth Balance. Don't do it with cold vegan butter, the cookies\nwon't spread out properly. To that, add sugar. I'm using golden sugar and white sugar that\nhappens to be vegan. The recipe uses brown sugar and granulated\nunrefined organic sugar but the organic sugars in my cabinets have proved to be too molasses-y\ntasting for my preference. Just cream those together. Next, add the rest. I prefer less salt so I used half the amount\nfrom the recipe. Then vanilla extract. Baking soda and baking powder. And three tablespoons of aqua faba. Finally, I added the flour, holding back a\ncouple tablespoons just to see if I'll need to adjust later. Turns out I did need all the flour. The recipe called for up to one and a half\ncups of chocolate chips. That's a bit much for me so I only used one\ncup. To be honest, next time I'll probably only\ndo three forths of a cup as I like a greater cookie to chocolate chip ratio. So just like that, the dough is done. Use a cookie dough scoop like this or just\na spoon and place the dough on to a baking sheet prepared with parchment paper. Make sure you give the cookies space as they\nwill spread out in the oven. Bake those in a oven preheated to 350 farenheit\nor 175 celsius for about ten minutes. Take them out when they are a bit golden on\nthe top and you can see lightly browned edges. You're going to want to eat them right away\nsince they will make your kitchen smell amazing but exercise a bit of patience. They are way too soft right now and will fall\napart. After ten minutes or so, transfer them to\na wire rack to cool off. They'll get harder as they cool. And those were best vegan chocolate chip cookies\nI've ever had. They are crisp at the edges, but soft in the\ncenter, but not too soft and they have a really nice chew to them. If you want a double choclate version, try\nswitching out a quarter cup or so of the flour with cocoa powder. Those were pretty good too. Make sure you check the description box for\na direct link to VedgedOut.com for the full recipe amounts, instructions and hints. And while you're there, leave a comment and\nlet Somer know I sent you! As always, thank you very much for taking\nthe time to watch this video and a special thank you to those who like and share this\nvideo.

them out for 15 minutes and then parana mansa i think improvise [Music] [Music] so i asked you guys uh community i posted hey tom what do you guys want to talk about the next slide top segment comment down below and somebody said that megan de silva megan de la hoya said um about the new normal how would it affect your small businesses and how to deal with it okay i like that part get that know the video about the new normal how it affects small businesses and how to deal with it so i want to tackle all three but i think this is my top segment little foreign talk the right perspective in the normal okay so before the normal start this is what i asked my mentor to say during that time and i was talking what my mentor said to me it was the story about jeremiah so what we got about jeremiah i think the most famous verse not just in jeremiah but from the bible it's actually jeremiah 29 verse 11. for i know the plans i have for you the christian lord plans to prosper you not to harm you but to give you hope and the future so it's not about a whoa little personally but actually it's the most misunderstood verse ever when you speak about verses you have to know the story behind pakistan so let's talk about the context of the story and how it can be applied to the new normal and how to have a nice perspective in this season so when you quote this first the next time you will have um the right perspective was previously inhabited by the vegans wickedness prospered in that place so the reason why i picking up mussolini godzilla is to bring light to that place but bring influence even as possible in that way so when you have evilness in you in the society and resultant is oppression um injustice wickedness and salvation and by the way this isn't a horoscope story or entertainment story this is true to life story this is the history of israel so how can that story relate to our situation right now i'm not saying that bonnie starts and not if he takes a debate still but i do believe if you focus so much on who did this who did that we might miss out the revelation of the story but what i can tell you is this story can be applied to us and what they did first nature as a promised land like us before we were in the promised land it's uncomfortable it doesn't feel right but what is the plan to get out there and to go back to the promised land just like us we want to go back to the old normals you and me demand is stated and some people are still on that stage but luckily we have the bible with us guiding us so some of you might say this is what god said during this time god said build houses settle down plant gardens [Music] they statistics [Music] need to separate peanuts and then when i'm going to do discovery in a cupboard and will happen discovering the boxing scientifically i'm basing it scientifically we're not getting it out anytime soon so might as well settle down be comfortable and strive in this season and what i've applied in my life my time i have been about sabotaging is that we are in a bad situation it will continue to be bad before it gets better so somehow we started i got shaken and i started focusing on his work next is he said also seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which i carried you into exile pray to the lord for it if it prospers you two will prosper pray for the ones who got you here do not just discriminate help them even the nation the nation that we're in that you don't like because of what's happening just pray and continue to serve other people because even though you hate this nation if it lose if it prospers kasama for prosper also make sure you don't just vote right make sure you raise the next generation right okay you say next generation when we're 50 60 70 those are gonna be the leaders one day based on my method this is the story that she shared with me so i can look at things in the right perspective again i'm not saying that god did this god did that no it's the enemy people who did this stop focusing on that focus on what you can do right now in this uncomfortable stage looking for the plans i have for you you are going to get uncomfortable for 70 years but i will bring you back to the promised land and this time as my eyes you almost intimidate your heart in relationship because i took care of you that's the conflict of the story and somehow i can apply it in my life no matter how shaken i am somebody people no matter how much will happen i know god is taking care of me not just in this lifetime but in the next lifetime not because i'm being nice not because i'm obeying not because i'm serving but because of what jesus did here for me and for you for me so my question to you is just like um how can you apply those words in your life right now in the season this is gonna be a three-part video um i'm gonna be showing you some next life talk segment nothing the hidden light of trees and how it it can affect in our businesses and our work from your life perspective but and how to handle it [Music] let's get our cookies so make sure to watch them closely because even just one minute of over baking can burn cookies also if you should check your sha wagneon books and every now and then the disturbing baking time yeah but even temperatures is indicated by the color so your edges and bottom should be turning into golden color also [Music] uh after that remove the cookies from the pan while they are still warm because again if masha don't stop on adding cookies do not remove from the pan until they are cool enough and firm to handle and then lastly if you have a container make sure not completely cool for our second batch parchment paper from the last time because you know busan on parchment paper so don't hate me on this

the inside are absolutely incredible you want to start off by tossing your sugar into some melted butter and crack in an egg and get everything nice and lovey-dovey then we're going to go in with some flour baking powder and salt let those ingredients get together for a minute and then you want to add the highest quality chocolate chips that you could find before you turn betty crocker on me these baking techniques are probably not traditional and here's me testing the cookie dough for some salmonella yeah please don't try that at home we tossed the cookie dough into the fridge for about half an hour and after they firmed up we make four large cookies we then toss them into the freezer for another 15 minutes bake them at 400 for about 13 minutes and now we have final product now bismillah

episode we're going to make two different versions of my famous chocolate chip cookies both these versions are incredible they're crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside they're both paleo gluten free grain free and dairy free but the second recipe I'm going to teach today contains no eggs for those of you who are vegan or are allergic to eggs these two recipes are really simple to make you can use your stand mixer your electrical handheld mixer or just the whisk it's really up to you so let's get started by first making my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe in your bowl you're going to begin by adding the coconut oil and the honey you can get the exact measurements and detailed instructions on my blog and I'm leaving the link to both recipes in the description of this video cream the coconut oil and the honey together until smooth and then add your egg and the vanilla extract next add the almond flour coconut flour the flaxseed meal and the salt you now we're going to dissolve the baking soda in some hot water and this is going to activate the baking soda faster and give your cookies more lift during baking so I'm going to add a half a teaspoon of baking soda I'm gonna have a cup of hot water here mix that together add it to your bowl mix a little bit more now we're going to add the chocolate chips in our dough and I'm using mini chocolate chips today these are dairy-free soy-free and gluten-free and using your spatula just mix these ingredients together now I'm going to scoop my cookie dough into this baking sheet and I'm using parchment paper on the bottom so that the cookies don't stick with the palm of your hands just flatten the cookies slightly like this then you can adjust the edges with your fingers just so that the edges are perfectly round all right in the oven they go now let you cookies cool on a wire rack so now for the egg free version of this recipe we're going to replace some of the oil with almond butter we're also going to add a little bit more flexible to hold the dough together and we're going to replace the honey with coconut sugar again you can get the complete measurements and instructions on my blog and I'm leaving the link below this video in the description so the first thing we're going to do is mix the flaxseed meal with some water and let it sit for five minutes give it a little stir and set it outside so in the meantime I'm going to add the ingredients to my bowl and this time I'm using my stand mixer add my almond butter coconut oil coconut sugar and vanilla extract give this a quick mix on medium speed now let's add the flaxseed meal that's been soaking in water and give it another mix okay now let's add the dry ingredients to the bowl I have almond flour coconut flour salt and baking soda now give this a quick mix and be careful not to over mix now that my dog came together I'm gonna add the chocolate chips using a spoon and there you have it guys two delicious chocolate chip cookie recipes that I'm sure you're gonna love as you can see the cookies look different the regular chocolate chip cookies have a lighter color and there they have a more cake like texture on the inside the egg free version is chewy air dancer and darker in color they're both delicious look how soft and moist it is on the inside it's incredible I really encourage you to try both recipes and if you like this video and you want to see more please give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel and whenever you make my recipes please post a photo on my website and on instagram and

start today I'm gonna be testing out Bon Appetit some best chocolate chip cookie so in the past you've seen me try the brown butter toffee Chocolate Chunk cookie that Rick demonstrated then I tested that cookie recipe against Claire saffet says best salty Chocolate Chunk cookie and now Bon Appetit is back with an all-new chocolate chip cookie recipe developed by Chris Morocco I'm really excited to test this recipe today because I am a huge fan of chocolate chip cookies plus since I've tested several Bon Appetit chocolate chip cookie recipes in the past I've got something to compare this recipe against so I do these Bon Appetit recipe tests every single Wednesday if you like this one please be sure to give me a big thumbs up and click subscribe alright without any further ado let's see how this goes as always I'll leave a link to the recipe and the ingredients in the description box below Bon Appetit provided the ingredient quantities in both measured and weighed amounts however I found that the 200 grams of AP flour called for in the recipe actually should have been a little bit closer to 225 grams so my cookies spread out a ton and I read a lot of reviews online where people said that their cookies spread out significantly as well so you're gonna want to plus the flour up just a bit from what be a called for in the written recipe so next I'm making me brown butter if you've been on the channel for a while you've seen me do this a few times basically you're placing one stick of butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and you're just gonna cook this until the butter melts down and then it will start to foam you want to keep scraping the bottom of the pan with a heatproof spatula just to prevent anything from burning and what you're really doing is just toasting the milk solids in the butter so you're looking for a nice color change to happen you can see that mine kind of reaches a really dark golden color to kind of like a light tan brown and once you're at that point you want to get it off the heat pour that melted brown butter into a heat proof Bowl and set this aside for about one minute after about one minute your brown butter should be cooled off and not be spattering and kind of boiling still so then we can add in the chopped cold butter and basically what we're doing here is cooling down the hot brown butter and melting our cold butter so this is going to give us a nice room-temperature brown butter that we can work with straight away so next I'm just combining all my wet ingredients what's kind of interesting about this cookie recipe is that it uses a ton of dark brown sugar so you've got a cup of packed dark brown sugar and only a quarter cup of granulated sugar so the proportions here are pretty much the inverse of a typical chocolate-chip cookie recipe however that dark brown sugar gives you a really great flavor in this recipe so you want to just whisk together the sugar and the melted brown butter until it's fully incorporated you don't want to have a really gritty mixture this was kind of hard to do with a whisk it just took some work but I got there eventually once I did I added in my two egg yolks and the whole egg and again whisking to get this all combined and get rid of the streaks and then just adding in my vanilla extract as well so this recipe said to mix by hand with a whisk it's totally fine it wasn't that hard to do however my stand mixer sits on the counter and it's really not a big deal for me to use that on a weeknight event so I think the next time I make this I'm definitely just gonna use my stand mixer once you've got your prepared dry ingredients folded through the dough and all of the streaks are gone you can add in your chocolate so I chose to use these chocolate wafers because I really like how they melt in the cookies however I think the next time I make this I'm going to chop up half of the wafers and leave half of the wafers whole I found that using like these really big discs gave me some really great chocolate puddles however it was hard to get an even distribution throughout the dough so the recipe called for a 3 tbsp portion on these cookies which is coincidentally twice the size of the cookies that I typically make so I'm portioning using the Aqsa medium cookie scoop which is a tablespoon and a half so I did one tray of these really big cookies like the recipe called for which baked for 10 minutes I also did a tray of just a single scoop tablespoon and a half cookies which is more standard for me and this baked for only eight minutes so you can see that my cookies are really spreading out a ton in the oven and this is the finished product so the cookies are done baking and I let them cool completely on their baking sheets and this is the size comparison between the 3 tbsp version and the tablespoon and a half so you can see it's quite a size difference both cookies are pretty syn overall so there was quite a bit of spread during the baking process the brown butter scent on these cookies is fantastic so I'm super excited to give these a taste all right so we'll get up and close you can see it's got a really nice texture on the surface a little bit of brownness around the edges it could have left it maybe another minute longer going for the break so this is a little bit chewy still gooey chocolate there that looks fantastic let's see mmm-hmm a little bit of crispy nicer around the edges the center is nice and gooey oh my god there's so much chocolate in here this is insane hmm so good so overall I am super impressed with this cookie so it's got everything that I look for it from a taste and texture perspective so the taste of this cookie is a little bit complex with the dark brown sugar and the brown butter but at the same time it still feels very classic and traditional and in that kind of normal chocolate chip cookie family it's just a little bit elevated so I really like that then the texture is just like nothing I've ever had before it's crispy on the edges chewy and gooey in the center so it's kind of checking all of those boxes at once so I am a huge fan of this cookie recipe and I'm pretty sure that this is going to be my new go-to chocolate-chip cookie recipe so I really hope you enjoyed this week's video if you did please be sure to give me a big thumbs up

[Music] you", "Jy0pSxEkAbc": "crispy around the edges soft in the middle and gooey and melty chocolate that's a chocolate chip cookie right there [Music] so i've said it before and i'll say it again i'm not the world's best baker i know very little about baking i say i follow a recipe pretty well but in terms of understanding kind of all the little things going on i'm working on it and the way that i learn is by doing right i have to pick something i got to try it out maybe screw it up fail a little bit and then learn that way and so i thought what better way than to sort of figure this all out than to make some of these great recipes that are out there and sort of use them as learning tools certain recipes do certain things for a certain reason and that's why they turn out good and to learn about baking we sort of have to do that process and so today we're gonna learn how to make one of the most american pastries there is the chocolate chip cookie and we're taking the recipe from jacques torres which is a famous french pastry chef and chocolatier and so over time i'm gonna make probably lots of different chocolate chip cookie recipes and learn how to figure out how to make my own and how to come up with a baking recipe i know how to make a savory recipe but a baking recipe is quite different so let's just jump right into it the first trick here is that jacques torres does not use all-purpose flour and this is one of the reasons why i wanted to try this famous recipe as jacques torres states all-purpose flour is good for everything and good for nothing because it kind of covers a wide basis it's good for everything but but there's usually a better way and what jock figured out is that if you use a combination of cake flour and bread flour then you can sort of dial in your ideal texture cake flour has a low protein content protein equates to gluten when it comes to flour so the lower the protein content the less elasticity you're gonna get so it's gonna be much more tender like a cake where the bread flour is the things we use for like pasta and for bread things we want a little chew and elasticity in so we have that as well and we use a blend of 50 50 using a combination of these and i've waited so long to do this recipe because it's taken me about three months to get both cake and bread flour so i know it's not really the easiest thing to find right now but like i said this is more of a research thing for me and if you can sort of figure it out and find yourself the two flowers then you'll be all set to make this recipe so we're just gonna sift these two flowers together in a bowl real quick [Music] and then here i have some salt some baking soda and some baking powder all the ingredients are going to be listed in the recipe down in the description so make sure you go check that out so i'm just going to sip those as well [Music] so this is our dry ingredients i'm just going to give it a nice mix to combine it all evenly when you do mixing in a bowl you like to spin the bowl while you're mixing if you're using a spatula or anything like that use kind of the turning of the bowl to kind of help you incorporate things easier we set this aside i've got two eggs here i just need to crack [Music] we have our eggs ready over here the next ingredient that's a little different is instead of using the little chocolate chips we're using these baking discs and these have a 66 cocoa you want it at least over 60 because then these will actually melt the chocolate chips they kind of don't really actually melt like they'll get melted but they maintain their shape whereas these will melt into the cookie it sort of creates this much more rustic in my opinion more appetizing looking cookie so we're gonna use these so now this is sort of just like any other cookie recipe the real main difference is the chocolate chips and the types of flour other than that you know it's basically the same process as a regular cookie recipe and the first stage is creaming the sugars with the butter so right here we have some brown sugar and some granulated sugar those combinations kind of create like a crispy and a chewy kind of contrast so the edges might be a little crisp the center might be chewy and you're getting like these different textures in one cookie so these go in break up that brown sugar a little bit and then i have this room temperature softened butter now this is a a point of variability i've been making cookies that have brown butter where you make brown butter and then you add that in and that creates a whole other flavor component to the cookie which may be an aspect i incorporate into my final cookie recipe eventually but for now we're going to keep it pure to his recipe which is just using softened butter and then we're going to cream them together for a good five to seven minutes so just add that in and you can use a stand mixer or you can use your good old hand we're mixer gonna start mixing instructs to use a paddle attachment on a on a kitchenaid so if you've got one of those then feel free to use that it's probably a bit easier [Music] i'm gonna add one egg at a time incorporating each one until it's fully mixed into the batter and then i'm gonna add the vanilla extract [Music] now we're going to slowly start to add in the dry ingredients now you don't want to work this hard you want to get it in barely incorporate it and then stop mixing it we don't want to start to work in gluten [Applause] [Music] i'm just gonna try and incorporate a little bit by hand so we just finished mixing it by hand it's come together everything is ready to go now we're just gonna add our chocolate chips incorporate them into the dough and then we can move on to the next stage is gonna be letting the dough mature [Music] the next trick that jacques does is he matures the dough meaning he allows the time to sit in the refrigerator to have the flowers absorb the ingredients kind of mingle and more flavor to develop you don't have to do this process you can now kind of go in and start to bake them but what i'm going to do is roll these out into balls then put them in the refrigerator you could keep them in this in the bowl and then refrigerate but it couldn't be that much harder to kind of scoop out later so i like doing this ahead of time so we're just going to get a sheet tray with some parchment paper roll out some big balls and then throw them in the refrigerator [Music] i've got this little this ice cream scoop kind of thing and the cookie scoop is usually a smaller scoop i want to make bigger cookies these chocolate chips i think are better when you make the dough ball or the cookie ball a little bit bigger otherwise they start to edge up like if you roll a small ball it's kind of hard for the chocolate chips to find a place to be but if you have a big ball it's a little bit easier for them to sort of find a place to sit so we're just going to roll balls like that [Music] and then as a final touch before we cover them and put them in the refrigerator we're going to sprinkle a little bit of this flaky salt on top of each one [Music] and there you go we got a nice batch of these what i'm thinking are going to be really good these look really amazing i can't wait to cook them i know you have to wait a little bit to do it but i think part of the delicious aspect of this is that we're going to have to wait and that anticipation is going to make them much better put this into a fridge go overnight and we're going to bake them off in the morning so into the fridge see you tomorrow here we go it's day two and i must say all day and night i've been just thinking and salivating of these cookies crossing my fingers that they're going to turn out but they look good i really just want to get them in the oven i want to get them cooked i want to taste them so that's what we're doing now we have a preheated 350 degree oven we're just gonna pop these guys in and the way that i spaced it is these are pretty large cookies these are probably double the size of a normal cookie so i need plenty of space so i did this sort of alternating pattern so hopefully none of these guys end up touching each other which i don't think they will so into the oven [Music] these are looking pretty good to me a little mistake over here that's fine i need to let these sit for like a good 10 minutes before i'm able to kind of pull them off the sheet tray we'll get another batch of cookies in the oven [Music] i don't need to make more than 10 cookies so i'm going to take the rest and put them in the refrigerator when i want a fresh cookie i'll just bake me a fresh cookie i like it better like that this batch came out nice now the goal is to pull them out when you can just start to see the ridge of the cookies begin to brown so it's like you can see a little bit of brown and the center is a little bit more pale and that's sort of what you want [Music] okay guys this is straight up the best cookie i've ever had why i'm sure we used good chocolate and it actually melts into the cookie as you can see and so you bite into it and you can almost hear it like you've got a crunchy bottom and crunchy edges but the center is really soft and gooey as you can see it's not like crisp so you have three different textures crispy along the outside a little softer on the inside and gooey in the middle and the texture like i've said before is the key to a lot of deliciousness the flowers make a difference the chocolate makes a difference it's just a pretty incredible cookie oh man i'm in trouble i needed a good chocolate chip cookie and this kind of ex surpassed my expectations by a long shot so i plead with you make this recipe do backflips to get the bread flour and the cake flour give it a shot of course you could try it with all-purpose flour but man i'm just going to town on cookies right now and i can't stop anyway thank you to all my patrons scrolling up on the screen right now thank you to everyone who watched that's all i have today i got cookies to eat i'll see you next time until then take care of yourself and go feed yourself [Music] you", "G5tG7ARK2lw": "- Hey, everyone, welcome to my channel. I'm Dorothy with crazyforcrust.com and today I'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite\ndesert mashups, brookies. These are sinfully rich\nand decadent brownies and chocolate chip cookies all in one and you're not going to\nwant to miss this recipe. (gentle music) Have you ever wondered what\nwould happen if a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie got married? Well, no fear, I'm going\nto show you what happens. Brookies happen. So, \"What's a brookie?\" You ask. A brookie is basically just a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie. So it has a brownie base and\na chocolate chip cookie top. I have a lot of different\nrecipes for these on my blog but these are the classic recipe with my best chocolate chip cookies and my favorite brownie recipe\nall put together in one. They're rich and fudgey and delicious. If you love chocolate chip\ncookies and you love brownies, this is the recipe for you. For even more easy and delicious deserts, be sure to subscribe to my channel. Now, let's get in the kitchen. Okay, so there is a little\nbit of work involved when you're making a brookie because we're making two different recipes and we're putting them together. We're making brownies\nand we're making cookies but it's worth it because\nhomemade just tastes so much better than store-bought. So to start off both\nrecipes, you need butter. Now, I always love to\nuse Challenge butter. It's my favorite one, I've been using this since I was a kid, it's the only butter\nthat my parents ever buy so it's the only one\nI ever ate growing up. I'm using unsalted Challenge\nbutter for this recipe. If you're using salted, you can, just see the notes in the recipe, but otherwise, grab a\nbox of unsalted Challenge and let's get started. To start the brownies, you're\ngoing to use three quarters of a cup of unsalted butter\nand you're going to add that to a large bowl that is microwave safe. That's one and a half sticks. Going to add four ounces of\nunsweetened baking chocolate. That's the chocolate that\nyou find in the baking aisle. It's usually on the top shelf,\nabove the chocolate chips. You can grab whatever brand\nyou like but just go ahead and break it up into smaller pieces and add that to the butter. We're going to microwave that\nuntil it's melted and smooth. It's going to be about one to two minutes, depending on your microwave. I like to heat it for about\na minute and then stir, and then heat it in 30-second\nincrements until it's nice and melted and smooth. First thing I'm going to add is sugar. And then I'm going to\nstir in three large eggs. Then go ahead and add\nvanilla, salt and cocoa powder and stir that in, and then\nstir in some all-purpose flour. This recipe doesn't have any leavening in the way of baking\nsoda or baking powder; you don't need it because of the eggs. We want a thick and fudgey brownie recipe and if you add baking\npowder or baking soda, it's going to make it rise\nmore and make it more cakey and you don't want that. The eggs will do the work of the rise. Once that's all stirred together, just set it aside 'cause\nnow we're going to make our chocolate chip cookie mixture and then we're going to marry\nthem together in the pan. For the chocolate chip cookies, this is my favorite\nchocolate chip cookie recipe, it's the only one I ever use. We are going to melt half\nof a cup, that's one stick, of unsalted Challenge butter\nin a large mixing bowl. Then add brown sugar and granulated sugar. Stir that together. Mix in one egg. Add vanilla extract, baking soda and salt. And then you're going to stir in one and a half cups of all-purpose flour. That's stirred in, you can\nadd your chocolate chips. I'm using a cup and a half\nof semi-sweet chocolate chips but you could use your favorite. I love this chocolate chip cookie recipe because it just is one\nbowl and a wooden spoon, it's super easy, no mixer needed. Now we have our brownies and\nour chocolate chip cookies so it's time to marry\nthem together in the pan. I'm taking a nine by 13 inch baking pan and I'm going to line it\nwith foil and spray it with non-stick cooking spray. Go ahead and spread the brownie batter in the bottom of the pan. As it has sat, it might\nthicken up a little bit but that's okay, just\nspread it as much as you can to the edges of the pan and then you're going to scoop\njust balls of cookie dough. It's hard to spread cookie\ndough on top of brownies so I just scoop up pieces\nof the cookie dough and I flatten them with my hands and then I lay them on\ntop of the brownies. Just do that until almost all\nof the brownies are covered. It's not going to be a\ncompletely solid surface. That's all right, they'll grow and bake\ntogether as it cooks. Bake it at 350 degrees\nfor about 30 minutes. Check it after 20 or 25,\nmaybe rotate the pan. Once the cookies are\nnice and golden on top and you'll see that the\nedges of the brownie around the edges don't look\nwet anymore, then they're done. It's hard to do the\ntoothpick test with brownies or brookies like this but if\nyou do use the toothpick test around the edges, it'll come out clean. But there you have it:\nit's a fudgey brownie with a gooey chocolate chip cookie on top. Oh, these are so delicious, let's try it. Mm. It is that soft and gooey\nbrownie on the bottom, my favorite chocolate\nchip cookie on the top. These are fantastic. I love these so much;\nthese are going to be hard to put in my freezer (chuckles)\nand not eat the entire pan. Well, I'm going to go try and do that while you\nwatch the next video.", "RRxW8L3Chz8": "okay we have to be serious for a second the entire winter season is cookie season even beyond the holidays any occasion to bake cookies is a good occasion anytime the weather's cold i'm happy to turn on the oven and make a batch of cookies and you may know my chocolate chip cookies well but this is my new favorite my salted caramel chocolate chip cookies so you take a good chocolate chip cookie and you just give it more more crunch on the outside more chewiness in the center more flavor more more more more that makes you want more cookies and it all starts with brown butter so instead of just creaming butter and brown sugar together i'm adding three quarters of a cup of unsalted butter to my pot and i'm going to melt it on high heat and actually let it brown this takes about three to four minutes you want the butter to melt it'll bubble up let the bubbling subside and watch the little bits at the bottom turn brown i can see some brown bits but most of all i smell the toastiness of this butter oh it's so good now i'll put my sugar into my bowls before i pour in the hot butter one cup of light brown sugar again building on that caramel flavor and i have a quarter cup of granulated sugar now i'll whisk in the browned butter right on top of the sugar even get in those little brown bits now the next ingredient is a real game changer for this cookie recipe two tablespoons of caramel sauce liquefied caramel guarantees the chewiest center to your chocolate chip cookies and i'll add a teaspoon of vanilla and now the sugar has absorbed the heat from the butter so i can crack in my single egg i'm very particular when it comes to baking a cake i always sift my flour but if i'm whipping up a batch of cookies you can just stir it all together in the bowl i have one and a half cups of all-purpose flour and here's another new addition to my recipe a quarter cup of rolled oats regular rolled oats it really helps give these cookies a good chew in the center it's worth it believe me why am i waving my spatula at you of course my signature addition to chocolate chip cookies a tablespoon of cornstarch and i have half a teaspoon of baking soda but i also want to add about half a teaspoon of flaked sea salt to the batter so i just crush it between my fingers and i give this all a stir there we go and of course we need chocolate chips you want one and a half cups total and i've got a mix one cup of regular chocolate chips and half a cup of salted caramel chips of course if they're not available just use all dark chocolate all right now it's time to scoop the cookies i've preheated my oven to 375 and these only take eight to ten minutes in the oven you wanna see a nice golden brown around the outside edge it's amazing how after just eight minutes the whole house smells like chocolate chip cookies now the last little tip to really set the chewy center to these cookies is give each tray a smack as you set it down not a big smack just a little one and immediately you see them drop now that's compressed the center and you know it's going to be so chewy but i've got the nice light brown edges with the two flavors of chocolate chip you can see the sea salt on it the only difficult step in this recipe is waiting for the cookies to cool long enough so you can pick one up and eat it smells so good these are honestly my new favorite cookie and i love that with the salted caramel it elevates the cookie perfect for a holiday tin but if it's just a blustery winter night and you want to turn on the oven and make a batch well you've got the perfect occasion just make sure you have a glass of cold milk nearby [Music] just that crispy ring on the outside chewy right in the center yeah it's chocolate chip cookie 2.0 you", "zvjBy6ZAwdY": "hello hello hello my name is lydia and today i want to show you how to make a chocolate chip pie if you guys like chocolate chips if you guys like pie if you guys like both of them combined together i think you guys are going to love this dessert this pie i think became really popular last year but since i was traveling last year so much i really didn't get a chance to do all the baking that i wanted to so here's a shot at it this year even though i'm a little bit late make sure you buy your favorite vanilla ice cream if you are making this recipe because your vanilla ice cream is going to elevate this pie to a whole other level this pie is good by itself but the ice cream really elevates it this recipe is also pretty easy it has basic ingredients that you guys probably already have on hand if you don't want to make your own pie crust you could always buy some from the store and it makes this whole pie making a lot easier the hardest part is waiting for it to bake but besides that it comes together quickly you don't really have to wait till it cools off completely and then you have pie in your mouth with vanilla ice cream nothing better than that before i show you how to make this pie make sure you are subscribed to my channel leave me a comment give me a thumbs up and let me show you how to make this chocolate chip pie to start off this chocolate chip pie make sure you preheat your oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit make sure you have a pie dish with your pie crust ready then go ahead and crack two eggs in a large bowl and go ahead and beat it until it is nice and foamy it should look something like this once it's nice and foamy add in your flour as you guys can see there's not a lot of flour that goes into this recipe add in both kinds of sugars and then you want to go ahead and beat it until everything is nicely combined it doesn't take a long time at all this recipe comes together pretty quickly make sure you get everything combined once your mixture is completely combined add in your room temperature butter and your vanilla i know it looks like it's a lot of butter but it's going to make this pie so delicious and it'll give it that nice chocolate chip cookie flavor so once it is all mixed up using a rubber spatula scrape the edges make sure you get all the dry bits off of the edges and then you could add in your chocolate chips so i'm using milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate just because i had some milk chocolate left over but i definitely recommend the semi-sweet chocolate just because it needs a little bit of that bitterness from the chocolate just because this dessert is pretty sweet and then mix that all up it should be nice and fluffy and kind of like this type of texture as you guys see right here make sure you have your pie crust ready i just fitted mine into my pie dish i don't have this exact recipe i'm still playing around with it but once i get it i promise i'll film it so add your pie filling onto that pie crust make sure you get every last drop of the pie filling out i know it sounds a little funny to have chocolate chip pie but it is so good you guys have to give it a try especially with that ice cream and then make sure you spread it out evenly so it fits every nook and cranny how do you guys like my really crooked pie crust edges yeah they're just awful and then you could go ahead and bake it bake it for 55 to 60 minutes or until it's golden brown on top then you could take it out of your oven and place it on some sort of cooling rack as you can see the top is kind of inflated but it'll deflate as it cools off but before it cools off completely i like to add some chocolate chips on top of it just because it kind of looks plain and boring without them you kind of can't tell what's going on so add some chocolate chips after the pie has been out of the oven for around 20 to 30 minutes you can start slicing into it so you can go ahead and slice it like i did here but it's still pretty soft just because the butter has not set up there is a lot of butter in here so it will be super soft especially when it's right out of the oven and it's warm and then don't do what i did here so i was trying to plate it and i kind of just dropped it kind of like that yep that happens to me quite often i thought i'd share with you guys just so you know that i make a ton of mistakes in the kitchen so here's my other slice and i was able to plate that without any mishaps and then it looks something like this again it is still slightly warm add some vanilla ice cream to the top of it and then you can start enjoying it since this chocolate chip pie is straight out of the oven it is still hot and it's really still soft but as the butter sits it will solidify and so will the pie it's just up to you on how you want to serve it here i am trying to take pictures for instagram i'm trying to post there but instagram just gets on my nerves sometimes i'm trying to get better at it guys i promise someday i will be great at instagram just just not today you know what i mean i know this isn't the prettiest of desserts or pies but when do you guys go to serve your chocolate chip pie make sure you guys are serving it with your favorite vanilla ice cream do not tell me that you skipped the vanilla ice cream because that is that's criminal you know what i'm saying so the vanilla ice cream really does provide some creaminess it cuts down through all the richness that this pie has there is a lot of butter so we are not going to be counting our calories today just because there's just no need we know that it's really unhealthy so if you guys ever want to recreate my recipes you can always find the recipes in my description and all of my other information also if you guys have an instagram account and you feel like it once you recreate my recipes i would love to see them there so make sure you tag me on there told you guys this recipe is super easy i love easy recipes with basic ingredients because we could all make them and that's the beauty of recipes that are easy i hope you guys enjoy this recipe i hope you guys give it a try enjoy it with some vanilla ice cream please please buy the vanilla ice cream do yourself a favor do me a favor get that vanilla ice cream and if you don't have a pie crust recipe i'll try to link one up so you guys can make your own pie crust if you're interested in that i do need to update my pie crust so i will be doing that sometime in the future until then i will

will fall apart in your hands [Laughter] yeah I'm very good there's like simple but really good not my favorite I like that I like the size and so Q I like that yeah these are a little dainty okay these are a little fellas first up I know that a lot of James Tollhouse does like the square shape for the dough that's how much I know about it you know what I'm just gonna do a little tear pull this makes me think of they're like break off square ones just because of the size like maybe that's the orientation better I like it better but I'm with it these are a little less flavorful I think than the first one yeah the other ones I would say still might might be my top choice so far but these are definitely good you know I wouldn't say no tool doesn't blow my mind not really it's very good I like it I like a lot [Music] look at yes very for you look at this big boy Wow love it when you call me big papa if you told me these came from like some little boutique Bistro and might be a $7

Fields cookie ears oh that's a good bet there's just like really dense oh no I don't like that I hate this one I'll eat the whole thing I'm not gonna eat I don't know if I like it much it has almost

would rather have the last one than this one no for us it's like some I try to give me a healthy cookie I'm actually gonna swerve a little and say this is my second favorite pace wise but it is easily bottom of the pack presentation-wise yeah I'm just not into this one yeah it's too crumbly it feels like it almost feels like it doesn't have butter yeah I don't like this one not a fan yeah no no no no no thank you my favorite is this second one the one that almost looked like it kind of had a square shape that's my favorite one but that one ones it for the third one yeah I get there one number

Welcome back to my channel. Today, I have got the best\ncookie recipe for you. We are making vegan oatmeal\nchocolate chip cookies. They are soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. So easy to make. They use really simple, whole food ingredients, and they're also gluten-free. So this is like one of my favorite recipes that I've come up with recently. I think that they are\nlike the perfect cookie. They last really well. So you can like make a batch and give them to your kids, friends, et cetera. And they're just so, so good. They're also oil-free, which I know a lot of you\nfollow an oil-free diet, so that's really exciting, and I just can't wait for you to eat them because they're so good. So if you do want to try this recipe, as always, it is linked down in the\ndescription box for you. Before we dive in, I would love to invite you to subscribe. If you are new around\nhere and you like healthy, delicious recipes like this, tap the red button that\nis right below this video that says subscribe. Otherwise, let's go ahead and get started. So we're gonna start by adding\nour nut butter into our bowl, and you can use any nut butter you'd like. Here, I'm using a blend of\ncashew butter and tahini. I really like these two together but use any nut butter you want. Then we're gonna add in a flax egg as well as some maple syrup, a little bit of coconut sugar, and some vanilla extract. Then you will beat this all\ntogether until it is smooth. Again, you can use any type of nut butter. The reason why I like\nadding granulated sugar is it just adds a nice, chewy texture to the cookie. From there, we're gonna\nadd in our dry ingredients, which is quinoa flour as well as a little bit of baking soda, a pinch of sea salt, your oats, and then you are going\nto mix that all together. From there, you should start to form\nlike a thick cookie dough. There are a lot of oats in this recipe, which I think have a\nreally, really nice texture and gives that that really hearty texture, I guess, as you eat it. The dough should be on the thicker side. Once you have your cookie dough, you can fold in your chocolate chips, chocolate chunks. You could also do M&M'S if you wanted. There's really any kind\nof mix in's that you want. Nuts would also be delicious. But of course, these are oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, so we wanna use chocolate chips. Then using a cookie scoop, we are going to scoop\nthe cookies directly on to a parchment lined baking sheet. This recipe makes about 15 to 16 cookies and then you will use your hands to flatten out the cookies gently. I like to wet my hands\nslightly before doing this so that they're not as sticky, but basically just gently\nflatten them out a little bit. Then you can pop them in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes and\nthat's pretty much it. They should be nice and golden brown, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, studded with dark\nchocolate chips and oats, and they are just absolutely delicious. I like to let these cool on\nthe pan for a couple of minutes so that they set and\nthen I dig in and enjoy. And there you have it, my friends. That is how to make the best vegan oatmeal chocolate\nchip cookies on the planet. These cookies are so good. I've said that a million\ntimes throughout this video but I swear to God, they are my favorite cookie\nthat I have created so far. They're healthy, they're vegan, they're gluten-free, they're oil-free, they're refined sugar-free, and they don't taste like they're healthy, so that is a win in my book. I hope you guys do try this recipe. If you do, let me know what\nyou think down in the comments. If you do wanna try it and\nmake it and follow along, you can find the full\nrecipe up on my blog.

I don't have a pan but any would do this another spin get cookies this size if exactly then you can do smaller but also a cup cool idea instead of making cookies twice make a double batch take these put them on a sheet tray put them in the freezer as a freeze throw them in a resealable bag whatever you want cookies check this out you having friends over for dinner make some homemade chocolate chip cookies for dessert yeah as you're eating dinner you throw those in the oven right what's that smell I tell you what our cookie tasters seemed to like I know all of them what do you put you know originally started this segment on four minutes ago you're still eating best cookie which we have online we do that mix of brown butter we then put in some regular unground butter we've got a mix of brown sugar and sugar so gives you crispy and chewy and we don't want you guys to feel left out so we have cookies for our entire [Applause] chocolate chip cookie well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts

any time we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on GMA", "4klXSi2TjLg": "my name is amber Amoz I'm the chef and owner of Mossad our bakery here in the West Village of New York City and today I get to try everybody else's chocolate chip cookies [Music] there is a nice number of chocolate chips which I really like doesn't really smell like anything though which is kind of strange she didn't have to unless stick my face into it smell it mm Oh 20 sweet really sweet something that I always look for in cookies that isn't just kind of like monochromatic it shouldn't just be crunchy it shouldn't just be dry I shouldn't just be sweet I like about this is you have a little bit of the crunchy and the chewy and you can see that even in the difference in color it got a little caramelized you can see that it's soft because you can't hear it but then when I bite into it you can see that it's crunchy so I do like that it's got different texture it's not my favorite but I'm going to turn it away [Music] this is a much more sizable cookie that looks really big and delicious I think there's nuts in it not that easy to break open it looks good it's just a kind of cookie that would be really good warm something that I would want to have right out of the oven you can't be mad at a warm chocolate chip cookie even a mediocre chocolate chip cookie worm like you want to propose to it the less air you haven't something the less it's gonna dry out and you look at a cookie you look at something you see a lot of little air pockets everywhere so it had a lot of opportunity to be a little bit on the drier side it looks like it has a lot of nuts and here the thing about nuts is they suck moisture I think the nuts kind of fought with the cookie and they might have one this would actually be a really good cookie to put with ice cream because it'll hold up against the ice cream I would love to try this cookie again but I think it's time war first glance I like the size and it looks like it's nicely baked too because it looks nice and golden it's smells good it actually smells like brown sugar which I love more of a carmelization and more of a caramel taste you face a little bit more homemade there's good I feel like this is a cookie that could kind of do the trick I also would imagine they're sold in packs of more than one that's also kind of a cookie that you're gonna want to eat more than one of the chocolate tastes a little bit waxy but I'm not really mad about it my mom looks so much better Oh what just happened I like subway cookies [Music] this is a big cookie sometimes size doesn't always make it better it's really heavy when you see this happening on the outside looks like it's almost kind of like blood a little bit on the outside that's actually excess butter that means it wasn't mixed all the way if you take this little outside piece this is probably gonna taste almost exclusively like butter and the other parts may be a little bit drier you look on the back you can see that they use really big chocolate chunks which is kind of nice so I break it open it's really almost kinky inside but it still looks really nice and moist inside and it definitely looks like we used a lot of brown sugars you're getting a little bit more common well taste hmm it's a little bit too dry for me or somebody like Starbucks having a cookie like this is probably a great idea if you're having a cappuccino you can dip it and it's not going to disintegrate [Music] it's kind of a nice size actually it's a little bit like the Goldilocks of cookies it feels like a sizable weight breaking it open is nice Wow that is more chocolate than I have seen in any other cookie it's which not what I remember it tastes a little bit more homemade this feels like somebody might have made this for me i think everybody's mall how to mrs. feel a lot of what i'm tasting is probably my memory more than the cookie itself these are a little bit blonde for me Rhonda's not bad but in your cookies you want them to have a little bit of color one of the things that we really like to do with cookies have them be baked enough and have to have enough sort of golden color which this doesn't have but it has a lot of nostalgia so definitely gets points for that so I had a lot of chocolate chip cookies today if you're gonna make them at home I would recommend two things you always want to think about the balance of sweet and salty before you bake them you sprink a tiny little bit of Maldon salt the other totally great tip age your dough so you're gonna get better color and you're also gonna get sort of a better flavor at the end of the day no matter where your chocolate chip cookie comes from how much chocolate it has or how long it's been aged it's gonna be amazing because it's a chocolate chip cookie [Music]", "b6gXFR2K1o8": "today we're going to make thick chewy chocolate chip cookies they are super soft and packed full of chocolate chips they're super easy and you can make them the same day that you bake them all right let's get into it so basic creaming method here nothing complicated going on um i've got my stand mixer you could do it with it hand blender whatever you want um i've got my button i've got dark brown sugar okay and granulated sugar and then we're just going to cream that starter on a little lower just make sure and turn it up let her go so while this creams we are going to whisk together our dry ingredients i've got ap flour here salt baking soda baking powder [Applause] that's it just goes together you just don't want any like pockets or clumps of baking soda or sultry check in with our sugar here look it matches um give it a little little scrape down she's been scraped um she's it's very thick paste in there right now we're gonna keep going we do want it to be a little bit lighter and fluffier um when i'm making chewy chocolate chip cookies i don't really want to fully cream them like you do for a cake because i do want a little bit of that density uh i don't want to work in too much air here or they will be light and can play and i don't want that right all right so it's lightened a little bit um that was really that's it that's all we want to do we don't want to carry on still turn on a little lower we'll add our egg and then we'll turn that up eat that in i'm gonna go ahead and add my vanilla we're to turn it on low and we're going to slowly add our flour mixture now you don't want to over mix this once you add your flour we're not going to like continue beating it you know you want to let it mix until like there's just a little bit remaining and then add a little bit more [Applause] and when almost all the flour is incorporated we'll go ahead and add our chocolate chips and that's it okay so now we've mixed our dough um and you could chill it like this we're going to chill it before we bake it but um i like to go ahead and portion my dough first which just makes it easier later you know it's hard to it's a lot harder to scoop or portion hard dough i've got a fortuner also known as a ice cream scoop um i have a bunch of these different sizes but you know you pick whatever size you want you can also just ball them up totally fine um and then i've got a tray to put them on which will help them cool faster nice even number 11. so we've portioned our dough and now it's going to chill faster so i'm just going to add a little bit of plastic wrap on top of this and then i'm going to pop it in the refrigerator probably they'll probably be cool like 30 45 minutes um as opposed to like having to chill it overnight or something so for the impatient people um and then we'll bake them we're ready to bake so these have chilled for about like an hour so they're nice and firm and they're ready to be baked you could have obviously you can freeze these also and then you can just bake them the same way or you can wrap them and keep them overnight in the fridge whatever you want but i am impatient and we're baking them now so i'm going to go ahead and place them on my baking sheet and then i've got you know a really obnoxious number left over and i'm just going to bake them on here i've got a preheated oven to 350 degrees convection and we're going to bake five minutes i'm going to rotate and we're going to make another five and then i'm going to check them they'll probably take about 12 minutes um and then we'll let them cool or not so our cookies are out they baked about 13 minutes but until they're just a little golden brown on top but they're still they're suddenly soft and beautifully chewy in the center so we just want to let them cool completely um and then while we eat them clearly it's time to try them so do you see how many chocolate chips are in here it's just like oh my gosh i can't wait to show you guys this this is like it's so soft and like do you see it's divine it's just got a little bit of crispy on the outside and the inside is soft and chewy but not under baked mmm", "u1xk6jOWQpw": "welcome back to another episode of register for dinner I'm remotes Amanda and they were making keto chocolate chip cookies do

friends", "5xTAWT7--zs": "[Music] is it baking around Christmastime the best I seriously cannot resist a really good cookie recipe and these hearty chocolate chip cookies are like the gift keep on giving they're made with two different types of chocolate chips and bread flour so they're thick and chewy and really live up to their name after the first bite you'll fall in love and know that they were totally worth the effort so come on grab some chocolate chips and I'll show you how to make them [Music] what's up universe welcome back to my kitchen in case you're new here I'm Julie I'm a chef I'm a mom and for this season of our show we're focusing on some easy and yummy snacks that we can actually execute and film while I saw Lincoln naps I think it's time for some hearty chocolate chip cookies what you're gonna need is bread flour baking powder baking soda kosher salt unsalted butter sugar light brown sugar eggs vanilla extract semi-sweet chocolate chips bittersweet chocolate chips and walnuts have you ever been to levan bakery in New York City if you haven't you're totally missing out and you need to go visit the next time you're in New York this is what this cookie recipe is based off of so I have three cups of bread flour in here I haven't tried it with regular all-purpose but I think the bread flour will add kind of like that crust and that chew and the hardiness that you're looking for in these cookies which I feel like make them super unique these cookies are so big dense chewy rich for me I'm cutting down the amount of chocolate chips for me personally because I'm not the hugest chocolate fan I still think it works perfect with this amount though what I'm doing is adding all of the dry ingredients into the bowl first before we use the stand mixer and then you need about a teaspoon of baking powder and a half teaspoon of baking soda along with a half a teaspoon of kosher salt so you just want to mix all of these dry ingredients together so that they're well incorporated and you don't have like little surprise bits of baking powder or baking soda mixed in so we're gonna move on over to the stand mixer you got to bust out your KitchenAid for this because it's a pretty hefty dough you're gonna need a paddle attachment and some butter I have two sticks of unsalted butter and you do want it to be still just cold from the fridge if Christmas isn't the time to plot your stand mixer I don't know when it will be so we're just gonna soften it up a little bit by beating it doing this a little bit backwards so you can see my apologies in advance that we don't have a glass see-through mixing bowl that's something I want to invest it in the future but just don't have it right now but I know for you guys I think I will invest in it so you're gonna look at though for just about a minute just to get it started to soften then you're gonna have two different kinds of sugars I have a cup of white regular granulated sugar and a packed cup see how it's nicely packed into the measuring cup of light brown sugar so you do need both kinds it's just gonna add in both sugars this is always the basic step of baking creaming the butter so I'm just mixing on about medium medium low speed just until the butter and the sugar get incorporated it becomes a little bit fluffy and then feel free to help yourself out by taking it off the paddles every now and then [Music] but that's looking pretty incorporated to me what do you think right so I think it's time to add in our liquids so we're gonna add in two eggs that were chilled straight from the fridge sometimes in baking you need room-temperature eggs for this one you just want to keep them cold little wash and then 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and make sure it's pure vanilla extract not imitation oh I just love vanilla in anything and baking so we're just gonna mix this again on medium-low just make sure it's well blended that's all you're looking for every now and then if you want to stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl itself and off the paddles and feel free to do that because you want to make sure all of those sugar crystals and everything is mixed in well before you add in your dry ingredients cuz once you add the dry ingredients it becomes so stiff it's really hard to manipulate just a little bit longer okay I think it's looking pretty good so it's time to add the dry this might be a little tricky cuz it's a lot of dry ingredients it's like a snowfall okay now we're just gonna mix for a little bit on low because if you go too high what will happen flour shower you're just gonna mix until the dough just comes together and it's almost there you don't want to over mix it's almost there alright that's about it guys it's so heavy ok I mean I might even have to have Joe come out and help me with this next step because when I was testing this I'm telling you I always like breaking my arm so I have a quarter cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips which is traditional in any chocolate chip cookie recipe it doesn't seem like a lot but a little goes a long way and then you also have the second chocolate chip which is bittersweet so I have 1/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips and it's really not that bitter it just tastes like a really rich dark chocolate which i think is so lovely mixed with the semi so it makes it the overall cookie not too sweet and then 1/2 a cup of chopped walnuts and this is not toasted in advance if you feel like do what you want to do that you can always go ahead and do that and then you're just gonna be patient and try your best to mix this all in it is a workout but you don't want to use your paddle attachment your stand mixer for this step because you don't want the dough to get too tough and the chocolate chips to just break down you guys I'm actually coming off of a sickness and you know what's funny we have another chocolate chip recipe video so chewy chocolate chip pecan was a chewy the conch Auklet chip I don't know something and that was also filmed around Christmas and that's also an excellent cookie but during filming of that video I was also sick so I don't know what is with the timing it's probably just the season it's the weather so I'm feeling a little bit weak like I can't even do this Joe can you come out and mix this chocolate chips for me well hello Joe no you got to work for your cookie he's never done this actually so we'll see how he does but you just got to mix it all so it's all incorporated and make sure that like all of the chocolate chips in the dough are combined told you this is probably as close to cooking as you'll see Joe do I'm the show honestly oh yeah this show cuz I'm not qualified I don't think you've ever baked with me before forst's quality baking time together one day I'll do this lip Lincoln I think you'll really enjoy it mm-hmm yeah I'm not joking look at him struggling I told you it's gonna be worth it didn't you enjoy the levan bakery cookies from my favorite places in New York we always stop by when we're there honestly because it's just a treat there's something about them and this is not a sponsored video of them yeah I wish I wish they would sponsor us and cookies I [Music] just did a few more turns just to be sure and then we're just gonna grab two half sheet pans rimmed baking pans lined with parchment paper and cut down to size you're gonna want to because these are so huge that you can only fit about six you're gonna try to your best to divide the dough evenly so I'm just gonna use a cookie scoop and do a scoop each and then I'll go back and add more evenly just to make sure that the cookies are all even in size and they cook properly so this recipe will make 12 big cookies so this is not even the specs of the cookie but I find the ice cream scoop method just to be the easiest especially because this dough is so thick if not you can always use a measuring cup doesn't this look like really awesome cookie dough ice cream see look at this and then there's still so much dough left the thing that I want to note is that normally I'd be like pre-heat your oven get it started but here's the thing about this recipe you cannot bake these right away I'm sorry friends the whole point is that it's crispy on the outside dense and soft and chewy a little bit fluffy on the inside in order to do that you have to freeze the dough so you're gonna freeze the dough make space in your freezer and just put these trays right in just like this freeze it for an hour until they're nice and solidified you can make it an advance throw it in a ziplock bag and then pull it out and bake it when you need it so that's kind of cool too because then you can do portion control if you don't want to make 12 big baseball size cookies at once then you could always just bake what you want so I for the sake of time have already made a swap out so I have six cookies and a freezer that are ready to go I'm just gonna be baking that batch because there's no way Joe and I can eat twelve cookies on our own okay so an hour later this is what they feel like or overnight in advance so completely frozen so you just throw this whole sheet in the freezer and then you pull it out and straight from the freezer you throw it into your hot preheated oven the ovens at 375 so we're gonna let it go for about 18 - I would say 20 22 minutes the last time I checked this it was about 21 22 minutes you just want to make sure that they're fully cooked on brown and crispy on the edges but you do want them to be slightly still under baked than the insides of the beast a chewy if you don't freeze your cookies then they will grow too flat and spread out too much in the oven and he won't turn out like the lava and bakery cookies [Music] after the cookies come out of the oven make sure to put them on the cooling rack on top of the baking sheet leave them there for about five minutes so that the cookies have a chance to firm up a little bit and then remove them onto the cooling rack itself so they can cool completely are you excited to try your hard work yes very much so you guys I mean the smell is intense the aroma coming from the oven it's like walking New York City mm-hmm don't roam around by the bakery mm-hmm it's true it permeates the whole street and it's perfectly golden brown on the bottom nice and crisp it's still warm mm-hmm so soft look at that thick bread cookie oh my gosh oh it's making my mouth water let's give it a go mmm it's like being in a cookie heaven the texture is unbelievable just a little bit crusty on the outside hmm but not too hard but the inside the gooeyness softness of it yeah oh my gosh and the chocolate chips still warm wait guys we've tried this when it's not warm when it's room temperature the next day the day after and it's still just as addicting same table would be a very happy ending in our place mm-hmm give us an extra gift because seriously for substitutions it's really up to you you can put everything but the kitchen sink in there if you really wanted to for the nuts you can try different kinds you could try pecans like my original cookie recipe you could do peanut butter chips caramel chips it'll still be good as long as the base is there just follow the proportions and just try to like substitute what you want but enough we're just hungry but we're like devouring these cookies really good wow you guys it's really but tasting a texture you can taste a little bit of the vanilla the cookie dough itself is just not too sweet has almost like a caramel taste to it it's just really good buttery crispy chewy soft it's everything you'd want in a really hearty good cookie I'm still gonna go to Livan and buy levin bakery cookies cuz that's the original but I think this is a nice dude mm-hmm if you don't live in New York great substitute mm-hmm we weren't afraid that Lincoln would wake up like he did before in our other episodes but he's just knocked down so we're just enjoying our cookies and peace merry Christmas to us thanks so much for watching we're just gonna be gobbling away remember if you enjoyed this recipe to push like and be able

and a big welcome to steve's kitchen today we're going to be making a delicious gooey chewy chocolate chip cookie if you love chocolate chip cookies they're old fashioned delicious chewy ones full of chocolate this is the recipe for you now I don't know if you manage to get chance to see the Christmas pudding recipe the other day I put a little link down here to subscribe to the channel I really appreciate if you subscribe and stay in touch let's get on now I'll make this delicious chocolate chip cookie for these yummy cookies we're going to need all these ingredients which I'll run through quickly but I'll also write them down in the description bar we've got a cup of soft brown sugar one cup of regular sugar two and a half cups of flour I'm using two whole cups of chocolate chips so don't skimp on the chocolate chips it really adds the flavor I've got 1 cup of soft butter which we're also going to melt 2x we're going to use a teaspoon of baking powder and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and I'm going to be using a quarter teaspoon of salt or a pinch of salt there so I've taken our cup of butter and I've just melted that down almost fully I mean there's still a little bit of solids in there and I'm going to add to that our soft brown sugar and our regular white sugar that's a cup of each and then I'm going to use a whisk we're not going to need to use a machine for this I'm just going to use a whisk to beat this up to a smooth cream so once you've blended that together by hand and you can use your electric mixer if you have one but I just want to show you the simple way of doing this by hand we're now going to add our eggs into the mix so I'm just going to take two lightly beaten eggs and add that in with our sugar and butter and start to mix that in again just beat that up slightly it doesn't take long and I'm just going to add two teaspoons of vanilla extract this will just give a rich flavour to the dough itself and beat that through now once I write in vanilla or a mix nicely and we've got this lovely creamy mixture I'm going to go from using the whisk to using a spoon and I'm just going to take our flour and using a sieve I'm going to put about half of the flour into the mix just getting the lumps out and making that lovely smooth and light so with that flour in there we're just going to start folding that through until the flour is completely incorporated into the into the cookie dough and once I think or break it I'm just going to take the rest of our flour now and also I'm going to put a quarter a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda just sift that into the mix and then again we're just going to mix that through to get the final cookie dough ready now we've got a lovely stiff cookie dough if you add chocolate chips into there so we go our two cups of chocolate chips and we start to mix those through now an interesting little fact about chocolate chip cookies is Ruth Wakefield apparently invented chocolate chip cookies when she was looking to add chocolate to a cookie to replace the color she had she thought the chocolate would would melt but it actually she it just stayed entire and she ended up with a chocolate chip cookie so we've got this lovely bowl of cookie mix here now and there's two options here now you can either just take a tablespoon and roll it up into a little ball and pop that down on a baking tray now if you preheated oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's 180 degrees Celsius you can bake those until they're golden brown it'll only take about 10 minutes or you can do what I'm going to do which is to actually put the whole cookie mix into the fridge cool it down and I'll show you what I do with it because going to actually freeze it and use it as I wanted right I thought I just cook three of these off for you now before I actually show you the chilling down and freezing of the dough so you can see that they cook perfectly well straight from the mix and there you have the cookies they're absolutely perfectly cooked it's just ten minutes from start to finish I'll take these ones out now let them call on the side so there's no three cookies cooked through absolutely beautiful I'll leave them to cool for those of you that have decided to cook them straight away you'll be enjoying chocolate chip please for those that want to freeze down either the whole batch or part of that batch so you can use them as and when you want follow on and watch how we do that so once our cookie dough has chance to cool down in the fridge I'm going to take this out now and pop it on the side you might need to break this if you've made the full amount into two pieces and we're just going to roll this cookie dough out into a sausage so we roll out cookie dough there till it's around about a foot long square up the ends nicely and then we can take a a little piece of wax paper and just roll that straight on to the air it'll pick the paper up as it goes around and we can just roll that into a tube just turn in the ends and pop that into the freezer ready to use whenever we want I'll show you that of them in a moment by magic so you can see how we make the cookies so once they've come out of the freezer you've got two cookie rolls and you can use them pretty much as you want if you want to just do four or five cookies you can do four or five if you want his one I just cut the end off so you can see the cookie mixture going through that so we can just get a knife now so we take about an inch at a time two and a half centimeters and we just cook we'll just cut through paper at all and then you can just peel the paper off there we go just peel the paper off and that goes on straight onto the baking tray ready to cook so there are eight cookies I just cut off and I'm just purely the paper off of these and then they go onto a baking tray and same as before we've got another that's heated to 180 degree Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit and we're just going to cook these for no longer than about 10 minutes and we have beautiful chewy chocolate chip cookies and what you don't use pops back in the freezer ready for next time so there's our eight cookies cut to size on a cookie sheet ready to go into the oven and I'll show you them in a moment when they're cooked and they're just ten minutes later you've got a beautiful plate of chocolate chip cookies I'm just going to pop those down now and let them cool so ten minutes from frozen there you have lovely plate full of chocolate chip cookies more in the freezer ready whenever you want them and I have to tell you these are soft and chewy they're delicious just break one of those in half you can see that's got loads and loads of chocolate taste it's crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle just the way it should be smells delicious tastes delicious so stay in touch I'll get the subscription button down here so anyone wants to subscribe to the channel I'd really

it's time to make a lemon and meringue pie", "7GiQNlY6OoU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "Kyu427fYmEU": "Hey everybody Sam here from Sugar Spun Run and today I'll be showing you how to make The Worst Chocolate Chip Cookies That's right. You heard it correctly. These chocolate chip cookies are the worst. If you want the full story on how they got their name, you're going to have to check out my blog post, but the gist of it is that they are going to ruin every other chocolate chip cookie out there for you. These cookies are absolutely addictive, and I have hundreds of five-star reviews on the original recipe that all agree on the same thing. These cookies really are the worst. To begin, you're going to need 1 cup or 2 sticks of unsalted butter and you're going to want to melt this. Now here's where a lot of people go wrong. Once you melt your butter, it is so important that you let it cool. Usually in the microwave your butter will get really hot, and if you add your other ingredients right away, what you'll actually do is you'll melt your sugar and you're going to have a greasy cookie dough that is never going to form nice soft cookies. They're going to spread way too much in the oven. So what I like to do is, I'll microwave my butter and then I let it cool for at least five minutes, but usually it may need even a little bit longer. If you take a look at what I have here This butter has actually even started to re-solidify a little bit that will work fine. But yours doesn't have to be quite at this point. You just don't want it to be hot to the touch Now that it's cooled we can add our sugar. You're going to need one and a half cups of tightly packed light brown sugar. We'll also add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar. You'll stir your butter and sugars together until they're well combined. Next we'll add two large eggs and you want these to be at room temperature, because we're adding them to melted butter. You don't want them to be cold, or it'll shock your butter. It's going to make your ingredients not combine as nicely as we want them to. So room-temperature eggs are the way to go. Now if you don't have room temperature eggs on hand and they're all cold in the refrigerator a quick and easy way to bring them up to room temperature is to just put them in a bowl of warm water, and let them sit there for about 15 minutes, and they'll be at room temperature before you know it. Next comes our secret ingredient for these worst-ever chocolate chip cookies, and that is a quarter cup of maple syrup. Now if you're worried that this is going to make your chocolate chip cookies taste like pancakes, don't freak out, none of my taste-testers could tell that I added maple syrup to the cookie dough. Now it's still important. What this does is it is going to add a great flavor enhancement to your cookies. It's just a secret ingredient that really brings out the flavor. Don't skip this and I want to note that you can use either pure maple syrup or that fake store-bought pancake syrup. Honestly, most of the time I use pancake syrup because it's less expensive, but either one will work just fine in this recipe. It's been tested both ways. Scrape that out, because we want to get every drop of that we can, and we'll also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then we'll stir everything together. Now we are going to need a separate bowl for our dry ingredients. This recipe uses three and a quarter cup of all-purpose flour. Now the flour is another place where people can go wrong when making these cookies. If you scoop your flour into your measuring cup, you can end up really packing that in and end up with more flour than the recipe calls for and you're going to end up with thick cakey cookies. Likewise, if you don't put enough flour in your measuring cup you're going to end up with cookies that spread too much and come out flat. You don't want that either. My recommendation is, honestly to use a scale, and I have included weight measurements for all of my ingredients in the printable recipe. If you want to check those out. I'll also link to the scale. I use it's really inexpensive under 15 bucks and it has just completely changed the way that I bake in my kitchen. So once you have your flour measured we are going to add another key ingredient, and that is two teaspoons of corn starch. This ingredient is critical for giving you soft chewy cookies that aren't cakey, but that don't spread in the oven. Don't leave it out. We'll also add a teaspoon of baking powder, a teaspoon of baking soda, and a teaspoon of salt, and then we'll stir these together until they're really well combined. Now that you've combined your dry ingredients, we are going to add these to our wet ingredients. I recommend adding the dry ingredients gradually, I'll usually add it in about four or five parts, and you'll stir everything until it's nicely combined. Now comes the most important part of these chocolate chip cookies, and that is the chocolate chips. You will need two full cups of chocolate chips for this recipe, and I like to mix things up a little bit by using a half cup of mini chocolate chips. Now for the remaining one and a half cups, I like to use just standard semi-sweet chocolate chips. And what I'm going to do is I'll reserve about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of this for after the cookies are finished baking. We're going to press them on top. It's going to make them look nice and just a little extra pretty. I like to do this, but you can skip it if you want. Now comes the worst part of these chocolate chip cookies, and no we are not going to be adding nails or scorpions or anything, we are going to have to chill our cookie dough. You're going to want to cover this with cling wrap and the dough is going to need to chill for at least 30 minutes. Once your cookie dough has finished chilling, You're going to want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and we can begin scooping our cookie dough. I like to make these cookies pretty big. So I'll scoop mine to be about two to two and a half tablespoons in size. We are going to gently roll them between our hands and what we want them to look like, it's almost egg-shaped. You don't want to roll a perfectly round ball. You want them to be slightly taller than they are wide. As you probably noticed I like to line my cookie sheet with parchment paper. It makes the cleanup really easy. If you don't have parchment paper, you'll just bake these directly on an ungreased cookie sheet, and you'll want to space these cookies about two inches apart. They are going to spread quite a bit. You'll want to bake your chocolate chip cookies and your 350 degrees Fahrenheit preheated oven for about 13 minutes. Keep in mind that if you make your cookies smaller than I did, they are going to need less time to bake. Another few notes I want to add is, do not place your cookie dough on a warm cookie sheet. Make sure you always let your cookie sheets cool completely to room temperature before adding any more cookie dough, and while you're not rolling out your cookie dough, keep it in the fridge. That way it doesn't get too warm and the dough doesn't get too sticky and difficult to roll. Once your chocolate-chip cookies have finished baking, they should be lightly golden brown around the edges. Now, here's the trick I told you about, and the reason we saved some of those chocolate chips from earlier. One thing I like to do is while the cookies are still warm, like one to two minutes after them coming out of the oven, I will gently press additional chocolate chips onto the tops of the cookies just gently nestling them into the surfaces. As you can see, it just makes them look a little extra pretty, this isn't completely necessary, you can skip this if you want. It's just a nice finishing touch that I like to do. Now these cookies are still going to be slightly underdone in the center so you're going to let them cool completely on the baking sheet. This is going to let them finish baking all the way through, besides they're going to be really fragile at this point. So you don't want to move them anyway, and then once they're finished cooling they'll be baked all the way through, but they'll also be really soft and chewy. That is how you make the worst-ever chocolate chip cookies. This is a recipe you have to try and when you do, please let me know how you like it, and if it ruins your life or not.

dive into this recipe be sure to tap that little Bell icon near the subscribe button so that you can get notified each and every time I post a new baking video now these cookies the trick with them is to keep them ultra thick so be sure to watch this video all the way to the end to get my tips for thick gooey cookies now we're get started with this recipe in the bowl of the stand mixer you're just going to add two sticks of room-temperature butter and it's important to use butter that's at a cool room temperature if your butter is too warm if your dough is too warm when it enters the oven your cookies will actually melt too quickly and flatten and you won't get that thick texture that we're looking for next we're going to add in granulated sugar brown sugar and I actually like to use way more brown sugar in this recipe because it gives the cookies that rich caramelized butterscotch flavor and a softer slightly chewy texture so we're just going to beat that for about two to three minutes or until it's just light and fluffy cookies do not need as much beating time as a cake if you beat the butter and sugar too long when you're making cookies you can actually get cookies that puff up nicely in the oven and then deflate once they start to cool which we don't want so just two to three minutes the next step is to add our eggs and vanilla I just have two room-temperature eggs and a splash of vanilla extract next up are my dry ingredients super simple I'm just adding in 3 cups of all-purpose flour and this recipe uses a fair amount of flours to get that steak texture fine salt and baking soda and the baking soda will actually help contribute to that golden brown color that we're looking for now I'm just going to beat this until it's combined next up the star ingredient chocolate chips I'm using semi-sweet but you can use any kind you want okay my dough has come together it looks perfect at this point you can actually cover the entire batch of dough or put it in an airtight container and refrigerate it for 24 to 72 hours and this can be kind of like a marinade period for the dough refrigeration actually helps to intensify the flavors that butterscotch flavor that's so delicious and that process also helps to allow the flour to absorb some of the moisture and so your resulting cookies are not only more flavorful but they're actually thicker in slightly chewy so if you have the time I definitely suggest trying refrigerating the dough for a 24 to 72 hours I'm actually going to bake off a few cookies right now because I just can't wait so I'm using a 3 tablespoon cookie scoop today this one's by Aqsa it's their large size I'll link to this down below I think that this creates cookies that are so much like the delicious ones from the bakery because they're nice and big until you can get those crispy edges while still being gooey and kind of under baked in the center which I personally love you can also make these smaller and I'll list out directions for that below and I actually like to use parchment paper when I'm baking cookies I prefer it over silicone baking mats because I just think it's easier and with silicone baking mats if you allow cookies to cool on them for too long after baking they can actually kind of create moisture and reduce the crispy edges of your cookies so I usually prefer parchment ok my cookies are all scooped they are ready to bake now if it's warm in your kitchen or it happens to be a really hot day in your cookie dough is warm you can actually pop it in the freezer while your oven preheats to really make sure that these cookies stay nice and thick while baking these will go in a 350 degree oven for about 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown okay my cookies came out of the oven they are golden brown thick and beautiful what I love about this recipe is I actually filmed the time lapse video my iPhone of these cookies cooling to see if they deflate it too much while cooling and they totally did it they say nice and thick and you can just see how gooey they are on the inside I cannot wait to take a bite thank you guys so much for watching this video if you liked it be sure to give it a thumbs up leave a comment below and let me know if you give this recipe a try and be sure to subscribe before you leave thanks for watching and I'll see you next time [Music]", "qi8Ybju_2V0": "wow this is so fun i feel rich don't spill evelyn don't spill this one genius if i do say so myself it's only stupid if it doesn't work [Music] hello i'm alvin welcome back to tasty's making big the show where i make giant versions of some of america's most beloved foods so today i'm going to be making a huge chocolate chip cookie let's get started okay so uh the first thing to making great cookies is a lot of butter as you can see this is 10 sticks of butter so this recipe is a scaled version of one of my older tasty recipes of cookies and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna brown the butter one two eight nine ten okay and this is going to take a while to melt down if you'll excuse me i'm gonna melt this butter for a little bit wow this is so fun i feel rich oh some of the little flavored brown bits are starting to come up to the surface that's a good sign okay so i've turned off the heat and i think this is beautiful it's like liquid gold okay so this guy is going to go off the heat and it's time to make the rest of the dough so now it's time to make the dough i found the largest bowl that we could find in the tasty kitchen and yeah let's make some cookies first i have a lot of brown sugar a lot of white sugar for a lot of flavor i like to add a lot of salt let's just give this a mix break up all that brown sugar so this recipe is 10 times the size of the normal batch of cookie dough which makes about like 12 cookies so this is gonna be one very very large cookie okay oh the wrong way now that it's cooled off a bit my favorite part brown butter [Music] smells ridiculous and back in look at that one of the biggest reasons why i really like baking cookies it's literally because of this part where i get to smell the brown butter and the sugar there's a candle that smells like this i would spend a lot of money a lot of eggs and quite a lot of vanilla extract here we go coming together it's gonna work out you know all right the texture we want is these beautiful silky gold ribbons time for the dry ingredients 10 cups of flour a lot of baking soda and back in we go slow this time don't spill alvin don't spill this one just do one of these yeah that'll mix it in real good genius if i do say so myself it's only stupid if it doesn't work this mixer really does have a mind of its own okay i think the dough part is ready but can't have chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate so i'm gonna go get lots and lots of chocolate be right back okay so i brought a lot of chocolate i like to use both milk and dark chocolate i'll start with the milk chocolate first i'm going to chop these all up into pretty large chunks oh yeah that's what i'm talking about let's get all this into the batter let's just start cutting some dark chocolate that's so satisfying wow this is like 20 chocolate bars i believe all right i'm saving these two bars for decoration so i'm going to mix this wonderful chocolate into the dough probably one of my favorite parts it's like like mixing a salad oh yeah listen to that sound you know what i'm gonna use my hands oh this feels so nice okay i think that's mixed time to figure out how i'm gonna bake this guy let me go check in the back to see what we have okay i found this uh really big cake pan that we have in the tasty kitchen i think this will be a perfect size got some parchment strips to keep it non-stick just spray it just to be sure parchment sling technique go in there have it in the pattern almost like a clock okay i think this pan is sufficiently lined now the gotta get all this batter out of there come on whoa nice all right let's get the rest of you i'm gonna spread this out i'm gonna use my hands let's get you situated just in case we didn't have enough chocolate we're gonna put some more chocolate i'll go here you know is there really such thing as too much chocolate i don't think so two entire bars of chocolate just for the topping this guy is ready for the oven i am so happy with what we have right now oh we let's put you in the oven big guy ah there's this is cookies like at least 50 chocolate which is a good thing because when i make cookies i get to control how much chocolate goes in all right let's bake you for probably like an hour to 300 nice and low to give the whole thing enough time to cook wow later dude oh boy this is this is a heavy one wow so this is what the cookie looks like after one and a half hours of baking and a lot of resting time so i could slowly cool down i'm really proud of this and you know you can't have a giant cookie without big milk i'm also very excited because i have a friend named lindsay who's baked cookies and really likes making cookies so i think it'd be really fun face timer in to see what she thinks of this let's get lindsay on the phone what's up lindsay hi how's it going good i'm mad i'm not there to eat whatever you're making i would have preferred if there are other people to share it with lindsay made a really cool video where she challenged a lot of tasty producers to bake things and that was a really fun one because you've made so many things that video and lindsay also happened to make my cookies which was really fun i actually baked your cookies a lot for jasmine because she's obsessed with them all right well do you want to see it i'm ready ready one two three alvin is a cake and all the milk you made it so beautiful thanks it's a 16 inch cake pan the largest we could find at the store this is a vase i think i guess that's the next step for me i guess it's just to go bigger that's right go big or go home that's the motto of the show all right well thanks lindsay i'll see you soon all right good luck all right bye so it happens to be almost christmas and milk and cookies are a family tradition at least for me around that time i leave them out for santa so i thought it would be fun to see if we can tempt santa claus to come in hopefully we get some never before seen footage of the ever elusive santa claus merry christmas oh what is this it seems to be a large cookie and milk usually when kids leave it out for me it's not this big whoever made this must be a fine lad i will bring him many presents no one seems to be watching i see no reason not to try my oh my this is quite the large cookie look at this texture there's so much chocolate and cookie i think i will

hmm freeze rudolph this is a good cookie this may be the best cookie i've had in all my years i think i shall take this cookie and hightail it back to the north pole oh sweet sugar plum i'm out of here [Music]", "AK-MqFtQNlA": "Hi everyone and welcome back to my channel. Today I\u2019m sharing with you a recipe for\nhow to make the ultimate chocolate chip cookie. These are crunchy on the edges and soft and\ngooey in the middle. Once you\u2019ve tried these chocolate chip cookies,\nyou\u2019ll never want to make any other recipe ever again. So if you would like to learn how to make\nthese then lets get started. The first ingredient for these cookies is\nbutter. You'll need to use room temperature butter\nas we will be creaming it with sugar. Measure out the butter and add it to a medium\nsized mixing bowl. The recipe for these chocolate chip cookies\nwill be in the information box as well as a printable version on my website, so just\nclick the link of the screen now. To the butter we are going to add two types\nof sugar. Brown sugar and regular sugar. You need to use both types of sugar to get\nthe best results for your cookies as they both work in different ways. Brown sugar contains molasses so it makes\nthe cookies really gooey in the centre and adds caramel type flavour, whereas the regular\nsugar creates a crunchy edge to the cookies. Measure out the sugars and add to the same\nmixing bowl as the butter. You can use a stand mixer, or just a wooden\nspoon here to cream the butter and sugars together. If your butter is at room temperature this\nshould only take a few minutes. You want everything to be well incorporated\nand for the mixture to be quite light. Next crack in one good quality free range\negg, and add a splash of good quality vanilla extract. The vanilla really helps to round out the\nflavours and pairs really well with the chocolate. Mix the ingredients together until well combined. Measure out a cup of flour and add to the\nmixing bowl. For this recipe I am using baking soda as\nthe rising agent. From my experience with making chocolate chip\ncookies you can add baking soda, baking powder or a little of each. All three options have different outcomes. Baking soda produces more flat spread out\ncookies like the ones in for this recipe. Baking powder produces more of a puffed up\nrounded cookie, and a mixture of both produces a cookie somewhere in between. It\u2019s completely up to you what you use. Add it to the mixing bowl and mix the ingredients\ntogether until just combined. Once you can\u2019t see anymore flour it\u2019s\ntime to add some chocolate chips. I am using some dark chocolate chips here\nbut the possibilities of what you can add to these cookies are endless. Nuts, dried fruit, white chocolate. Anything goes. Add to the mixing bowl and fold the cookie\ndough together until everything is well combined. This cookie dough is now ready to be baked\nbut if you want to keep it for later you can store it in the fridge for up to three days\nor in the freezer for a few months. Roll your cookies out and place them on a\nbaking sheet topped with baking paper. To do this I am using an ice-cream scoop. It works really well at making all of the\ncookies the same size, and it\u2019s just easier than using a spoon. I\u2019ll have it linked in the information box\nif you are interested. Make sure to give the cookies some room around\nthem as they will spread as they bake. Place them into a 190d celsius or 375 f preheated\noven for about 7-10 minutes. The cookies are done when the edges start\nto brown. Remove the cookies from the oven and leave\nthem to cool on the baking tray for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack. These cookies will stay fresh in a container\nfor up to 5 days, but of course they are best eaten straight out of the oven. If you make these cookies don\u2019t forget to\nsend me a picture on my social media and let me know what you think of them. I love to see your recreations. For more baking videos take a look at this\nchocolate salted caramel tart, or for other recipes take a look at my channel. Thank you so much for watching and I will\nsee you in my next video. Bye.", "2hz84I9tKOc": "alright guys tell me you have those nights where you wish you could have just one fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie but you don't trust yourself to bake a whole batch because let's face it you'll eat them all by you I mean me so today I came up with a recipe to make two perfect fresh baked gooey crispy on the outside and soft on the inside chocolate chip cookies so you can satisfy your craving any time here are the ingredients 2 tablespoons of butter to firmly packed tablespoons of dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar a pinch of kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 egg yolk quarter cup of all-purpose flour quarter teaspoon of baking soda and three heaping tablespoons of chocolate chips ok let's get started first we want to take our melted butter both sugars vanilla and mix that up well I tested this recipe with softened butter and with melted and found that the difference was not noticeable I don't know about you but if I really want to cookie I don't want to wait 15 minutes for butter to get soft now add your egg yolk and really mix that together well now it's time to add pinch of salt baking soda and your flour stir well and now you just want to stir it on your chocolate chips now I'm making classic chocolate chip cookies but this recipe is awesome with white chocolate chips nuts chopped fruit you can really make it your own just try to keep the proportions about the same that is looking at my cookie dough and before I just start eating it raw I'm going to grab a sheet pan I've lined it with parchment paper so my cookies won't stick and just kind of scoop out two balls of dough that are roughly the same size it doesn't have to be perfect now I'm going to pop that into a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes all right so these are perfectly cooked and I mean come on how good does that look and you even have a second one to share with a friend or eat in an hour I'm hotel anyway I'm going to eat this and I'll see you guys next time it's really good it's like perfect", "SPM-gqhOMHo": "if you're looking for something cozy delicious and amazing treat and super easy look no further this everything skillet cookie is just what you're looking for and as promised very very easy start off by whisking together your dry ingredients it's two thirds of a cup of all-purpose flour half a teaspoon of kosher salt if you're using fine salt please use a quarter teaspoon otherwise your cookie will be very salty and you'll get mad at me and I don't want you to be mad at me I want you to love me just like I love you quarter teaspoon of baking soda those are your dry ingredients basically nothing and if you're an avid Baker I'd say you probably have almost all these ingredients in your cabinets and your refrigerator right now so that's another good thing you might make sure I have five tablespoons of unsalted butter with a quarter cup of granulated sugar and to that I'm adding a half a cup of light brown sugar beat until creamy which happened very quickly if your butter is room temperature then one large egg and your vanilla [Applause] beaten so that is combined and then you're going to add your dry ingredients also I probably forgot to mention this have your oven preheated to 350 degrees because as you can see I'm almost done making this so you better have preheated your oven heat to combine and then the promised everything in the everything cookie it's a cup of chocolate chips most recipes say to turn it off the mixer and do this by hand for some reason I never do that a quarter cup of sweetened shredded coconut and 2/3 of a cup of the quick cooking oats beep - the mine that's your batter I have a cast-iron skillet for you can use any oven proof nonstick skillet I prefer to use cast iron so I think it's a great thing to bacon but enameled cast iron works as long as it's summoned proof would also work keep it one last stir just to make sure that all the good stuff is evenly distributed and then just put it into your pan you don't need to grease your pan it should be plenty of fat from the cookie so it shouldn't stick and then just press it into the pan you can use an offset spatula and don't worry too much it will spread into the corners but it doesn't need to be it'll become perfect all on its own all I really want to do is just eat this batter unbaked but I am gonna bake it and it's 350 degrees until it's set it takes about 20 to 25 minutes when it's done guess what you get to eat it warm sometimes I just scoop the ice cream right on top and let it melt into the whole thing but today I'm going to cut myself one slice it is really fun and it's a great presentation if you're serving this is a dessert at a party to put the ice cream in it but then you really do have to serve the entire thing otherwise it kind of ruins most of the cookie all right I may be a little hasty which is why it's falling apart sit and let it cool quite enough but I'm okay with that because it's warm and delicious scoop of ice cream love gosh like so great this is habit warm chocolate chip cookie with coconut and oh and ice cream it's everything that you want in a cookie and maybe even a little more if you like recipes like this and you want more make sure to click like and subscribe because we have plenty more where this came from", "kJnkDx3gLCk": "it is a fact this is the easiest cookie to make and it's perfect for when you want a chocolate chip cookie so bad and you want it now works every time by the way this healthier mug version comes with more nutrition and fewer calories than classic cookie recipes single serving mug cakes are so convenient it's done in a minute you don't have to worry about the perfect shape and there's no messy balls to clean up also these little treats are great when you want to keep your portion control in check i would say it's a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth without overindulging start by adding 2 tablespoons of unsweetened apple sauce in a microwave safe mug which i use instead of butter then add a half tablespoon of maple syrup or agave you'll get the sweetness from the chocolate too pinch of salt which balances out the flavors and keeps the cookie from being too sweet and drop of vanilla paste or vanilla extract the classic recipe calls for egg and i'm gonna make both classic and eggless version as well for classic cookie you're going to need just one egg yolk because egg white turns rubbery when microwaved so keep your egg white for later you can add it to your homemade granola to make it crunchier just mix it in and bake as you normally do it will help to create this delicious crunchy clusters stir it up with a fork until well combined for no egg version you just have to replace the egg yolk with some milk of your choice the rest of the ingredients are the same you don't want your batter to be crumbly so mix all the wet ingredients first then you can add the flour again i'm using homemade old flour which is cheap and so easy to make at home to measure properly spoon your oats into the measuring cup and level it off the batter won't be very thick like a cookie dough because we're using a liquid sweetener but not too runny either finish it off with some chocolate i prefer using mini dark chocolate chips but you can use chopped chocolate too anyway if using milk chocolate your cookie might be too sweet also press couple of extra chocolate chips on top what i also love to do is to push some healthy nutella into the center of the batter making these mug cookies are so much fun this homemade nutella is a healthy spread made with all natural ingredients dry roasted hazelnuts dates cocoa powder and water you just have to blend all the ingredients for 5 to 10 minutes and that's it all you have to do now is to microwave the mug for 40 to 60 seconds you do that on medium power and start checking for doneness after 40 seconds it's always better to undercook than overcook it it will continue to cook after you remove it from the microwave on top it looks like undercooked but if you press it you'll see it's done look what i got after 65 seconds if it's overcooked there's no going back so if making the classic version let it microwave for 40 to 45 seconds because the egg yolk will cook really fast and it will set the cookie in less time but if you make eggless cookie for the best texture i would suggest you set your microwave for 60 seconds cookie will be pretty hot so let it cool for like 3 minutes then dig in it really makes a difference compared to omb cookies these mug cookies are pretty soft with no crunch at all and i think soft and gooey is the only way to go with this recipe also if you want to go creative you can change the flavor by adding peanut butter dry cranberries chopped walnuts or fresh blueberries so if you're too lazy for baking and want something sweet this chocolate chip cookie in a mug really hit the spot but if you want to make whole batch of cookies to share with family and friends make these oatmeal chocolate chip cookies these healthier cookies are soft and chewy with lots of small chocolate pockets inside check out that recipe now thank you so much for watching see you in another video stay healthy stay happy", "71HtO0Fb6ws": "Guys, the day's finally come. Today, we are finally doing a cookie taste test. This is what this is what dreams are made of. Hello, everyone! I'm here today to share with you guys a video that I have been waiting for. I've been waiting all my time on YouTube for this moment. Today, we're doing the ultimate taste test. Today, we're going to be testing Tasty vs. Rachel, and in case you guys don't know this I make cookies pretty much every night. Every single night. And not just any cookies. Not the box cookies. I make cookies. I mean, I freeze them. I don't like actually physically make cookies every night. That would be insane, but chocolate chip cookies are basically my favorite dessert ever. So I thought it'd be a really fun video to taste the Tasty recipe for cookies vs. my recipe for cookies and just see which one is better! See if I can pick up some tips and tricks for making my cookies even better. If such thing existed 'cause my cookies are delicious. Tasty recipe is for their \"Best Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies\". And then I have my chocolate chip cookie recipe. They're very similar, but there are little things that are different: in terms of amounts, or salted versus unsalted butter, and the types of chocolate chips... Just things like that. That will make them a little bit different. So I wanted to test and see if those different methods and things actually make a big difference in how the cookies turn out, but I am very excited about this video, so give it a big thumbs up if you enjoy it and you want to see more of these Rachel vs. Tasty type of videos. And if you have any suggestions for, I don't know, recipes or anything you want me to test out leave them in the comment section below. Don't forget to subscribe, so you don't miss out on new videos every Saturday and every other Tuesday, and without further ado, let's get into this! And today, we're gonna start out with the Tasty recipe mostly because it is the first thing on my screen. And I want to follow this exactly. I have my little scale here, so I have all the measurements correct . This is the best, guys. I'm so excited. I know it's, like, 10 o'clock in the morning, and I'm making cookies, but I don't care. So first things first, I need to whisk together all of these sugars, the salt, and the butter until a paste has formed, with no lumps. And they did all of this by hand. They didn't use like a stand mixer, which is what I would normally do, so I'm going to- I'm gonna do that, but I'm gonna be tired because I'm out of shape. Measuring out a hundred grams of Sugar. Oh no! Too much! 165 grams of brown sugar (or 3/4 cup). I'm gonna need a spoon for this... By the way, you like the Christmas pants? 3/4 of cup of brown sugar. So far, this is fairly similar to my own recipe, but, um, I don't mix in the salt with the sugars, and I also, um, just the ratios of sugars is a little bit different from mine. So a teaspoon of salt, and then half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted butter (melted). Here we go, everybody. We got oh, that's half- yeah, that's half a cup. There we go. Into the microwave, go little guy. Alright, butter soup here. We're just gonna pour that in. Now, they want me to whisk this together, until it forms, like, a paste. Unsurprisingly, this is quite easy. Alright, there we go. Paste. Now, we need one egg. (cracking) Put that in, as well as one teaspoon of vanilla. Now, they want me to whisk this until light ribbons fall away from the wirk- the whisk. This is my workout for, like, the month. Based on the BuzzFeed video, this is kind of what they're talking about, I think. So, it's kind of like ribbon-y at the bottom. Now for the flour, they want me to sift everything, so I have my little sifter over the bowl, and I measured out 155 grams of flour, so now I'm going to put that into the little sifter. And they also want me to put in half a teaspoon of baking soda. We're just gonna sift this in. Now, to actually mix it, they want me to use a spatula, just to make sure that I don'tlike over mix it, which I get because overmixed cookies... They're disgusting. So what my dough looks like which looks really, really good so far. And for the chocolate, they actually mixed up two different ones. They use semi-sweet chocolate, as well as, like, dark chocolate chunks, so I got these little dark chocolate chunks. So I'm going to, like, break these up. 110 grams of chocolate chips... Oh, too many. Guess I'll have to eat them. Get all this chocolate into the bowl. Get that chocolate. And then we're, again, going to mix it very carefully. Spatula? (ding) Spatula? You were just... (sigh) (ding x5) Oh! (laughs) Wow, that was a moment that happened... where I was looking for a spatula- was in my bowl! (slow motion as dough flies out of bowl) (laughs) This is why I don't do the cooking. This is what it looks like, and now we're gonna go in, and we're just going to, aw,  you can use two hands for this, but I'm just going to incorporate all the chocolate in. Honestly, I feel like a three-year-old trying to stir, and I don't have two hands. Okay, so I have my dough right here. I'm gonna cover this in some plastic wrap, and then I'm going to stick it in the fridge to chill. Because if you didn't know, chill dough for cookies- makes it just so much better. Highly recommended, if you can- if you can wait. I know, I know, it's cookies. You don't want to wait, but you should. I'm telling you, it's worth it. Alright,\nnow I'm gonna clean up a little bit, and then we're gonna go on to the real cookie recipe: my cookie recipe. You don't make cookies every single night if they aren't good. Okay, so for this recipe, I'm gonna be honest. I eyeball a lot of it, which I know isn't good- you should always measure your ingredients fully, so I did measure out, in terms of grams, like, how much it is, because I want to make sure that I'm following the recipe that I still use, but then I also want to take into account the changes that my mother-in-law makes to the recipe, as well, because she's been making this for years. I don't even know where she got it. Maybe, it was her great-grandmother Nestlie tollhouse. So the recipe starts out fairly similarly. We have brown sugar. We have white sugar. We have butter. All the makings of a great cookie recipe- just my ratios are a little bit different. So for the brown sugar, it's 1/2 a cup of brown sugar to 1/4 cup of white sugar, but my mother-in-law always adds a lot more brown sugar. She just kind of like makes it instead of, like, flat and packed down, she makes it like rounded on top of the, um, measuring cup. 'Kay. That is more like a \"half a cup\" of brown sugar to my mother-in-law. For cookies, anyway. Which measures out to... 128 grams, not 99 which is what the recipe calls for. Gonna put this into my stand mixer, and we have 45 grams of white sugar. Which, in case anyone is wondering, stays the same for my mother-in-law. For butter, I use salted butter because I'm using less salt later, and I just like to cut it up, softened, at room temperature. And cut it up and measure it that way. And then it's just easier. When you're trying to mix it all together in the stand mixer, it doesn't just form one big ball. That doesn't break out. Okay, now from here, I'm going to also add in one egg and some vanilla. And for all the dry ingredients: the flour, the baking soda, and the salt, I like to combine them, and then add them, in batches, into the, uh, stand mixer. So 1 cup of flour... 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda... Where's my teaspoon? Okay, now we're going to sift it all. Sift, sift, sift, sift, sift, sift, sift. To the stand mixer! Little batches of flour at a time. Let's kind of incorparate it. This part I actually do by hand, um. Sometimes, I will mix them in with the stand mixer if I'm feeling really, really lazy. But I am gonna try here to, kind of, just mix them in properly. Alright. Now my batter is good to go, and I am also going to stick in the fridge. I will usually either stick into the fridge or I will just go ahead and freeze it. It's so much better, guys. So I'm gonna go do that, and then we're gonna bake up some cookies. All right, we're back. Both of the doughs have chilled properly, and I'm gonna put them on this baking sheet here but I will have them separated out, so I know which side is which. Even though one has chunks of chocolate in it. When I was going on the Tasty website, they were saying that uh, I, should be using an ice cream scoop. This seems excessive. Like that needs- it seems like a gigantic cookie. Alright, Tasty, whatever you say. Alright, so here we have the cookies. I have three and three, so here we have the Tasty recipe, and over here are mine. Just a note, something that I realized when I was scooping them out, this, the Tasty ones, are- were a lot easier to scoop. They weren't as sticky as mine were. So you guys can see this is my first batch, and I felt them to be very flat. I think it's just my oven. So I usually I cook my cookies at 325. And so, this was just higher, and so, the edges crisped up a lot faster, and the inside was still raw. So I did a second batch at 325. So I finally have the cookies. I'm excited. I finally get to test them out. So I have, uh, my cookie, right here. And this is giant one is the Tasty one, which is a little bit flatter. Probably more of a chewy texture, I'm assuming. And it looks like it's like marbled with chocolate, which looks delicious. So obviously, now, I guess I'll take one for the team, and I will test them both. You're welcome. Tastes like a cookie. So far, so good. Because the dark chocolate, because when I was, like, chopping it up or whatever. It's sort of marbled and worked its way into the rest of the batter. It's like every bite has a bit of the dark chocolate in it, and it almost gives them more of, like, a, like, a richer, like, chocolate-y flavor. And then, my cookie right here. I don't know why I'm bothering taste-testing this because I already know what it tastes like. See, to me this tastes more like, like a cookie. The Tasty one is good. It's a little bit more chewy, and it has that richness of the dark chocolate, so it just tastes different. This one feels a little bit lighter, a little bit fluffier, I guess. This one wins, in my personal opinion. Christopher, can you try it? Can you see those bite marks? Look at that. They're like jaws or something. But he says that the Tasty one just tastes, like, very much like chocolate, like it tastes very chocolate-y, and mine tastes more like a cookie. I personally think mine is better. I don't know, I could be biased in this particular scenario because I make these so often, and I kind of have an idea of what I like cookies to be, but, like, if you guys try out any of these recipes or both of these recipes, can you, like, tag me? Just like #RachelVsTasty or something like that, or just tag me on Instagram or Twitter or something. I want to know which one you guys like best, but I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Give it a thumbs up if you want to see more of these Rachel vs Tasty kind of videos, and let me know what type of meal or snack or dessert or anything you guys want me to test next, and that's everything. I hope you guys are having a wonderful, wonderful weekend, and I'll see you guys all in my next video. Love you all.

Ro: Yeah.", "VYG4qeR8qZ8": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you how to make a Chocolate Chip Cookie Cake This cake is super fun and super easy to make. Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees\nFahrenheit and lightly grease a 10 inch cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper Then plop 3/4 of a cup of softened butter\ninto a bowl and add in 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 2/3 of a cup of regular sugar and cream this all together After about 1 minute of mixing you'll add\nin 1 whole egg plus 1 egg yolk and pour those in along with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and beat this\nin It only takes about 20 seconds of mixing to get a nice creamy mixture on that Next we're going to add in our dry ingredients We'll start with 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon of salt Give this a quick mix Then we'll add in our flour You'll need 2 cups of all-purpose flour We'll start adding that in and mixing it in in between additions It'll look a little bit crumbly at first but\nif you keep on mixing the dough will come together Then we're going to turn off our hand mixer because we're done with that And sprinkle in 1 cup of chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of sprinkles and stir those in Once you get it into a nice big dough ball we're going to transfer this to our 10 inch\npan and press it into the bottom It takes a second to press it down and get\nit spread out through the whole pan but after a couple minutes you'll end up with\na giant cookie and you want it to be as flat and even as\npossible It's a giant cookie with sprinkles and that's\njust so much fun! We're going to bake this in the 350 degree\noven for about 30 minutes Or until the edges of the cookie turn golden\nbrown Once the cookie is finished baking you'll\nwant to remove it from the oven and transfer it to\na wire rack to cool completely In the meantime we're going to make our frosting Start with 1/2 cup of salted softened butter\nin a mixing bowl and cream it with a hand mixer You want to beat some air in there and get\nthe butter light and fluffy so give it a good minute\nor two of mixing Then we're going to add in the powdered sugar You'll need 1 1/2 cups total but I like to\nadd it in about 1/2 a cup at a time Once you get all of the powdered sugar mixed\nin it should be pretty thick but don't worry we've still got a couple more things to add because this is actually going to be a chocolate\nfrosting You'll need 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and then also add in 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla\nextract which will help thin this out And if it's still too thick add in 1 to 2\nteaspoons of milk and mix that in Transfer this all to a piping bag and we're\ngoing to pipe it on to our cooled cake Give it some pretty swirls of chocolate frosting\naround the edges and then I like to add a little bit of sprinkles on top of each little swirl And that's it! A fun little cookie cake You're ready to slice and serve Thanks for watching! You can find the full written recipe in the\nvideo description.

See you later!", "KyWaAguD3ao": "[Music] [Music] hey guys and welcome back to bakewich in this episode i'm sharing the recipe of everyone's favorite chocolate chip cookies but i'll be making them without maida which is refined flour without eggs and without an oven i will also be sharing instructions on how you can make them in the oven so stick around let's get started so i'll be doing everything in one single bowl the first thing that i'm adding is half a cup which is 113 grams of butter this butter is softened it's at room temperature and i'm using regular salted butter to this i'm adding half a cup of superfine sugar and half a cup of brown sugar and also a teaspoon of vanilla extract you would have seen that for all my cookie recipes i like using both brown and white sugar and that's because i like the flavor and texture that the brown sugar gives to my cookies but in case you don't have brown sugar you could use jaggery powder instead or use 3 4 cups of white sugar in total now using my spatula i cream the butter with both the sugars which means i'll beat it very very well until i get a mixture which is super light and fluffy and looks something like this time to sift in the dry ingredients i'm adding 1 plus 1 4 cups of whole wheat flour which is atta you could also make these cookies with maida i'm also adding an optional ingredient which is one tablespoon of corn flour and also half a teaspoon of baking soda now corn flour is what will make these cookies slightly chewy so if you want super crunchy cookies you could absolutely skip the corn flour [Music] once it's all in i use my spatula to give everything a quick mix at this stage you will see that your dough would look super sandy but don't worry this is how it's supposed to be and to bind everything together i'll be adding in 1 4 cup of milk and i'll mix everything until my dough comes together beautifully my dough looks good it's ready and now this goes into the fridge for about 30 to 60 minutes until it chills and firms up properly all right now let's do the setup to make the cookies i have an induction stove here you could use a regular stove i'll be putting it on to medium heat on the induction i'll be placing this pan you could use any pan that you have the first thing that goes into the pan is a wire rack or absolutely anything just to elevate the plate with the cookies i am using this idlika sacha because that's all i could find and now on to this will go another plate onto which i'll be scooping my cookie dough and then to cover everything up one lid that will go on top now the first thing we need to do is to preheat the pan so with the wire rack and the plate in i'll turn the heat on and let this heat for 10 minutes if you want to bake these eggless whole wheat chocolate chip cookies in the oven you need to first rest the dough in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes once that's done you use an ice cream scoop to scoop the dough out on the baking tray lined with either silicone mat or with parchment paper then you will bake the cookies in an oven preheated at 180 degrees celsius for about 10 to 15 minutes until the edges of the cookies become golden brown all right so my cookie dough has chilled and now it's time to shave the cookies to shape the cookies i'll take a small amount of dough i'm not making very big cookies roll them into a ball and then press them slightly until they're nice and flat i'll place the cookies into the pan and then put the lid back on be careful because both the plate and the pan will be very hot at this time [Music] i'm only placing four cookies at a time because my pan is slightly small and also because these cookies will spread slightly when they're cooking and now we wait for the cookies to cook since i'm doing it on an induction stove my cookies will take slightly longer they should be done in about 20 minutes but if you're using a gas stove your cookies will be done earlier so keep an eye and don't let your cookies burn so if you see my cookies have risen a little they've also become slightly golden brown this is when i'll take the lid off and start placing chocolate chips on all my cookies once the chocolate chips are in place i'll put the lid back on and let these cookies cook for another couple of minutes [Music] [Music] so my cookies look good they have a really nice golden brown color at this stage you need to switch off the stove but they'll be super soft so you need to let them sit on the plate as it is for a few minutes they'll become crisp as they cool down and after that once they become firm you can lift them off the plate [Music] trust me guys these cookies are absolutely delightful you can't tell if they've been done without an oven or without eggs or without maida they look super pretty they're super crisp delicious and of course there's chocolate which makes everything better so when you make these cookies at home don't forget to show them off on your social media and tag my instagram profile at chavez70 i have lots of interesting recipes lined up for you guys so don't forget to hit that subscribe button and i'll see you guys next week with another recipe until then happy baking and take care", "f8jRUiyB2y4": "fire city fam what is up it is art and Bobby coming at you live on a Thursday with an unannounced live stream I'm looking at the comments right here my blue Milwaukee Brewer and Daisy are like you know did anyone get a push notification no because I set this up about 20 minutes ago and I think if you do it with less than 30 or 45 minutes YouTube won't push it real good but people are gonna come because what does Kevin Costner stay I can feel their drinks if you cook it they will come well say yea bleedy said that exactly then the director is like no no build it Kevin he's like okay that works too much Linda in the house joyc toyline is here spec sheet da so I'm pretty sure people are gonna get da oh yeah I said dot just write more like yeah it's been a long day it's been a long 24 hours again so the reason we didn't do a live stream yesterday is cuz we did a five hour master class shoot with Whole Foods I taught the class on how to shop for the week that's gonna live on their platform that was a heck of a day and then this morning we woke up at the butt crack of dawn and then went to Whole Foods here in Chicago and we got the cover shot for the cookbook exactly the way I wanted it I'll show it to you in a little bit so we did all that before ten o'clock in the morning came back here and I'm like yeah we gotta do some more work and then pop on for a live stream so say hi to our thirty al maseeh hello everybody no so leave comments down below let us know where you're watching from let us know if you can hear us and see us well um while I was at Whole Foods this morning with Arden Jesse and rose I got wild salmon the wild sockeye salmon that's normally $19.99 a pound is on sale for Amazon Prime members for $11.99 a pound what a great deal and I asked a fish the fishmonger said hey my friend can you take the pin bones out but then can you take this skin off and then cube it for me he's like bro of course I'll do it for you super nice guy they'll do that for you it seems do so much time because you don't have to do that at home um I do have some Brussels sprouts going in the oven here because I have to free up the oven space what do you guys think a couple more minutes to get on nice and roasty and toasty right I like I'm crunch to you yeah cuz we're gonna put the paleo chocolate chip cookies in here so I got our roast these and get them out just avocados salt and pepper so we're gonna have that I'll put some ah lemon zest some Parmesan cheese maybe some toasted pistachios over the top of that then we're gonna buzz up this beautiful wild salmon with eggs avocado oil mustard crowd sourced ingredients and make little patties and then I don't feel like making tartar sauce today so in the spirit of the semi-homemade five ingredient cookbook coming out later this year we'll use one of them bats I know that's not one of the best store-bought tartar sauces it is amazing with avocado oil real ingredients no cane sugar no process canola oil because when you only have five ingredients you got to get really good fresh ingredients and usually one store-bought ingredient or product like a primal kitchen Bobby hashtag ask Bobby what am I forgetting oh and I'm sorry and then I'm gonna make Desi's five ingredient paleo chocolate chip cookies using the best-in-class paleo baking mix from the grocery store this Bob's Red Mill stuff is amazing could you say Katrina Freeland has a hashtag ask Bobby time and temp for the brussels 450 degrees for about 30 to 35 minutes the key is preheat the sheet tray in the oven wired chopping broccoli or chopping the Brussels sprouts so when you put it on the sheet tray Katrina since they'll sizzle sizzle they start getting crispy and delicious immediately okay Maggie's in the house sorry guys I missed some comments were y'all walking from leave comments down below what is the best ketchup to get at the market I think my fans you guys the family can answer that question down below and then I'll show you one that I have in my fridge right now rdd's in the house what we cook into our cooking wild salmon cakes for cooking paleo chocolate chip cookies we're having a good time what happened I get a time I don't want I stop a tauren wants to know what the ingredients are go check it out paleo mix I turn around that is such an amazing mix it is way cheaper on thrive market which by the way you all know that but it's phenomenal Oh rose honey is taking a nap right now she got up early for the photoshoot West Virginia's in the house I heard my genius for lovers I don't know about you my girl Christine's from Boca Raton primal kitchen my girl Paula Mae yeah so when you're looking at ketchup you want to avoid ones that have refined sugars a traditional Heinz ketchup left four grams of sugar per tablespoons that's a teaspoon of sugar per tablespoon you're probably gonna use three tablespoons of ketchup we're talking about a sigh of diabetes with your ketchup so instead get one that has no added sugar my boys in Primal kitchen just use tomato to sweeten it one called the the new primal will use a little bit of I believe either dates or pineapple juice concentrate we just don't want cane sugar in our diet cuz it's the devil what do we do with the devil we stamped that damn dog down hey I'm gonna stamp man Dabo down the hall right right let's pour some wine accident like a housewife just came here this is my $9.99 what a play fam been absentee because we're moving going from the

Davi okay first thing we have to do is form the cakes then we're gonna make the chocolate chip cookies what do we got here so sip pop you can take videos $4.99 thank you for Silla priscilla that's video so we're gonna put everything in the blender I'm using my thermomix once again the star the show it look at the color of this is wild salmon when you're at the market asked the fishmonger to take the skin off for you and cube it up it's gonna save you so much time and this is wild salmon sockeye wild salmon normally $19.99 a pound on sale for Amazon Prime members for $11.99 Colorado boiling you see him on the street that's a heck of a deal super Chad from violet day three Canadian dollar move Islander that is Oh blow me kisses hey Thank You violet gotta get the candle one day soon so that goes in there I need binders and emulsifiers so the thing about wild salmon is that it's very lean and dense and meaty and I like using it for this recipe because I can had some fat to it it's all get Dee Dee and his girlfriend drove down from Wisconsin last weekend deci and I met him out for lunch we did an impromptu shop at Walmart it was really fun so I have two pasture-raised eggs they were sold out a vital farm so I got this brand at AA / foods still organic and pasture a so I'm okay with it but the yolks aren't quite as yellow or as orange as my boys / vitals somebody asked what that spaceship looking thing back there is that's not arts rocket yeah this is my thermomix it's like a fancy chopper all in one cooker really good stuff but I was gonna say if you want to use a good quality was gonna say farm salmon a farm Sam for this you can do that too oh wow you know I'm not gonna waste my marbles like Bobby is heavy on the Brylcreem today it's that kind of day we're exhausted so if you didn't hear we got up at 6 in the morning we got the cover shot for the new cookbook done at Whole Foods I'll share that very soon yesterday we did a five hour shoot for Whole Foods with Whole Foods on a virtual simulcast and I taught a master class on how to shop that's gonna live on their platforms now we need a binder or like a bread crumb traditionally I'd use a panco but how do we get it gluten free and keto almond flour so we get the bigger bag from Costco and put out three-quarters of a cup in here and I'll say if you're gonna use farm salmon for this you won't need as much us too much eggs and avocado oil mayonnaise because that has a lot of really good fat in their stuff problem is a lot of farm salmon is garbage I mean that's raised in a really bad way but when you get good quality farmer salmon Whole Foods has it but my favorite brand is we that Norwegian salmon then it's super clean and good for you and you can blend it here it has more fat more omega-3 fatty acids and you're less prone to overcook it especially you're making a fillet so when I make fillets I like to buy a good quality farm when I'm making like salmon cakes I don't mind getting wild Cox and gonna add mayonnaise and stuff like that Maria wants to know what you think of a yellow sweetener Madi she reminds me of a West Side Story arts great it's great I'm delirious today but by the way guys um a your loss is fantastic it's a great keto sweetener I know some Costco's have it you know I really want to try has anyone tried that out yet gone yacon syrup the akan is that a South American potato that's low on the glycemic index and they make the yacon syrup out of that I want to try that I heard it has a really good texture so you know soaking the almond flour and water will let that hydrate talk to me Arthur say you had him Spiegel $19.99 Jackie Wednesday Lake City family and happy cooking thank you so it's Wednesday we typically don't do live streams on Wednesday but yesterday was crazy we didn't have time so we're making it for today tomorrow or off and then Friday we're back for Friday's with Flav now I do also want another binder here in the form of mayonnaise look how cool this is Kito mayonnaise from our boys over chosen food what makes a keto though cuz all a mayonnaise is technically keto well it's made with coconut oil and coconut oil is rich in Tennessee teas medium chain triglycerides so it's nice because it has those is avocado oil mayonnaise keto - well yes but the ICTs are just a little boost for the keto diet if you're down with that so I'll put about half a cup in the yonder get that in there right pardon to say gochujang in the house poem is in the house palm even art is on the gochujang train now he would you do the other day with that art made some Asian themed chicken thighs that grill to my Weber pretty cool huh some gochujang some sriracha tamari coconut area I mean Oh teriyaki whatever it's called pretty sweet oh yeah uh coconut secret teriyaki and you know some lime so what's crowd source a special ingredient for this right so I got aa egg salmon mayonnaise salt and pepper I'll put stone-ground mustard up a caper berries onion powder garlic powder parsley what else give me one like bananas bonkers ingredient to throw in here but have it make sense don't have me put like you know doing it in there or something like that right I never had dairy another I like to try it to be honest see what the fuss is all about little bit of S&P Adrienne's asking dill not officers capers yeah caper I got Wendy says lime yeah thank you I got lemon zest lemon zest about that Jill if I had deal I would do that follow with Joe what's the first thing I should make from the cookbook got it today so excited loved that Stacey go to the chicken chapter make my Moroccan chicken stew with gold and cauliflower rice thank you so much and by the way if you have not left a review yet please leave an Amazon review those are very important we're still on number one bestseller all because of you thank you I was thinking the same thing cilantro during and green onion mango kale of something go on there yeah I don't think I have mango that's a really interesting idea hot sauce hey we're all in Duchene if you like hot sauce better drink I love the way you think let's take a little bit of this a siete chipolata hot sauce later we've asked this one many times nobody knows what the heck are talking about way imagine that's a pretty random I think anybody ever picked up on that one great call alright that's rockin and rollin grooving and moving 600 family members sorry for the last-minute stream but who cares we get to hang out it's all that matter I'll do about two teaspoons of stone ground mustard I just love this stuff because I'm a sucker for crunch those are all the brown and yellow mustard seeds in there so they add texture they add Tang eNOS what else do you want Adrian says turmeric just a tad helps with the utilization of omega-3s as far as I know interesting well I don't know if it aids in absorption of omega threes but it has those lovely anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties so Adrian no drugs I'm down with that so onion powder garlic powder put that in there I got extreme close-up city by heart I'll go here arts I'll be tell me but break out powders it's like one of these days I'm going to do a line of monkford all of these days I'm gonna do a line of stevia if he does it we're doing it on live stream a little bit of to me I'm telling you no it's not gonna happen a little bit of to me put that in there no way that Joe comes now the cool thing about to me is that it needs black pepper to activate it a lot of people don't know about that we have a black pepper in there and it needs fat so your body can absorb it we have fat in the form of the mayonnaise in there so we're good to go caperberries trivia what exactly is a caper Mary is it a berry that grows on a tree is it you know mysterious fruit that hangs from something what what is a caper berry what's that French word me oh the nonpareil yeah what's that mean I don't know I'm just a French let us know I'm just a stupid I'm sitting there for and I don't know what it means so well you know I'm gonna take a little bit of the juice yeah I got the juice I got there just a little bit of that briny juice Oh so let's see here my Flav seen you cook book marked up like aunt Esther's Bible attitude the more marking the better you guys I'm so excited I finished writing now about 40 of the 50 recipes all the savory recipes are done they're so mind-boggling easy and tasty with the ingredients that are so best in class and so much shopping knowledge is dropped in every single page every single chapter I really think you're gonna go gaga when you get this book there's a question for you from Ashley o-net what is the water system that you have from Venice Beach at Google couldn't find it on the name of the store changed if you change you're right but search Alka logic I believe they're called them Water Company now and just call them say you want the really small company run by an Israeli guy it's just they're a little unorganized but you want the alkaline under a sink system where chef Marco just came in with a $5 super chef Bobby art no inverted Top Gun flying today I'm so $2 dusty for today's an awesome nice bro Deanna : - Thank You Frontera recommendation so yes I don't know if you said it but caperberries are actually the bud of a mediterranean bush it's picked and pickled it's salty and briny it's delicious so so good so that goes in there then we'll take our almond flour Go Go Go G who said that no I said Theresa hello from Portugal oh I heard Portugal obrigado and I heard gochujang well kochujang he chimed in say his nickname I don't know he's really don't you let's do it a little Stickle of go G right just a little Sh tickle umami it's gonna mommy bomb right put that him now like I said earlier the key to making this light and fluffy but also you know oh my god gochujang I guess just get this stuff from these guys fermented funk who needs a funk all we gotta have that [ __ ] this stuff is the best obreg\u00f3n see normally people would put like crushed up saltines panko breadcrumbs Italian breadcrumbs homey don't play that game homies gluten free homies paying the Aikido so we took our lovely almond flour hydrated it in water so I don't have any cheap almond milk I only have the MalK right now I'm not gonna waste it for this and that's our lovely binder that being said I did make a 5-ingredient version of this for the cookbook and for my fifth ingredient which is the tartar sauce I'm telling you about this and why to avoid other ones in the cookbook it's such a stripped down version because this version here has what 10 ingredients the cookbook one has four ingredients in the patty fifth ingredient is tartar sauce I 5 really good interesting question dr. Chang you think gochujang and peanut sauce would make a great sauce peanut butter would make a great sauce did you not see what we did recently what did I do that I put a gochujang in the peanut sauce for the uh oh you didn't see it because I did it for theokoles going with peanut butters what he said yeah bro I made a sauce out of that so we took those Korean short ribs we made a 5-ingredient Mercurian I use gochujang for the marinade and then I used gochujang way of thumb lime juice peanut butter water salt and pepper for the dressing amazing dude totally amazing and we put it in the video from the Costco yogurt marinated chicken thighs last weekend bread tricks you can find the one that Bobby has at Whole Foods that's where I ended up getting it other places will have other go to James but if you want this baby why do you want this yeah go to Whole Foods I'm sorry it wasn't the Casco last weekend's Whole Foods haul and recipe I used the gochujang Pina dressing with maple syrup it was bomb calm where I think she'd be great on ice cream too to be honest I think that would like a little like go do Jing sauce did you try the other day or not I thought you were joking I know I did something weird come on with something weird on ice cream yeah wasn't good no it was a tikka masala sauce oh yeah I put the tikka masala mama tikka masala sauce on my so delicious ice cream it was

fire fire fire fire okay so we're walk in a row about to make oh my got it in put a timer on the vessels dump so I wanted them pretty crispy so here we go actually to be fair look that's the way I like them the leaves are a little toasty but these are perfect we're not even joking I totally meant to do it totally meant to do it and what's cool about doing that is look this turns into potato chips yes that's the way it is so our that's important is it no it's perfect no this is why it's perfect look you guys sometimes Brussels sprouts if they're cooked via boiling or steaming there is boring see that carmelization there and there but inside it's still super super creamy right there so if you just eaten that unlike what mom used to make when you grew up that's delicious that creamy

for Michigan ah much love to you cheers you guys it is Wednesday afternoon having a good time Lahaina did you cook with cedar plank for salmon and is it worth it yes I have such an old-school recipe on my blog if you do Flav Sinise cedar playing salmon you can get them at Costco in the in the season I don't know if they have it now but I put an on a cedar plank that you have to soak in water and I top it with my famous a brown sugar citrus rub and i grill it indirectly oMG it doesn't part a really lovely flavor and if you only have a gas grill like I do it's a great way to get that barbecue smoky kind of flavor in there Vic with a question can I substitute salmon for sturdiness um no you can substitute it for a pan salmon if you substituted for Cod halibut um but you can't do start jeans I don't that's too oily and a very very different dog texture my dear you reuse the cedar planks that I don't know near admirably in the chat love you guys each at a time I'm going through menopause and a vegan I'm always check out of ingredients for now check them out Bobby and aren't you guys have plenty of peeps on here from Cowan County Texas y'all should make a visit over here we love you guys Frisco McKinney and Plano I'm down with coming down there sounds great thank you Andy yeah um you know what have you ever got fresh sardines sometimes they have them at Whole Foods fresh sardines if you marinate them and like a Mediterranean marinate and then grill oMG they're delicious and you can eat the whole thing but neither dancy welcome let's see here okay how do I find the whole the white spaceship you're using or I know it's a Thermomix so it's a thermal mix it's great if you don't love to cook with ovens and pots and pans cause you can chop and cook in there they gave me one because I was doing a huge project with them but I really use it just for the blending purposes but it is really great if you don't want to have cast iron pans and non-stick pans it's called a thermal mix yeah but you're probably traveling for the immediate future but eventually we can travel we good to get down to it okay here it is here's the recipe for Desi's five ingredient paleo chocolate chip cookie check it out our cell screen shot ah I don't want so it's the Bob's Red Mill Paleo flour mix baking soda is a pantry staple one stick of grass-fed butter coconut sugar almond butter vanilla extract large egg semi-sweet chocolate chips the pantry staples for baking chapter are vanilla and baking soda so the rest are the fresh ingredients you need Dessie hasn't finished the recipe I'll probably write it up tomorrow but that's it now what makes this recipe so great is you don't have to buy almond flour coconut flour tapioca starch it's a little pricey but this Bobby boys Red Mill Paleo flour mix is bomb.com why because look at these ingredients it's the perfect mixture of paleo ingredients that are not too dry bind together really nicely and it's fantastic oh really really cool let me preheat the oven to 350 brewer and spelled a little differently out there and monkey organ Milwaukee figured I'd point that out to you what's the Alice Cooper line about Milwaukee in wins well no monkeys Algonquin for the good lad maybe walk hey I love it okay so I need to create that mix the flour salt soda in One Bowl Susan Creed or $4.99 hey from Texas Google capers and caper berries they are two different things not always interchangeable love my paleo wines they're all my faves great not always interchangeable cuz caper berries can be very big like olives true capers are the small bud have you seen capers that are bigger than like olive sometimes they're monstrosity for the quito chocolate chip cookie recipe can I substitute Evo au for coconut oil for the Quito which one chocolate chip cookies um I wouldn't do that cuz Evo has a very strong flavor profile I would use avocado oil cuz it's neutral flavor would you recommend grass fed collagen or marine collagen and no vital proteins at Costco is a great dude um I would get rested cow's collagen it's think it's better for the body Marines and if you don't eat beef or any kind of animal proteins and then if you don't eat animals at all you get the plant-based one from Sun warrior and the cookies on the menu tonight have inspired char orders come in with a 14 sure cookies cookies cookie says sure I love to see that and Waukee organized named after Milwaukee Wisconsin at the time Milwaukee Wisconsin was spelled haha who sells the s water I know it's always at Target and Whole Foods it's an elegant based company it's great we love the kedo line that's all only available on their website I have my promo down below for discounted shipping no sugar no chemicals no headache or hangover amazing stuff I saw that uh Cameron Diaz now has a keto sugar free wine line cuz everyone's starting to learn that chemicals are very prevalent in wine and no one knew about that because they don't list the ingredients on the bottle you got a drink clean organic keto sugar-free one marissa esquivel where do you get that specific flour from I'm this easiest place to get is Whole Foods but I get this bag on thrive market and it's a way cheaper than the smaller one on at Whole Foods so use my thrive market link that I have a lot of my videos are the one tomorrow what my buffalo sauce would you recommend ma well can I show you the coolest thing I saw the way up their primal kitchen now has a buffalo sauce at a paleo with cashew butter I don't buy any pre-made I make my own with just hot sauce and butter and a touch of maple syrup search Flay City a chicken wings bread chimed in to say that the nonpareil and the caper yes the French has no equal ah ah wow that's pretty like ballsy of them Ziza kippa beds have a no equal so a cup and a quarter of paleo mix the funny thing is every time art and I and se finish a live stream we're always like automatic I really go for those cookies but we don't want to

currently making the citrus glazed salmon tonight nice bro so that's the citrus place salmon I would put on the cedar plank from Costco really really good stuff monk fruit really hard to find in Australia any other suggestions yeah I know I feel so bad for my friends in Australia in other parts of the world I mean the thing about monk fruit is that it's a one-to-one sub so you can get pure erythritol also if you want but I really really want you to try to find that if you can gentleman wants to know your thoughts durum wheat semolina only if it's organic because conventional wheat is scores high in glyphosate's but durum wheat is not a whole wheat but if you're gonna have a durum wheat pasta make sure it's organic shocking news yesterday out of my boys at ewg they did a report on glyphosate levels in chickpeas and hummus and even though my favorite Bobby approved brand of hummus cava which has organic chickpeas no oils no filler scores extremely high in glyphosate why the hell would Schick peas have glyphosate which is the active ingredient in roundup it's because they pray not only in the soy with Roundup this Bray wheat and oats with Roundup as a desiccant it happens to be very very susceptible to get into legumes which is why you really want to get organic legumes because for the most part they score lower and lifeless aids but for some reason the organic chickpeas they use for kava are high in glyphosate so now because of that they're officially garbage that's really it's upsetting to me so I'm going to go with hope hummus is now one of the only Bobby approved hung eye on the market via Robinson December 1 that's when the book comes yes December 1 I'm pretty sure pre-sales will be a couple months before that of course I'll let you know lucky Brewer is it safe to let Bobby bake yeah yes no because Robles chocolate chips and Jesse's cookie recipes no sugar no there's zero sugar at all because this is what we're doing free with this recipes in the cookbook look at that best-in-class store-bought ingredients in products zero sugar Lily's stevia-sweetened non-gmo erythritol based chocolate chips those are the bomb.com why look at these ingredients that's what you want with chocolate chips not cane sugar loaded diabetes chips these are an anti diabetes ship these are delicious now I couldn't make you guys I'm actually pretty good at baking but I hate the process of measuring and all that stuff but my heart should make the cookies you want to make the cookies and I'll film you are how about that let's do that you guys want to see art bake all right - pretty good look to that let's do a little switcheroo okay that's a good point how it's gonna do it right now I requested a very nice good point that's what you look you guys are getting art oh my here is our 13 al maseeh not the first lady in gentleman he ain't the second he is the thanks for welcoming me into the kitchen I'm gonna wash my hands Jackie Adam Spiegel $15 holler Cookie Monster and love these combos and on exciting thinking so you know if you don't say that art is the recipe just because don't blow it yeah so that's obviously the crux of the cookbook it's five ingredients FD meals anyone can make using best-in-class store-bought products and ingredients whether it's avocado oil or keto mayonnaise whether it's Goju Jane that has no crud in there very very good stuff that anyone can make so these are the five ingredients paleo chocolate chip cookies art I have added a cup and a quarter a Bob's Red Mill paleo mix that's a baby thank you for pointing that I was gonna ask cuz I can't keep track with you can go from there that's all you've done that's all I'm done okay so your baking so you don't have any other ingredients out here I'm I do I have most everything out you need you do yes I can so that I don't have the baking soda would be in that yellow container over there you can soda okay do you need a glass of a key don't whine no I'm good thanks one teaspoon of baking soda yes so we're gonna use a teaspoon of baking soda my boy Rocha yesh is in the house Roshan dusty was asking if you had a chance to complete that our task we have to go Oh Jesse is actually doing it so you don't want him to do any more pinch of salt Matty's chopped keys in the house drinking Seco rosy so what's he gonna say mix flour salt and soda so what we're gonna do is we're gonna mix the Bob's Red Mill paleo baking mix aka the flour in the recipe right here Bobby where could somebody buying that Bob's Red Mill I'd recommend buying our thrive market because it's way cheaper than Whole Foods great in the pinch you can get it from Whole Foods too it's good to know Bobby my husband said to give you a personal shot off of hooking us up with gochujang I love to hear that okay so we've got our dry mix dry team is there and we need to cream the butter sugar and add the almond butter vanilla okay so what do you cream with us how for to keep your I would get the mixer in the lower middle drawer there and then a bowl you know where that is haha pause like where's my thanks for the actually parm is a reason why we drink we use a gochujang this stuff you guys we talk about mommy bombs I use this in two recipes in the new five ingredient cookbook it's a fermented Korean chili paste normally with GMO soybeans and other garbage in there look at this these are the company that are invented coconut aminos really good stuff are there any hazelnut spreads that are healthy you know what my friend I will tell you that desi absolutely loves and it's probably the cleanest ones on the market this one right here she has almost one of these every night on a piece of tortillas from siete it's very close to being 100% Bobby approved but can you spot the fact that I have organic sunflower that's not expeller pressed and I have natural flavors but it doesn't have palm oil it doesn't have any cane sugar the total sugars are only two including one additional pretty pretty cool so grab that on Amazon five dollar power from a grill Mattie Trotsky who crushed about fifteen or twenty videos this weekend Thank You Maddie go art you are the best thanks to Maddie Trotsky dusty said we're done with all the videos BJ I would get the gochujang on Amazon look for coconut secret dojo jack where's the coconut sugar coconut sugar is in that yellow tin behind the booze big one yep okay folks if you're watching this and saying boy this looks really unrehearsed that's because it is you don't know where I keep everything I do um yes I've tried some tella but it's made with some sunflower seeds and it doesn't have that flavor that Nutella has did you sift the flour we did not you don't need to if you wanted to you could Wow Maddy says she got off 30 recipes thank you for that egg so for this recipe we need a half a cup which is one stick of butter ghee or coconut oil we're using butter tonight we're using a special butter if I use a cultured butter Organic Valley organic cultured butter because art is a very cultured man argumentative so we're going to take a half a cup plus three tablespoons of coconut sugar Charles I would put a tablespoon of that and four ounces of water or tea in the morning and drink it like that it's great for your gut what's the ratio of coconut sugar - sugar it is one to one my friend yes Genesis the pale Oh 61 kilo wine is only available online and because I love this company so much I always have a promo code if you go under the video there you'll see the promo code for dis kind of shipping on set go wine the red wine and the Rose a are my favorite so coconut sugar is lovely if you got in there did a virtual sniff right now it's nutty and caramel e and almost like chocolatey it's really lovely or like an Austin Powers a bit not to you yes it isn't Moustakas and Laird super food makes coconut sugar that is one of the better ones I've had to be honest okay so we're going to cream the butter with the sugar and after we do that I'm going to add some almond butter to it it's right room-temperature butter very important let's give a round of applause for art rocking out the cookies I want to see those lights go from 161 way higher here I don't like to waste butter so yeah I don't weigh its need to grease the pan with anything you want to lick that thank you are so you want to go slow when you start out good a wise you're gonna make a mess yeah somebody's have to clean it up we don't like it or it's pretty sure so that's as much they're gonna get so was cleaning the mother with the sugars like put in a lime in the coconut so once you get the party started then you can crank it up a little bit more yes Jorge if you want to make these Kido substitute the coconut sugar with the golden monk fruit from the canto then be lovely yes Ashley says can I use coconut oil for the recipe yes you can just make sure when you add the oil and you don't over mix it otherwise the oil will separate just go very easy on the creaming just do it for like 25 second that's it using coconut oil oh yeah [Applause] Thank You Coco for coconut flour that like that artists killing the kitchen so it's good luck with Bobby because talking or cooking now will happen the middle of pretty soon you don't worry about that I put coconut sugar over monk fruit this coconut sure that has a very complex flavor but if your Aikido you can't have it you go with monk fruit you can check my Aki move it down so you can see what how to do it so I what is creaming sugar exactly it's blending the sugar with beef water and the sugar looks like cutting into the butter it's softening it's incorporating some air into it too commentating their baking and it really helps for the mother to be room temperature yeah some recipes probably not party to explain Falls to clean it so Jim you can substitute almond flour the texture of the cookies is just not gonna be that yes this cookies Nemeth peanut butter breaking news breaking news Rose has been crying and we haven't heard because she's recipe creaming the sugar it gets adequate for this recipe yes I think that is adequate ah nose amazing almond butter almond butter I took right yonder we have fancy almond butter oh we have our gain eeeh which one should I use yes whatever you think is appropriate to the side you guys listen to the maple huh foolish show that for a second using the argan oil laced almond butter there it's got Florida cells are really nice they sell this at sprouts farmers market if you have that buy you something regular - yeah mix it up Oh crazy I'll use a spoon so we need recipe calls for a cup of almond butter so okay [Music] Nathan's wife is trying to figure out what I do for a living she's betting I'm a nutritionist Nathan she'd be wrong I'm doing exactly what I'm doing right now you two being social meeting and blogging so you'll see that often times with almond butter the oil separates from it so if that happens just recombine it and I don't need to go too crazy with it we've done a lot of cookies around here and one time the only almond butter we had were like sample packets for my gosh and what we do we started measuring out a third cup of almond butter by tearing open individual sample packets and draining them and by we you mean me we open like ten sample packets the measures are ridiculous out of a cuff hilarious I'm gonna try to go mostly original almond butter well throw in a twang of sure the maple center what kind of questions are people asking ah so here in the comment section I made your keto ketchup and barbecue sauce dah dah dah dah I'm loving it my coconut secret ginger turmeric sauce would that go good with fish yes it would Maggie I've seen that but I haven't bought it let's see here yeah the Google Doc is closed right now because so many you guys hooked us up with the information thank you so much what makes the Bob's Red Mill feel and not Kido great question maybe instead of me saying it you guys can crowdsource it what are the ingredients that make this where are the ingredients that maybe go that make this key dough and not paleo I see - what do you guys see you there let me show you the macros here so it's not that high carb to be honest I mean 10 net grams of carbs per quarter cup man not terribly low what is that tapioca says bread go judging prom and exactly right exactly right so is here so you can use a hundred percent almond flour if you want just keep in mind the cookies will be very fragile yes rose honey bunny Daisy why don't I use my beautiful board this

you know okay back to kiss y'all we need to add one egg and I don't like to crack an egg right into it cuz what are the eggs bad then you got to start all over again so I corrected one of this dish here Wow alright super fun anyways the thing about this recipe is when you're incorporating the egg you need to just mix it until it's combined you don't want to overdo it pregnancy well is this egg and egg mix to come on I'm just reading let's say add admits just to combine [Applause] make sure your ends are combined that's that's important I love these water model help out and I use zero water

definitely be on Amazon and then if Costco wants to carry it then be gray Whole Foods Target I'm actually the the buyers are kneading with our publisher next week so hopefully they like to look at the cover and a few recipes we gave them and if it goes well I look V in those stores and we'll see what Amazon's really the big driver for that thank you for asking Jackie new cookbooks coming out on December 1st and mark your calendar Yas it'll be the gift the holiday gift of 2020 how often can I give my one-year-old a wild salmon I would do it no more than two to two times a week good question so Jesse has informed me that it's best to mix this by hand firm batter if you're using the Mixmaster what are these are called also a nice thing about doing a paleo mix is there's no gluten so you can actually mix this as much as you want him if you had a regular all-purpose flour you have to mix it just to combine otherwise you can activate the gluten and make them to talk yeah Thank You Annette yeah that's a good thing you put out there because yeah exactly this one you could mix all you want Shawn's asking why I left the finance world because this is way more fun Shawn I'm all about helping people how often can I do that one all right Viviana is in the house Jana is in the house the I gog ha ha ha ha Bobby you're gonna put your I'm gonna put peas on top of the salmon case I don't think so no do you need to chill this do not know are we going to or not I don't think so tonight Sammy takes out the freezer for some blasts show that what last but not least it's and we need one or three quarters of a cup are we feeling one are we feeling in your quarters today so these are the lilies sugar free chocolate chips I've asked the question hoping that no sugar and stay away from the milk chocolate ones they have natural flavors are at the semi-sweet so the only sugar in this recipe is the coconut sugar and we're using unrefined Pelias chocolate chip cookies we put vanilla in there right Parton says or the entire bag yeah those were you having my dear Oh organic peaches and lava plant-based yogurt rose that sounds yummy somebody said they're trying to get me the blush that's not very different no how you're trying but keep up you'll probably succeed that good no the tasty yeah you love that yogurt once again we're using this flower this is Desi's go to baking flour for the 5 ingredient cookbook because it is paleo and has very good it's important to taste the chocolate chips when you're making I kind of like old wine you got to first taste it to make sure it hasn't gone bad same thing was freaking out why feel free to eat I need a sip of the bag you don't want the chocolate chips to be corked hey good play hard thank you hot so I made no sense at all

just with that okay so we are going to put this in the freezer yes it's a real in the freezer yeah okay I'll make room so I want to cover it with plastic wrap will do that make sure it doesn't soak up any flavors yeah it's a one to one replacement exactly right that's not that's the fancy plastic wrap for some Sava kados yeah oh that's what use it for four avocados yeah does it work well it works amazing eyes oh my god I'm at night and they are 30 can we make this bread with paleo flour instead of macadamia nuts ah yeah so late law instead of making diseases Kiba bread get her all yeah yeah or

comes to illustrator top or anyone for indoor cooking we're gonna hook you up with that too I'm gonna turn my mini I think people are saying the audio is good news all right fired to sing a vertical horizon do you think we should leave it that way for like the videos - we're not we may want to interesting sometimes I do hear some clipping really how's your carpal tunnel Bobby um overall pretty good it did act up end of last week but I've been doing these exercises the fan sent me an email with the exercises her husband does it physical therapy so that try every day to do this five times this five times five times five times come down here ten times like this and then ten times like like this and it helps but sometimes it just still hurts here I guess divided in these since I've been taking is not helping but it's okay wait John Jonathan Hill says mic is off now it's better because it's on what are you talking about is not off talking about it I don't think Mike is definitely not on I've got a little bit of Brussels sprout leave in the back of my throat okay and then instead of making a tartar sauce tonight which I have the recipe for and that link I showed you we're gonna use this showing various this is a new product in primal kitchen it's the only Bobby approved tartar sauce in the grocery store because there's editing made with canola oil and sugar it's made with vente avocado oil no added sugar real organic seasoning and spices this stuff Dessie will down this stuff like nobody's business if you're not careful Viviana wants to know if your your wrist pain is something that college and can fix um I don't think so because it's not joint pain its carpal tunnel so unfortunately knocks I take two scoops of college and everyday this is a art recommended spatula it's the nonstick safe up to 450 degrees event but if it's flexible I wasn't getting that with my previous one so I added this to my Amazon shop page and here's why it's good because check it out just don't leave it in your PIN yeah don't leave it in there don't run I swear the cakes like this and gets under there very very easily it won't melt like plastic ones normally do and a what scratch my nonstick pimp and I'll immediately go down this platter duck look up brilliant at it otherwise I'd have oil every year were they really great I'm preheating the mini oven here I'll evacuate the dancefloor on here rockin in a row and groove in and I move in right we're having fun your fungi I'm a fun guy thank you are no wonky brew or $10 I made Jessie's almond milk the good news is that it tastes great peeling the almonds is almost a deal-breaker though yeah dude am I losing anything besides money if I buy the almonds already blanched oh no just losing money but hey you got lots of money who cares right Jill chops key those look so good where do the crab come from oh it's not crap it's sand it's wild salmon sockeye salmon sockeye salmon on sale right now and it's cute instead of 20 bucks it's $11 or $12 great meal I told you all before but there's a lot more people on that when you get salmon from the fishmonger ask him or her to take it off the skin debone it and cut it into chunks that way you can just toss it in the food processor with the mayonnaise the egg the seasoning good to go um what was going to say I forgot and when this live stream is done now that we're talking tartar sauce go to youtube and search Mitch Hedberg tartar sauce haha great jokes about it not getting either well he is but seriously yeah yeah my tartar sauce recipe is great too I use avocado oil mayonnaise my hand on Greek style grass-fed yogurt and then umami boosters like relish lemon juice salt pepper I also put all caper berries in there it's really tangy and creamy as delicious yeah I'm very sad that Mitch's gone somebody asked a question is there is it is there such a thing as too much collagen powder now can you take too much collagen no but I want to do more than two scoops today Milwaukee Brewer be more specific when you say we're losing Bobby sound again like how long have a stretcher you're not hearing him I mean Milwaukee Brewer is hitting that uh slips a little too hard over there wait are you hitting the mute button he's distant cakes are out I've been told before then of them to distance to people so I don't know maybe so these are done look how beautiful they're all right nice and GBD you're gonna cover them up shiny side down yeah deaf people might get headphone though leave my last message art let me find a Jonathan and then I get the second batch in here try to come back yonder our third heater said than done and once again he might mixture here it's not super creamy it's a little chunky and I like that and give it those salmon cakes a little character a little pizzazz look at that right I don't want all cream I want some texture I'm on Team texture you don't want no scrubs either yeah I don't want no scrubs thank you are it's a very good point so the TLC reference now about them even look the Mike's turn to decide that should be fine parm says it's better now I haven't changed anything far Desi's listening she's gonna be the boss like she always is the timer's going off for the cookies maybe once the Desi's done there she got skip some cookies onto a sheet tray for us put these down can only even stop the noise sure can you stop the noise in my head sure [Music] no oh beautiful stuff if you're using good quality farm rectus salmon like from Norway the one from Whole Foods or mowie you wouldn't need as much Mayo right as the binder and just take a look at your audio pack when your hands are dry just make sure you're not accidentally on mute people said when I got closer then they heard you better see I got a chance something back then because we obviously mess something up by doing that see let's see Desa can you grab the cookie mixture off my thing great it's not needs it right let's change this back to the +10 when you want to change yours to are now well let's first see oh yeah so right back plus 10 repeat this is plus 10 plus 10 audio check audio check plus 10t sibilance sibilance sibilance cookies I want cookies Rose honey I want cookies are done the dance keys keys keys I got to come down roasted cookie and could have keys keys keys keys alright we're buddies and yet the last chilled cookie dough its muffled and fuzzy Jeepers Creepers microphone getting worse all the time I have to order in a new one on Amazon you're violating me on YouTube put this one back not just a new one of these are the might of this set everything what the mic yeah no nothing like that everything like a transmitter I don't know I mean we can test this line after work interesting with my mic in yours and ah gotcha sounds just right now okay well let me Isis terrible let me go to that then let's get - 20 room [Music] [Music] beautiful Sammy takes our money city I hear what Bobby is thinking now sounds like a job you don't want to be in my ideas like crazy talent man when you put your mic in your pocket this one became distorted well that should lot of people are saying it's better now and then I guarantee you I'll see a comment no there's a way better little muffle see I just feel that some people are watching on a lag and by the time I see the comment right it's like three settings ago that is correct Wow let's show what does he's doing come over here this is more important I agree that my muffled audio can a pour a glass of wine in the meantime I think the verdict is good now good people trained better so Jessie is forming the cookies into false teeth you push them down or you leave them as balls balls they completely flatten on their own yeah where's this audio is perfect Bradshaw that's good let's show this one more time art in case you guys didn't see earlier we woke up at 6 o'clock this morning got the cover shot for our next cookbook coming out on December 1st this is the official cover shot for semi-homemade 5 ingredient meals we went to Whole Foods get out there at 7:30 this morning got this beautiful shot with the most amazing light coming through this bank of windows that was like all over here art and I filled up a cup in the cart with the most Bobby approved products ever gonna see at a primal Lilly's Mina harissa coconut secret sky valley for that hard Jodi all very very exciting where can one get Desi's omen milk recipe on flame city.com yeah and youtube anytime you have a question if we have a recipe just search Flav City Plus that Flav City almond milk Flav city chicken breast Flav City creamed spinach what happens if you do Flav City cheese balls that will go to a video art eating cheese balls at Walmart I believe well let's go to a screen shot here of Tyler who just gave $2 as a super Chad hey Bobby hi al sorry I'm late Tyler so if you're just joining right now we have these beautiful salmon cakes which I got to evacuate from the dance floor I'm going here Jesse's making five-ingredient hey Leo chocolate chip cookies and I roasted some Brussels sprouts and very high temperatures check this batch of a Fionna cakes out right just cooking for their GBD also known as what our golden-brown delicious now because it's wild salmon tends to be on the leaner side so I really added a good half cup of ah of the mayonnaise coconut oil mayonnaise and the egg to really help add some moisture and some binder Bobby do you want to hear the bad news I love to grab her and focus that we're going to reshoot the cover because there wasn't any gochujang um there actually was cooking in aminos but yeah I feel you I feel you Bradley I feel you homie all right well put a little more than duck fat in here we go how many cookies does this recipe make we have a four rows of three there okay okay I got a 12 there so far Grenada watching Chicago according to Madeline I don't like the sound of that forget know what well there was a question mark after her fan exclamation mark which one do you mean what's the one that I hope it's more of a question mark rather than an exclamation mark okay a little more duck fat the old pan here this is actually one of my favorite non-stick pans from a company called Tremonti know it's their restaurant series it's a 12 inch pan it's high-quality there's no Teflon using uh nonstick anymore let its high quality and its affordable I think this pants like 35 bucks really really like it you just don't want to buy cheap non-stick pans because that coating on top can be very fragile fragile Frankie Merman right Arwen from Glastonbury hey Glastonbury here happy to stumble upon you guys and gorgeous roads live tonight happy to stumble on this deal oh there's gonna be big cookies damn girl nice Oh could we use tuna canned in water instead of salmon of course you can yep use two pounds of that you're good to go and what makes them key though is the fact that we use almond flour soaked in the water or almond milk as the breadcrumbs as the filler because when it comes to filler I'm all about thriller and that's how we do it right we need Fernando watching from Ontario Canada Ontario Knife the border sometime that will help you surgery goes well next week sometime in the next year I want to get to Montreal to a fan meetup and have you guys show me the

butt to make it's a lot of work to film and it writes a recipe all that stuff live it's worth as the great you two said live is where we live it's doing well Tyler any other YouTube first cook live I know he don't connect us here and there but do many other food channels cook live and kind of do what we're doing like I haven't seen too many to be honest I don't like that expression to be honest coast yeah I agree it's not a lamb to me most the time yeah kind of a lame-o thing but the pork lettuce wraps love to hear that Wow no not many interesting elegy in Illinois in the house nice thank you or nay I'll surround us on Tuesdays yeah Alton Bravo yeah he him it is a wife do that which is really really I have not seen you gotta call that quarantine kitchen I believe okay no check it out that's what you're gonna know why that ball around here not which one the line somebody wanted to see them yeah oh my theory away here's another one right here yeah go I put the link down below in the description box organic no sugar added no chemical keto wine you won't get a headache because it's the only one of the only ones in the market that puts a nutritional information here and most wines add chemicals look at this the chemicals actually give you a headache not salt bites what about too much wine too even if you have too much you probably not gonna get a headache in the description box down below shipping discount using my promo code really cool company I was hoping to make some olive oil with those guys but it just didn't work out because it choose to all the batch to remind me of another Mitch ever joke was that I live with one grocer here how could you drink red wine doesn't a headache I said yeah eventually but the first in the middle part or a minute not do something just because of what happened to the end it's like this you want an apple no eventually it'll be a core I love my argument take a look at that nice cross on this beautiful morena $20 thanks for being you and there is a pair of shaking a maracas pair they'll soon Shafi can't the movie famosa thank you much is Graziano says but moving with an author right of course they know that some water for D slobs Joe Gallagher thanks for laughing at my humor well I'm recycling Mitch so I guess I'm just plagiarizing so thanks for being a muse my everyday Arthas at least some something Mitch Mitchie he's so applicable to everyday life here you go Rose just the first sip let's here we go Rose for a simple water for you I know you love your water there you go heart what's in there cookies well marine that is an excellent question okay all right we've got some paleo mix from Bob's Red Mill in Milwaukie Oregon or just show the recipe there you go and some sugar-free chocolate chips but here's a recipe so go ahead so that's gonna be one of the 50-plus recipes in the new five ingredient cookbook and the reason why begin with five ingredients is because of this Bob's Red Mill in my opinion makes a great paleo mix it's a little pricey in Whole Foods thrive market is a great deal almond flour coconut flour arrowroot starch and tapioca flour replace it one to one with all-purpose flour paleo delicious these cookies are the bomb let's take a look in the oven art hey Danny a me says Bessie your hair looks great I agree a hundred percent alright what could somebody use instead of Bob's Red Mill um you can if you want it to you could use straight-up almond flour or mix almond flour 1 cup of almond flour with a quarter cup of tapioca starch and that'd be your your replacement so all my cakes are done zaki cook in yeeah and duck fat could we be any more posh sure maybe that's done and this is this more posh or bougie uh what do you guys think is a more posh or mushiya I guess where there's such a difference probably not but I like the word posh take a look at that other nursery our cookies our walls are big and beautiful bold and beautiful what if I don't have tapioca starch every would starch tapioca starch 1 2 1 you need a little bit of a starch or a binder if you do it with all almond flour it will work but the cookies will be very fragile they're gonna fall apart like fragile Frankie Merman on Seinfeld so I don't recommend it um it's the Paleo flour keto friendly no it's got a little too many carbs in there do you mind asking Bobbie if it's okay to put frozen fruits in the blender to make a smoothie it should be okay right yeah are you in it for years absolutely oh don't do ridiculous is about to use coconut flour to replace the almond flour I'm gonna guess no no coconut flour so dry and absorbent it won't work lowest notes have coconut flour but we known it it's almond flour first then starch then coconut flour you're never gonna see more coconut flour than almond flour it's just so dry it really will make your mix to dry an absorbent if it's a prevalent ingredient are there any drawbacks to tapioca flour I don't think so I mean it's a staple in the Paleo kitchen you need it as the binder Desi's paleo bread uses it so you're gonna need a little bit a little dab will do you there your cream which you're heavy on according to somebody else which sat down there I'll put some stuff away here Rosie I'm poppy okay Rachel you'll know if you eat sourdough bread ah no cuz even though sourdough bread can be made with wild fermented spores it's still made with white flour even if that flour is organic ancient grains it's still straight a gluten which is in my opinion inflammatory and our bodies can process it especially Dessie but if you're gonna eat white flour or even whole wheat flour I recommend having wild fermented bread because if a natural fermentation as opposed to a yeast fermentation well if you're looking to get rid of bread send it my way I'll eat it ha does that reach you all all Sedgwick aside you look nice made some very nice-looking bread Oh a nice cool where's our Rachel Marie down maybe at the Q she's lots of uh lots of happenings the Q let's see here mm-hmm sourdough bread from a local bakery yeah if they do it right that's the one you want to eat that's hot share your YouTube channel with a stranger in the market today love to hear that Jerry thank you so much I'm an late Masari staying man what's up my man Rachel use whole wheat flour it's good hopefully it's organic whole wheat flour we talked about earlier a new report came out from ewg about glyphosate in chickpeas and hummus and even my favorite organic kava brand hummus had one of the highest glyphosate levels which is crazy because organic legumes should have lower glyphosate this one ranked high so I pitched it in the bottom of the garbage so compa is off the Bobby approved list hope hummus is one of the best widely available ones I would just make my own to be honest soak some chickpeas overnight pressure cook them save some of the pressure cooking water put it in a food processor or blender with heaping amounts of tahini garlic that's roasted lemon juice salt pepper extra virgin olive oil reserved cocking cooking on cooking water blend blend blend whizz whizz whizz creamy dreamy a fraction of the price of store-bought I'm the worst nobody nobody

please pyro say bye say bye Rosie [Music]", "-W7xq-BSxkE": "hi this is Diana cool Ian with real healthy recipes calm welcome to my kitchen now today I would like to walk you through a brand new recipe that I made for chocolate chip cookies my background with cooking and baking started when I was young and honestly I loved sweets so much that I would spend so much time in the kitchen making cookies and chocolate chip cookies were absolutely my favorite and I actually have the chocolate chip cookies that I used to make when I was a kid and you know back then I didn't know anything about nutrition everything was for taste and just the fun of baking something and having something sweet to share with others and so the ingredients that I would use they're very typical ingredients that you've probably used in your cooking before this is just traditional chocolate chip cookie ingredients so we have white bleached white flour now these days I do not even keep this in my kitchen we had to make a little trip to the store just so we can have a little demonstration flour here but you know by now we know the dangers of grain and the dangers of gluten so not to mention I mean you look at this you can see it's been bleached there's not a lot of nutritional value in it despite all of the issues with the gluten and just you know there's so many calories with it being a refined grain so this is mix up a good portion of a traditional cookie and then we have our refined cane sugar now this stuff I mean I haven't been eating refined cane sugar for quite some time and so when I even like smell it like it's so sweet so this is another huge piece of what goes together to make traditional cookies now from there we have butter and then we have these semi-sweet chocolate chips and I did a math on how much how many sugar grams is in a bag of these chocolate chips these are just regular old chocolate chips and the math came out to 184 grams of sugar so that is how many grams of sugar we're adding from this bag and you know you make a cookie and it's delicious and everybody loves it and it's just what we know and so this weekend and I mean I've come up with plenty of cookie recipes that are healthy in the past but this weekend I got a little itch to make some cookies so we're going to a party like I'm gonna make some chocolate chip cookies and for some reason I was like you know what I'm gonna make cookies with quinoa in it and you know quinoa is such a great it's actually a seed and it has protein in it and that's fiber like it's a lot of usable energy a lot of nutrients and one of the things I just love to do is to get these ingredients that are so healthy and so full of nutrition and create something that is really it tastes better than the traditional version but it's good for you so all of the calories it's all usable energy every single thing on this side has nutrition in it it has minerals and vitamins and the end product tastes so good so let's walk through the ingredients in my cookie over here like I said for the flour we're using a cup of cooked quinoa and then this is almond flour so it's just ground-up almonds two cups and so two cups of the almond flour plus 1 cup of the cooked quinoa is what we are using instead of two and a half cups of bleached wheat flour so this is how we're swapping it out now to sweeten I'm using coconut sugar now this is a really wholesome product it comes from coconut nectar and what's really cool about it is it tastes sweet it's less sweet than refined sugar like your palate will adjust to it but it is definitely has a pleasant sweetness but it's low on the glycemic index so it's not going to affect your blood sugar the way that traditional sugar does so it's almost like we get the benefit of something that's sweet that we can you know add to our cookie but then we don't have the downside so now if you wanted to take it one step further and use even less of this wholesome sugar you can add in some stevia so take away some of the coconut sugar and add in some stevia if you would like but it's I mean we're making so many of these cookies this one batch I made these ones a little bit big but one bat just 48 cookies and so you can afford to put some coconut sugar in it and you know use portion control so instead of butter what we're using here is a palm shortening and we have some coconut oil so these are too wholesome sources of fat we're going to add to our cookies and we have some sea salt some vanilla one egg and then baking soda so I'm gonna go ahead and just walk through making this cookie and I'm gonna have some taste testers come on and just see how these cookies compare to the traditional you know refined cookies so it's super simple it's very much like making regular cookies so we're gonna start by creaming the coconut oil and the palm shortening so we're gonna start here and this is 1/3 a cup of palm oil and then a quarter cup of coconut oil and we are gonna throw this into our mixer and we're gonna cream it on medium for about 30 seconds this might get a little out here [Music] all right now from here all right so we got it nice and creamy and from here we're gonna add in our one cup of coconut sugar and like I said if you want to reduce the amount of coconut sugar just based on your taste or based on if you're really trying to control your sugar even more then you feel free to do half a cup and then to add in a little bit of stevia if you'd like so we're gonna put the the coconut sugar the baking soda and it's 1 teaspoon of baking soda and then one teaspoon of sea salt and this recipe is on my website real healthy recipes calm and we'll put a link here as well so you can get it for yourself so we're going to put this on high for a couple minutes this part is very much just like making traditional cookies literally just using healthier ingredients so you get all the same fun without you know the downside all right now when you're making your cookies it's important to wipe down the sides of your bowl just to make sure that we're incorporating all of the sugar in with the roots you do that a couple times just to make sure that we have a really even consistent dough it's gonna make for better cookies now we're gonna beat it until it gets nice and kind of soft and you're gonna see the color change we started it with a darker color and now it's getting lighter as the the oil is getting more incorporated into the sugar all right so I'm gonna push it down one more times because we want to make sure it's all incorporated and then from here we're gonna add a tablespoon of vanilla extract and I really recommend getting a high quality vanilla extract because you can really taste the flavor difference I get an organic kind from sprouts and then we have one egg so we're gonna beat this in [Applause] and once you get comfortable using healthier ingredients it's really crazy how easy it is to take something that you love like a cookie and just make it healthier by swapping out some of these ingredients so this is it's you know becomes a game and once you get comfortable with it it just becomes your new normal okay so we've incorporated the vanilla and the eggs into our sugars and our oil here and it is really really a great consistency and now we are gonna add in our flour so I'm gonna start with the almond flour and I'm just gonna sprinkle about half of it in and then we're gonna go ahead and mix it up there's no real technique to this got to get it all in the bowl [Music] and again as you see it sticking to the sides we can push it down you want to get all that flour mixed in and you can start to smell it alright so I'm gonna push it down and then we are gonna mix in our cooked quinoa now quinoa is so easy to make if you haven't made it before what I did to make this is two cups of water in a saucepan brought it to a boil and then I added 1 cup of quinoa and then brought it back to a boil reduce the heat down all the way to low and then put the put the lid on it and let it go for about 15 minutes and then it's done it's super easy typically in a lot of my recipes when I make quinoa for a savory dish I will use chicken broth it really just gives it more flavor now for cookies I used water because don't necessarily want a savory flavor added all right so now we're just gonna throw in the quinoa to incorporate that into the dough then we are gonna talk about chocolate which is one of my favorite topics ever all right so we want to make sure to get the quinoa fully incorporated into the dough you don't wanna have one cookie with a bunch of quinoa mmm another cookie with not much all right so you can see that this cookie dough looks a lot like your typical cookie dough and that just means that we've gotten all of our portions right for swapping out all the ingredients that's some of the fun of you know when you're when you're playing around with trying to change ingredients from the unhealthy stuff to healthy you're figuring out how much and if you were paying attention you know we had two and a half cups of the bleached flour but we ended up using three cups of the wholesome flours two of them being the almond flour and then one being cooked quinoa so these you know this is a recipe that I've tested out and I figured that okay this is the consistency that works this is the amount of wholesome flour to get it to stick together but you definitely need to play around with it unless you're following a recipe like this and then when you get one where it's like oh my gosh that consistency is just like you know regular cookie dough so that's really satisfying okay so sugar we already talked about how this has 184 grams of sugar in it which is a ton and so if you spent any time making desserts from my blog you know that I like these Lili's dark chocolate chips and the reason why is that it's sweetened with stevia and so there's actually zero grams of sugar in these chocolate chips so we're gonna add the entire bag into our batter and we're adding zero grams of sugar and they taste really good too nice dark chocolate okay so I mix these in and I like how these chocolate chips are kind of small they're petite they're not quite mini but it's it is a really pleasant size for the cookie you could always if you have like a Lily's chocolate bar you can chop that up that's fun to do more of like a chocolate chunk in your cookie you could also if you don't want to purchase the stevia-sweetened chocolate you can take unsweetened chocolate like chocolate bars and then melt it down and add your own stevia or you can add a little bit of coconut sugar and then put it in the freezer chop it up and use that as well so there's a lot of options for you know still having a delicious chocolate presence in the cookie but getting away from using traditional chocolate chip cookies or your traditional chocolate chips that are just full of sugar I did take these to a party this weekend and the cookies were gone quite quickly so I had a lot of people asking me what's the recipe says all right well posted this week and make a little video for you okay so you can see I'm using a tablespoon here as the recipe is written I made the mini so I made them with teaspoons and if you do teaspoons of dough it's gonna make 48 so if we're doing tablespoon it's gonna make less than that 48 divided by 3 so it just depends on what size you're going for this is the size that it will I guess I should spread them a little bit more they will expand a little bit as they're baking but I like to flatten it you don't necessarily have to I did a batch on the weekend where I just left it like a little scoop and it has a little more texture on the top like a little more bumps I kind of like them to look you know real smooth so it just depends on how much you like to play with cookie dough and I like to play with cookie dough so I'm gonna make mine look really pretty yeah so this dough is so soft and so awesome and as far as spacing depending on how big if you're doing you know this tablespoon and I would space it at least an inch or an inch and a half and if you're doing teaspoons of dough you can do it a little bit closer yeah so we def we posted this recipe I think yesterday so if you want to make quinoa cookies real healthy recipes calm and you too can be experiencing this amazing smell that I'm experiencing and have some fun with it you know see if the kids notice that they're different you know see if the family enjoys it and gets on board because you know it's just the more we can incorporate some healthy changes in our diet like it adds up it makes a difference you know if that means taking you know these unhealthy ingredients completely out of your kitchen and replacing them with the more wholesome ones bless you and you know just making that change subtly can add up to a big difference in our diets all right I'm gonna ask some taste testers to come over here and give these cookies a shot we've valentina and Jessie I'm gonna come over so we have our quinoa cookies and then I don't know if you want to taste these or you want to do some side-by-side comparison right so we were snacking it's hard not to they said they're good but what I like about these is you can actually like feel the crunch of the quinoa yeah you know I mean you know like so many different textures yeah it's just so good yeah it's really good and it's so different it's amazing delicious all right well again real healthy recipes calm we posted the recipe you know try it share it with your family you know give it to your kids see if it's something that you can start incorporating into your you know family traditions and just make your life a little bit

easiest dessert so schnapps you can make with the kids the ingredients and super are straightforward and easy to find I'm going to be using one box of cake mix you can get this at any supermarket I'm going to be using the yellow key it makes so you can use it banila you can even use the chocolate make it mix actually as well up to you I'm going to be using some oil eggs and of course the chocolate chips I actually thought that I had picked up the chocolate semi-sweet chocolate chips but probably I picked up some chunks but that's okay so if you have the chocolate chips you can use it I'm going to be using this three and start simple guys you're just going to combine everything I'm damage is going to put it onto our baking tray pop them in the oven to bake for a couple of minutes so I'm just going to add in the oil on the eggs we're gonna whisk everything up and now I'm just going to be added indeed chocolate chips you can add as much chocolate chips as you like to this and remember you can use the chocolate cake mix as well next what you're going to be doing is just simply putting them out onto your baking sheet I'm going to be using this size arm ice cream scoop but you can use a larger one if you want [Music] don't put them too close because when they start baking they're gonna spread out and you want don't want them you know meeting up and form a one huge cookie so I'm gonna pop this into the oven for about 12 minutes about 15 minutes at 350 degrees some chocolate chip cookies are all finished not a peak time will depend on if you are soft cookie lover or a harder cookie lover now husband enjoys soft cookies so I left mine for about 12 minutes and if you like it more on the crispy or solid side you can't leave it for longer so it all depends on how you like your cookies even they're two sizes these are the ones that I did with the larger ice cream scoop and we've got this size with these smaller ice cream scoop so you guys can get an idea if you do want to use the ice cream scoops I'm not sure how they gonna come out this is the comparison right here small ice cream scoop to assess the larger one what you can also do too is when you lay out the cookies you can put some of the chocolate chips just on top in case you enjoy seeing the chocolate chunks I how these are poking out here you can also do that so they will not be all had not even that nice our chocolate chips look in a static reason to the eyes what I want to say on top of your cookies you can do that as well so as always thank you so much for watching guys I hope you all really enjoyed this chocolate chip cookies video game it a trial it's not easy to make with the cake mix the boxes but you can get right in any supermarket pick that pick it up and this is so simple and easy to put

see you all in the next video [Music] you", "MVkTy5ar5AU": "another great recipe t-shirts you guys as always it's going to be simple and quick but most importantly it's going to be delicious I'm going to make some chocolate chip cookies so if you guys want to see how I made this please stick around you're going to need some flour thank you fill it up and then you're going to need some brown sugar some vanilla extract two eggs and themselves you're going to need some margarine or butter so whichever one you have it's all good so in your bowl you want to start off by adding one cup of brown sugar one cup of sugar and then you're going to add one cup of butter and then you just want to cream this all together alrighty guys so once you've finished mixing the brown sugar and the butter together it should look like this next crack in two eggs don't forget to crack at one in time because you have to slowly incorporate this into the mixture into those egg number two so you want to mix it until you don't see any more of the yolk next you want to add a note to tape two teaspoons of vanilla extract I love the smell of it is so so again me I say that all the time but it's very very true and then you want to mix that into your mixture and a separate little Bowl you want to prepare the baking soda mixture which is just one teaspoon of baking soda and two teaspoons of hot water next you want to add in your baking soda mixture that we've mixed or to this mixture here and this is gonna help the cookies rise of it so you want to slowly mix that in together you're going to add in a half a teaspoon of salt again you want to mix this together next I want to add three cups of flour to this mixture and I've already sifted it and this is all-purpose flour I'm going to put one and a half cups of chocolate I've not tablet tips not cookies yet mmm smells so good so you want to slowly mix it like this and incorporate the chocolate chip flour is that batter it all together already so when you finish mixing it it should look like this mmm look good and now we're going to bake them so we don't have a cookie sheet but we do have this pan but it's going to bake the cookies just mine I'm gonna make nice big giant ones so what I like to do is take two spoons and scoop up some dough and just place it you'll want to bake them for apart because they are gonna spring and next we're gonna bake this in the oven and preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and then we're gonna bake this for 10 minutes look at that so pretty before you guys take note of the tiny one let it cool in here for about another minute and after a minute you guys can transfer the cookies onto a cooling rack as always thanks for watching everyone and hope you guys give this recipe a try and I'll talk to you soon bye [Music] [Music]", "NLdumQfUri8": "[Music] so the other day I got a video and it was for a recipe from Hilton Doubletree for their famous cookies and I've had their cookies when I've been at some of their hotels and I thought how cool is that that they're trying to make us feel a little bit like we're on vacation on a business trip and let's try their cookies alright so let's see what this says to do it says to take two sticks of softened butter which I have here [Music] and then I need to put with that sugar and brown sugar and I need 3/4 of a cup and one tablespoon of granulated sugar which is just white sugar so I'm gonna do 3/4 of a cup [Music] my next ingredient is going to be 3/4 of a cup and it says packed brown sugar [Music] to do this for two minutes on medium and so I'm going to start my timer okay and the other thing that I need to do for this recipe is have juice from a fresh lemon so gonna get my cutting board and cut my lemon and leave this here I'm going to use it later but that's not looking great so I'll cut that off and I do have a juicer I'm sure that's going to be more than I need because I only need a quarter of a teaspoon but I have it ready to go okay so this is done for two minutes my next steps are to add eggs vanilla and lemon juice blending on the low speed for 30 seconds so I'm going to add the eggs I only need a quarter of a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice so and I'm sure if you have lemon juice in a jar and that's all you have go with it and one and a quarter teaspoons of vanilla there we go and this recipe says to blend with mixer on low speed for 30 seconds then medium speed for about two minutes until light and fluffy so first I'm going to get my timer ready for my 30 seconds and start so that's gonna be on low for 30 and now it says to do it for two minutes and too light and fluffy alright so that was two minutes with the mixer on a low speed at flour oats baking soda salt so I need two and a quarter cups of flour [Music] what I'm gonna do is put my towel over the top of this too so it doesn't go all over [Music] so that's all the flower get this over here and I need 1/2 cup rolled oats so just so you know I did look it up I don't have rolled oats I have quick oats they said that it would come out a little bit different and then the rolled oats but that's what I've got so I'm using it and putting a half a cup in at the same time a teaspoon baking soda so here's a half a teaspoon since this is clean I'll just do two of these and again I scrape it on the top one [Applause] - I then need a teaspoon of salt I am NOT a salt user but in this instance I'm going to use the salt and just maybe not use as much that's a half a teaspoon [Music] there's maybe 3/4 of a teaspoon as opposed to a full teaspoon and then the last thing I need to do is put a pinch of cinnamon one of the things that says in here is do not over mix so it says to do this for about 45 seconds so I'm gonna do that for about 43 and especially be on a low speed so there you go on a low speed [Applause] so I've done that and it says to scrape it so I'm going to go round and scrape it [Applause] all right my next step is to it says to remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the chocolate chips and walnuts what that means is I'm supposed to do this by hand so I'm going to add the walnuts and the chocolate chips so for this I need 2 and 2/3 cup of chocolate chips [Music] now it's supposed to do this by hand I'll see how this goes guys Wow okay it's pretty easy its soft its fluffy and possibly I might be suggest using a spoon when you do that's like a wooden spoon this is very easy to do wow this looks great as I'm reading through this and now they lies I did not look ahead and see that I'm supposed to put parchment paper on my cookie sheets so here are my cookie sheets and here's parchment paper and it's also saying that you can freeze the unbaked cookies and there's no need to thaw so that's pretty cool you can make this in advance and if you're gonna have friends or family over you can play some frozen cookies on parchment paper and bake them afterwards maybe I'll try that looks on the best face all right so here's parchment paper and it says to portion that there's three tablespoons onto a sheet wow that's a lot these are big cookies so this is Wow [Music] one to three I always wondered how they got their cookies so big now that I'm thinking about it and then you just [Music] about two inches apart so you really can only get two of these on a side so look how huge these are [Music] okay and I will do these four I'm gonna do these four twenty thirty because this oven happens to cook much lower so okay so the timer has gone off for the bottom ones oh and they look perfect Wow look at that yeah all right I'm gonna put them right here and they have to sit here now for an hour Wow look at those they look great [Music] because I know that my ovens do not cook evenly I'm going to take these out and kind of see how the backwoods are cooking a little bit more than the front ones and put them in this oven and actually I'm gonna turn it and see if I can get those to cook evenly and timer just went off and I'll look and see and I think they looks perfect for what we like we like I'm soft it says brown around the edges and so I see that so I'm going to say they're done these cookies are supposed to sit for one hour okay good thing I've never made these when my children were around because you eat right off the pan we're going to set the timer and in an hour I'll let you know how they are so yesterday what I was reading this recipe for cookies it said to try and put them in the freezer and that way you go right from the freezer to the oven so I put these in the freezer so put the cookies in the freezer let them stay overnight and it says just put them right in the oven so I've been preheating to [Music] so the recipe didn't tell me exactly how long to let them cook we're gonna try 20 minutes like the original recipe set and we're gonna cook it for 20 minutes all right these have been in about 23 minutes and so I'm gonna take them out these cookies happen to sit for an hour but what is really cool is that right out of the freezer I was able to take these cookies put them in the oven and you have fresh cookies for life you could make one or two for yourself or have fresh cookies when friends are coming over one other thing I want to tell you a lot to do is when I am making cookies and I'm going to do it for these if I love to plate them on something that I call a pay it forward plate this one happens to be from Dollar Tree and I love to give those to people because that way they get a real plate and they can pay it forward and give cookies to someone else so I'm gonna plate these and I do want to say last night when we made these we did taste them they are fabulous thank you Hilton for sharing your recipe with us enjoy [Music] you", "IJmc8-jI0Z4": "soft and chewy one-minute keynote chocolate-chip cookies is what we're making today one minute just refers to the cook time on these cookies but from start to finish they only take five minutes to make not only are these cookies incredibly easy to make though they're flourless they're completely sugar free and there's portion control built right into the recipe so what I mean by that is that this recipe only makes two keto chocolate-chip cookies so you don't have to worry about making and eating 10 or 15 cookies so if you struggle with portion control like I struggle with portion control this recipe is probably the keto chocolate-chip cookie recipe for you that being said let's jump right into it and I'll show you how to make keto chocolate-chip cookies in just one minute all right so first things first we're gonna get out some coconut oil and add a tablespoon or 15 grams of it to a small bowl then we're gonna microwave that for about 15 seconds just to melt the oil and then we're gonna set that aside now in a medium sized Bowl we're gonna get together the rest of our ingredients for our keto chocolate chip cookies the first ingredient we're gonna add and it's also the base of our keto cookies is blanched almond flour and as a lot of you guys know I like to use this one by kirklands because it only has two net carbs per serving that said we're gonna be adding 1/2 a cup or 56 grams that almond flour to our Bowl and then once we've added that we're gonna sweeten up our low-carb sugar-free chocolate chip cookies by using some confectioners worth if you don't know swarf has zero calories and zero net carbs so it's an awesome keto friendly sweetener and as you're seeing here we're gonna add about 3 tablespoons or 25 grams of it to our bowl when we've taken care of that we're gonna add a pinch of salt and the melted coconut oil from earlier so now at this point we're gonna separate in egg yolk from a large egg and add that to our Bowl along with a 1/2 a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and then the last component to our keto chocolate chip cookies is going to be using some low-carb sugar-free chocolate chips I love these zero net carb chocolate chips from Lily's they are so delicious and it's hard to believe that they don't have any net carbs that's how good they are having said that for today's cookie recipe we're gonna be adding about a half a tablespoon or seven grams of those keto chocolate chips to our bowl so now at this point we've got all of our ingredients added to our bowl we're gonna take out a spatula and give everything a good mix until a crumbly consistency forms in the bowl once that happens we're gonna use our hands to form a ball of chocolate chip cookie dough and then we're gonna separate the dough into two pieces because this recipe makes two keto cookies so now at this point we're gonna coat a dish with baking spray and at the first half of dough to it and we'll want to use our hands to form and shape a chocolate chip cookie out of the dough because the cookie isn't gonna flatten and expand like a normal cookie would when it cooks and then this is totally optional but I like to add just a few more of those keto chocolate chips to the tops of my cookies before I bake him so now at this point we're all set and ready to bake the cookie for the one-minute version of the recipe you want to add the cookie to your microwave off set it to either the left side or the right side and cook it in 225 second intervals by the way my microwave is 1,100 watts so just adjust your cooking time accordingly because all microwaves have different power levels and this can change your cook time I realize though that not everybody has a microwave or likes to use a microwave and the good news is you don't have to have one to make these keto cookies so you can totally bake these in the oven so to do that you'll want to preheat your oven to 325 degrees and once again you want to coat a plate with baking spray and form the shape of a cookie out of the dough then when you've done that you want to coat a ramekin with baking spray and add the low-carb cookie to the Ramkin as far as bake time goes you'll want to bake the cookie for around 15 to 20 minutes or until the table just starts to turn golden brown regardless of how you cook them them they will need time to set about 15 to 20 minutes so take a shower clean the house go for a walk or just find something to do to let them do that anyways when they're completely cooled down check this out they're incredibly soft and chewy and incredibly delicious and as always for more from about today's the low-carb Aikido cookie recipe check out the video description below and I hope you enjoy them", "7VyNun4IZdY": "hi I'm Stephanie give go a king calm today we're going to make chocolate chip refrigerator cookies and this is what they look like you can see their beautiful golden brown color wonderfully crisp edges of course the flavor is buttery sweet and then we're loading them with chocolate chips and some chopped nuts so um if you have a stand mixer like I do just use the paddle attachment or you know you could use a hand mixer or really you could just use a large bowl with a wooden spoon the first thing you need is three-quarters of a cup which is 170 grams butter my personal preference is unsalted I prefer the flavor but you could use salted and if you do then just leave out the salt in the recipe and of course you want your butter at room temperature so just put that in there and then I'm just going to beat it just to soften it and get it nice and smooth so just you know maybe 30 seconds and as always when making any batter scraped the bottom and the sides of your mixing bowl as often as you need to make sure all your ingredients are mixed together and not stuck on the bottom which they tend to do and next chocolate chip cookies typically have a combination of both brown sugar and white sugar today we're going to use 2/3 of a cup of firmly packed light brown sugar that would be a hundred and forty grams and you know sometimes you might want to just go through your brown sugar sometimes there's little hard lumps you want to remove those and then we're going to do something a little different here from my other chocolate-chip cookie recipes we're going to add some powdered sugar or you may know that as confectioner sugar or icing sugar we're going to add 3/4 of a cup which is 90 grams and then I'm just going to mix this together on medium speed just to get a little bit of air into our batter so what we're doing is just basically mixing all the ingredients together like so it's nice and smooth and then just to get a little bit of air into that mixture so next you will need one large egg that would be about 55 grams with out of the shell and then have your egg at room temperature and then for flavoring I like to add one and a half teaspoons which is six grams of pure vanilla extract it's kind of a classic thing you add to chocolate chip cookies if you didn't want at the vanilla flavor you know you don't absolutely need it so I'm just going to mix that in hmm pretty simple so now for our dry ingredients I have in a separate bowl 2 cups 260 grams of an all-purpose flour you may know that is playing flour and to that I'm going to add just a quarter of a teaspoon one gram of salt like I said use salted butter you could just leave out that salt and then I'm adding 1 teaspoon 5 grams of baking soda you know that's baking sodas for Lebanon which when you have an acidic ingredient like the brown sugar that's why we use baking soda but the other reason for baking soda I'm just going to whisk these together the other reason for baking soda is it helps give us a crisp cookie those nice edges baking soda actually helps with that so mix that in you want to make sure that baking soda is really mixed in because if it's not you get clumps it's a little bitter we don't want so I'm just going to add our flour and slowly mix that in have it on low speed you don't have that flour coming up in your face so I have that about half way mixed in so now what I'm going to do scrape this all down and then we'll add our final two ingredient so you will need one and a half cups which is 250 grams of your favorite chocolate chips now you can use semi-sweet bittersweet you could use milk you could use white you could actually use like a combination of chocolate chips if you want and I'm adding some chopped nuts I think that really adds you can if you want leave the nuts out and maybe if you want add a little more chocolate chips so uh you could use I'm actually using pecans today you need 1 cup which is 110 grams of chopped pecans you could use walnuts you could use hazelnuts you could use almonds I've even used macadamia nuts or you could kind of have a combination I like if you're you know using like pecans walnuts hazelnuts almonds I do like to toast them first you don't absolutely have to but toasting your nuts does bring out their full flavors so just put them in a 350 degree oven that's 180 degrees for about you know 6 8 minutes just until they just start to brown and you smell them let them cool and then you know fine I'd like to chop them fairly finely because we are making a refrigerator cookie so now I'm just going to beat this on low speed just until everything's all mixed together and that is our dough pretty simple like I said you could make this by hand and you get your arm will get a bit of a workout but that's not a bad thing so now as I said this is a refrigerator cookie so what we're going to do is form this batter into two locks and what is so great about this is you don't have to bake off all the cookies at once so now you can you know divide the batter just kind of eyeball it I like to wait I like to be a little more exact I know like each log the same size so I'm it could I've done this I've made them before so I know it's about five hundred and thirty five grams per log smoke right so yeah do is just take well let's put that right in there just take a piece of plastic wrap and then so we're going to form about an eighth inch long it's 20 centimeters so just kind of put it there now my dough my kitchen is quite warm today so my dough is soft if you have that problem just form it as best as you can and then what you can do is put it into the fridge you know let it sit a half-hour and then you could bring it back out and really get a really nice shape if you find your dough is too soft which can happen so eight inches if you you know get the ruler it's a boat ring almost and then that's about two and a half inches wide just what 7 1/2 centimeters so just you know level the top pretty easy to do so really this is like a slice and bake what we're going to do now is just wrap this up put it into the refrigerator and then we want to chill it till it gets really firm I find you know probably 4 to 6 hours or overnight and then what you can do is you can leave this this dough in the refrigerator probably 4 or 5 days and then you know the kids want just a few cookies just slice off a few and then you bake them or what you could do is once this is it chilled you could put it into the freezer for like a couple months and then when you kind of want to do some chocolate chip cookies just take out this defrost it in the refrigerator and then again you have that slice and bake so I would say probably like I said for six hours and when we come back we will bake some off so now we're ready to bake off our chocolate chip refrigerator cookies so about 15 minutes before you want to put them in the oven pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit which is 165 degrees Celsius and then you need a baking sheet I've lined mine with parchment paper but you could just either lightly butter your baking sheet or even spray it with one of those nonstick sprays and then we want to cut our cookies I like to make cut them into a half inch which SPO 1/2 quarter centimeter thick slices so sharp knife I use a ruler and then I just take my ruler and I just kind of mark it off so I have little marks so I can make them all the same size because you want them all the same size because you don't want one cookie to be done like two minutes before another one because they're different thicknesses so that's why I think it's a good idea to use your kitchen ruler and then just take your knife and just straight try to do it straight down now if you find because we have so many chocolate chips and so many nuts in our batter you know it might crumble a bit but don't worry just kind of I just kind of put roll back together who's going to know and then just put it space them equal you know evenly on your baking sheet just another point sometimes you know when you're forming your dough your the end is not quite you know straight even so what you can do is just trim up your edges before you start marking off so you get like really nice shaped cookies so that's what you do and then if like I'm the only baking what twelve so I'm just going to wrap this dough up and put it back into my fridge or like I said you could put it in your freezer but as you saw it's really nice and firm now I can get a real nice cut so baking ah you know chocolate chip cookies is one of those cookies some people like there's really like crispy edges and crisp all the way through some people like crisp edges but really soft in the center some people like them almost to the point of being like you'd say oh that's a little under baked and so you know your baking time how you you personally like them you might want to you know vary your baking time for like as you can see these cookies fair you know golden brown fairly crisp you know they're a little soft in the center but they're crisp around the edges so I'm baking them about 14 minutes so kind of use that as a guide of course everybody's having you know bakes a little differently so you know you might want to check them at like the eleven twelve minutes just to kind of see whether they're the the way you want and I do about seven minutes in I do rotate my pan front to back so I'm going to do the book fourteen minutes okay so our chocolate chip refrigerator cookies are now done so I put the pan on a wire rack as you can see nice golden brown edges and I bake them so that the center is going to be a little soft so I'm just going to let them cool maybe a minute in the pan and then I'm just going to use a little spatula to transfer them to the wire rack to finish cooling and when we come back we will try one so let's try one now these are still like a little warm because I don't know about you but that to me is when they're at their best they're great I doesn't like a chocolate-chip cookie nice crisp edges that they're soft in the center and then you have yeah nice chocolate chip and the nuts such a crazy cookie so I think they're at their best like the day they're made but you can still cover and store them for a couple days so try them and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of Joey baking calm you", "Ux4U2GWMBsE": "hi guys welcome back to my channel and in this video I'm going to be showing you guys how to make matcha or green tea chocolate chip cookies so to get these cookies started we are going to begin by sifting together two cups of flour with one tablespoon of matcha powder 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and also 1/2 teaspoon of salt and we're going to sift that all together into a bowl now set that bowl full of dry ingredients aside and we are going to move on to our butter and sugar so we are first going to clean together our melted butter brown sugar and white sugar [Music] when the mixture is smooth and kind of has a consistency like molasses you can go ahead and fold in vanilla and egg yolk and a whole egg with a spatula we're folding it with a spatula because we don't want to over mix it by using the electric mixer [Music] eventually once your mixture is thoroughly combined you can move it back on to the stand mixer and gradually add in your dry ingredients as you add in more of the dry ingredients you'll start to see that the color will change from a brown color to more of a dark subtle green color when the dough begins peeling away from the sides of the bowl go ahead and stop mixing immediately and then you can fold in one and a half cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips with a spatula if you like your cookies to be super chocolaty then you can even add in more than one and a half cups if you're feeling like it when you have the dough to your liking with the correct amount of chocolate chips go ahead and scoop about one tablespoon of dough roll it into a ball and then set it onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper here's a little trick that I do in order to make my cookies look really chocolaty and really nice on the top I add in a few chocolate chips to the top of each ball of dough just to make it look really pretty when it comes out of the oven you're going to want to bake these cookies at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately 10 minutes then pop the cookies onto a wire rack while they're cooling down [Music] you can enjoy your cookies while they're still warm and oozing out chocolate or you can enjoy them once they've

the chocolate chip cookie from the emotional D demo get started with this chocolate chip cookie we're going to first start by drawing a big circle so the nice thing about this circle is that it doesn't need to be a perfect circle that you shouldn't be a perfect circle just make it somewhat oval ish I kind of like my chocolate chip cookies nice and fat so I'm just going to make it a little bit wider on the side so don't worry just have fun with the shape so as a kind of looks circular was good I'm just going to keep going and off my cookie nice to not have to draw a perfect circle right so there I got my cookie shape in and then now let's bring it to life so right in the center I'm just going to draw to fit your eyes so but right here in the center you drive one circle from atrocity I just come over here about right here and draw another one and they can prosecute I so two small circles inside and a curved line at the bottom and shade in the top I'm definitely looking forward to watching this emoji movie hope you guys are too because the character there are so cute and this is going to be my first one of course there's many more characters coming from the emoji movie I'll be drawing so hopefully I will be drawing the ones that you guys love so start off with this cute cookie first and then there's going to be the ice cream math course the hand and many more so if you love this dry please stay tuned for more okay so I got my eyes in and lines at the bottom there okay now I'm going to give some up right here just give it curve with the eyebrows and we come into ticking a

well as you want so just going to come here and you don't necessarily want to draw a perfect rectangle in terms of right here you don't necessary want it to be very sharp so you just kind of go on the on the corners right here you can just kind of round it off a tiny bit and these still has an are sharper than maybe some of them is so slightly rounded off something like that so I'm just going to go ahead some bigger smaller clothes here looks like a big one right here notice my corners are kind of different on each one a small little one right here and big one right here this is chocolate chips

"kfWXeyriteA": "i absolutely can't handle how stunning these are today we are going to be making espresso chocolate chunk cookies now these are my go-to sweater weather cookies because i think there is something so heartwarming about mixing espresso and chocolate together now the thing about this recipe that you have to know is that we use one shot of freshly brewed espresso now i don't know about you but i feel like most of the time these types of baked goods that have coffee or espresso flavor use instant espresso or the instant grounds that you mix into the recipe and this uses freshly brewed espresso so we have two cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon and a half of baking soda and the kosher salt i use as few tools in the kitchen as possible when i am cooking um because i love cooking but i hate hate cleaning so if i am using the electric whisk i like to take it off and just mix anything that needs a quick mix with that that is one less thing that gets dirty so dry ingredients off to the side okay next step we are creaming the butter and the sugar so we have softened butter it's 12 tablespoons total and we cream it with an electric mixer with both sugars so we have a cup of packed brown sugar light brown sugar and we have a half a cup of granulated sugar and we are going to mix this together next up we add our shot of freshly brewed espresso so it's just one shot we have one egg and everybody's favorite smell and taste a teaspoon of vanilla we're gonna mix this until combined and we're gonna start to incorporate our dry ingredients a little bit at a time this is a super super fluffy dough which i love you can absolutely smell the espresso at this point already and then in go my prized possession dark chocolate chunks instead of chips i prefer the look so we're gonna mix this in we have um we don't want to over mix just fold in the chips it already looks good to me so we're gonna let this sit in the fridge for about a half an hour and then we are going to use an ice cream scoop and put this on a tray and right into a 350 degree oven okay i want to try it i want to try it it smells like coffee so let me break down the cooking for you super soft it's generally chewy when i make this recipe so i hope it is today too but look it's like malleable watch do you see that without cracking the espresso is the perfect amount the perfect amount i know i joked that i want like three shots in my batter but it is there's a note there you taste the coffee you taste the chocolate you taste the salt it is absolutely beyond let me know if you make these cookies this season [Laughter] you can go i'm gonna finish my cookie now [Music] you", "_RM1NsgRfzA": "today we're gonna make chocolate chip cookies this is a really easy recipe we need 1 cup of

cup of regular sugar and also 2 cups of all-purpose flour let's get started what we're gonna do is we're going to take our softened butter we're also going to throw in the white sugar and the brown sugar we want to cream this up now what we're gonna do is we're gonna break two eggs and we're gonna add that in with the vanilla what I always like to do just break the egg one at a time into a bowl so there's the first egg just so that you make sure that you don't get any shells if you're doing an omelet and you've got eight or ten eggs and you get a shell in there it's a little harder to get out there we go there's the second egg and we'll throw in the vanilla and we'll get that going again that looks good take another bowl and take your 2 cups of flour and take your salt and your baking soda and put that in there then you can just give it a little stir with a spoon and then what we're going to do is we're going to slowly incorporate this into the batter [Music] no laughing a little bit I'm gonna let another bit the only thing we have left to do is to add in the chocolate chips so I'm just gonna pour them all in and hopefully my little mixer will be strong enough your mixer at this point if your mixer is not strong enough you can just simply get a spatula and fold this stuff in at this point that's it for the dough so I'm gonna clean up my work area and I'll come back and we'll bake some cookies all right I'm back and what we're gonna do now is we're going to just grab some of the dough make any size you want I usually go something like that a good tablespoon just take your other spoon and just push it off you can make them small bake different sizes if you want but if you're gonna do it different sizes you're better off to bake them on a different sheet because if you make a larger cookie it's gonna have a different baking time so if you've got small ones and large ones on the same pan the smaller ones are gonna you know they're gonna do faster than the other ones so I'll continue doing this and I'll be back what we're gonna do is we're gonna bake them at 375 for about 10 minutes depending on your oven just keep an eye on them they might be done in 11 minutes they could be done in nine minutes so 375 degrees Fahrenheit new rules look good so let's get these onto a cooling rack and we'll be back [Music] pull these look good when they smell really good you", "2qGX30sTrvs": "let's make the better cookies let's make the other cookies and better cookies now when you're looking at this right this looks very similar to what was over here sugar brown sugar eggs vanilla out of the same ingredient a lot of you what's the difference ratio gotcha all about the ratio and so with these cookies here when you taste them you remember how we went like this were like oh man there's this okay what that is is that's the ratio of flour to butter the thin and crispy cookies are basically pure butter that's just held together with flour and just as much as you need that's it I'm drooling yeah so do the same thing so it's less flour less flour TIPA right you get you're just getting more butter oh and that's not plugged in at all it is plugged in hmm there we go it wasn't turned on I'm down with that man that's fine much less flour I'm about about our same amount of butter and sugar delicious delicious right it's just enough to hold it yup same thing what the chip they love squished here show me yeah this is what you do oops oh my god I feel good these are the thin and Krispies right so what you do is can you give me that with a bowl of

want that completely mixed i'm adding it all in there the flour okay i spilled some it's all good and then we're going to sift it real good honestly if you don't have a sifter just grab a whisk and mix all those ingredients together and that works perfectly fine too and my kids are home so if you guys hear a noise you guys know online school for the year so now let's go ahead and mix the melted butter in a large bowl because we're combining all the ingredients into this large bowl that is melted butter some of it is soft and it's all good and then we're going to add that brown sugar like

little more fold that in oh that's jakey i guess he's really excited about these cookies we just want it to be folded in so that every bite has a chocolate chip in it you know what i mean so after

house right now during these times but if you're feeling like a chocolate chocolate chip cookie but you don't want to bake a dozen this is great so let's go off camera let me just continue rolling

bye hi friends hey everyone thank you why are you so fast like why do you say it like that is so fast it can't be zen like like they hear you saying hello", "GPFcMBs6JVw": "yes i made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies with no butter and no eggs either and they're just like classic soft and chewy with just the right amount of chocolate chips and with this healthier recipe i removed some calories and kept everything you love about the good old cookies [Music] ditch the boxes homemade cookies is the way to go in fact making your own cookies could be easier than trying to find ones with no crazy ingredients in your grocery store this cleaner alternative to chocolate chip cookies isn't loaded with sugar butter and flour and these are great way to satisfy sweet food without unhealthy ingredients and too many calories and i believe these cookies are a great transition from highly processed foods to wholesome recipes they're so easy to put together so you start by combining all the dry ingredients in a large bowl this recipe calls for rolled oats which result in a two-year cookie quick cooking oats work but they won't get the same texture to make it hold better i'm using some ground oats too which is just a homemade version of more expensive oat flour also you're going to need some baking powder a good dash of ground cinnamon and pinch of salt to enhance taste i like to mix my ingredients separately just to make sure they're evenly distributed now it's time to make a sticky base which is basically made of two ingredients applesauce which i use in place of butter and it works so great in this recipe and sweeteners such as honey maple syrup or agave then pour over the wet ingredients mix stir press to the back of your spoon until the sticky mixture is formed no hand mixer needed next chocolate chips goes in and dark chocolate chips provide more intense chocolate flavor anyway don't overload your cookies with chocolate or you lose the other flavors instead go for mini chocolate chips that will ensure your cookies have a little bit of chocolate in every bite then chill your cookie dough in the fridge for half an hour to make it easier to handle and the oats will absorb the moisture making the cookie dough more firm also you can make this cookie dough ahead of time roll it into bowls and freeze to be baked later line your cookie sheet with parchment paper and start scooping the cookie dough small ice cream scoop will make it easier to have your cookies the same size but you can scoop out the dough using a quarter cup measure or even a food scale which will help your cookies to bake evenly place the cookie balls on a baking sheet leaving about two inches between each these cookies won't change shape while baking so using your hand or a bottom of a glass press them down to about half inch thick and here you have two options first one is just to flatten the cookies leaving the edges exposed which will make your cookies brown more on the bottom and size or you can seal the edges and make a nice round shape so your cookies will bake up extra soft and tender if these calorie numbers are still too high for you you can reduce the amount of chocolate chips to a third cup or even quarter cup for this recipe with these changes you'll be able to lower the calorie count up to 100 calories per cookie without sacrificing the cookie experience a lot now bake your cookies for 12 to 14 minutes until baked on the bottom and still slightly under done on the top because there's no butter inside you don't want to over bake your cookies because applesauce makes them moist but you bake too much they tend to be dry losing that chewy texture anyway the cookies will be a bit soft and finished but they will continue to cook while cooling down let them rest on a baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely this will help them from falling apart as you can see these cookies are firm and chewy and there are lots of small chocolate pockets and i will make a bold statement and say that this oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are not just holiday cookies they're all year round cookies chocolate chip cookies and a big glass of cold milk that's all you need to make your breakfast time the best time of the day so if you want to enjoy your dessert and keep your calorie count in check i highly recommend you make these zucchini brownies these healthier brownies are super moist and delicious and you'll never know there's veggies in check out that recipe now thank you so much for watching see you in another video stay healthy stay happy", "hTTEJvLn-1g": "today we're going to be making something really really fun and this is my chocolate-chip cookie cake and here are the ingredients that we need one and a half cups of all-purpose flour one cup of chocolate chips and I'm using semi-sweet chocolate chips but you can use any type of chocolate chip that you like a half a cup of salted butter one cup of brown sugar one teaspoon of baking powder one teaspoon of vanilla extract and our last ingredient one egg so those are the ingredients so let's get started into our large bowl I'm going to put in all of our butter and my butter is at room temperature so it's very soft I'm gonna grab my mixer and I want to start mixing this around just breaking this up then we'll add in our sugar to that I'm going to get in all of our brown sugar get all of that right in there and I'm going to take my fork and I just want to help my mixer out I'm just going to break all of this down just makes it a little easier for a mixer if there's any little clumps just get them in there get your fork in there just break them all down that looks pretty good grab my mixer again we'll start creaming this together so that's really important and you really want to do this all the time when you start off a recipe you want to get your sugar and your fat and you want to get this really well creamed just keep going at this until it all starts coming together that looks pretty good and then I'm going to grab my a and get that in there and that's going to help with the creaming process is it's going to start loosening everything up and giving it a little bit of moisture that always helps I'm gonna get my mixer going a little bit faster and I do want to get this really well combined before you move on to our next step that looks good I'll get in all of my vanilla mix that in and that's perfect and now we're going to sift in our dry ingredients to that we'll get in all of our flour on our little bit of baking powder and I'm just going to start sifting that in perfect I'm gonna grab my mixer speed number one I don't want a dust cloud we'll just start slowly mixing all of this in and I said this before but I'll say it again if you ever find that your cookie dough is a little bit on the dry side you can always add a little bit of water so you can add in about 15 milliliters which is about one tablespoon of water and that will just bring it all to life and add a lot of moisture to your dough which will make it a lot easier to work with that's always an optional step and that's good and then our last ingredient all of our chocolate chips just get all those in there grab our mixer one last time and just mix these in a little bit just so that they all get covered with that dough and that's it for the recipe onto our next step I have a baking pan here this is 9 inches in diameter by 2 inches high I have sprayed it with a little bit of cooking spray I've cut out a little piece of parchment paper and that just holds the parchment paper in place while we get our cookie batter in there so just get it around and now we're ready to fill it grab our really nice cookie batter and get that great in there always use a spatula and make sure you get everything out of your Bowl okay that's good I'll just show you a little trick just get yourself a little bit of water put your spatula into the water and what that does is it prevents it from sticking to your spatula and just makes it a lot easier to spread out so I'm just going to keep flattening this out I'll come back in a second I just want to make sure I get it all nicely flat and I think that looks pretty good now after we bring this out of the oven what we're going to want to do is we're going to score this so I have my little bench scraper ready to go so as soon as this comes out we're just going to score it into our little slices so now I'm going to pop this into my 375 degree oven until it's nicely baked and then I'll come back so here we have it exactly 14 minutes in the oven 375 degrees Fahrenheit this is extremely hot and that's what I want I'm going to grab my little cutter and I'm just going to go right through I just want to make sure that it's cut and I'm just washing off my blade between cuts I'm just going to go down in because once this hardens up it's going to be extremely hard to cut so clean off my blade again one more time clean your blade in our last little cut right here all the way down and that's perfect and at this point now we have to let this completely cool so that's what we're going to do I'll let this cool down and then I'll come back in a little while and I'm going to show you the final product now that our cookie has cooled right down I'm just going to grab another little cooling rack put it on top and flip it over and there we have it because of that parchment paper that we put in there the cookie just comes right out and then to flip it back over one more flip and again well there we have it then I'm just going to grab a serrated knife I'm just going to go over my cuts again there we have it let's pull these apart look at that oh this smells really really good and I know you want me to zoom in so that's what I'm going to do next so I've just zoomed in and I guess I'll give this a little bit of a spin just so you can see this now I did these for 14 minutes if you want these a little bit more crispy you're gonna go about 16 minutes you might even want to do 17 minutes right now these are very very fudgy you can see how nice these are look at this I mean it really is like a cake and children really really enjoy these these are you know just a fun thing to do look at that I'll just show you how this look at this oh wow mmm that just melts in your mouth really really good look at that Oh amazing mmm I have to stop the camera just for a couple of seconds because I was really enjoying that really really fudgy and delicious so like I said I did these at 375 degrees Fahrenheit 14 minutes if you want them a little bit more crispy just add about 2 or 3 minutes and they'll be a little bit more firm so that's it for this really fast video a really really fun one I hope you try these out that's it for today if you enjoyed my video please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really really do appreciate that that's it and I'll see you next time you", "DVojTEHkfSw": "hey guys it's Danny and today I am sharing a seriously delicious chocolate chip cookie brownie bar with you now these bars are vegan paleo and grain free and yet they taste exactly like in doing buttery chocolate chip cookie except we're gonna cook them in a pan and then cut them into a bar stove so I have a feeling that you guys are really gonna enjoy this recipe and as a matter of fact if you do do me a favor and make sure to give this video a big thumbs up and come down to the comments below and let me know so I can continue to make the content that you most want to see now the great thing about this recipe is that it's dump and stir so it's easy peasy lemon squeezy so if there's any part of you that thinks you don't know how to bake I absolutely guarantee you that you can make this recipe so to get started I've got my oven preheating at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and I also have an 8x8 baking dish that I'm just gonna spray down with some cooking spray you could also coat the pan with some butter or coconut oil whatever you use just make sure that you do grease the pan because we don't want the bars to stick the next thing I need to do is make my chi egg now if you're not familiar with a Chia egg it's basically just a vegan substitution for a traditional egg that works so brilliantly in recipes just like this one all you need to do is take 1 tablespoon of ground-up chia seeds and do note that chia seeds don't usually come ground up so you just want to pop them into a coffee grinder and give them a quick whirl to get them broken down so take 1 tablespoon of that ground-up chia seed and mix it with 3 tablespoons of water just gently mix it together and then let it sit for about 5 minutes and what you're gonna see is that the chia seeds absorb the water and the whole thing gels up a bit and it gets this consistency that's just like an egg and this is gonna help to bind the bars together and of course if you do eat eggs and you can certainly sell an egg here as well either one work so just do what works for you okay so to make the bars I've got a nice big bowl and I'm gonna start with one cup of cashew butter now personally I love using cashew butter because to me cashew butter tastes exactly like cookie I don't know that's the way it tastes to my tastebuds but it is a little bit spendy so do know that you can really use any nut or seed butter that you have on hand or that you prefer then to that I'm adding in the Chia a 1/2 a cup of maple syrup to sweeten you want to make sure to get the real deal there 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt and then 2 tablespoons of coconut flour which is also going to help to hold the bars together gently mix that all together until you have a nice thick cookie dough consistency just like this I mean it really does look like cookie dough and then I'm adding in 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips now do note if you want to keep this recipe 100% vegan you have to make sure that you get a dairy-free chocolate chip as well so I will be sure to link down to one of my favorites down in the description box below gently stir those chips in until they're evenly distributed through out your batter and we're gonna transfer this into my greased baking dish so just get all of the dough in there and then you just want to go back down and smooth it out so it's nice and even over the top because the dough is a little sticky a great trick is to either wet your hands or to wet a spatula this way it doesn't stick and then just Pat the top and so you've got it nice and even out looking good okay then we're just gonna pop this into our 350 degree oven and let it cook for 30 minutes or until the bars are set up and the top is a golden brown now as you guys know I am NOT for restriction or deprivation when it comes to eating well but I do like having fun playing with kind of leveling up the quality of the ingredients that I'm working with so I love that we can take something as traditional as a chocolate chip cookie bar and then fill in real whole nourishing ingredients no process flowers no processed sugars and still get an insanely delicious end result so good now truly the hardest part of this recipe is it really works best if you let them cool completely before you cut into them and then once they are ready to cut I like to cut them into 9 squares and then if I think we're gonna eat them in a day or two which is not that hard to do when you've got a family of four I'll leave them on the counter or on the stove and I'll just cover them with a dish towel but if you want them to go the long haul then what I would do is just transfer them into an airtight container and they will happily last in your fridge for up to a week gooey buttery chocolate chip cookie deliciousness stokin I'm telling you you guys are gonna love this recipe it is so good and while they would obviously be delicious any day of the week they're great for lunchboxes they also work really well if you bring them along to a cookout or for a picnic so make sure that you keep this recipe in your back pocket and my dear friend if you

been at the hospital um at this hospital two years oh great and you're working the emergency room yep registered nurse in the emergency room chocolate chips walnuts now i like these folks don't go kick in the mixer on 10. you know have a hot all right so we'll mix those in slowly that gives us our cookie batter then boy would maybe break in the machine here that's a good sign though because it's full of goodies i've burned plenty of these up i'm good for six a year oh yeah is it 350 degrees yes for about 12 minutes about 12 minutes we use a scoop like these to scoop out the cookie dough

like renee's mocha chocolate chip cookies", "0TG5FMBoy6s": "today I'm gonna be making something really yummy and these are chocolate chip cookies so let's get on with the ingredients one and two thirds of a cup of all-purpose flour 1/2 a cup of regular white sugar 1/2 a cup of packed brown sugar 2 teaspoons of vanilla 1 egg 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter and a quarter cup of shortening and our last ingredient one cup of chocolate chips so those are the ingredients so let's get started all right so the first thing I've done is I've taken my butter and my little bit of shortening and I've just popped it in my bowl here and we'll just get that going just mix it all up and I'm gonna combine my sugar my white sugar and also my brown sugar and then I'm just going to break this up a little bit just to help the mixer get moving here okay so our first step is just to really combine this really really well alright I've been mixing for a few minutes and you can see that everything is you know pretty well combined so that's what I want now I'm gonna add in my egg and that will help out even more it's gonna get everything really loosened up and I can also add in my vanilla I'll just pour that in there we go [Applause] and at this point I will add in all of my salt there we go and my baking soda there we go you can add your baking soda to your flour if you wish and mix everything in at the same time but I'm doing it like this today okay at this point this is nicely mixed now what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna start slowly adding in my flour go ahead a little bit more it's nice to mix your flower in in a little bit little batches so that you don't get any lumps just better to do it this way then we go a lot a little bit more down our last little bit so I just want to work really well combine this before I add in our chocolate chips okay that's good and now I'm just gonna dump all the chips in you can fold them in if you wish with a spatula this is easy so just mix it up until you think they're all well combined and there we go everything is perfect now and now we're ready to get them onto our pan I have my oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit by the way so I'm just gonna go grab my ice cream scoop and I'll be back in a second so I have a small ice cream scoop here and what's nice about this is that you always get a cookie of even size and so what I'm gonna do here and if you see that you can't get your doesn't come out sometimes what you can do is just grab a spoon and just help it come out there we go there's one and our last one so these are ready for the oven so what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna pop them in 375 degree oven I'm gonna put these in 8 to 10 minutes I'll tell you how long I bake them and I'll see in a little while all right these just came out of the oven ooh that's hot um eight minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit so if you want your cookies to be a little bit larger in diameter what you can do is just take a fork and just press each little ball down so that they will expand a little bit more but I like these ones here they're not as wide but they're thicker all right my last batch has come out so this is batch number three and just get these on here you can see how really really nice these cookies are and it makes quite a few I'll count exactly how many I made I'll just get them all on here 829 31 32 33 lovely cookies so I really hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give me a thumbs up that's it for this video so I'll see you next time mmm look at that mmm YUM well I did come very very good and please subscribe to my bake like a pro YouTube channel and also click that notification Bell to be alerted every time I upload a brand new video you", "mTXfpQs7kz0": "these chocolate chip cookies is my favorite suite at the moment I can't stop making and eating them that so more edge Joey director and they're really really easy to make so you start by just mixing together coconut sugar and coconut oil and then once that's combined we add ground oats buckwheat flour and brown rice flour and then a little pinch of baking soda you should have some rice a pinch of salt to bring out all the flavors a little drop of water and then the other thing is obviously our chocolate chips and so I don't know sign is easier to buy dark chocolate and then just crumble it up in the food processor to make chunks but otherwise you can just buy chocolate chips which is really easy as well and then once you've got all your mix together and it feels such a great cookie mate you just want to roll into little balls and flatten it down with your hands and then you bake it for about 10 to 12 minutes in the oven and you let them rest when they come out and they'll just finish setting those last couple of minutes and then just eat them all while they're warm and then have them [Music] you", "9hnPTEs9g54": ":'( Guys I had a super scary nightmare last night, I was still horrified after waking up. Scariest thing I've ever seen I was back in school and the teacher made me suffer with the math questions and balancing chemical equations :'( I don't even want to think about that horrible thing, let alone having a super realistic dream about it :)) I was sweating bullets when I woke up as well :))) I wonder if you guys have had terrible nightmares like these :)) It feels super awful :) First I'll whisk 120g of room temp butter, you can use both unsalted or salted butter here Next is 50g of granulated sugar And 60g of dark brown sugar. You can use light brown sugar here Continue to whisk your life away :) You only need to whisk it until it reaches this color, sugar can't dissolve in butter you dummy :))) After that throw in that vanilla juice- I meant extract :)) Aand here comes the premature chicken :)) Continue whisking until the mixture turns a light brown color Then take out your trusty flour in the quantity of 150g in a ADORABLE CAT BOWL ONLY to put it into the butter mixture :))) Oh and flour's clingy friend, 1/2 tsp of baking soda :)) Remember to sieve it to get rid of the clumps *sighs* cue the MHA music for me to get this workout :)) Cookies aren't hard to make, they're just very laborious work :)) The first time I tried these recipes from other countries, oh GOD it was SO sweet I had to tried a few more times until it doesn't murder my tastebuds anymore I did put in chocolate in the cookies so the sugar has been greatly reduced to a tolerable level :)) It's now really tasty so you don't need to make any changes Before I knew how to bake, I really did not like cookies that much. They're so dry and bland and has the personality of flour :)) But then the gods gave me the abilty to bake.. The butter cookies and chocolate chip cookies changed my mind :)) If you don't believe me, first how dare you :) and second, try making and eating it and you'll be a different man :))) When the dough is smooth and well-mixed, break 50g of chocolate's bones into pieces about 0,5 cm big and put it into the bowl :)) It doesn't need to be exactly that size but don't leave it in big chunks or the cremation won't be successful :( And alast, our favourite ingredient enters the room, chocolate chips :)) It's fully chocolate chips, no raisins involved :)) You can use only choco chips or choco bars, it's fine But the defining ingredient for the tastiness in these cookies are the chocolate so don't be cheap and buy the good ones :)) Use a spatula and stir it up, be quick and confident, unlike your usual self, hard, I know :( After that, use an ice cream scooper to scoop the exact amount of dough for each cookies on the baking tray. I infiltrated an ice cream truck for this :)) So if you don't have it, you can use a spoon which is a huge pain in the neck and if it's being stubborn, you have to put it in the fridge for 30min for the dough to set and then wear your gloves to roll up your cookie balls until you're satisfied because the dough becomes soft and flexible when it's cold It's just like Playdoll so don't worry about your puny noodle arms :)) Also please don't eat the raw dough even if you did eat your Playdoll when you were a child When your delicious dough is sitting on the baking tray, you can be like me and add in that extra dramtic flair by sticking small chocolate chips on top so it looks tasty when done BRING OUT THE FIREE >:D Cremate your cookie doughs at 190\u00b0C for 12-15min, depending on your oven It's time for the relaxing bit :)) Watching cakes and cookies rises in the oven creates pure happiness :)) It's just like your crush just smiled at you :))) After the cremation, put their fully cooked corpses on the cooling rack. Now now, don't be greedy or your gum's gonna burn off :)) Don't mind my hands, PussyCat was just being crazy and couldn't tell if I was tryna pet him or kill him :))) I was lying on my bed scrolling through my feed and PussyCat was literally so happy hopping around like he just won the lottery :)) People do say that we should be happy. But he was in total euphoria and jumped onto my beautiful hands :)) There was blood everywhere and now it still has not healed :)) This is what you get for having cats :))) These cookies are crunchy on the outside and super chewy on the inside. if you prefer crunchier cookies, make the cookies flatter and bake it at lower temp for less time The crust is super cronchy, and the chocolate flavour is just attacking your taste buds :)) That's on me putting a lot of chocolate and it's totally worth it :))) The insides are chewy and moist, so you'll never feel sick when you eat too much :D Give yourself a cup of milk or milk tea since both are a great fit You almost killed me so I'm just gonna let you sniff it :) (please do not let your pets eat chocolate, this is just a joke) Look at that, the scar's so long :)) And now look at the culprit. He looked like he snorted 7 lines or something and started jumping and then scratched my arm :)) You guys thought he's super well-behaved or something because he's acting so adorably :)) But what you don't know is that the moment he wakes up is the moment where my day is doomed :))) Cut my arm like it was nothing :)) I'm just saying that to complain but I hug and kiss him like every single day :))) If you have a single bit of sympathy for my poor life with this Satan spawn, share this video!

below enjoy today we are making a ridiculously naughty little treat for ourselves microwave absolutely no microwave recipes for you now I'll make sure I link them all into a playlist playlist playlist right up here so make sure you going to check this out but today I I don't care that it's January and we're all doing healthy eating I want to treat and I want it really really quickly so no one else notices that I've had it that's the sort of treat I'm talking about and we're going to do a cookie in the microwave in under one minute so one minute microwave chocolate chip cookie how does that sound should we get going let's do this disclaimer one minute less than one minute cooking time and make taking more time to measure out the ingredients okay go in okay so first things first you're gonna put a tablespoon of butter into a microwavable cup and that's gonna go into our microwave for about 10 seconds just to melt you don't want to see your butter boiling just melt it thank you very much so it should only need about 10 second blasts I've got a very cheap microwave very helpful if you have a digital microwave otherwise I'm gonna do a lot less by eye so bear with me great yeah okay so our butter is melted it has not boiled at any point though just just melted that perfect to that we're going to add one tablespoon of dark brown sugar oh my goodness we're then going to add one tablespoon of granulated sugar that's important between what the course texture in our cookie we're then going to add in a pinch of salt and we're also going to add in some vanilla extract now if you've got vanilla extract just as a teaspoon I've got Papa vanilla paste here so I'm going to add in half a teaspoon all the good stuff oh it's so cute I'm gonna give that a really good stir to make sure all of your sugar and your butter is combined to that we're going to add one egg yolk a bowl so just the yolk of our egg this time it's gonna let the white run out you can always save this and make something or if you are being healthy this January make this helper egg white omelet so in with the egg yolk and you give that a good mix up lovely so we should have a nice well mixed but still quite runny mixture at this point we're now going to go in with a thickener which is our plain flour and I've got three tablespoons of plain flour going into this and we're going to stir that most of the way through and just before we finish we're going to add in our chocolate chips we just don't want to over stare our chocolate chips because otherwise we could start melting them and I want a nice solid chocolate chip in my chocolate chip Omega and give that a final stir as well so what you are left with now is essentially a cookie dough mixture this is gonna go into our microwave on its highest setting for 40 to 60 seconds I recommend taking out about 40 checking it what you're looking for is a nice cone cooking but it shouldn't be tacky on top [Music] I might actually have to eat raw cookie dough our game of that it's perfectly fine oh that should be 40 seconds I'd say it should be firm at this point but Tachyon tada yeah it's a cookie in a cup now just picture this just gotta have them work it's been dark when you left for work it's dark when you get in from work you just want a little bit of comforts and just to make your heart happy you know just as an ice cream you know what will be amazing the ice cream hot specially baked cookie scoop ice cream on top of that bad boy I'm gonna tuck in and what you've got here is like the sort of soft cookie ah something something

"hey guys I said welcome back to the kitchen today is the penultimate episode of the cooking Chronicles and it's the last recipe that I'm testing of other people's next episode will be the final recipe my ultimate chocolate chip cookie recipe but for today we're going controversial we're talking mix-ins [Music] so when we talk about cookies there are the obvious questions crisp chewy big small but I think the thing that we disagree about most maybe is what goes into the cookie do you like nuts in there do you like other things in there for me a chocolate chip cookie is at its best when it's just chocolate and it's that kind of classic delicious flavor but today just because a little bit further and it's adding something else today's recipe is the Bon Appetit brown butter chocolate chip cookie with toffee and what we're using is a toffee bar chocolate coated toffee bar in America be using a baffled score we can't get out here so I'm using dine bar and it'll be really interesting because I do like cookies with these things in but they don't really taste like a chocolate chip cookie to me so I'm gonna see if any of those things add to the recipe or whether it takes away the other main difference in this recipe is the sugar so every risk of you so far has had a mixture of caster and light brown sugar this doesn't it uses caster but it also uses dark brown sugar and that's gonna mean a lot more molasses flavor and I'm really intrigued to see if that overpowers of chocolate or whether enhances the kind of fudgy caramel notes that I love in a Timeship cookie so the ingredients for this recipe come in fairly standard proportions it uses unsalted butter which we're gonna Brown and then uses caster sugar and dark brown sugar which is the big difference eggs vanilla chocolate salt and baking soda along with plain flour obviously and then it also uses the toffee bar that we've chopped into small pieces so the first step in this recipe is to take out unsalted butter and brown it now if you've never done this before it's not difficult you just need to make sure you don't walk away from your pan because it will happen quite quickly so what's actually happening is the butter solids the milk solids in the butter will toast and become this beautiful nutty brown and you can tell it's done because the color change and it will also smell and beautiful and nutty so what we're going to do is place this butter into a pan and place it over a medium heat and cook it until it melts and it all sort of foam and then once that foam dissipates you'll be able to see the pieces of milk solids these kind of white lumps and then they will start to go Brown when it's a really nice golden brown you to the pan off the heat and immediately tip that into a large bowl if you leave it on the heat too long that milk solid will become burnt and bitter and it just won't add that beautiful flavor that we're looking for [Music] so once we have browned the butter we need to pull it into a bowl set that aside and let that cool slightly meanwhile we can work on our dry good so we're going to take our flour and to that we're going to add a teaspoon of baking soda and 3/4 of teaspoon of salt and then just whisk that together to combine so once our butter has cooled a little bit we're gonna add our sugars so our dark brown sugar and a castor sugar we're just gonna whisk that until combined [Music] and you can smell that really beautiful kind of treacle smell from the molasses in the dark brown sugar and there's no doubt that will make a delicious delicious dough I'm just intrigued to see if it overpowers that really nice flavor of the chocolate so to that we're gonna add our vanilla and then our eggs and just whisk until it tightens slightly and comes together in a more uniform mass and then has with Tara's recipe we're going to do exactly the same I'm going to switch to from our whisk to a spatula and we're gonna add our flour mixture and then our chocolate and in this case our toffee so we're gonna add our chocolate pieces along with our toffee pieces and again just mix those to combine you can already see that because of the dark brown sugar this dough has a much darker color much more toffee like much more caramel tones it smells amazing it's not absolutely delicious so all you do now is leave that for 30 minutes to hydrate the flour and then we can get on with baking the cookies so for the chocolate the choice is actually probably more important than normal and that's because of the extra flavor in the dough in terms of the dark brown sugar so the chocolate musing is my favourite chocolate for cookies in general its guitars 66 percent wafers and the reason I really love it is it has that really intense chocolatey not that kind of classic chocolate flavor but it also has more than that it has this kind of level of spice and a little berry flavor and it just had some more complexity and it will stand out better too that dark brown sugar so once our donors have a chance to sit from the flower has hydrated properly reading it - scooping out cookies and as always we're gonna use my favorite tools an ice cream scoop this one needs to hold about one and a half ounces of dough which is about 45 grams so what we do is scoop those onto two parchment lined baking trays leaving a good couple of inches between each cookie because they will spread as normal we also need to make sure that oven is preheated to 375 degrees which is about 190 degrees Celsius once the cookies are scooped and they're ready for the oven we can finish with a good sprinkling of flaked sea salt they're gonna go into the oven for about nine to eleven minutes [Music] now I have to say these cookies as they're baking smell just delicious and they have this really beautiful dark color when you come out the actual molasses in the sugar almost makes them more of the gingerbread cookies they've got that really characteristic color from the molasses now I won't say I couldn't resist never I tried one of these but just say these are delicious delicious cookies they have obviously fudgy from molasses full of chocolate flavor I'm not sure the toffee really adds that much to it I like the notes you get when you do taste it but it kind of gets mixed up with the molasses a lot I would say for my perfect choice of cookie I'd want to reduce the molasses flavor a little bit but these are so so delicious [Music] so that's kind of it we've tested five of the most viral chocolate chip cookies on the internet and I have a lot of thoughts I loved every single one of those recipes for different reasons but there are certain parts of each recipe that I love the most and so I want to do in the final episode coming up on Thursday is take everything we've learned all those little bits that I love from each recipe smush them together and see if we can come up with the ultimate chocolate chip cookie so that will be on Thursday and until then I'll see you later", "FFexZuAlrt0": "(upbeat music) - Thank you so much for watching.

cookies are some of the world's greatest pleasures perfectly crisp on the outside chewy on the inside with large pockets of chocolate and when they're done right there is nothing quite like them I strongly believe that you should be able to enjoy a chocolate chip cookie any day of the week so I'll be showing you guys my personal recipes for a two-minute two-hour and two day cookies I think this is gonna be fun maybe you only got two minutes and you want to make a cookie first thing we're gonna do we're gonna take some softened butter can I get it in here this is more about those times you get just cravings and you don't want like ten cookies but you just want something sweet that'll hit those spots and some brown sugar and then you want to mix this until it's essentially a smooth paste so next is your what ingredients you're gonna take your egg and your vanilla and just kind of go in it's essentially the same steps as making a normal chocolate chip cookie except I'm you're just dealing with smaller amounts I didn't say this is gonna be the easiest thing to make but it beats having to whisk a whole giant bowl of this stuff after that flour no matter how many times I make chocolate chip cookies I always end up spilling go in with some salt and some chocolate chips you actually want to save a handful because we're gonna decorate the top of the cookie to have more chocolate on top so rest go inside it looks like chocolate chip cookie dough that's because it is oh yeah you want a plate that is pretty large like a normal dinner plate some parchment as well because the parchment is gonna help rent the cookie from sticking and we're gonna scoop a nice big scoop of cookie dough because man stuffs good all right kind of like that you also want to decorate the top and a little bit more chocolate and the key here is to actually clump them together one ant starts to cook and you'll see this it'll start to spread it's like studying a watch jewelry except the diamonds the chips I'm gonna say that this cookie contains a lot of the drip as I've heard in some of the songs this is gonna go in for about a minute and 30 seconds and we're gonna see how it goes looks pretty nice he looks like a nice old chocolate-chip cookie you know almost like the clipart version I'm gonna peel this off it's a nice tree a little cookie we have over here this is your two-minute cookie which is done in the microwave I think is pretty awesome all right let's see what we got it's nice and soft good a chocolate distribution for microwave cookie it's better than you think all right onto the two-hour cookie this is a pretty standard talk soup cookie recipe I start with some normal white sugar some light brown sugar and a good amount of salt give these a nice twist you know you might have your own recipe of a regular chocolate chip cookie your grandma might have one my grandma did not have a chocolate chip cookie recipe because she's Chinese but I was like you know what I want to make some friends and in order to make friends I need to give them food what kind of food does everybody like I'll chip cookie so this is one of my first recipes gonna go in delicious golden melted butter oh yeah make your cookies it's not the easiest thing in the world but in the end I think it's all worth it and with your liquids got two old eggs what and then really good vanilla extract just want to keep on going until it's at that stage where you can tell that it's like really whipped all right that is beautiful and with the dry ingredients got some flour and some baking soda we're just going to slowly fold I like to take it slow just because I think the slower and smoother it's better beautiful right there probably one of my favorite it's about chocolate-chip cookies is the chocolate moment of silence please may I love that beautiful chocolate chunks just swimming and incorporating and just evenly being dispersed throughout the dough I might have put too much chocolate then again I like my chocolate chip cookies like I like my bank account freaking loaded whoa this might be my new wallpaper at this point it's pretty darn awesome it does benefit from the time of the fridge so this is gonna go in the fridge okay so it's been about an hour and this has chilled pretty nicely I have a half sheet tray lined with parchment paper we're gonna scoop some nice little cookie balls I like to be pretty generous with my cookie scoops oh that's beautiful nice we have five cookies on the tray obviously things gonna make like 10 15 20 more so save this if you have more friends bake it if you don't have friends that's it's kind of sad these are gonna go into an oven at around 350 degrees to get a nice crust on the outside to keep the inside chewy so we're gonna go bake these off [Music] yes look at these as you can see there is a nice sort of golden-brown crust around the outside but the inside I can already tell it's like chewy it's dense it's gonna be delicious oh yeah here we go and here we have it a two-hour chocolate chip cookie nice caramelized crust on the outside really chewy in the middle super delicious here we go oh that's nice dipping in milk but the next one's gonna be even better this is it this is the two-day cookie here we go so the first thing we're gonna do we're gonna make some toffee going to put in a lot of butter into this pan after the butter is going in you actually want to also add in light brown sugar and a good amount of salt I think it's important that you stir pretty constantly throughout the process because it helps the butter and the sugar kind of stay together this is a pretty personal recipe um I've actually been able to make a lot of my friends do to this recipe if you're watching if you've had one of these cookies thank you for being my friend the butter and the sugar are coming together pretty nicely beautiful dark golden brown ribbons happening right now that's at 290 so that means uh this is ready to come out so we got a nice tray with parchment paper for the landing this is probably one of my favorite parts I love it put it in the freezer as soon as you can so beautiful all right while the toffee cools we're gonna make some brown butter the first thing you start with is a lot of butter a lot of sticks don't worry you know if someone asks how much butter one of these cookies don't let them watch this video so butter is made of water of milk solids and butter fat when making brown butter the water kind of melts off and evaporates and that leaves the milk solids behind turn golden brown and that is because of something amazing called the mired reaction we don't know what the my reaction is I don't know exactly either but it makes tough turn golden brown and it's delicious the milk solids are looking amazing your average butter has around 80 percent butterfat sixteen percent water and three percent milk solids we got two problems right now the water is gone and to this is really hot so we try to put this in make cookies right now we would like burn all the sugar cook the egg you know cook the flour so there's a couple of interesting solutions and one of them I read online in a lot of blogs is that they use ice cubes you want to go really slow and add one ice cube in at a time and just wait for it it'll start to bubble and it's cooling down the butter it's adding back water into the mixture all right dude we're gonna set you aside but just no great got the rest of our ingredients brown butter still just hanging out over there sup dude first dark brown sugar I think there's a lot of flavor in here good old white sugar a lot of salt actually I think that's one of the secrets baking soda and some espresso powder I think espresso powder it helps knock back any of that fat or that sugar that might be a little too much and the star ingredient of the show with the brown butter whoo this is gonna be pretty dark compared to the other ones that we've done before but I think color is flavor for eggs go in a 1 3 & 4 a lot of good vanilla you really want to beat it until smooth dissolves mixture of almost like a ribbon-like consistency all right dump in in the flour slowly incorporate these beautiful ribbons of this butter and sugar mix that's a beautiful dough right there now it's time to add in the really good stuff let's go get our chocolate and coffee if you're spending two days to make a stalks from cookie you're not doing it justice unless you use really really good chocolate so this is some nice chocolate in bars and we're just gonna go in pretty large chunks this is one of those things where the less perfect it is the cooler it is you're gonna get that much more texturally and visually interesting cookie it's nice Jordan you haven't talked to the cookie has like big pockets Charley everybody's like oh you're like yeah I made that so we're gonna keep it like this and let's go get the toffee so this is what the toffee looks like after about 30 minutes to an hour in the freezer make sure when you do this you don't have any neighbors and it's not 2 a.m. they go into here nice little ziplock bag squeeze out a good amount of the air yeah I can't rap is it broken down into top.you chunks approximately the same size as these over here these are going in oh yeah don't waste any of this stuff on the board either that chocolate dust that's the good stuff let's get some gloves on get in there with your hands I'm trying to make sure the chocolate and the toffee are both evenly distributed it's pretty much ready so now I'm gonna go get a tray we can shape is into nice big cookie dough ball pretty generous amount almost the size of a tennis ball but you're gonna spend two days might as well make a little bit bigger probably wondering by now hey why is this gonna take two days so this recipe specifically requires it to rest for 36 hours but why 36 hours like why not just like you know put it in the fridge and just chill it until it's ready to go well I actually worked in a bakery before their child some cookies we're the best I've ever had the reason why they were so good is because the owner always rested it for at least 36 hours what does it do you know a lot of experts also say that the resting process allows flavors to intensify and integrate more with each other I'm no cookie scientist but I baked one off right away and I baked one off 36 hours later and the one that I baked off 36 hours later had more flavor the color was deeper it was more caramelized way better by a bio these are very soft right now they need to rest so I'm gonna saran wrap these and I'm gonna put them in the fridge for 36 hours stay tuned I promise this is gonna be worth it okay so these have been in for very much two days now before you guys say anything I have two of these shirts these have been resting for 36 hours it's time to bake them three four five and six I'm excited because I want to show you guys why we put so much time and effort to this so let's go bake these cookies okay so these are the finished product what a two day cookie looks like straight from the oven a lot of interesting textures going on it's almost like a landscape in like the desert where like the ground is kind of cracked one last touch we're gonna do to really take these to the next level we're gonna use some flaky finishing sea salt you can probably find this to any grocery store just like a nice steak I think seasoning your cookies it sounds weird but that's what I like to do I'm gonna go make some vanilla milk okay so vanilla milk it's just a splash of vanilla just some good old-fashioned milk and just to top it off a splash heavy cream and really help take this to the next level give it a nice little mix and there you have it a two-day brown butter toffee chocolate chip cookie with flaky sea salt serves with vanilla milk these large pockets of gooey chocolate that toffee that just melts and add flavor I want you guys to see how it looks so here we go that's a damn good cookie it is my favorite version but chocolate chip cookie I think if you have two days so [Music] I'm gonna go take a nap now so there you have it a two-minute two-hour and two-day cookie you have any questions about the recipes feel free to send me a message or drop a comment below I know that baking cookies can be pretty tricky sometimes and I want to help you guys the best I can so good luck have fun and remember there's always time to bake until next time", "Cqzca7lgWuw": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "VfZllKN4iD0": "today's recipe were making quinoa chocolate chip cookies now I'm using quinoa flour instead of regular white flour which makes it a bit healthier this is an ancient grain and it has a lot of fiber and proteins so it's it's a really nice substitution and the flavors are fantastic you're not even gonna really notice it this flour makes a nice soft chewy cookie like I said so I'm rockin Robin and I'm going to show you how to do it right after this so like most you know chocolate chip cookie recipes we're gonna start off by creaming together our sugars and our butter together so I'm combining my white sugar and light brown sugar to my KitchenAid mixer and I'm going to add the butter and then we'll just mix that up until it's nicely combined now while that's happening we're gonna take another Bowl and we're gonna combine our dry ingredients so I have my oat flour which I like to use because it has a very nice flavor that it adds to chocolate chip cookies and then we have of course our quinoa flour some salt and some baking soda now you want to mix this all together ahead of time that way you're sure that everything's gonna get mixed in evenly in your cookie dough now here's our butter and sugars that were creaming in and it's still crumbly this is not ready yet so we're gonna go until it gets nice and smooth so this is what you're looking for it you notice how the butter and the sugar looks much smoother and creamier so turn off your mixer before you add it the egg now I crack my egg into it a separate Bowl so that way I know if there's any shells in there if you crack it directly into this bowl you're not gonna be able to get that shell out very easily so crack it into a separate bowl and then pour it in and I'm gonna add some vanilla extract and we're gonna mix this up once the day.this combined you can start adding the flour and by the way I have my my oven bake it into 350 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm gonna add about 3 scoops of my combined flowers here and just do it on a low so you don't get flour in your face and you're gonna mix that in once it looks like it's combined then we'll add some more flour just keep adding the flour until it's all in there it's almost all in now I'm gonna go ahead and pour the rest of this in turn the speed up and even scrape the bottom of the bowl to make sure everything gets mixed in nicely now these are the chocolate chips that I like to use they're my favorite they're called Guittard and they're milk chocolate they are the best I tell you I could eat the whole bag just by themselves they're that good and just mix this on low so now I'll take a spoon just a you know tablespoon type size and I'm gonna make balls out of the dough and you just want to try and make them the balls about the same size you can roll them in your hands you know something like that now if you want you can freeze the dough as well and then make balls first freeze them and then you can just pop them out of the freezer let them thaw out a little bit and then bake them and you'll have fresh warm cookies whenever you want so these are gonna go into the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for between 12 and 14 minutes so here I just took these out of the oven at 13 minutes and I think they're perfect so I'm gonna let them cool a little bit and then they can take them off the pan so that's how we make our quinoa chocolate chip cookies guys I think you're gonna love these I love how they held their shape right they didn't flatten out you know some cookies just go really flat well these don't do that they hold their shape really nice look at that beautiful thickness and when you open it up it's soft I can feel it when I open it but it's soft and chewy that is so delicious that I love those Guittard chocolate chips there huh they're the best and then you've got this nice soft chewy warm cookie that is just delicious what can I say try guys I

favorite kinds of ketta recipes to make and I've already showed you how to make a ton of different low-carb keto cookies on the channel but today's recipe these 10 minutes soft and chewy peanut butter chocolate chip keto cookies they might just be the best keto cookies I've ever made on the channel so with that being said let's jump right into the recipe and make some keto cookies alright so first things first you want to get out your food skill because we're gonna be weighing some of these ingredients out to the gram and then you'll also want to get out a medium to large size Bowl so now we're all set to get our ingredients going and the first ingredient we're gonna add for our keto cookies today is gonna be one large egg so the next ingredient you want to add is gonna be some coconut oil I already went ahead and measured in melted mine and today we'll be using a tablespoon or 14 grams that stuff for our keto cookies so obviously today's keto cookie recipe is a peanut butter chocolate chip keto cookie recipe and my recommendation for peanut butter is to go with one that has no sugar added to it personally I like to use the Smuckers natural peanut butter but if you can't find that one just try to find one similar to it with that being said for the keto cookies today we're gonna be adding just less than a third of a cup or 70 grams of the peanut butter to our Bowl last but not least we're gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and now at this point we're just gonna mix all those ingredients together until they're well combined once they're combined that's we're going to start adding our dry ingredients and the first dry ingredient we're gonna add is going to be some blanched almond flour and if you're trying to keep the carbs as low as possible I highly recommend going with the Kirkland's blanched almond flour because for every 28 gram serving it only has to net carbs and that's the lowest that I've seen anyways today we're gonna add a cup or a hundred 12 grams of that stuff to our bowl and then of course we want to add some sweetness to our keto cookies but we're gonna want to do that without adding any carbs and the best way to do that is by using some oral today I'm using the confectioner's ortho all by swarf it's carb free it's calorie free it works for it to sweeten up pretty much everything and today we'll be using three tablespoons or 42 grams of it to sweeten up our keto cookies we're also gonna add a half a teaspoon of baking soda along a quarter teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt and then of course we're gonna add our chocolate chips today I'm using the no sugar added Lily's chocolate chips if you've never tried these before they're amazing totally low-carb totally keto friendly highly recommend picking some of these up if you haven't already they're a game changer as far as chocolate chips go but with that being said for today's keto cookies we're gonna add just less than a quarter cup or 35 grams those to our bowl all right so now at this point we're gonna take a spatula and mix all those ingredients together until a thick batter starts to form once the batter forms we're gonna use our hands to form a ball of dough out of the batter and then at this point we're gonna set that bowl aside we're gonna get out a baking sheet or an align the baking sheet with parchment paper and then we're gonna coat the parchment paper with baking spray once you've done that we're gonna get our bowl full of cookie dough back out and at this point we're gonna take a cookie scoop and scoop out 12 equal size cookies from that ball of dough so when you got the cookie dough added to the baking sheet you want to flatten the cookie dough either with the bottom of the spoon or an icing knife and then once you flatten the cookie dough it's time to get these in the oven and you want to bake these at 325 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes they're gonna be a little soft when they come out of the oven almost cake like but don't worry at all about that because once they set they'll firm up and become much more cookie like so you want to let them cool completely in the tray itself and then check this out this is what these keto cookies end up looking like they're soft they're chewy they're full of peanut butter chocolate chip deliciousness and I hope you guys enjoy them as always for more information about today's recipe check the video description below and I'll see you in the next one", "PwVrp0u-DDA": "- Hi, friends, it's Sam, and, okay, here's the story. The other day, I was playin' around, watchin' YouTube videos, and I came across a viral video by Tasty of how to make the perfect\nchocolate chip cookies. Now, I am a big sucker for\nchocolate chip cookies, in fact, I think it might be\nmy most favorite dessert ever. So when I saw this video, I wanted to make them immediately, but there was a problem, Tasty's recipe is not vegan. So, I thought it would be\nkind of fun to show you guys how I can take a recipe and make it vegan. And so today, I'm gonna do Tasty's perfect\nchocolate chip cookie recipe made vegan. Yeah, love it. Now, I have never made this recipe before, I've never veganized it before, I'm gonna be trying for the\nfirst time on camera with you, so I hope I get beginner's luck and get it right the first time. I'm excited to make\nchocolate chip cookies, let's get to it. So I'm looking at this recipe, and I can tell you that it's\nalready a lot more complicated than I normally like to make my recipes, it's got about 14 ingredients\nand about 13 steps. Whereas my recipe in my\ncookbook has eight ingredients and four steps, so definitely a little\nbit more complicated, but let's hope the extra\neffort is worth it. Okay, so the first four ingredients Tasty's recipe calls for is bread flour, all-purpose\nflour, salt, and baking soda, totally vegan already, we don't\nneed to do anything there, it says sift them together, so alright. We're gonna do it. Now it says two teaspoons of kosher salt, or 1 1/2 teaspoons of regular salt. I have regular salt, so that is what I'm going to use. Seems like a lot of salt to me. And sift that together. I never sift in my recipes,\nI'm too lazy to sift, so this is new for me. (laughs) Alright, sifted, beautiful. Now the next step is that\nI have to brown the butter, so let's hop over to the\nstove and brown the butter. Tasty's recipe calls\nfor one cup of butter, so I'm gonna do the really\nobvious, easy substitute here, which is just vegan\nbutter, or vegan margarine, whatever you wanna call it. Now, later on in the recipe, it calls for one egg and one egg yolk. Now, when it comes to cookies, I always find that you don't\nreally need to replace the eggs with any kind of flax\nor anything like that, some people will feel\ndifferently and that's fine, but in my recipes for cookies, I don't know, you just don't need it, so I'm just gonna replace the\nrichness of those egg yolks with a few extra\ntablespoons of vegan butter, so I'm gonna do one cup\nplus two tablespoons of vegan butter. Okay, turn on the heat, and melt that vegan butter. Beautiful, woo! Okay, now unexpectedly, this Earth Balance is, ooh, dripping, and it's really, really foaming up, more than non-dairy\nbutter would, for sure. So foamy. And I realized, as making this video, that I don't think I've ever tried to brown Earth Balance butter, so we'll see what happens here. Don't start a grease fire. Really foamy. I can see that the butter is starting to darken underneath\nthis layer of foam, though, so I'm gonna keep at it, hopefully we'll get\nbrown butter out of here. Okay, the foam is chillin' out now, and the butter is darkening, so I think it's working, there was just a really\nfoamy moment, there. (laughs) Oh yeah, starting to smoke, I don't know if you can see that smoke. So I think that's plenty. Woo, smoky. Oh yeah, look at that brown stuff. Weird! So I've got my browned butter here, it needs to cool to room temperature, so I'm gonna pop it in the fridge. Tasty said to add water to make sure that you've\ngot one cup of butter, I already have one cup\nof vegan butter here, so I don't need to add any water, I'm just gonna pop it in the fridge now. I might need to add a\ncouple tablespoons of water later on in the recipe, to help replace the moisture of the eggs, but I'm gonna wait and see how that goes. So I've got my sugars here, my\nespresso powder, my vanilla, and the recipe calls for dark chocolate, so I just picked up a\nvegan dark chocolate, dairy-free, just check the\nback of the ingredients, and I'm gonna just chop it up. Man, it is such a dark, rainy day, I don't have proper\nlighting equipment yet, I really need to get some, because I'm a little bit\nworried that all of this footage is gonna be dark and grainy, and so, if it is, I'm sorry. So I need one cup of the dark brown sugar, and 1/2 a cup of plain sugar. One teaspoon of espresso powder, I actually really like this addition idea, espresso powder enhances\nthe flavor of chocolate, so that would be why they used it. And two teaspoons of vanilla extract. So, my browned butter feels\nabout room temperature now, it smells super brown,\nlike, really toasty, maybe on the edge of burnt, I'm a little bit worried that\nthis is gonna taste not good, so we're gonna have to see, maybe I'll have to make this recipe again and find another substitute that's better. No, there are, like, brown\nsolids stuck to the bottom of this measuring cup, and I'm guessing that's where all the brown butter flavor comes from, so I'm gonna make sure to\nget those in there as well. Now, mix that up. Now it says whip that up until fluffy, so I'm gonna really give it a good whip. I'm not convinced this\nis really gonna work just like I was hoping it would. This is not getting fluffy, and it's really dark brown, fluff factor is zero here, I don't think this is gonna\nwork just like the video, but maybe it'll taste\ngreat, who knows, let's see. Now I'm gonna add the dry ingredients, about a third at a time, as recommended, mix that in. Yeah, I can really, really\nsmell this brown butter, and I don't know that\nI love the smell of it. So it says to fold in chocolate chips, and the dark chocolate. Okay, folding that in. Now, I do think the batter\nlooks a little bit dry, so I'm gonna add a\ntablespoon or two of water, just to get the consistency\nthat I saw in the video. Alright, there we go. Okay, so now I'm gonna\nprepare these cookies, put them on a tray, bake 'em, and give it a try. Alright, I've got my cookies\nall ready to go in the oven, let's bake 'em up and see how they are. Lemme try this dough, actually,\nand see how I feel about it. I don't really like it. Buh. That brown butter flavor isn't nice, so strong, and not very\ngood, I don't think. We'll see how the cookies turn out, but I think I'm gonna have\nto hash this one again. Okay, my cookies are out of the oven, and they look kinda sad. (laughs) I don't think\nthis worked really well, I'm probably gonna have to try it again. So they got kinda flat, they look kinda greasy,\nwhich I always find happens when you melt butter before\nadding it to a cookie, so I don't think I'll melt\nthe butter the next attempt, we'll see. Okay, the cookies themselves\ntaste a lot better than the batter. They're kinda gritty, kinda greasy from the\nmelted butter, I think. Pretty sweet, crispy on the\noutside, chewy in the middle, so they're not horrendous, but they're not great. I think I can do better, so I'm gonna take a little\nleeway on this recipe, veganize it a little bit\nmore, do some tweaks, I have some ideas, and\nhopefully this next batch works, because I'm gonna run out of\nchocolate if I'm not careful. Okay, so here is my idea, I had a look at Tasty's recipe, and with my experimentation\nof the first round, I think I have some ideas of\nhow I'm gonna veganize this, get the same flavors that\nTasty's trying to provide, the same textures, except, yeah, my own little tweaks, so the vegan brown butter,\nI don't think really worked, it had a really strong,\nkind of burnt taste, but not in the delicious\nbrown butter kinda way, so I had an idea, in order\nto get that toastyness, I am gonna take some almond flour, which is just ground almonds, so if you don't have almond flour, you could use ground almonds, and I'm gonna toast that a little bit, and that'll help get some\nof that nutty, toasty flavor that you find, normally, in brown butter. I think three tablespoons\nis what I'm gonna try, hopefully it's the right amount. So, adding it to my pan, I'm just gonna toast it a little bit until it's a little bit\nbrown, a little bit fragrant. The nice golden brown color, make sure you stir it\nfrequently at the end because it can burn really quickly, so you wanna keep an eye on it. And now the pan is really hot, so in order to make sure it stops cooking, I'm gonna add it to my large mixing bowl. Ooh, smells toasty delicious, that's how you know it's done right. Now, unlike that brown butter, this actually smells really\ngood and not gross and burnt, this smells toasty almond delicious. Yum. So, now into this, I'm gonna add all of the remaining dry ingredients. So, sticking with the\noriginal measurements of the dry ingredients, one cup of bread flour, really hope this works, I don't wanna have to do this over again, 1/2 a cup of all-purpose flour, one teaspoon baking soda, one teaspoon of espresso powder, I decided to just add it along\nwith the dried ingredients, instead of later on in the recipe, just because I think\nit'll be better. (laughs) And I did find the cookies really salty, I think that's partly because the recipe originally called for unsalted butter, and the vegan butter I\nused already has salt, so I've reduced the salt\nto just one teaspoon, and I'm gonna try that\nand see how that works. And now whisk that all together. There, so I'm gonna whisk it as well, Tasty didn't call for\nthat in their recipe, but I really wanna make sure, especially that the active ingredients, such as the baking soda, are mixed together so that it's\neven throughout the cookies. So there's my dry ingredients. Now, my cookies turned out pretty greasy, and I find that usually happens\nwhen I use melted butter in a cookie recipe, even if I do let it cool, so I'm not gonna melt the butter, and since I already\ngot those brown flavors from toasting the almond meal, I'm not worried about sacrificing flavor. So, one cup of vegan butter, one cup of dark brown sugar, and 1/2 a cup of white sugar, all of these measurements\nso far are the same, and two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Now, I'm just completely\nskipping the eggs, I might need to add a bit of moisture, but since these cookies came out so moist in the first place, I'm gonna wait and see if I need more. Now I'm gonna cream these\ntogether until fluffy, and hopefully this time,\nit'll actually get fluffy. Whoa, I should've used a bigger bowl. Woo, that looks so much better. Okay, now Tasty added the\nflour mixture into the wet, but I'm gonna do it the other way around, I just like it better that way. Oh yeah, this butter\nis so fluffy, gorgeous. So just scoop all of that goodness in, and mix to combine. I can smell the toastyness of the almonds. Now that is so much better, look at that dough,\nit's light years better. Mm, and it tastes like\ngood cookie dough, too. I don't even think I need\nto add in any more moisture, this dough is lovely and fluffy, so I'm just gonna add\nin the chocolate chips and the chopped dark chocolate. 1/2 a cup of vegan chocolate chips, and put all of that\nchopped chocolate in there, and mix that in. Oh yeah, that is looking so much better. I'm gonna taste some of this cookie dough. Mm, that is good. Alright, let's bake these\nup and see how they work. Oh yeah, nice big scoop, woo-wee, that looks so good already. There we go, those look so much better, I can't even tell you, they're a better color,\nthey're a better texture, I'm really excited about them, I hope they work, so let's pop them in the\noven now and give it a try. Alright, so I ended up\nmaking two trays of cookies, so now let's give it a try. Mm, smells good. Oh yeah, so good. Mm, I taste a little bit of the espresso, they're a little bit salty, crispy on the outside,\nchewy in the middle. Pretty delish. Mm, super chocolaty. Mm, I need milk. Okay, now I've got a glass\nof almond milk, oh yeah. Mm! Mm, so good. These are, like, really\nsweet, really rich, toasty, full of flavor. It's definitely a good cookie, and I think I did a pretty\ngood job of veganizing it, the second time, not the first time, the first time was no good. There's something about it, I think it's maybe the dark brown sugar, there's a really strong caramel flavor, really, really yummy. Mm-hmm.

(chicken squawking) (upbeat music)", "DMSRr5vsE8E": "Hey everyone it's Sam here from Sugar Spun Run and today I'm showing you how to make brown butter chocolate chip cookies. One of my favorite secret ingredients to use, in the kitchen, is browned butter. Browning your butter makes all the difference in recipes, and\nit's going to make such a difference in these chocolate chip cookies that I'm\nsharing today. Now if you've never browned butter before I'm about to walk\nyou through all the steps. It's actually very simple so let's go ahead and head\nover to our stovetop and get started. Now for browning your butter you're going to\nneed about a medium-sized skillet, and if you have one I recommend using one\nthat's a light color. A black cast iron one's just going to make it a little\nmore difficult to tell once your butter is brown. So if you have a light-colored skillet you're going to want to use this. I'm gonna set this on our stovetop. And to this skillet we're going to add one cup, or two sticks, of unsalted butter. Now at this point all we're doing is melting our butter. We don't want to brown it yet.\nWe just want our heat to be on low, or medium low. We're just gonna cook the\nbutter until it's melted. You're going to need either a heatproof spatula, or a\nwooden spoon, don't use a metal spoon or anything that conducts heat, because the\nhandle is going to get hot really fast. Once your butter has melted completely,\nnow you're going to turn the heat up to just above medium. I mean just a hair\nabove medium, don't turn the heat up too high, you're going to end up burning your\nbutter. Once you turn your heat up just keep stirring the butter, and any moment\nnow it should begin to sizzle and pop. Now once your butter starts sizzling and\npopping and crackling you're going to want to stir it constantly. You want to\nmake sure you keep that butter moving so that it's cooking evenly, and so that\nnone of it's getting burned to the bottom of your pan. What's happening here\nis, we're cooking out a lot of that water that's in our butter. We're concentrating\nit and pretty soon it's going to start browning and your kitchen is going to\nsmell amazing. Now as you can see, our butter has\nstopped cracking and popping like it was and it started to get a little foamy on\ntop, but if you listen to it it's not popping nearly as much as it was. This is\nwhere the magic happens. So at this point keep stirring. You never want to stop\nstirring, and look for the butter to begin to brown. You might need to pull\nback through that foam a little bit, but if you can see it here, we've got a\nlittle bit of browning going on. I'm gonna let this cook just another second,\nand it smells good too. You can smell it's like a nutty aroma. That's how you\nknow your butter is done. We're going to take this off of the heat right now, and\nthis pan is still hot. It's going to keep cooking our butter. We don't want it to cook any more so I'm going to immediately pour this into a heat proof bowl. So you can see that browning that happened on the bottom we want to get all of that out of the skillet and into our bowl because that is what's going to\nmake our cookies so good. A little of it stuck to the bottom of the pan, that's\nfine. You will know if you burned your butter cuz it's going to smell bitter.\nIt's going to spell burnt, and the residue left on the pan will be black.\nIf that happens, unfortunately, you have to start over, but right now we're\nlooking pretty good. Now one of the hardest parts about baking with browned\nbutter is we have to wait for the butter to cool before we can go any further. You\ndon't want to add sugar to your really hot melted butter, otherwise, it's going\nto melt the sugar and you'll just have a greasy mess. So this is going to need to\nsit. I let mine sit at room temperature for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until it\nno longer feels hot when you're touching the outside of the bowl. It shouldn't\neven feel warm. It should basically be back at room temperature. So I've given\nour brown butter some time to cool. It's no longer hot to the touch when I touch\nthe bottom of the bowl. So let's go ahead and make our cookie dough. We're going to\nadd one cup of firmly packed brown sugar to our butter. Now you can use either\nlight or dark brown sugar. When I have both on hand, I actually like to use a\nblend of both. This is about half light, and half dark, but that's totally not\nnecessary. That's just a personal preference We'll also add 2/3 cup of granulated sugar and stir everything together until it's combined you can see those brown butter specks in the dough. It looks so\npretty Now we'll add two large eggs, and ideally\nthese should be at room temperature. I'm also going to add one and a half\nteaspoons of pure vanilla extract. And once again we'll stir everything together. So our wet ingredients are looking pretty good right now so I'm just going to set these aside and we're going to need a separate bowl for our\ndry ingredients. We're going to start by adding 2 and 3/4 cup of all-purpose\nflour to this bowl. To the flour we're going to add 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. One teaspoon of baking powder. A teaspoon of baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon\nof salt, and just stir everything together until the dry ingredients are\ncompletely combined. Once everything is nicely combined, just\ngradually add your dry ingredients to your wet ingredients and just stir\nuntil everything is completely combined. I'll usually add the flour in 3 or 4\nparts it just makes it easier to stir everything together. Now let's add the chocolate. Now you can\nuse chocolate chips for this recipe. That's totally fine. You would need about\ntwo cups, or a 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips. I usually use semi-sweet, but milk\nchocolate, or whatever you prefer would work fine, however, since we went to the\neffort, the extra effort, to brown the butter I like to take the little bit of\nextra effort and chop my own chocolate bars, and the reason I do this is because\nthis chocolate is just usually a little bit more melty a little bit better\nquality than what you usually get as chocolate chips. So if you're chopping up\nchocolate bars, you'll need 10 ounces of chocolate, and you can chop the chocolate\nas course or as fine as you like. I like to do a little bit of a variety  as you\ncan see here. We'll stir this into our cookie dough. This cookie dough is going\nto need to chill for 30 minutes before we can bake it. Now that's not only so\nthe cookies don't spread too much when they're baking in the oven, but also so\nthat the flavor can develop even further. And you can chill this dough longer than\n30 minutes. It's a great on when chilled for several days. The flavor really develops\nif you let it sit that long. I'm just going to cover the bowl with plastic\nwrap. And let this chill for 30 minutes. Before your cookie dough has finished\nchilling, you're going to want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees\nFahrenheit. I preheated my oven a little while ago. My cookie dough has been\nchilling for over 30 minutes now. So we are ready to go ahead and start scooping\nand baking our cookies. I like to use about 2 tablespoons of dough per cookie\nright here I'm just using my 1 and 1/2 tablespoon size cookie scoop. I will link\nto this in the description below, and as you'll see in just a second I just make\na heaping tablespoon and a half. Now just  to make the cookies look nice and\nuniform I always like to roll them between my palms to get them in a nice\nball shape before placing them on my cookie sheet. Make sure to space your cookies at least\ntwo inches apart, because they will spread some as they're baking. Now I'll\npop these cookies in our 350 degrees Fahrenheit preheated oven where they're\ngoing to need to bake for about 10 to 12 minutes. You'll know they're done when\nthe edges are light golden brown. Now, once these cookies come out of the oven,\nwhile they're still hot, there is one extra special touch that I like to add,\nand that is just a sprinkling of flaky sea salt. I'm just gonna grind this over the\ncookies. This step is completely optional, but it does really put those cookies\nover the edge. It just makes them nice and gourmet. Besides we've already\nbrowned our butter. We've chopped up the chocolate. We really want to add that\nextra little touch. That extra sprinkle of sea salt. All that's left to do now is let these cookies cool completely on their baking\nsheet. Okay so these aren't completely cooled, but I cannot wait another second so let's just take a look at these cookies. That is how simple it is to make brown\nbutter chocolate chip, or in this case chocolate chunk cookies at home,\ncompletely from scratch. These are really really gourmet, absolutely incredible\ncookies. I think you guys are going to love them. If you try this one out please\nleave me a comment I can't wait to hear what you think of them. Thank you so much\nfor watching and I'll see you next time. I'm so excited about this.

It's my double chocolate chunk cookie, the most addictive cookie known to man. These things are dangerous, I must say. If you have a chocolate\ncraving, I'm telling you, this will hit the spot. Let me show you how easy\nthey are to put together. So, we're first gonna take\na half a cup of butter, and four ounces of bittersweet chocolate, and I like to put in a\nlarge microwave safe bowl, and pop it in the microwave\nat 30 second increments, just until it's nice and melted. And then to that, we're gonna add a cup and a quarter of sugar, two eggs, and three quarters teaspoon\nof vanilla extract. And you can go ahead and whisk that up, until everything is combined. Then, you can set that mixture aside, and then in a separate bowl, we're gonna prepare our dry ingredients. So, you're gonna add a cup of flower, two-thirds cup of\nunsweetened cocoa powder, a half a teaspoon of salt, and a half a teaspoon of baking soda. And you can whisk that up,\nuntil it's nice and combined. We're gonna take our dry ingredients, and we're gonna add it\nto the wet ingredients. And you can just do this with\na wire whisk or even a spoon, whatever you have. And you'll see, you'll have a kind of a sticky wet cookie dough on your hands. Double chocolate chunk\ncookies usually have a variety of things in it. I like to do something\nsweet like chocolate, something crunchy like nuts, and then something chewy like cherry. There's nothing better\nthan a combination of dark chocolate, and cherry. You've gotta trust me\non this one and try it. I know there are people out there that don't like those raisins and I hope that you will try the cherry, because the cherry is not like a raisin. It's even better. So, in goes a half a cup of\nchopped bittersweet chocolate, half a cup of walnuts, and then, three quarters\ncup of the dried cherries. And you can stir your dough up, just until all of the\nthick things are combined, and then we're gonna take ice cream scoop and parcel them out on a\nparchment lined cookie sheet, and give them room to spread, cause they will spread out a bit. So, I like to probably\nget about six of them on a tray at one time. And then, we're gonna bake\nit 350 for about 17 minutes, and you will know that they\nare done when you start to smell that amazing chocolate aroma, wafting through your kitchen, and you start see little\ncracks on the cookies. That's when you know to pull them out. Let them cool slightly, and then, you can transfer\nthem to a cooling rack, and then, pile high on your\nfavorite cookie platter, and you will see, you will have one delicious chocolatey chunky\ncookie on your hands, that people will go nuts for. I brought these into the Kin\ncommunity off a few weeks back, and they were devoured in minutes. They're that good. I hope you guys give this one a try and let me know what you think, and as always, you can head to the entertainingwithbeth.com website, if you would like a printable\nversion of this recipe. Otherwise, you can also\nfind it in the description below as well. Alright, you guys, I'll\nsee you back here next week for another delicious and easy recipe. Until then, bye. (lighthearted music)", "ZKWn-9GUPcI": "horns up and welcome to a brand new episode of head bangers kitchen my name is Sal I'm a death metal musician I'm also the author of the recipe book called keto life out now worldwide and today I'm gotten my hands on a very special ingredient some stevia sweet and chocolate chips all the way from the United States of America and a big shout out and a thank you to my friend Ranbir Kapoor no not the actor for bringing me these chocolate chips from the USA so now that I've got these I was like what can I make with them and I thought to myself the perfect recipe to start off with is going to be some keto chocolate chip cookies but not any keto chocolate chip cookies because I've already done a regular keto chocolate chip cookie and you can click here on the I button in and watch not listen but watch that video but today we are going to be making some keto double chocolate chip cookies more chocolate than you know what to do it anyway enough jibber-jabber let's get baking I'm going to start by preheating my oven to 180 degrees Celsius the next thing I'm going to do is sift my dry ingredients using a sieve and I'm using hundred grams of almond flour 75 grams of confectioner's erythritol 20 grams of cocoa powder unsweetened and about a teaspoon of baking powder and then I just sift it now the reason I'm sifting my dry ingredients is because I live in Mumbai city and I haven't used airtight jars to store my stuff so you can see my almond flour and my erythritol is a bit lumpy and I want to make sure I don't get lumps of those in my cookies because that will not be fun to eat so I'm just gonna sift all of them just to ensure a nice cookie texture but of course if you have been smart and kept your ingredients in airtight jars and you don't have any to begin with well then you can skip this step no problem anyway this takes a lot of work and I got a bit tired of doing this on camera because it's an awkward position so if you just have a look that's pretty much how it's supposed to look and I'm going to do this off camera and well this is pretty much how it looks after sifting all my dry ingredients now I want to take these cookies to the next level so I'm going to get a saucepan on the stove and I'm going to add in 30 grams of butter and what I'm going to do now is turn this regular butter into melted butter and then turn that melted butter into brown butter and the reason I'm doing that is because brown butter has a lovely nutty flavor to it but of course you can skip this step and just use melted butter no problem anyway I cook that butter till it gets nice and brown and then I take it off the heat and now into this warm brown butter I'm going to add a hundred grams of all-natural peanut butter just peanuts and nothing else and I'm also going to throw in about a tablespoon of water and then I'm gonna give it all a good mix and make a brown butter peanut butter I guess that's what you want to call it anyway that's part of the liquid ingredients I'm going to be using anyway once that's done I'm going to pour that into the dry ingredients off my cookie dough and I'm gonna give that a bit of a mix before I crack one whole egg into that and I'm also going to throw in my chocolate chips at this point about a hundred grams and I'm going to give it all a good mix now this might take a little bit of elbow grease but hey that's okay you want to give everything a good mix till it combines and becomes cookie dough it's a cookie dough it's a rich dark chocolaty and delicious cookie dough and you can also taste the cookie dough raw no problem and check it for sweetness you know in case you want to have it sweeter it's completely up to you anyway once that's done it's time to get on to making the cookies now folks you all know that I love the kitchen scale so I am going to weigh out the entire cookie dough which is about 454 grams which means I'm going to get 10 cookies of about 45 grams each so what I'm going to do is I'm going to measure out 45 grams of cookie dough and then roll it into a ball and then you do this with the rest of the cookie dough to make 10 cookie dough balls now I'm going to get a baking tray lined with parchment paper and I'm gonna place my cookie dough balls on it and press them down now you need to do this because this is not regular cookie dough with flour in it and if you put a ball into the oven you will get a ball right back out so put the cookie dough onto the parchment paper and shape your cookies however you like if you want them nice and thick make them thick if you want them nice and thin make them thin anyway once that's done take those cookies and put them in the oven to bake for about 12 to 15 minutes and after about 12 minutes my cookies were done and they look delicious but of course as always let them cool down for 15 minutes before you touch them be patient and I promise it'll be worth it so there you have it ladies and gentlemen our Kito double chocolate chip cookies are ready and they look absolutely delicious and I can't wait to dig in anyway enough jibber-jabber time to taste alright folks it's time to taste our Kito double chocolate chip cookies and they look awesome like they're dark and rich and chocolatey we just look at it I know you can see it but right anyway I'm gonna dig in oh man hmm yeah this chocolaty goodness oh it is it it's perfect guys like I mean man oh man it's it's a chewy chocolate chip cookie the most beautiful is the peanut butter is not overpowering you know you think peanut butter and chocolate you get like way too much peanut butter flavor but no texture taste and you know what this editor at all and the sugar-free chocolate combination is perfect it doesn't even taste like a ketose sweetener anyway I'm gonna go and enjoy the rest of this cookie I will see you on the next episode of headbangers kitchen poor cuckoo home hey folks if you enjoyed the recipe please hit the

of the cake itself but you have to make a cake before you can make cookie cake bars so basically today's recipe is like a mrs. Fields cookie cake mrs. Fields was in like all the malls across America I don't think they had like regular stores but my mom loved going to the mall every time we go I would beg her beg her to take me to mrs. Fields because they have the best chocolate chip cookies with the M&Ms inside they were gooey and warm and just like a crunchy outside of a cookie oh my god it was the best and she was great about it she'd give me one of those cookies every time we go to the mall and I remember they have this glass window where you could see all the cookies inside and then on the one side they had all these things called cookie cakes basically a cookie cake is exactly what it sounds like you'd get it for your birthday or your graduation or anniversary whatever it would be a cake made out of chocolate chip cookies it was amazing so that's where due today we're making one of those except we're gonna make bars out of the cake it's gonna be delicious let's give them this one let's make some low-carb keto chocolate chip cookie cake deliciousness all right so first things first you want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees next you want to get out your food scale and a very large bowl and we're gonna start adding our liquid ingredients so to start things off we're gonna crack and add two large eggs to the bowl next we're gonna add a heaping half cup or about a hundred and 50 grams of some melted salted butter and the last liquid ingredient we're adding is a teaspoon of vanilla extract so now we're gonna take out our whisk and whisk all those ingredients together until they're combined and an eggy soupy consistency starts to form in the bowl once that does happen we're gonna get out our dry ingredients and start adding those to the bowl starting with some almond flour today I'm using the Bob's Red Mill superfine almond flour so what I recommend going with but any almond flour should work just don't use almond meal with that being said today we're adding one in three-quarters of a cup of the almond flour to our bowl that's about a hundred and seventy-five grams and then we're gonna be sweeping the recipe up with some granulated ureteral if you've never heard of girth at all it's a calorie free carb free sweetener I'm a huge fan of it and it's what I use in pretty much all my recipes so if you want to grab some there's a link in the video description below to do it but you can also probably find it in you grocery stores organic section or the natural section but anyways for today's recipe we're gonna be adding a cup or about a hundred grams of that stuff to our bowl we're also gonna add some coconut flour to the mix a quarter cup of coconut flour to be exact followed by a half a tablespoon of baking soda as well as just a pinch of salt and of course we have to add some chocolate chips so my favorite low-carb chocolate chip is the Lily's no sugar added chocolate chips they only have two net carbs per serving so I'm gonna be adding 1/2 a cup of those into the bowl and now we can take out a spatula and start folding all those ingredients together until a thick cookie dough starts to form and not only will some cookie dough start to form in that bowl but a big ball of cookie dough will start to form in the bowl and once that happens that's when we're gonna transfer the dough to a cake tray today I'm using an 11 by 7 cake tray but an 8 by 8 cake tray or a 9 by 9 cake tray should work just as well your baking time just might change a little bit so once you've got all of your cookie dough in the tray you want to take your spatula and just start pressing it out until it's equally spread out between the entire cake tray once you've done that and it's looking good and everything's even that's when you want to take it over to the oven and bake it for about 10 to 12 minutes just until the top stars turn golden brown and once the top of it starts to turn golden brown bats and you want to take it out of the oven it doesn't take long at all to bake you want to let it cool completely in the tray itself and then once it's completely cooled that's we can cut it into as many bars as you'd like it really depends on the size of your tray but check this out this is what they look like how delicious did these bars look so that's today's low-carb Akito chocolate chip cookie cake recipe a cookie cake bar recipe I mean it's a cake and a bar whatever you get what I'm saying I hope you guys enjoy this one of you make it I would give it a shot if you do I'd love to see a recreation of it so definitely tag me on Instagram I say this like I try to say this in every video because I love seeing the recreations my handle is in the video description below so you can find that there also links to all the products that I used to make the cookie cake it's tough to say cookie cake it's like a tongue twister that is in the video description below as well think eyes so much for watching I will see you in the next video [Music]", "U_xIw9pq0YA": "[Music] hi my name's Bubba awesome little bubble of hi I'm dawn also known as mama alright my name is bondo also known as Barney boy I love barn also known as the dad hi my name is Jana we're just a very competitive family for some reason I was like let's do a baking challenge I decided to pick something that we really make which is chocolate chip cookies and excited to try them god help us all they don't come into the kitchen unless it's to get a plate if there's a sales any pieces of cardboard or plastic in it you win surprise me I personally love chocolate chip cookies but I don't think I like making them as much least after today it does not say when that happens that's the most important part does look like sugar cookies more if anything don't look like chocolate chip cookies with me they're mine so far see one chocolate chip it tastes like a cookie it tastes fine to me I'm gonna try again do the hit okay so - chocolate chip please not too bad not too bad at all I like this city of their cooking I like this now I've taught me a lot of sugar a lot of moisture oh I'm gonna give it a 5 whoo give me five kind of I live with these people and I gotta go sleep and they might be up and they might be mad I mean it tastes like a cookie it just doesn't look like a cookie so I mean 10 as me we love no that's all you need to know what I'm doing all of Marsha a bunch of different recipes and I'll try to come up with my own kind this cookie got a lot of stuff going on with it it's a it's hard I think handling nuts in it I can see some chocolate chips for sure I like a complex cookie that means to me that stuff I got a flavor you got tins to it oh it has like this weird taste it's like this it's not becky mo very nutty and business dr. chips but they're not just like overpowers everything it's nice it's not overly sweet I've got the right balance to it when you get past the nut it tastes like a really good chocolate chip cookie it's just that you have to find a spot where there's not a lot of walnuts I would probably give this an 8 hi mr. clay - I give it a 4 it's not bad it's good you give it a 10 it's like an espresso chocolate chip cookie why did I make that it sounded interesting like it xx in here I guess it's gonna be more spread so than chocolate ooh there's like a real golden brown on there like my Browns like the brown act like a coated chocolate guessing it's not supposed to turn that round okay it's our new boil I like how I can see some of the chocolate chip like trying when you're melted on top of the cookie looks like it's kind of losing this cookie actually looks like in front of that doesn't mean it tastes like it smells like buck popcorn pug butter it's cookie kind of smells a little like coffee if anything this is not bad at all yeah chocolate chocolate it's not bad at all I like food has a taste to it but at the moment nothing's like worse than this one for sure this one's up there you got up in the morning and you uh made some coffee and put bark butter any instead of creamer or something thought what this tastes like I hate to say I want to give it a full minute I know if it tastes like a cookie it gonna get intent hey pretend that you don't need a bad water if everybody's eating this cookie today I'm sorry I feel like I should be okay I need some talk yeah well this is right here I can do chocolate chunks of my preference I ain't got no chocolate chunks I'm still talking to see up in there you know I'm kind of add some little cleavage the competition this is like a pancake it looks like a pancake - don't you feel like a cookie it smell like cooking baby's fighting it the memo it's this West chocolate chip challenge weather and putting effort into this of this course cooking partner no chocolate chips in it but we'll see what's our tanks I should have the kitchen I'm really convinced this is a pancake to give this person a - it's not a cookie even though it's tough hey no chocolate chips in it it tasted better didn't imitation do kegels I give it a five eight base ride huh it's better than up someone so here I make this one by it's a store Bob cook me I'm pretty sure they won't be disappointed I made enough cookies in my lifetime let them run around making cookies they've had these cookies before though just because one of my recipes see now you can totally connect business you know your basic chocolate chip cookie like the ones you will see in a store so I don't know if someone made this or not but this is small it's really really really light - you can't get chocolate chips like this this is just a store bought cookie be anonymous look store-bought it does but you could taste that was homemade this is chemically induced machine produced cooking I know this cookie so my cheated challenge was homemade Chuck chip cookie I'm gonna give it a three I saw like 80 or because it's not the one homemade I'll give this one a nine and only because I like soft cookies you know if it works it works [Music] [Music] you", "Igkp80BOmWU": "hi I'm chef Rafi and welcome to Lata's kitchen cookies are a delicious snack that kids enjoy especially with a glass of milk today I'm going to show you how to make homemade chocolate chip cookies made with Lotto butter let's get started [Music] now for the ingredients we need 295 grams of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of baking soda Latta beta this is at room temperature this is 225 grams 2 eggs chocolate chips 200 grams and 200 grams of sugar now the most important thing about the latter bottle cut it when it's hard into cubes and then let it sit at room temperature so that it becomes soft so that's what we start with into our bowl now mind if you use a microwave to trend soft in your but you have to be very careful because it can easily become too soft and we don't want it too soft that's why I'd rather you remove it early in the fridge and then let it just become warm into room temperature by itself now to this I'll add the sugar and then they get to whisk it until it's fully mixed so when it's fully mixed the sugar and the butter add the eggs and mix mind you when you're using but I try and use the unsalted butter especially when it comes to baking and in case you have salted butter and using salted butter skip the salt part of this recipe so that is ready now we're adding the dry ingredients which is the salt and bicarbonate to the flour and then we'll now add it to the butter mixture now because this mix is a little bit hard it's not a soft cookie dough that's why I'm using a spatula like this because if you use a whisk in fact when you're mixing the flour spread all over the surface as you're mixing it with a whisk or an electric mixer so they're days to mix until all the flour is fully mixed into the dough and then to this I'll add the chocolate chips what I did with the chocolate chips I added them I chopped up chocolate block but you can always use chocolate chips if you have some and try and use the dark chocolate ones not the milk chocolate because it will the milk chocolate tend to be too sweet especially when you're baking and now what is left is to place them on a baking tray lined with greaseproof of parchment paper what I'm also using another is an ice cream scoop because an ice cream scoop will be able to scoop even sized balls onto a baking tray but if you don't have an ice cream scoop you can still use two big spoons so you need to leave some space so that as they cook as they will spread so that they don't touch each other you need to give them a small press so that they are a little bit flat this will now bake in a preheated oven already preheated my oven at 180 decrease and they will bake for about 10 to 15 minutes how you know they're actually ready is you'll actually see them browning on the sides like this when they already know what you need to do is remove them from the baking tray what chocolate tends to do when it's still hot because it's still hot it will melt and stick to the baking paper and now you're going to serve them with Latta milk so the cookies are crunchy perfect combination I hope you've learned something to game this is like I said a perfect snap from the kids until next time see you in latter's kitchen goodbye", "5JGN2KqXteE": "Hello and welcome to in the \nkitchen with Matt, I am your host, Matt Taylor. Today, I'm going to show you \nhow to make eggless chocolate chip cookies. Oh, yeah. From time to time, I get asked \nthe question, what can be substituted for eggs and \ncookies and whatnot? And so I thought I would do a \nrecipe where it doesn't use any eggs, but they\ncould still turn out fantastic. It's really easy to \ndo simple ingredients. If I can do it, you can do it \nbefore I move on, make sure to subscribe to my channel and hit \nthat notification bill so you won't miss out on\nany of my new videos. Let's get Beijing down below. In the description, you'll find \na list of the ingredients and their amounts, as well as a \nlink to my website where you can print the full recipe. We are going to start with one \ncup of soft unsalted butter. Or you can use salted butter, \ntoo, if you like, one cup of packed light brown sugar, \none half cup of white granulated sugar, and then with \na hand mixer or a really sturdy whisk or like a\nwooden spoon, that's cream these ingredients together. All right. All right, perfect, \ntwo teaspoons of vanilla extract and now at this point \nis where I would add two eggs, but we're going to use \nthe egg substitute. So for every one egg, you need \ntwo tablespoons of water. So sense normally I would \ndo two eggs. This would be one fourth cup or \nfour tablespoons of water. And this adds the moisture to \nthe cookies that the eggs would do. But instead we're using water \nfor the moisture. Two teaspoons of oil. This is vegetable oil. You can use canola \noil or whatnot. And so normally one egg would \nhave one teaspoon of oil. Since we need two eggs worth, \nwe have two teaspoons of oil that rounds out \nthe wet ingredients. Let's blend those \nall together by. Come in and just\ngive those signs a scrape, set that aside and I \nhave my flower. And this is two and a half cups \nof all purpose flour, the last component of the eggs. Each egg requires two teaspoons \nof baking powder. So this is four total teaspoons \nof baking powder and that finishes off our \ntwo egg substitute. And in the normal \ncookie recipe, also calls for one teaspoon of baking soda and \nthen one half teaspoon of salt. To sum it up, one egg takes two \ntablespoons of water, one teaspoon of oil and two \nteaspoons of baking powder. And then I just double that \nbecause I needed two eggs for these cookies. And now I'm going\nto whisk all those dry ingredients together. All right, to set this aside, come back over here to the main \nball and now I am going to add in about a third of that flower. And now the star of this dish \nare the chocolate chefs, the major \nsemisweet chocolate chips. That's about two cups or 340 \ngrams or just one of the standard bags here in the \nUnited States on. Great, give the full scrape here. That's a more flower. And then the\nrest of the flower. All right, the cookie\ndough is done with it. Get rid of these beaters and guess what, since there's \nno eggs in these, you don't have to worry about not being \nable to eat this cookie dough. Of course, I would\nstill eat the cookie dough, even like the eggs. But, you know, the whole raw \neggs thing is got to be careful about that because I never was \ngrowing up or even still today. And what I normally do\nis I'll bring just the dough into the center. It's not necessarily something \nthat I like to do, but now it's ready to go and now \npreheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 176 Celsius. And then I just take two \ntablespoons and I will grab some dough here. About that much, it's like a \nbig heaping tablespoon worth and just drop it on your sheet \npan or cookie sheet and have it lined with a silicone mat, \nor you could use parchment paper. For those of you who follow \nthe show, you know that I love silicone mass. I use them all the time. And then you want to\nspace the cookies a couple of inches apart, usually you can get about 12 of \nthese on a sheet and then bake these in the oven again at \n375 Fahrenheit, 176 Celsius for eight to 12 minutes. If you want the cookies to be \nmore soft and chewy, bake it for a little bit less times \naround the eight to 10 minutes. If you want it to be more \ncrunchy than the 10 to 12 minute mark, somewhere around \nthere just depends. Everyone's oven is a \nlittle bit different. So just keep an eye on them. And when they come out of \nthe oven, they'll look something like this lightly. Golden brown on the top. And then what you'll do, \nyou'll let them sit on the cookie sheet for about five \nminutes before you transfer them to a wire rack. And what's going to happen is \nthey're going to cool down, but also they'll continue to \ncook a little bit on the sheet. Now, if I wanted these to be \nextra crunchy cookies, I would have baked them longer and they \nwould be more brown on top. I like mine more soft almost to \nthe part of a little bit, maybe underdone just \na little bit. That's just my preference. Bake them however you want. I want to show\nyou the bottom of this. Mackell Awesome. That is an amazing not \nburnt at all. Nice light golden brown. Amazing. And now I will come in here and \nbite into one and show you what it looks like on the inside. Oh yeah. Hmm. Look at that. Nice and soft. So amazing. All right, the English \nchocolate chip cookies are done, \nturned out fantastic, really soft and chewy \nand so delicious. This recipe makes about 32 \nfairly large cookies and depending on the size that \nyou make, make sure to bake them between eight \nto 12 minutes. This size was right\naround 11 or 12 minutes. And it was a perfect time. They're really easy to do. If I can do it, you can do it. I'm Matt Taylor. This has been another episode \nof In the Kitchen with Matt.
