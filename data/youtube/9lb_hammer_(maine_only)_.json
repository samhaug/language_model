{"QtqawimIxpk": "hello fellow Florida medical marijuana patients this is Florida medical marijuana reviews showing you today 9 pound hammer true leaves own indica dominant strain coming in at a whopping twenty two point seven total THC it is beautifully coated completely in trichomes and terpenes that we're gonna try to show you up close and personal today with our macro lens this my friends is truly a beautiful batch of flower I mean there has not been a caliber of flower like this that I have seen yet though I did just scoop some Girl Scout cookies and white buffalo that actually is just as frosty but just as pricey they all came in at 53 dollars an eighth those 3/8 all being 53 dollars an eighth range from total percentages of THC from as low as 19% all the way to 26% they're all just as dense just as frosty just barely smelly not crazy smelly not punching your face deliciously smelly so I truly don't know how other than just pure amounts of trichomes and the density that they've priced their particular eights other than that I have no idea that's truly an assumption because to me the puck yeah coming in at 21 and a half percent THC is just as powerful just as potent just as great as all of those other four and yet it's a 33 dollar eighth I just don't I don't see how they're doing it other than just maybe a dice roll or a guess or some guys just picking and choosing to make these beautiful trichomes on this particular strain they had to take an indica GU berry a hybrid Hel's OG and a sativa Jack the Ripper to cross completely to make this nine pound hammer strain and these beautiful trichomes all over this plant are just evidence of the handiwork that they made at this genetics lab to create this strain when it's ground up is when I actually got notes of a citrus smell at all but before that just sitting in in the 8th container it's not very pungent but it is still a delicious smell but it's more grassy maybe earthy - anything more than citrus or sweet like I've read that it should be or even fruity I believe is somewhat people have said the strain can be as far as medicinally it knocked it out of the park for what I need an indica to do I was able to sleep I felt great all over my body from being sore from boogie boarding and kayaking took that care of all of those problems so I thoroughly enjoyed the strain I felt like it was delicious it smoked very well it was cured very well it ground very well it was everything I needed it to do but again I could love a lower price tag so I do not think I will come back to the 9 pound hammer I'm going to go back and stick with something more affordable like the puck yeah that does just as well and just as much and just doesn't quite have the eye-popping stunning trichomes and dense structure that everyone wants to pay I guess 53 dollars for 1/8 so that is how I feel about the 9 pound from true leave it is great I like it if I were richer I'd buy it but right now I'm looking at something more affordable down the line but other than that it's a great indica strain and thanks for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews you", "_u964a0f38s": "you well then I'm having heavy

aloha elevators", "ttiYyaQ6F10": "[Music] so here we are at another booth exciting to talk to some growers right and then wife and husband combo huh Thanks proof from this rose jinx proof genetics hi good to see y'all and we also run a 501c autism charity in the state of Washington that's cool yes yeah we're always out collecting because we we donate iPads to nonverbal autistic children so they can find a way to communicate with the outside world and it's through the cannabis community that we are able to get all these donations and then we link into different universities in Washington State also to help find people who are in need tell me are you designing these strains for specific uses medically like for example autism some we have a high CBD strain that I believe is good for autism we really designed it actually for our veterans if a vet comes up to our booth today and lets me know their event they get a pack of it free we call it too many after the 22 many foundation the the suicide prevention for soldiers foundation and uh yeah that's i mean we've we've created some magnificent strains nine pound hammer when the michigan cup just a month ago but I mean our passion and the thing we're most proud proud about is helping autistic kids so we've done we do raffles all the time we've probably close to raising a hundred thousand dollars there is no community as giving as this committee when we first started we hit up like big businesses and [ __ ] we couldn't squeeze blood from a turnip as soon as we started cruising around the marijuana community BAM it's a big family absolutely giving family caring family absolutely everybody he's been super nice to us to talk to us and if we dig it we dig it ed let me ask you this tell me about your your strain like is it a sativa dominant indica dominant like what does the plant look like is it tall huge we have a several strains actually but the one that when the cup is a nine pound hammer it's a it's a pretty good sized strain it usually kind of will turn on maroon kind of purple it's super heavy foot super stony like I'm a glassblower I don't smoke lamb pound hammer unless I take my weed to my torch it's otherwise like magically my recliner pops open and my tv turns on it's like it's that kind of weave we have many sativa as hybrids and we have the menues down here you know all of our different strains one of the things I'm really into is creating limited-edition strains so I'll do small batches once they're sold out I'll never release them again it's just kind of fun to have keep a mom of them maybe or a clone if not I always at least set aside a package you know like 100 seeds for myself some tissue samples maybe in a petri dish somewhere freezer because even though I won't read breed limited editions I will breed them to other things and stuff like that so yeah I kind of got that yeah and I kind of got that collector gene into me so that's kind of where that limited-edition how I did it I did it I have my own collection of seats and strains myself few strains out there that I'm not a hater like they're absolutely bomb but they're almost like Budweiser now like you know every person here got the cutting of it cookies Girl Scout cookies yeah a little too much of that those are bomb strains I've even bread to go gorilla glue to my hammer cookies also you know but like say it's just nice to have something everybody has a cool hybrid it's a really cool hybrid and it's easy to grow I'll tell you that I think that's why a lot of growers like it but you know I like to change it up a little bit like let's get some like really long lanky sativas with these little tiny buds but they're like super powerful super packed but you don't I mean a lot of times people don't want to grow that way because they're going for you wait wait wait so anyways it's cool that connoisseurs and growers let such as yourself can still you know develop those types of strains and bring those to light which I dig yeah we were I really enjoy it so we started out with TJ sub cool after about seven eight years it was time to go on turn on so we're our own company now Jenks group genetics underscore jinx proof on Instagram if anyone wants to check us out well we'll put that on our link to this particular video and also if I can mention we do have a North West family for autism Facebook page and you can make charity donations there if you are interested or see what our upcoming events are to what you can be part of and we are a legal 501 C we're not just some dudes collecting money cuz you know you never really knows where it goes so you don't want to get audited as a charity like they cut it like there's a dollar miss and then you can't show where it went they come down hard so but but I like that because it shows that we're legit and that the money is going the appropriate places and also and another thing all y'all that haven't seen my Instagram every day one thing I'm really known for almost more than my strengths is every morning and every night I do a positive affirmation video and I put it up and I put a little riding there and controlling the vibrations huh most people that will come up here today that want to meet me or shake my hand that's usually what it is is they want to thank me for the positive videos and that it helps them not realizing that it helps me a lot too so check that out if that's is it Americans are programmed every day you know with the stuff that they see on TV it's cool to reprogram yourself so that you can actually take a little bit more control of what's going on with your you know your direction right deprogram exactly exactly you know with all the crap on you know social media and stuff like that it's really fun putting something nice out there and getting a positive response I can feel good about you guys company like I feel better you know it's cool that you guys are doing something good we will [Music]", "b3jxqpRXE54": "[Music] this time pound hammer if you ever oh my sighs oh my sighs take this camel short took captain tell him I'm go tell him I'm gone he should ask you where I went to

[Music] oh my flash", "tRqLXr8Ame0": "one two one two three four [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] hey everyone welcome back to music with ryan thank you for joining me as you just saw and heard there i played three arrangements of the classic bluegrass two nine pound hammer in the key of g now we're going to cover this first arrangement right now here on youtube i'll have the tabs up on the screen if you want to access everything download all the tabs for all the arrangements plus the audio backing tracks at four different speeds and the sound slice click the link in the box to learn how i'm also going to include two rhythm lessons as well that will be all tabbed out so all in all you're gonna get three solos and two rhythm lessons so this is all-encompassing it's kind of like a study piece here for this bluegrass standard so let's get in the first arrangement thanks for watching all right so let's go ahead and put those first four measures up on the screen there here's the first four measures what they sound like oh one two ready go one [Music] okay really straight ahead one two three four one okay so right there in measure one we've got um you know quarter note rest and then the pickup starts on beat two and we're gonna do pickups in all three of these arrangements they'll all be kind of slightly different so for this first one it starts on b2 it's gonna be two eighth notes on the d string and then a quarter note and then two zero pull on the b and then measure two we're going to play the open g and then strum the bottom half of the g chord and then open g again and strum the next measure is gonna be open g and then i'm gonna do three four hammer i'm gonna use my second finger and third finger so hammering with my third finger that's twice in a row and i'm gonna shift down to the second fret of the g so [Music] and then going on the next measure open g note and then i'm gonna go over top of the c chord so i play the open g and then i strum zero to hammer on the d and strum and in this arrangement or in nine pound hammer we're gonna doing a lot of the flatted three okay the um b flat no we're going to be going from the b flat into the b natural uh from the a into the b flat just that little flat of three adds a lot of character to this tune and you know it's often done within the melody here so on those first four measures one more time one two three four one okay pro tip right here um when you're doing that hammer on three to four make sure you keep your finger down on the fretboard okay keep that finger down because you're gonna go right back to it and then we're going to shift down with it too to the second fret so if you lift off of there it won't be as smooth perhaps there's more room for mistake and so forth so you know keep that finger fretted the whole time because we're gonna be doing this again in some other measures as well [Music] okay then moving on the next four sound like this talk about that strumming pattern in there a little bit as well but okay the melody is rather simple in there right so measure five we're still in the c chord i'm gonna play that bass note c and then it's gonna be open g twice and then three four slide on the g i'm gonna use my pinky here and then open g back to second fret d [Music] next measure we're going to land on the open d but get ready to strum the g chord here so one two three and four so down down up down that's what those ties are in there we're not going to play beat three okay um there's no pick direction marked below it and this is a very common strumming pattern which i'll cover in the rhythm lessons as well for this tune but um this is just again it's a nice little pattern to kind of fill in the space and provide enough energy okay and then measure seven we're going to play open d and then melody stays on that d string right there so i just did a bunch of eighth notes on the d string so two [Music] and then do that same strumming pattern up down all four of those together now two already go went on just a bit there you can slide there with the third finger or the pinky it's just i'm kind of in my c position and then when things get going a little fast i probably just my pinky's free so i'll do the most efficient move possible let's do all eight of the first the first eight measures here all together so one two three four one okay cool so moving on now kind of had that first phrase and now we're gonna kind of come into the second phrase or the second uh sentence if you will the piece it sounds like this dude ready go okay some new things there and some things we've already done measure nine we'll play the open g um and then we're gonna go on the third fret of the b string and we got a little eighth note run here for sure so we got two and three and then the open height e back to three on the b and open b so one next measure 3 4 slide on the g then open g and then kind of that little strumming pattern that we've already worked on right just kind of half of it um just in there to fill things up keep the rhythm going in the right hand we don't want to just sit still okay i'm trying to create a basic melody but i want to keep the momentum and the pulse going in the right hand in our solo so it can stand alone if you will if need be so up down up down that note is tied in there so uh measure nine and ten up down next measure we've already done this in the piece open g three four hammer on the g twice down to second fret and then measure 12 we go to the c chord but open g note is the melody strum zero to hammer on the d strum all four of them together two ready go so again one thing to keep in mind i talk about a lot of my rhythm lessons and even in my solos is that the right hand kind of always needs to be going up and down no matter if you're hitting strings or not just to help you keep the flow you know you don't want to just hit a note and then just stay you know be stiff or whatnot but even if the movement's very little and when we get playing fast we're going to have to make it smaller but keeping that right hand kind of going can really help with the feel and the timing of your solo and or rhythm all right then so moving on to the last four measures here they sound like this ready go so i measure 13 i'm on the c chord still and we've already done this did the same thing in this in the c to begin with we do the same thing here for the c chords a string third fret and then open g twice three four slide with the third or pinky and open g second fret d measure 14 open d we strum the g chord right so one two three and four and measure 15 changes to the d chords i'll play a d note and then i'm gonna do i'm gonna slide up to the three and the four three on the b four on the g one and i'm sorry it will be two and then down a fret three four kind of chromatically walking down one two and three four passage i use uh very often i measure 16 open g second fret d and then little eighth note run to end it open d second fret a zero two hammer on the a and then third fret low e back into my strumming right all four of those two ready go okay so there's the lesson uh for the first arrangement i'm gonna play through the um the whole thing um all 16 bars from the start to finish and you can play right along with me so here we go one two three four one [Music] so okay there it is if you want to access the other two arrangements and download the tabs and the audio tracks for all of these plus the rhythm stuff access to slow down looper click the link in the box to learn how if you want to watch some other videos like this in bluegrass carter style click the boxes around me here to watch some more videos on youtube until next time take care you", "1PwwKxUL0AA": "all right welcome back everybody purpose of this video is to try to teach people how to determine female seeds for male seeds okay if you have feminized seeds they're female don't even try this okay so this is this what I learned a long long time ago I wouldn't say it's exactly 100% because it's up to you know your own discretion so there's a lot of human interference in there but it's about 90 95 percent accurate if you actually are really like really a you know quality controlled about I was gonna say anal whatever but you know if you're really anal about it and you really really really only go for strict strict looks then you can pull it off 100% okay but this is what I come up with okay the female seeds look look a lot like this okay and if you see these seeds here see how they have like a little top to them okay now if you were look to look on this top you'll see a perfect circle where's my camera okay you'll see perfect circles it kind of looks like a little volcano maybe something like that oh look what I just found out guys so my cameras over here but when I put things over here it gets blurry when I put things over here they become clear oh you look nice I can work see how blurry though we did just remember that when you guys are trying to show stuff you put it right in front of you camera is blurry if you put it over there look how clear so so that's a perfect circle in there and it's like the volcano shape okay so you want to look for on the top of the seeds you want it to have like a little Ridge it doesn't have to be that defined these are pictures so you completely understand what I'm talking about okay they're a little over exaggerated so you're gonna see a little bit of a climb with in the middle will be a perfect circle okay and that's where actually the seed attaches to the actual button okay so you can see the top of the seeds it's the round piece and then you'll have you know the the sides of the little volcano that you'll be able to see from the top it'll look like you know you know it look like puckering up and then you have a complete perfect circle in the center and then from the side you see will look something like this okay the male seeds have a smaller Ridge or no Ridge at all okay do not confuse male seeds with immature seeds okay these are immature seeds they're super flat on the top but you can tell they have not grown yet okay those are immature seeds okay they have not completely formed do not confuse this with a male seed okay now mind you this probably would have formed into a male seed although it is not fully matured yet but this is how a male seed will look see how it has a kind of slight bump to it okay let's go to a male seed okay see how it's got slightly kind of inclined raised okay see it but it's flat it is flat it looks like a but okay and there is a circle in there but the circle will not be perfect it will not be centered perfectly normally and it will be flat looking and look kind of like you know it'll be like that you have a circle and there will be a weird thing around it and they look like little bloodshot lines spitting out of it and they'll look like these seats here these are 100% sure for sure mail seeds okay no doubt in my mind so this is just the easy way and I went through a whole bunch of different seeds to find males from females but um it's just an easy way if you're going through stuff like this and you want to find female and male seeds okay yeah yeah yeah that's a lot of seeds I got a couple of these okay I'm sure all you do to these right here people these are all skunk baby all skunk you see there's some immature ones in there blah blah blah whatever but yeah that's what these are so I hope this helps you guys you can determine your seeds a lot faster before you ever stick them in the dirt okay so try this technique out you know give me feedback see if it works for you works for me I know mother nature it also does this way works for her that's how we do it you know and like I said it's all up to human discretion you know you might look at you might look at a seed and say on all about by what he was saying that that might be a male but that's a female female seed perfectly round circle with the but you know the volcano look to it okay male seed are me female seed pardon me okay that's how we do it see that male seed see that you can see the volcano to it but look how flat it is okay male seed so I hope this guys this helps you guys I just thought I'd make this real quick while I was doing the harvest I forgot I had told somebody I was gonna make this for them so hopefully they watch this and you know pick up a future a few tricks are just bit my tongue so now I'm gonna get back to harvesting people so have a good evening", "rq-_iG9soRQ": "you to navigate it back again in the 4k garden we're starting week seven everything is looking really nice right now getting that flush started like to use does freshwater and says he's armed in week seven and I'll move on it's just nothing but straight ro water in the eighth we've been looking at some of the nine how hammers that are in as you guys can see it's super frosting stuff every little bit of it you guys have seen in the past I like to do a really good lollipop job on these buds they don't extend too far down but even the bottom lowers on stuff is really killing no signs of any kind of pollination bananas now that [ __ ] everything has been really smooth sailing you guys probably remember I had a little bit of an issue a few weeks back but there has been no sign of anything since since this is the very beginning of week four you know and I [ __ ] off a couple of those little nail polish tags off pretty much every one of these nine pound found a couple sacks what all the one that is and you know I just pluck them off and I haven't had any kind of recurrence so this one right here is that cut that had that really bad clawing from nitrogen now I've been told by the breeder that they really do not care for nitrogen when it went when they go into one you know when they're in flower so I'm going to take that under you know under advisement for the next run and definitely cut back a little bit on my base nutrient and consider not even giving them cow Matic because I don't think they needed it now again that's really the only cut Murphy know that I really saw it that dramatically on but just about all of them showed some signs of a little too much nitrogen maybe it's a nun lowers crawling a little bit but that's you know it's still a good sign that you know they had plenty of nitrogen more than enough let's take a little stroll around the around the room here you've also got this blue widow just pretty much full-blown now she's starting to really get dark and weeds and stuff like that I really like when she starts to turn and finish off or with this out of the room you look at some of the things over here this right here as you can see she's starting to fade quite a bit already she's only had fresh the fresh wood since he's on one time already that was last night and she is already starting to yellow out a little bit but this is one of my favorites right here and just super stinky and real loud it's super frosty to all of it like I said footwork [Music] and it's got some nice colas here that one over there with that nitrogen clawing and that [ __ ] I can tell that shit's going to be purple as hell when it's done she's frosting your [ __ ] though as you guys can see I mean just about every part of the leaves are just coated it's that number seven we're looking at right now it's getting on the lowers there is crazy I can't wait to start trimming this stuff because you know it would be very very liver when it comes to filling up my my bin for you know the stuff I'm gonna blow for oil and stuff material here doesn't look like I'm gonna have a lot of popcorn or anything like that so I'll be using pretty decent but it's man and I think it's going to be some real fire a similar female this year is actually pin number six not filling out like some of the other buzz but then again this one could have been lollipop a lot better a couple of these Pinos definitely stretched a lot more than the others though I like this one right here stay nice and short I really only seen to Syria like distinct phenotypes in this garden the rest of it's all pretty much just the same as those you know you've got either something like this or something like the last one we looked at back here we got that Doctor Who doing really really well this run phenomenal my doctor who's got a very very unique flavor it's really nice good and strong super-healthy grower too and it doesn't even need that tomato cage you know that's the only plan I've got that I really don't have to worry about any kind of staking not also the case I've got to say it's a lot like that too but I don't really have to use that gauge but it puts on so much weight that I find that it's it's definitely good to have the security of a cage there you can see she likes to put something put together some really big colas she's hella chunky there's a ton of Amarna to I mean the ace really really yield at this time the final final pool twelve or fourteen ounces off and I'll be really surprised there's just we got them - back there the right there man I really like that I don't care so much for the one back in that corner it's a lot like to cut directly in front of me but it definitely has a hard structure building all these plans very similarly this one here just decided to do its own thing and I doubt that I can really show you guys what I mean where I'm standing but it's spread out like just crazy there's a nice uniform shape to most of my plans you know Viet some of them may be a little bit taller some a little bit shorter the way that I basically build my plants is it's the same with everything and if a plant doesn't really conform to the way that I do that I generally don't like that cut too much anyway there's not a whole lot else to report you know I wanted to make one last video or I'm really talking about how things are going and pretty much from this point on on this craft you guys are probably going to be seeing something other sides and stuff like that until I finished so look forward to that and you know if you guys have any questions or comments about how this 9-pound everything like that's going you know feel free to leave them I'll try to give you answers especially for you know the good questions a lot of people have lately been asking me questions that you can really have answered if you just watch one other video of mine for the most part I mean there's I tend to really go over everything in every video you know if I miss something just watch the last video you probably be in there you know what I mean everything went great though guys I've got to say you know I thought in starting week four I thought things are gonna get really bad in here and things turned out great so far I think we are past the point where anything bad can really happen you know I don't see any of the harmony issues coming back even if they do I think we're good to go I think everything in here is just about done to the point where we'll finish the next two weeks out and it's harvest time so lots of question to do I have lots and lots of trimming to do and a whole lot of extractions so I want to thank you guys for watching I'll see you next time you", "hchSvCgrYrM": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I have a comparison video between 9 pound hammer minis from true leave with 9 pound hammer regular buds from true leave so let's see what the THC is on the Mining's we got seventeen point six percent THC 0.5 percent CVG for a total 18.1% t8 cannabinoids and for the full size we have eighteen point three percent THC 0.5 percent CVG for a total 18.8% cannabinoids alright so let's get these minis opened up and it's the it's the jars of doom you know they gotta have jars that are really hard for people to open for some reason your medicine has to be that way guys see the seals pretty good on this looks like yeah it's not much of a bounce to it though see what's inside alright these look like some really nice little nugs in there 9 pound hammer this is the minis take a closer look at well let's get a smell first alright so the smell from these is very purple that's what I that's what I'd say it's got a sourness to it maybe a little penis but overall I smell that purple smell I want to figure out what that is it smells really good alright let's take a look at these things all right it'd look really nice as you can see these buds are just totally covered in tri cones they're really well developed little nugs these are not Airy wispy buds these are fully mature nugs that are just small and that's what I've come to expect out of truly minis between what I've gotten and what I've seen on the forums that's what I expect now because that's what they've been dishing out all right now let's open up the regular nine pound hammer eight here we've got the minis see if I can get that to stand up right there on this side we'll have the full-size let's check the seal on the full-size jar looks like the seal is intact go ahead and break the seal all right oh we got some nice nugs in here see let me compare these smells here hmm I would say these minis are a lot sweeter and smell and these have a lot more of the sourness to it and it's like a I'm thinking a candy sourness smell almost artificial smellin like like a lime candy or something it's really interesting just dump these mugs out oh wow look at this guy's it looks like we only got about seven eight nodes here that's good look at this man all right I'm liking what I see these look like they're maybe a little bit more mature than the smaller ones the smell is more pungent and well-developed it's more of a well-rounded smell to it deeper bolder smell all right let's go in for some close-ups of this stuff at the nine pound hammer Minnie's up close as you can see they're really nice well-developed little buds we've got a nice coating a trichomes on them there's a bit of leaf enos tiny bit of leaving as you can see to them not a huge amount take a look at that some beautiful stuff that's for sure it's really good try cone coating is nice-looking the color of these tri cones is very close to that of the trichomes on the full eighth you know I don't know if you saw my video yesterday where I compared the lemon og cush Mini with the lemon og cush full size and you can see a definite difference in the trichomes as far as their maturity their color that kind of thing all right let's take a look at the nine pound hammer full-size buds and these things are just beautiful man these are even better like more thoroughly coated with trichomes the smell is better on them they're just overall more well-developed buds I probably give you a higher quality experience overall and just look how sandy these things are man looks so good alright let's go in for a little bit of a closer view alright now we've got a real close-up let's take a look at the minis first trichomes right there they look so good nice furry coating all over the buds pretty little orange hairs everywhere there you go yo fir that thing is it's a little bit of leaf eNOS on some of them tiny bit of leaf eNOS I should say it's not not anything like some other batches you might get from other places and worth mentioning though let's take a look at the full-size wow I mean the difference really is impressive between the two while on the minis you did see a really nice coating of tri cones these are just really nice you can look through here you start to see those big heads forming on these things the smell coming off of this plate is amazing it's a really pungent smell and like I said I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but it smells like some purple strains I've smelled before like maybe granddaddy purp or something like that we'll look at that one oh man is it snowing or something are they evolving they evolving a winter coat oh yeah look at that you can see some really fat heads in this nice it's really good check out check out that Rando big fat head in there you see a couple more over towards this into the boat you so I'd say these are the trichomes aren't as big and fat and plump as the lemon OG Kush was still looking very nice though all right let's get this stuff weighed up and toked up all right now let's get these suckers wait up there the scale of course first I think we'll weigh the regular size since they're easier to get off the plate you got 3.6 nice so point one over on those tear that scale again just in case whoa holy cow four point one oh man I did it again guys it's like hitting the lottery on Thanksgiving what you're gonna do you're gonna talk it up it's what you're gonna do that's some really cool stuff right there I like having 4.1 man so this is half a gram half a gram over what should actually it's plenty six grams but it's it's half a gram over the regular jar and point six over what it should be so excellent deal for 27 bucks or 21 60 or 20% off heck yeah all right let's see so nine pound hammer is it's been around for a while in the system it's one of the go-to strains of true leave a lot of people love it a lot of people hate it a lot of people love it for night time a lot of people say it doesn't do much for them nine pound hammer is an indica dominant hybrid it's a cross between GU berryhill's OG and Jack the Ripper pretty good strain I've enjoyed it the times that I've had it I haven't had any problems with it so pretty good stuff now let's get some of this toked up thank for the review I'm gonna review the minis because that's really what everyone is interested in getting nowadays it's the mini so pick out some nice buds they're all really nice-looking but I want to get some dents one here we go this is look at this man this thing is the densest little nub of kryptonite kind of looking stuff and here's another really just covered node I'll use these to pack my bowl might not even need to honestly this one is really nice and dense this strain seems to have some really dense nugs I really like that I'm kind of disappointed in the lemon og cush minis I opened yesterday though that jar strikes me more as a joint roll in the scroll on a joint rolling jar you know so I don't know if you guys have that kind of thing like you know I grade in my batches that I get and like you know if this it's not that great if it's got a bunch of seeds in it I just consider it a joint rolling batch in that way I can roll big old joints out of it not worry too much about wasting something that's beautiful so I'd consider the lemon og cush from yesterday a joint rolling batch this batch right here I'll hustle man it's a vaping batch I want to savor the flavor I want to get the full effects out of it dang where'd that little one go that I was gonna use huh oh well I'll use this one maybe I already cut it up hey man this stuff is nice and sticky it's just covered when I did get there was one little stem in here I saw I don't want to be you know full disclosure here I did get a stem but 4.1 I mean come on 4.1 that all bundled up there so I can cut it up nice and fine all right Thank You Dade and use my splinters II see what this cuz I think this is gonna pack a big hole punch so I'm gonna let it do its best to me the splinters he really also packs a punch see I got it packed there I don't want to pack it down too tight go ahead and let this thing heat up for 10 seconds before I start hitting it I'm ease into a hit not much but I could definitely feel it oh man okay this strain tastes beautiful he's got kind of a pine eNOS to it but also that purple flavor really got to look that flavor of it maybe maybe it's a kind of a flowery flavor that purple flavor I'm not really sure like maybe some dried flower buds I've smelled before or something like that but it's really nice maybe dried hibiscus almost but a little bit more funky it's really nice really love the flavor on this thing but one thing I feel like one thing I feel like I need to do is is learn a lot more about flavor terminology and you know stuff like that aromas well I can more accurately tell you what this stuff tastes like see you start to get some vapor in there oh wow some good hits this thing always hits me so fast sorry to get sniffily feel it in my face no that's one really heat up see if I get a good old cloud maker going here oh my goodness man blow my nose again oh man so I'm that bigger hit I'm starting to get a little crazy fruit coming through maybe just a look at oh man it's like barely even cooked dang we're gonna be here for wild boys well that'll be here for a while boys and you really got to work this thing it's like it's a it's analog for sure you know it's not your digital normal digital bait this isn't the kind that you just turn it on and you do whatever you want to you got to play it like an instrument and man if you play it right it rewards you it really does so you gotta learn to play this thing oh hey kitty kitty hey baby kitty cat yeah this isn't for you baby you're gonna have to go away for a little bit be right back all right I'm back had to give that little kitty something that Thanksgiving on a little sour cream did the trick all right oh yeah it started crank out that vapor that was a really smooth hip for how much paper I got surprised usually it's usually be really killing me just a couple light coughs I'm deal with that yeah this thing is all about changing up the speed of the draw and the duration oh wow it's now it's getting a lot more of a greener flavor to it like all of a sudden maybe even a sweet peas flavor like a sugar snap peas that kind of thing interesting you'll see what we got in here now starting to get to it mmm I'm starting to get through this here almost done with it man I'm feeling pretty good um I'm a little surprised you know this is a lot more clear-headed than I would expect from nine pound hammer I feel great but in a very clear-headed way which is interesting like I don't feel groggy so you know take from that what you will I guess it can vary person to person but yeah I don't feel tired and groggy from this I feel just fine and it feels good really good I've definitely felt a lot more indica indica like effects from like Starkiller's a good one for that another one off the top of my head well let me know gee cush there you go I took a really good one for that I'm not getting very much vapor off of this and it's tasting pretty toasty so I think I pretty much cook this goose even though it doesn't really look totally toasted here let me try during this up a little bit no give it one more hit and if that don't work then I guess we're doing oh yeah that did it just give it a good stir Oh firmly into toasty territory now definitely at the end of the bolt it's a nice vapor there oh very toasty oh yeah it's starting to reduce in volume - I'll buy a lot probably buy a third at this point which is great I mean think about that that means all those trichomes were taking up a lot of physical space all right well it looks like I've cooked this one looks like I've cooked this one all the way through I'm not getting very much off of it and it's brown all right so there we have it get these two things on the plate again nine pound hammer minis versus full-size minis effects are great they don't feel really heavy to me I feel awesome right now I don't feel tired or you know couch locked or anything like that so this is nine pound hammer minis these are $27 they're about 24 bucks with 10% off and about 2160 with 20% off this is an excellent deal especially if you get 4.1 grams out of it like I did these are the nine pound hammer on the side full-size these costs fifty three dollars and eight very expensive for what it is beautiful buds it smells really nice nice effects I wouldn't say they're on the sedative side or anything like that I'd just say that it's a really nice high and so yeah if you get these on sale and you could get it down to what let's see 43 bucks so 20% off they're around 43 bucks or something like 42 for the jar it makes it reasonable ish but it's still way too high so wait for the minis I mean you know it's such a good deal all right guys thank you very much for watching y'all have a happy Thanksgiving you guys I just wanted to show you this bud it's out of the Florida Medical system it's a legal bud what do you guys think about it what's that but make you think does it remind you of anything any strains any dispensaries any effects how does this bud make you feel when you look at it what would you say about this bud if you had to say something about it does this bud look good to you you look like a high quality bud all right I'm going a little bit closer all right let's get a really good close-up of that bud what do you think about it you think of any names or places when you see this bud any feelings or experiences what's this bud remind you of you think it looks like a good bud how's this but make you feel what do you think about this bud alright thank you for watching you have a good one", "l8RVwccZdRQ": "hi everybody welcome back to mando lessons in this lesson I'm going to be teaching the song it's going to be a series actually that I'm going to be working on the song nine pound hammer I know it by the title of nine pound hammer there's a bunch of other names for it and variations of the song some people call it take this hammer it's also closely related to Swannanoa tunnel or Asheville Junction they're all in the same vein sound very similar so um this is sort of going to be a blanket lesson for those style of song I'm going to be working in this series to get you going with the melody and get in the chord structure under your fingers and then I'm going to break out into doing some kind of chop bluegrass chalk style accompaniment behind singing and then also working on playing in a couple different keys both chords and the melody and a little bit of a break that I've put together so it's going to be kind of serve as many Piper systems as I can kind of crammed in and a couple lessons so uh this is a lesson for my website Mandel lessons.com you can find tons of lessons over there a lot of tunes some songs bunch of techniques beginner series there's sheet music play along tracks you name it over there it's all free it's all written by donations so if you care to donate there's a couple ways to do that over at the website and in the description of this video that said the lessons will always be free I'll point out a new lesson every Thursday so please subscribe let's get back to the music here I'm going to be working out of the key of a just for a change because a lot of the other songs I've got on the website are in Avenue and key G and I think D but I'm going to work out of the key of a I'll probably using some of these chop shapes doop doop so if you're unfamiliar with those check out the lesson on my website on chop shapes I'll play through it a little bit and this so you get a sense of how my version goes again you know there's lots of versions I'm saying - the right one it's just what I know sounds like this this man's down hammer its little too heavy come outside come outside buddy don't you roll so slow how can ever go to mouth just see my baby ain't come day no income man that can arrow so there it is that's the song so I've been using that kind of CHOP backbeat cord so I recommend getting those shapes underneath your fingers um those top shapes definitely take a little learning stuff you know other a a it's just the chords are a D and E so if you know other versions of those chords that um you want to work with until you get those shapes under your fingers by all means use those they'll sound they'll sound good as well and what I like to do with any song that I learned is just start out by going through the lyrics and I'll have the lyrics and the chords written out on my website for this song going through the lyrics and just sort of playing the chord when it happens so this song has like a nice long pick up this man pound hammer and on hammer is your first a chord so what I like to do is kind of run through it and this man pound healer a it's a little too heavy the D chord on heavy but it for my side II buddy for my side and deck a and then the course is the same rollin don't you roll so slow how can I roll when the wheels won't go and that's the whole you know it's a short verse and the short chorus or refrain that's the whole thing and it just repeats through a bunch of floating lyrics you'll find everybody has a different set of lyrics for this great song right for kind of jamming out to so once once you get that feeling in your head I'll do that one more time it uh you know that's a great way to start any song it's how I start any song that I learned I go right for you know just figuring out where the chords are and where they change I don't worry about singing or playing in time just go right go get the very basic so I'll do that one more time this nine pound a it's a little too deep chord here comes an e then back to a man the chorus roll on a four don't you roll so deep how can i when the wheels won't a so get that feeling into your head you know go look up the words over on my website and just sort of play the chord where you see it written above the word and then once that's feeling familiar to you just try to get a little bit of this backbeat and there's a lesson over on Mendel essence calm on both how to play this chord shape and how to get this backbeat feel into your playing so so it's kind of a walk in two three this nine pound hammer it's a little too heavy for my for my buddy so that's sort of what it sounds like with a kind of basic just offbeat cha you can also spice it up a little bit with a little bit of downbeat so what I'm doing here is so I'm just hitting the what's the g-string as a little kind of bass top big jump big jump bees - bees - bees - please like this this 9-pound hanging it's a little too heavy for my size but it's in my side roll on buddy don't you reel so strong happy arrow when the little I sped up a little bit this nine pounds [Music] for my so how can i when the wheels don't go um and if you're familiar with those you know if that's still feeling good and you want something a little extra [Music] you can add a little bit of upstroke to it again not much the role of the mandolin in bluegrass really gives gives a lot of focus on that met offbeat that's sort of where you're made a rhythm is going to be but you can add a little bit of that day you live it up everyone [Music] nice spills up baby jumped up base jump d D D and that sounds like this this man pound hammer this little for my [Music] dinner in the window so that's that I think that's probably a good place to stop for this lesson again get to get the melody into your head get the the chord structure under your fingers and then start working on those chop shapes and getting that off beat rhythm really solid and your fingers great to use a metronome with this great too if you can find a version in a great to play along with that again if you need help with those chop shapes or playing on that in that offbeat style check out the technique and fundamental section of mando lessons calm and stay tuned for the next lesson in the series where I'm going to work on playing a little bit of a break that I kind of made for this song that follows melody but also kind of steps away from melody a little bit as well so thanks again for watching and hope to see you again soon bye bye", "0SsC_QktJro": "heyo Doctorow quarterback with the official last video of this series so as you can see I've chopped a lot maybe you can't see but uh there's not a lot left well there's a lot left for all the smaller stuff so be down restless we'll be down by the app into the afternoon but and it's looking good it's looking good let's take a look at this I got this over here Oh looks [ __ ] great I appreciate that my associate here buddy Baker thank you someone needed a trim and job so yeah this will be it so just want to say thanks for watching appreciate it until next time please", "kbsdvP4e4oQ": "[Music] [Music] whoa hi this is Jeff ho wolde a lot of my beginning students who want to play with others or go to jam sessions have asked me to write out arrangements to popular songs that are very easy but still sound like the song today we will be learning an easy arrangement to nine pound hammer once you learn this version to nine pound hammer you can play lead in your next jam session if you want to move on to a slightly harder arrangement you can go to the premium download for nine pound hammer where we will show you two additional solos that are based on the solo in this lesson now would be a good time to print out the PDF which comes with this lesson let's begin [Music] let's break this down we start the break with a to note lead-in then in measure 2 we play a forward roll this forward roll starts with the third string we continue the forward roll in measure 3 but you will notice that the second note of the roll is a second string instead of a third string so playing the first three measures goes like [Music] okay now one of the most important things is to be able to get that C shape onto the fingerboard and what we basically do is we make the shape in the air and we place it down on the fingerboard at the same time so when we hit play major four we have the C shape in place we play the third string open with a thumb let's watch that again so after we come out of the third measure which is and then we go okay then we go to the sixth measure which is a forward roll then this measure seven then starting in measure 8 forward role playing the first note so as I say probably the most important thing is to make sure you practice that see and the best way to do it is to go ahead take the C off put it back on take it off make it in the air put it back on and keep doing that do that isn't separate exercise without playing we will now play the solo at three different speeds along with the metronome to help you practice one two three four one two [Music] now we'll do it a little bit faster 1 2 3 4 1 2 [Music] and now slightly faster one two three four one two [Music] if you want to play a slightly harder version - 9 pound hammer go to the premium download entitled 9 pound hammer I will now play the two solos that appear in the premium download so that you can hear how they sound here is the first solo [Music] now for the second solo [Music] [Music] as you play through nine pound hammer concentrate on playing evenly and with good timing this is Jeff oh wow see you next time", "wqlNfSYnXao": "[Music] [Music] i got [Music] [ __ ] [Music] you know i go crazy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i stand on everything i say so [ __ ] i ain't just blowing [Music] you [ __ ] [Music] you", "yurXIhVW_iM": "[Music] i who is this course person with that foreign accent [Music] do [Music] do welcome to this lesson and this is a lesson on tone right's nine pound hem from the homespun tape and i would call this an advanced lesson i have just listened to it and it's not 100 perfect note for note but i think i'm close anyway so i'm going to start off by playing it as slowly as i can free [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] this that's probably the slowest i can play without losing myself so let's start with the intro this is a hard hard lesson okay [Music] so do that until you get that part down [Music] okay [Music] do an open d string there [Music] sorry [Music] he does something like that [Music] [Music] let's start from the beginning so you can nail this part before you move on [Music] one more time i'm sorry [Music] he often uses ring finger or whatever but you can use this as well [Music] do one more time so you can nail this part and then [Music] and now put that together with this [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] so and now i'm going to do it from the start plate and pause it okay [Music] so now it's your turn to try that do [Music] this then slide [Music] one more time [Music] do one more time and try and put it together now [Music] remember to pause the video okay and re-rewind [Music] and on to the next part boring with the ring finger try and do that a couple of times sounds kind of sweet huh i don't know how he came up with that [Applause] [Music] i'm trying to do that again for you [Music] so [Music] yes we are almost at the nice leaky dust up the neck we're gonna do this again first remember pause it rewind do it again you can even slow down i [Music] believe do [Music] do i don't know if i played wrong last time but but it is like this okay [Music] one more time even slower [Music] do [Music] do it's not a hard lick it's just hard to do fast [Music] one more time [Music] even slower [Music] so [Music] you [Music] [Music] do that 100 times [Music] do [Music] rewind do it again if you didn't get it i'm gonna play it one more time [Music] slow [Music] a little bend now we're gonna do the hardest lick in this tune i believe at least up to speed if you haven't played this leak before you're gonna think as me at least when you do it up to speed yeah okay start over [Music] do that a couple of times [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] one more time as slow as i can again remember to pause the video and most of all remember to subscribe for more free [Music] lessons [Music] do [Music] do do [Music] there you have it i'm gonna play it through that section again the whole section slow [Music] do ah sorry [Music] so i hope you enjoyed this lesson it's quite a long lesson but to me this is quite a hard zulu to do why would you want to learn to play this exactly like rice does it why you don't learn anything yes you do i learn how to pick out the notes i also learn different fingerings that are not used to example this kind of like i never played exactly like that before and it's a real finger stretcher it's back and forth back and forth and also up the neck click so that's a good exercise so i see this when i do this kind of lessons for you guys that's an exercise for me so i benefit by teaching you guys so i'm i'm kind of happy to try and figure this kind of stuff out because it's make me a better player and yeah take care everyone and i hope you like this guitar as you know i've done a lot of things to this so i might as well say it now um under the hood here we have this is a 2 2015 d28 i'm going to put my pick away under the hood have now scalloped bracing it's not forward shifted but you can almost say it forward shift because this sound was so huge man i can see it here now but okay it's not the forward shifted but it's it is scalloped now it wasn't before uh the saddle is a through saddle now it's not a drop in let's go all the way through it's a black ebony pins with abalone on it abalone dots it's a tonerized pick card it's herringbone cream now instead of the two lines i believe it was two lines yes so it's herringbone now i don't know how good you can see that but i really like it it's also a bound fingerboard extended bound fingerboard now with my flat pignation inlay on the 12th fret i don't know if you can see that very well but it's there i have dots on the side of the fretboard um what else yeah we changed to the to the nut here to walnut it was uh let's see it was ebony when i got it polished ebony yeah now it's a bone nut uh the tuners it swapped to open back instead the fat you know i believe it's go toe tuner maybe they are really huge that make actually the guitar a little bit lighter and that's true i promise you also when the bracing was scalloped it you know it weighs a little less and it is louder for sure i like the sound of it i can't really describe it but this is how the back looks like got some scratches this is a little hole here on it for a strap but but we can pretend it's i use the pellet gun to shoot it you know if you know the history the rice guitar and that's it i believe yeah and obviously the sound was enlarged not by me wasn't a very good job but i round it nicely and i know some of you say it's oh that's a huge sound oh but it's not it's okay it's a big sound hole but it's exactly the measurement that rice had on his guitar so and this is a mammoth bone by the way i love this guitar to death i'm gonna give it to my daughter when i die so hopefully not yet i want to play a couple years more and some people ask if i'm gonna take the logo away i don't know i'm not gonna say no but i don't plan on it right now so thank you everyone and take care", "r5BqLmwZYeM": "hi buddy welcome back to mando lessons this is part two in a series where I'm working on the tube nine pound hammer it's also known as take this hammer and is closely related to Swannanoa tunnel Ashville Junction kind of a well represented song in the American folk tradition we've been working out of the key of a in part one I talked about just getting the chord structure and the melody singing singing the melody into your head and in this lesson I'm going to work on just getting the the a little bit of a break which I made up which really mostly is just the melody added in so you have something to play in between singing verses and horses so I'll play through it once and then break it down so I'll sing it once and then play a break it's not down hammer it's a little bit heavy for my time 30 for my time to do so Pinero [Music] I'm going up and down Dorsey Maddy and income back go income back buddy deuces when we don't oh all right so that is what that break sounds like as you can hear it really closely follows the melody the only thing I changed right there that the very anisette ago when the wheels won't roll I go this gives a little bit of kava I turn around at the end there so so far what we've got we got the melody we got the you know we got the melody in our heads from singing it in part one we've got the chords from part one and then really keeping in mind that this this little break is just the melody what the only thing I've really added to it is this kind of constant shuffle so if the melody is [Music] every 44 my buddy or you know there are tons of space in there which is totally fine if you're singing because your voice can really hold out those notes it's got a lot of sustain but when you play that as a melody for my 31 you know it doesn't really doesn't carry that that energy through the song so what I do is for that whole what I've kind of done is worked out the melody in my head I wish I'll teach you in a second and then I just add this consistent shuffle to it so then build a more supple to Daddy shuffle particle my dad shuffle 24 a couple and shuffle so the shuffle pattern let's just do a nice open a string it's down down up down down up down down down down down down up down down down down etc and really just working on a single string not with any left hand maneuvers at this point if you're if that's a new kind of feeling for you really do that a lot and really try to get that feeling into your hand because you're going to use it all the time you know it's kind of my go-to rhythmic pattern for taking a break you know I'll often just start with the start by playing what I can get out of the melody and adding some shuffle to it and it really will keep the tune chugging along rather than just playing big long whole notes or whatever you want to call him you can also do that just with the with the chords if you want to have something a little more entertaining to play along with you can do this 9-pound my god down down down so it's kind of using that patter it's no longer the bluegrass chop but it's a great way to get your right hand comfortable with playing that shuffle pattern alright so to the melody first phrase this 9 pound hammer starts from the second fret of the D string open and that's going to pick ups into the top of the melody [Music] and again again next phrase so that's a bunch of four C sharps in a row don't know exactly how many there are just do that much five C sharps and then to the extra arc the fourth fret on the d-string again put those two together [Music] that's the next phrase and again and then we just shuffling on that second fret of the d-string [Music] and then that last phrase of the quad verse do that again and again put that whole verse together it sounds like this [Music] my next phrase top of this is now the chorus so starts with three big open e strings and then four to zero on the a string so those first three parts there Budi show me a net worth Fred shuffle and this little ending tag so every part of this is just opens twos and fours four - OH [Music] actually this whole melody this whole tune is just in this position it's just uh twos and fours and oaken's so that's the whole tune I'll play through it twice for you so you can get a sense of what it sounds like I'll sing a little bit I'll just play a little bit I'll call some shuffles and you know doesn't need to be exact don't feel like you need to play exact leave what I'm playing here that's said if you want to get the notes exactly how I'm playing them I do have tabs over a standard rotation over at Mandel essence cops so here we go one more time and you dare [Music] [Music] can you go back to the virus nothing amounted just see Maddie etc so that's sorry for that sort of long lesson there there's a lot of talking but uh well mainly what I'm doing here and why I talk in these videos a little more than I play is I want you to get more than just to get the song into your head and get the break into your head I want you to see my process of how I come up with the break what I think it is it's important that goes into a break and give you the tools to find the melody on the instrument so you can play yourself so you can create your own breaks because that's really a big part of the tradition is just you know not not having preset breaks but being able to adapt and hear our songs for the first time get as much of the melody as you can into your head and then spit out some form of that melody in the form of a break on the instrument kind of on the fly and it takes some practice you know everything everything does but but just keep at it and it'll it'll come to you just in the same way that's kind of learning to hold the instrument or tune the instrument or player fresh chords seem hard at first you know getting these tools to be able to build your own breaks and be a more kind of versatile musician those are skills that you can build and through projects like learning this song and working on these breaks and then trying to make your own breaks for different songs um those are great ways to build on those skills so thanks again for watching hope see you again soon again check out Mandel essence calm for the tab standard notation the words the melody things like that thanks for watching bye bye", "LuQ6iNF6pPs": "[Music] hammer it

don't number nine coal well our buddy he don't you row so soon how can we don't roll how can I roll and when the wheels won't go [Music] you", "cToxfJQKLJc": "howdy welcome to banjo vin clark calm this is your home for all guitar banjo mandolin on the Internet today I'm really excited we're going to take one of my all-time favorite singing bluegrass standards and we're going to break it down for you that song is nine pound hammer and what I'm going to do is give you a more of a beginner chord based lead to this and then we're going to dive in and do a really advanced melodic version that I know you're going to love but more importantly than that we're not bound by the time restrictions of YouTube here at banjo Ben Clark com we can go for as long as we want to go and as long as we need to go to to teach you everything so not only we're going to learn the arrangement so I'm going to take the melody of this song and show you how to transfer it to this guitar or to your guitar but to my Macpherson we're going to do that today so join me I'm glad you're here lissa let's get right into it [Music] my son [Music] don't go so soon [Music] and [Music] alright those were the two versions of non pound hammer I kicked it off with the more basic chord based version and then attempted to sing the song and then I played the more advanced version and so we're going to dive into that but first what I want to do is cover something that's extremely important this may be the most important thing you've learned you're going to learn all day all year and that's just to tune your guitar now I'm not going to go through each step of how to tune your guitar I think I'm going to make a whole nother video just on tuning your guitar it's so important to me but but I do just want to get you to check your tuning with my strings I'm going to pull off the capo then to just open strings here and I'm just going to play through them real slowly and just match up your guitar with mine here's low E string [Music] in a string d string you and don't forget the good thing about these videos is you can pause rewind everything so if I'm going a little too fast on any part you can just go back and check it out g-string [Music] we stream then your Eastern so the true G chord sounds nice and full and in tune okay then what we're going to do is put our capo on the 2nd fret because we're playing out of the key of a today but we're playing out G position so if we're playing in G position but we want to go to a then we need to put our capo two frets up ok so we're going to the 2nd fret and we're going to put our capo this is a Shub style clamp capo I use all kinds of different Capo's but with all your Capo's it's very important to put it as close to that fret wire as you can get a lot of guys put them right on top I don't I put it right behind it I see a lot of people putting the capo right in the middle of the fret there and you don't want to you don't want to do that it's going to call some tuning issues you want to get that capo right behind that fret wire make sure it's nice and tight but not too tight or it'll squeeze your strings and make them make them sharp but uncle' tuning is a very important thing it's one of my pet peeves you go to jam circles you hear people that are out of tune and they're outcasts and people start talking bad about you and behind your back and call you names and it hurts alright enough of that let's dive into these versions let's start out with this beginner version I say it's beginner it's really not beginner it's basic okay this this isn't extremely easy to play but what it is is it's straight ahead we're going to grab the melody I'm almost using it more as a teaching exercise than actual playing exercise you're real slow here I'm going to put the my left hand up on the screen here and that way you can play through with me from the very beginning here we go 1 2 3 [Music] and [Music] and another thing I want to stress right quick is pick direction pick directions very important to get it clean to get it rhythmically sound and to get it strong to get the accents where the accidents are supposed to be you need to have the right pick direction if you buy the tab that accompanies this video all the pick directions are in there it's a pain to do that believe me but it's so important I want every single note to have a pick direction and also in the more tricky parts of the song I give you fingerings as well okay so let's start out with the advanced version of Phnom Penh hem now we start out with just this little G lick and then we go on from there [Music] yeah you know how I'm bluegrass we have that extra bluegrass measure after you start singing and before you go into the break that's all we're doing here is just kind of a lead-in and one of my favorite things to do is find inventive unique ways to get into the melody and so I've done that here and that's your first melody notes right there at the end [Music] have to really watch the timing on that I throw a quarter note there in the midst of all the eighth notes order note right there oh but can I bend this one up far enough to make it sound like it's actually the third frame around doing that almost there it's really tough especially if you're using medium gauge strings which is what I like to use so what I've done is enlisted the help of my first finger that goes like this slowly okay and that takes us to that seat cord now I'm going to walk you through this last leg this is definitely the hardest lick in the whole song [Music] you", "8RPhUcoJBkg": "howdy welcome to Benjamin Clark dot-com but below this is your home for learning how to play on the managers the guitar or the mandolin today we are looking at a basic straight ahead melody driven version of nine pound hammer if you don't know how to play nine pound hammer this is your chance to learn it and you need to learn it it's a good one but if you're watching this on YouTube here in a wall I'll ask you to kindly go over to the website Benjamin Clark comm join as a goal pic member and help me put out these videos each and every week which I do I switched from week to week banjo mandolin guitar and we do all kinds of good fun stuff also come see me at Facebook if you haven't done that yet facebook.com slash the banjo bin and anyway if you are watching this on the website you can jump right over to the tab section download this all my gold picking lifetime members get access to all my tabs and videos for all instruments and we're going to do this 9 pound hammer basic version I've got Katie's this is an 80s model something master Tom Gibson and Steve Huber the banjo maestro behind Huber banjos he just set it up and I love it so I played it on this video check it out you okay that was the basic version let's let's dive right into it we're going to go through it measure by measure and then on the website there and I have a video of us playing all the way through from start to finish very slowly after we've explained each and every measure they also have four different rhythm track guitar videos where you can practice along with your tab there so let's dive right into a measure one non pound hammer non pound hammer alright we're going to start here with the kick off this is just a very simple kick off the song is in 4/4 time what does that mean well we have four beats in each measure okay that's essentially what that means in each one of these quarter notes like you see a measure woman they get one beat a piece okay so it's just a little bit of music theory review but that first little squiggly mark that you see there that's a rest that means we don't play on the first beat but we do start to kick off on the second beat of that first measure down on that low D string if you notice I have all the fingerings listed right beneath the notes all your right hand fingering so you'll have no problem figuring out how to pick it this is a great straight ahead version of this song we're going to follow the melody we're going to do a lot of forward rolls we're not going to do any really advanced left hand stuff but it's going to be a very sufficient very confident version of non pound hammer so we're going to start off on that bottom D string that fourth string on the second beat and we're going to play it twice we're gonna put the second fret down there now you can choose to play that with your middle finger or your first finger doesn't really matter typically I'll play with my middle finger because if I put my first finger I'll have a tendency to kind of mute this first string here with part of my first finger so I I can just curl around a little easier with my middle finger there here is where the break really starts is it measure two now if you're familiar with the melody this will make sense if you're not familiar with nine pound hammer this is still a great tune to learn you're going to need to be familiar with it but the way that the vocal goes this is a singing song and generally and there's a nine pound hammer that's what we're trying to copy and that's our melody right there on that open g string and that's what we're going to concentrate on pushing out throughout this second measure and the way we're going to do that is we're going to start with a quarter note use that index finger there you see the number one beneath that note that means our first finger and we're just going to do two forward rolls in a row okay just right through those our eighth notes so they happen twice as fast as the quarter notes that we've been playing so far okay now I'm at the very end of this video series on the website I have a video where I play this whole thing through very slowly and I also have some guitar rhythm track videos that you can practice along with at different speeds but I do want to play measure 1 and measure 2 just kind of together for you so you can hear how it sounds so I'm going to count it off 1 there's are four beats of measure two now when we get to measure three we're going to come around and land on that g string that third string with our thumb okay a lot of people will have a tendency to do it with your index finger and that's okay but your thumb has more power and I guess just more precision and so I like to use my thumb whenever I can and since this is a melody note I really want to stick it to them you'll notice when I played it the very first of the video I really accented the notes that were in the melody of the song now when we get to measure three we've got the quarter note and then we're going to do a really cool little slide move is a little too heavy that's the way our melody goes so the way we're going to do that starting on the second beat of measure three I'm going to use my middle finger here on the second fret and we're going to slide from the 2nd to the 4th fret okay now here's the important thing we're going to slide and at the point where we reached that 4th fret is right when we're going to pick the B string with our index fingers so do that with me can you do that good now just it's just a forward roll there if you look at that on the second third beat so he goes and then what do we do for the second half of that measure we come right back down so it's a forward roll and back down we slide again and that slide coming down there at the end of measure three it happens the same way we want our slide to land on the second fret at the same time that would pick that first string okay so measure three all together sounds like this - ready go one now when you plant up to speed leave that middle finger down because it's gonna uh it's going to give us a little resonance so it sounds good and we get to measure four we're going to change chords okay the guitar player the bass player they're all changing chords so we're going to go to a C chord position and that's what we see there we're going to start out playing that open g string but then the chord position has our middle finger on the second fret down here all right index finger on the first fret here and our ring finger is up here on the second fret of the first string okay so it looks like that we're gonna do a couple forward rolls so measure four sounds like this let's start off you're going into that core position good job okay so let me just play measures 1 through 4 for you right quick so you can kind of see how all this fits together and we'll look at the rest of the song - ready go one let's take a look at measure 5 see what it looks like", "NTBdfuRCQU0": "welcome to bluegrass 101 uh um for those who haven't heard and might just be tuning in i've already talked about it but uh tony rice passed away on december 25th at the age of 69. tony rice for anybody who didn't know is a phenomenal influence on the bluegrass uh genre he played on some of the most influential albums of night in the 1970s 1980s he revolutionized bluegrass guitar following in the footsteps of clarence white and doc watson and took it to a brand new level did a lot of jazz stuff but he also really really had a huge um uh huge roots in original bluegrass and if you ever get a chance to listen to the bluegrass album band um with uh miles tony rice and doyle lawson bobby hicks and jd crow they're phenomenal albums and um and this song he recorded on his album guitar he also recorded it on his album manzanita and manzanita is an interesting album because it is a very very pure bluegrass album phenomenal bluegrass album that features no banjo so i know all the banjo parts from manzanita um so we're doing nine pound hammer nine pound hammer dates back uh well it was like a prison a logging song a railroad song uh um it's been called take this hammer it's been called asheville junction versions have been recorded by mississippi john hurt lead belly uh the version that most people are aware of and um is copyrighted is merle travis merle travis recorded this song um [Music] he'd do like it's not bad hammer [Music] is my size for my size i can't do finger picking very well but he would hold the uh his the five chord uh a really short amount of time he would go well now hammer is a little too heavy for my side [Music] so it would be this little short little uh five chord um in the blue graph genre it gets held a little longer and let's go through the song okay there's tons and tons of different verses of it as i said i'm going to be doing the manzanita version of it and talk about some of the different other verses but let's go through it slow one two in the key of a three well the nine pound hammer is lit too [Music] just get a little true [Music] how can i roll [Music] that's in this tunnel that can ring like mine [Music] going on [Music] call [Music] is [Music] how can i rule [Music] so that is a very easy song i mean it's only 1.15 pretty standard uh bluegrass pattern uh and it is extremely repetitive and sometimes they add a whole lot of verses so what makes this song interesting is a couple things one is the soloing there is a solo after every verse and chorus and the solo is a verse in chorus so it goes well now pan hammer is led to heavy [Music] how can i roll when the wheels won't go [Music] it's a long way to harlan and also on this song there's this big space after someone finishes the solo and lets the person who's soloing regroup um what's nice about that is really you have to well i don't know if it's nice but it's kind of cool you really have to pay attention and make eye contact with the person that's soloing allow them to kind of finish their phrase and get set back in the pattern and then the singer can start singing again sometimes that's eight bars sometimes it's 16 bars depending on what they're doing but uh it takes a lot of interaction takes a lot of interplay and this is a great jam song because especially in um like bluegrass circles when you have lots of players who want to do solos this song gives an opportunity like one two three four um there's like five solos that you can just naturally do with only the lyrics that are written here and there are tons more lyrics so you can have tons and tons and tons of soloing in this um so this for all you players out there is a great opportunity to practice your picking so that you can pick out the melody [Music] um [Music] those are the notes one two three four five six seven there's only seven notes in this song um so if you just stick to those seven eventually you will uh get in on it so i'm gonna do this song again i'm gonna pick up the speed just a hair but i'm going to allow all of those breaks in between so start to pick out pick out that melody okay so one two [Music] how [Music] so [Music] how [Music] oh [Music] like [Music] how [Music] is [Music] no they ain't coming back [Music] how [Music] then [Music] is [Music] i just noticed that my mic doesn't turn correctly this might help slightly let's bring this a little closer always good to have your mic facing you instead of the audience or in this case a wall um yeah so um as i said it's a great opportunity to uh practice and practice and practice and practice but this song is also interesting because it has harmony and to explain the harmony in this song and harmony is done a number of different ways in the original recording of it the harmony is only on well hold on buddy don't roll so slow how and only done as a duet but sam bush in the 1998 tony rice live jam which is on youtube and used to be on a dv while it still is on a dvd of uh acoustic guitar it has tony rice sam bush jerry douglas mark schatz on upper base um now mark o'connor on fiddle and uh they do this song bailey fleck does join them later but baylor's not on this song particularly and uh they just rip this song up incredibly fast incredibly talented and sam bush is doing a really cool harmony on it so what i'm going to do is i'm going to record the lead on this just the first verse ah does that care get myself organized i'm using a program called audacity it's program i love okay uh one two three will a nine-pound hammer is left too heavy it's for my size honey for my size buddy don't you grow so slow [Music] so the cool thing about this song is especially harmony wise because there's so many verses and people do it in different ways the first verse the verses um is done in a call and response so um what that allows is the singer to lead what version they're going to do and what verse they're going to do and the harmony person can still sing along and then once the uh chorus happens then you can sing in unison um let's see let's crank this volume up [Music] [Music] how okay so there's a few cool things that are happening in there first off it's it's a delayed harmony on um on on the verse and when they get to the [Music] chorus [Music] how can i roll because tony rice is singing low there how can i roll when the wheels won't go sam bush is staying high can i roll when the wheels won't go but when he goes down when the wheels won't go um tony rice is going and the wheels won't go so an octave apart they go down to this discordant note and then end up in a perfect um one three uh so a perfect like typical lead and tenor or one three which is that nice nice harmony that that comes about so octave and then resolves let's do that again so you can hear [Music] one two nine pound hammer [Music] [Music] how can i roll [Music] um the other thing that sam bush does sometimes doesn't do it on the original recording but um [Music] pops up just just to hint at that four chord they don't actually play the four chord but it sounds like he's going to the four chord um that's not done all the time but i like the net sound of it one two i'll point it out to you when it happens with a nine pound hammer [Applause] [Music] how can i rule [Music] so that is a very very cool harmony version now you can skip out call and response part one two three [Music] when the wheels won't go so you can do it both ways i do like the call and response i think it adds a lot especially in a song that's so repetitive um adding a little bit of uh uh call and response and harmony into that makes that mix a little more interesting the other important thing on this song is the flatted notes and they flatten the fourth note so what is [Music] [Applause] this nine pound hammer is a little too [Music] let's see if i can do it well a nine pound nine pound hammer well the nine pound hammer [Music] how can i roll so um guitar wise [Music] so it's a lot of third third fret instead of going [Music] ah those are all the notes the the major uh the major um the major chord from d to a high d i'm [Music] going [Music] so and why that third the flatted third works in g but it also works in c because the flat that is a flat seven c7 flattened flattened third plated seven flat a third planet sevens so that note is a really good note to get that blue sound whether i pound hammer [Music] so lots of flattered thirds lots of flattered sevens uh lots of very blues and it is a really push well the nine pound hammer [Music] and there's lots of push and pull in this song in regards to so you can do this [Music] now tony rice in this song uh on manzanita and also if you're watching that 98 he's playing it pretty straight he's not doing this [Music] especially for the beginning of the song what you want to do in a song like this especially because it's so repetitive and there's like five verses to it um you want to build so if i'm doing a solo and it's the first solo i'm gonna stick really close to the [Music] melody and then if it's later on [Music] you can kind of stray more and more because by the time the third person the fourth doing person is doing the solo pretty much everything has been said by the banjo or the guitar the fiddle player so you kind of have to bring something a little more to it what you still want to do though is low in the first half and then high in the second half because that is well an impound hammer is a little too heavy [Music] how can i roll where the wheels won't blow so you want to be low for the first so make it interesting to go but keep in the spirit of the song low and then high um if it goes high and low then it's it's kind of it's not in the spirit of the song how's that for so uh what i'm going to do is i want you guys to have the opportunity to sing uh you guys can sing the lead first okay so i'm going to go through the song well a 9 pound hammer and hammer is a little too hip too heavy [Music] how can i grow so opportunity just to do the uh harmony part and an opportunity to do the soloing so i'm going to keep it really really really really really really really tight and just do the lead and rhythm guitar so one and uh we'll do lots of g runs in this because it's a good g front song um but yeah solo over top of me sing over top me uh and let's get that harmony and those lead licks in here one uh and i'll record this one two three uh you know what sorry stop i am going to do the intro as well so [Music] um we're just going to do the verse we're not going to do the um the chorus in it so one two three [Music] it's for my size [Music] is so it's a long way to portland a long way to asia just get a little group [Music] so [Applause] [Music] like how can i roam foreign [Music] cold how can i go [Music] how [Music] nice natural fade out except for me doing the low and in between but um okay so gave people an opportunity to do the harmony so now let's do the exact opposite let's see if i can do this i'm just going to record the rhythm again but i'll record the harmony and you guys can sing the lead and play all the lead layers so i will just be uh my imitation of sam bush on guitar and we'll do the intro again so [Music] is i'm not gonna do the four chord but i'm gonna vocalize it okay um let's get that going one two three four two [Music] nine [Music] how [Music] just [Music] how can i go [Music] so [Music] is [Music] how [Music] so [Music] how [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] so a few things that i like to do is these interesting syncopations as a rhythm guitar player and uh clarence white would do it as a guitar player tony rice does it sometimes so it says um it's a really slow g run well roll on buddy and it's almost like you're gonna be too late [Music] so it's it's just that walk up but it's a really slow [Music] and it's just making it on time and it it creates this really interesting push pull especially when you're doing it slow or fast i mean you can also instead of going up instead of doing that you can do the same thing but go down to the seventh so um um and also for a rhythm um i'm doing like great one hammer boom checker like a lucky [Music] so instead of just going boom [Music] sounds like a trainer and if you mix it up again it creates this interesting push and pull so you can do that for an emphasis emphasis [Music] or you do the off court or the offbeats [Music] by mixing it up it gets out of that extremely repetitive pattern that is a part of this song so anytime you can influence and input some sort of different rhythm into it you're going to make it a lot more interesting now um oh and yeah like tony rice does [Music] he does these bends um which is a really really weird he's doing a flatted um a flatted fifth which is a really really hard pin to do because it's really close to the capo but he's doing it on the second fret on the b string and he's bending down from the note so he's starting it up he's starting it bent up [Music] that's uh the solo that he does that [Music] note [Music] in uh in the 1998 tony rice special and then he does like [Music] i'll do that i'll do as close as i can get to his break i am no tony rice so one i'll do the harmony and then his break oh that's the wrong one oh no that's right so one two three [Applause] [Music] how can i rule when we go [Music] how can i rule [Music] okay [Music] what we'll do is we'll do some sam bush here [Music] okay i'm gonna do my best i will do an intro and one of the breaks and again i will sing the harmony um so you can have someone to sing so you can sing along with me doing the harmony or you can sing along with the lead me doing the lead um or you can just concentrate on your breaks now with mandolin i want to do those chops i want to make it sound like a snare as best i can [Music] that is my dream so one two three [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] don't grow so slow [Music] hey is when the wheels go [Music] [Music] you see my baby it ain't coming back [Music] is [Music] how so that is uh as much of a tribute as my talent allows for a tribute to the great tony rice um bluegrass album band rounder004 also known as the brown album um with jd crow in the new south uh tony rice um guitar tony rice native american there is also a compilation of tony ray's singing all of his gordon lightfoot covers that he did because he was a huge gordon lightfoot fan manzanita of course that album as well um i can go on and on with all of the tony race um yeah it is a huge shame he was only 69 passed away on december 25th so um thank you tony rice for all the music that you provided i hope you got something out of this bluegrass 101 with nine pound hammer you can tune in every wednesday uh until uh the uh pandemic is over here uh we'll be remaining live but eventually hopefully we'll be doing it with the northern bluegrass circle music society again every wednesday seven uh to eight at the uh pleasantview community hall but until then you can tune in to facebook or you can tune in to zoom and uh and tune in every wednesday seven to eight mountain standard time for bluegrass 101 happy picking uh thank you guys so much and uh happy new year to you thank you clayton so much and uh we will definitely see each other in 2021. uh keep your hands and uh yourself clean and your pick and clean and uh happy new year happy holidays and uh see in the new year bye", "n1jT65_Tu-Y": "now let's learn advanced flatpicking solo break number 1 and this is going to be kind of in the style of Tony rice there's some awesome bluegrass flatpicking licks in this solo break here and I'm going to play through it once so you can hear it and then we're going to take a closer look with the tablature [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh Oh Oh [Music] back into the course there now let's break this solo down one little section at a time and we're going to look at measures one through five first what you see on the screen the lowing flight through it so you can hear it get a feel for it and then you can pause the video and work through it with that tablature one two three four one [Music] one more time one two three four one [Music] Oh [Music] pay attention to those down pick and pick triangles below the notes on the tablature you don't have to go buy those exactly but those are the pig directions that I like to use throughout the solo break so maybe that'll be helpful and also one more thing I wanted to mention in measure 2 that hammer on there you know right at the beginning that one when I do that hammer on I like to bar with my left pointer finger across those two strings there the first straining second string so I'm borrowing that pointer as I'm doing that hammer the reason I borrow that pointer is because I'm getting myself ready for the third measure when I do pull off that quick pull off back to the pointer so I like to do that type of stuff in these flatpicking wigs when I can it makes the the solo sound a little bit smoother and it can be more efficient and get your speed up that way anyways let me play through measures one through five one more time be a little bit slower and you can practice along with me if you want to right here one two three four one [Music] you [Music] I'm possibly going to work more on that but let's move it to the next measures let's learn measures six seven and eight now sounds like this [Music] you [Music] once more [Music] [Music] the pretty cool little little section there I really like that slide at the end of measure six sliding it to measure seven I think it sounds awesome I slide with that left ring finger and then I catch the next note my pointer and that next slide there I use my ring also [Music] and right there [Music] that's one of those wigs you can steal that little lick and you can use that in a ton of different songs and just add that to your bag of legs I like that one a lot when I so anyways measures six seven and eight one more time [Music] [Music] now let's play through everything we've learned so far measures 1 all the way through 8 1 2 3 4 1 [Music] ah [Music] Oh [Music] that's it sounds really cool as we move into the next measures here what I'm going to do is I'm going to lead us in biplane measure eight this little G Lake right here to the next measure [Music] the come [Music] mine's ready for my son [Music]", "ZY4be9jNkQ4": "oh this is Durbin Allen coming to you from the bluegrass acre there are many musicians that can't get out

the 9 pound hammer in a chord here we go 1 2 3 [Music] you won't see my baby early [Music] damn junkie [Music] you you", "ZIQzUzQcN0k": "[Music] hi there in this arrangement of nine pound hammer we're looking at a very basic beginner version the version has a very straightforward rhythm structure and you only need to know one role and that's the forward roll so from measure to measure in this version we're looking at quarter notes to be played with our thumb directly followed by a forward roll playing eighth notes like this so the first half of this arrangement is very basic there's no ornaments no hammer ons no slides no pull offs which can be a little awkward for the beginner player so this version only has single note single arm quarter notes are played with the thumb and then the forward roll starting at string three into eight so so the main thing is at the moment you need to be able to play with your thumb the single string and and throughout the arrangement it changes which string depending on where the melody is going and also you need to know the basic forward role using strings five three and one so let's have a slow playthrough and then we'll talk about some of the measures within the arrangement okay so this is variation number one one two three [Music] okay so you would normally play that twice through for a break that was just the one just repeating okay so we talked about a couple of measures so first of all the pickup bar so the pickup bar is the first time we'll see just quarter notes so the quarter notes are played with the thumb and for example we're playing that open third string G followed by two open 4th strings the D followed by the second fret on string 4 throughout this arrangement you can get away with just using finger 2 we're only needing the second fret so your second finger so the middle finger on your left hand can play those two those second fret notes so directly following the pickup bar we have our first forward rolls so the forward roll is the same every time it comes in so the first measure is over the G chord so all open strings and what we're going to do is there are two ways of approaching this you can either start with your thumb on string 3 so we go thumb middle index little thumb and so on or you can keep the Roloffs with your index finger so on the third string would be index middle index I think to keep it simple if you can start with the thumb it's probably a good idea because you'll be coming out of the measure of quarter notes playing your thumb and then start the roll with the thumb and then drop into the thumb playing string five then index on the string three so just to recap that so the forward roll each time the forward roll comes in it can either be started with the thumb on string three like so or you could start that if you prefer with your index finger okay so in measure 2 we have the thumb needing to change to the second string and then we have a forward roll exactly the same pattern same strings but this time over the C chord but the only note you need to hold is fret 2 on string 1 so otherwise their open strings carry through for the C chord and it's exactly the same forward rolls before [Music] and as we work our way through the arrangement you'll notice that the next bar is back to quarter notes we'll play with our thumb the following measure is back to the forward roll then when we hit the where the D chord comes in we're back to quarter notes with our thumb and then the next measure which is a G chord we play a forward roll and then we have the first and second ending so the first ending we have the pick up notes again [Music] which will take us back to the repeat sign opposite that at the top of the page and then the second time through we'll come come through the arrangement we would play the second ending which should we couple of snaps so we'll go [Music] so that's when you're finishing your break you can play that instead of the pickup notes so to play this arrangement I would spend some time on being able to just play thumb on quarter notes this is a really good exercise start on the third string and play your thumb on also play your thumb on the third string and just call it a note so and then make sure you can also play the forward roll starting on string three so we would be playing string 3 string 1 string 5 string 3 string 1 string 5 string 3 string 1 [Music] once you get those two measures separately then put them together as an exercise and you would have this four quarter notes on the third string and then the forward roll [Music] one and two and three and four so if you can put that exercise together in your right hand that's with a little bit of changing of the second fret here and there on your left hand you'll be able to get the basic melody for the ninth pound hammer so in the next video we'll look at variation number two variation number two brings more of the melody in there's still no ornaments no slides no hammer-ons and pull-offs but instead of keeping it a measure of quarter notes to a measure eight notes with the roll the quarter notes get mixed in a little bit with the eighth note so sometimes we have mixed bars so check out the second video [Music] you [Music]", "XbvOlDOBn-g": "here's a little banjo ride for the nine pound hammer hope you enjoy this I always have been playing this and for a long time notice s that that little flag looking thing there is an eighth note wrist so I'm kind of one I'm sorry I'm one so you just kind of feel your way through that that I ain't noticed quick the pinch there the index middle pinch I'm string three that's quick okay now let's see I'm gonna do a series of four rolls here is that that measure there I'm sliding from two to five just like firewall mail and a bunch of others [Music] no cents a quarter another so I'm gonna wait a whole beat on that so I'm counting [Music] okay slide they're on the third string off their three-to-two pause slide from two to three pull it off from three back to - okay so that whole measure goes one [Music] is this in 4/4 time ok moving to the next measure I'm gonna hit my open third string on the whole beating and now I'm hammering on the hammer in my hole see Gordo second finger on the fourth string first finger on the second string I'm gonna keep my index finger down and a hammer again on the fourth string [Music] forward we've seen that one before too and then open third string so again start with a quarter note and finish it off with eighth notes [Music] what's the quarter notes they go twice as long as the eighth notes do like here on the floor for three pin forward to phone we had that one in fireball male 2 I'm gonna do my second variation on a G run here that started on the on the quarter note too [Music] third string slide on the third string back to the third stroke the index finger and fourth fret it on the second fret and then and forgive my voice I'm doing the best I can with it a hammer on the second string there and this next one is gonna be interesting because I'm in the middle of a forward roll here so I'm gonna start with my index finger pulling off I'm pulling off from the third fret to the second fret I'm going to take my second finger and slide from three to five now India fourth-string Creek slides couple pull-offs here right hand is 3 to 31 and I'm pulling off twice from the third fret to the second fret and open third string another C chord forward rolls this time what I'm doing there I'm hammering on both notes of my C chord again keeping that on there reaching out with my pinky to the third string playing the third fret there on the third [Music] like that whole two measures there okay now this little single string like mostly single string and again you got to watch the quarter notes and eighth notes starts on the quarter note now this that's all third string until I get to the don't try to don't try to hammer that on or pull it off too quick okay and the next lick is gonna be now what I'm doing is I'm just sort of improvising on the last phrases of the sung melody kind of making it more of a banjo kind of thing so this next next miniature is gonna be we've seen this before I stick these in here mainly because I just want you to learn these legs thus I've got two hammers there one is a slow the next ones a hammer pool so I'm three and ending with my Scruggs G run [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Music]", "cuizD9cg8x4": "youtubers back at you again with another lesson I was going to do a no I promise to do a video on like heavy metal and jazz and rock and roll type guitar riffs and things you can incorporate into bluegrass music however I have been bombarded with messages and texts and emails wanting me to show Tony rice licks everyone wants to learn Tony rice licks so in an earlier video I did a flat picking lesson video of a week or so ago up I chose non pound hammer to play through in a few writes licks and I guess that really exploded to the bomb people wants to learn those licks and those were a few of them there that you just heard so a rice doesn't use all of those licks and non pound hammer those herbs and licks that I've gathered up that he uses in a bunch of other songs some of them he does use the mountain pound him but I will show them to you as quickly as I can and try to cut this video not make it as long as my videos usually are so move kind of fast I have an idea I want to present to you about subscribers that will help me and you and everyone that gets involved so moving on let's get into this thing that's a right thing let me zoom in just a little bit here so you can see what's happening I'll try to explain this stuff as well as I can and you can pause the video in between the that's the lick he uses a play on timing right uses this a lot I'm just boring four three and two at the fifth fret and I'm coming back to the third fret barring for three and two and when I hit those three I'm hammering the fourth string from the third fret - I'm sorry I'm hammering the third string from the third fret to the fourth so let's you can pause the video and work on that or back up or whatever you have to do I think he does use that in this nine pound hammer tune okay this is another lick he does in nine pound hammer so I'm coming down here to the tenth fret I'll do it as slow as I can now I'll try to explain that as quickly as I can 10th fret first string three notes then you're going to the ninth fret pulling off to the eighth you come into the second string on the 11th fret second string on the eighth fret so that's and then it's you bar those two and it's the first string and second string first string on the eighth fret second string on the eleventh and you slide back to the sixth fret when you do that so it's and then it's so there's the lick part of it and then he ends it with uh that's and then this thing I already showed you and then the Almighty G run that we all know and love so well as I have so often said so the lip goes slowly like this okay there's that lick that puts us halfway through the song this is a rice leg I use that to start the second time through I'm just barring one and two on the third fret hitting the third string also on the third fret and sliding back to the second and then the third string open this is like a steel guitar link actually I think so that's how that's a that's a rightfully so let's see what we are okay that's a rice thing too but I don't think you used to do nine pound hammer all that is you want to concentrate on the strings two three and four you're boring two three and four here at the tenth fret that starts with hitting the fourth string and then all three I hit the fourth string on with the right hand on it down stroke and then all three of them up and then down stroke on all the rest of that stuff okay so let strings two three and four starting on a fourth string down and then all three of them up he actually slides into that thing yeah he comes into it from the sea so we're playing those three then you're coming back here this is just to e an E minor chord without the bar it's like an E minor shape all you're getting it with these fingers and you're coming all the way down to the E minor position on the neck and you're only playing for three and two go back two frets to the D minor physician play four three two together bar on the fifth fret for three and two play them together I already showed you this that's part of the whole thing you can pause the video there and do what you got to do but that's as well as I can explain it for the time we had I'm trying to keep this short because I've had some complaints about my videos being really long so anyway after that is an old classic rice leak that I picked up he did in his early days I see me put that into context for you now now he does that a lot of time the lick is this let me show you the lick first it starts on the tenth fret on the first string you're pulling off to the eighth fret then you're just hitting a G down here if you're familiar with that G position it's just like a D chord it's down here in this G so starting on the first string on the tenth fret that's the G he's boring uh the fourth and third strings on the tenth fret with his pinkie here okay after you do that bar you're coming back to the third string on the Sabbath fret fourth string on the eighth fret sliding to the ninth in the third string open uh he goes in to see they're like I've heard him do that long say now also rice uses this very same leg that I just showed you any place that's let me play it for you once in time the way he does it in time and then I'll play it for you another way he does the exact almost exact same lick but he doesn't out of time out of sequence and his rice says his self you know when the listener doesn't expect something like that you know it catches their attention so when we try to do it playing it in time the first time here now let me play the same lick right here I'm going to throw it out of time the way he does a lot and like he says it catches the listener by surprise because they don't expect that and they for a few seconds they don't know where what the hell is going on or where you are but they hear it come out in the end so we'll play it out of time this time can you hear the difference uh I wish I could do it that was in comm now we'll throw it out ah so you can hear the difference that it makes when you do it completely throw it out of time and this is in time this is out of time say 1 2 3 so you get the idea I hope I know that's a lot of stuff and in a short period of time and that's a really old lick - the rice used that in his very early on days I don't even know what song maybe freeborn man or something I'm not sure and he used the so there's a bunch of rice stuff for you as requested I know we went through it fast had some complaints about videos being too long so there's your short video I explained it as good as I could so that's this Tony rice wig you can play with the timing on that he does it all the time I'll play it once a straight time Oh here it is in town so you can hear the difference in just a little change in timing what the difference it makes so there's that leg and this one this one which incorporates part of the one we just talked about and then this one there again all this he incorporates into other licks like that um I did the one lick I didn't talk about was this a I do a triplet there sometime let's throw everything off Tommy which is a million ways you can do those those four licks of totally rice or five or however many of us I hope that's all of them I can think of that I used in the other video you Oh I hope that helped you Tony rice people that I got I have I had over a hundred messages on that other video where I just picked a little bit of non pound hammer over 100 messages people wanting those rice legs so there they are a quick version of them if you have trouble and you just can't figure it out inbox me or whatever and all you know whatever one or once you have trouble with let me know and I will I'll try to explain them better and do better for you by the way I'm really liking this guitar really holding up quite well but I think it needs more battle-scarred so we go up put some more battle scars on it here no really folks it's yeah I thought about doing this the other day and I chickened out it's actually an electronic cigarette it's not even real I wouldn't dare a little cigarette on a Martin guitar anyway I had to play with your head a little bit and you're just all about fun it's not fun though don't even do it you know I mean there's the rice licks like I say if anyone needs to break those down or has trouble inbox me and I'll put another video up and try to explain them in a little more detail a little clearer I'm trying to keep this short one of the things I wanted to mention about subscribers hold on okay back to the subscribe subscriber thing one of the things I wanted to mention of a YouTube fan pointed this out to me it seems like a great idea you can participate in it or not it's up to you if you want more subscribers this may help you than me and everyone that participates in it but here's how it's going to work this video there's four steps there's four steps in this idea this guy gave to me this video that you are watching right now liked it share it subscribe to my channel if you're not subscribed already and comment and tell me why I should choose you now not tomorrow I think tomorrow is the 12th not tomorrow but the 19th that's next Sunday a week what might do it tomorrow if I gave we get enough hits by then or even get it up by then it takes a long time to these videos and render them and all that anyway I'll probably wait till the 19th Sunday the 19th I will look at all the posts are made of people that want to participate in this it's four steps now remember like this video share this video be subscribed to my channel and comment on this video why I should choose you and what I will do is all on the 19th Sunday I will choose one of you that participates in this and I'll give you a shout-out on the next video I do after I make the choice and that will point all my subscribers to your page and maybe someone will like your and pick up or subscribe to you by sharing it and liking it and all that will open up your subscribers to watch it maybe some of those will subscribe to me that way should help us both it seemed like a good idea it's only four steps it doesn't take very long doesn't take nearly as long as making these videos do so if you would want to participate in that do those four steps like this video share it and subscribe to my account if you're not subscribed already and comment and tell me why I should choose you to give a shout out from one of my videos so there you go if you want to participate in you know the cool I hope everyone knows but if not that's cool too it's just an idea something I mean another guy he's been doing it for a while he hasn't had a youtube account very long and he's got like 200 some subscribers already from doing this and he said it just shot up you know when he started doing it so anyway I'm gonna try because I like to get more subscribers everyone wants more subscribers if they're serious about their YouTube channel so give that some thought and if you want to participate then they're you know what to do and like I say after I make a choice I will give you your channel a shout out on the next video I do after making that choice that will help both of us and if I don't choose you for whatever reason we'll do it again and that person that I do that wins that I choose and shout out they they shouldn't participate anymore and that will give everyone a chance to you know be chosen so to speak you can do the same thing on your channels if you want I'll participate help you all I can but it's a good idea I think it's something we should try for those of us that want more subscribers and that's what it's all about if you don't have a youtube account you can't subscribe so those of you that are watching these videos you know I would appreciate very much it doesn't take a few minutes to make a YouTube account you can put it on whatever name you want on it if you don't want to use your real name and and subscribe it counts and you know things subscribers asked me to post if you're subscribed to my channel and you asked me to do a certain thing I'll try my very best to get it up for you and do it help you out but if you're not subscribed don't look for it to happen because it's just it's a it's too time-consuming to try to keep up with all of it and interact on all the Google+ that's pretty much taking the internet by storm so anyways there's the Tony rice slicks that everyone asked about that I fooled with and I might mention the wicks like I said he may not have used all those licks in that particular song but I can assure you the licks are pretty much on the money the way Tony does them had a real good teacher that's all I can say anyway subscribe and keep watching and the next video I really will try very hard to make the one the rock metal guitar riffs that try to get all that kind of crap in and show you how to incorporate it into bluegrass or bluegrass is what I mainly use it in but you could use that stuff in anything I guess you know some jazz stuff that I use occasionally in some bluegrass tunes so anyway thanks for watching again thanks for all the subscribers new old and wants to come and once that I want to participate in this this thing we're going to try so remember the four steps try and let's if you want more subscribers to your account it will help us both hopefully if it works and the guy that I talked to it's pretty much proof that it does work so thanks again for watching stay tuned you never know what you might see on this channel you Oh Cheers", "qjGMSnPWUdY": "you you hello everyone and welcome to this\nbluegrass guitar lesson today I want to show you how to play nine pound hammer\nthis is an arrangement I wrote for solo flatpicking guitar if you are excited\nabout this give this video a like and don't forget to subscribe and hit the\nbell to be notified for new videos every single week you can find the tablature\nfor this lesson at my website as well as many other tabs and instructional\nmaterials so grab your guitar and let's get started first of all we want to put\nthe capo on at the second fret so we play a G position chord and we are\nin the key of A and then we have three pickup notes that measure number zero so\nthat means that we will start playing on the second beat like this one two three\nfour one and this is the first phrase again we\nhave three pickup notes then we have a G chord and we play a G fingering that is\nvery common it's like F chord I'm sure you're\nfamiliar with that if you move that fingering up two frets this is the G\nchord and we don't even need the middle finger down I like that we have a nice unison here\nsee that okay so measure number one very simple we have a G and then we\nslide from three to five D string very simple pay attention to your down\nups Oh\nright after that we have it I like that double stop I'm playing a bar on string\nnumber two and three and then I hammer the third string then\nI slide back now this is measure number three and\nthat's a C chord look at my fingering that's the middle\nfinger is not an index finger and timing goes like one and two and\nthree and that's an upbeat up stroke alright number measure number four we\nhave a C arpeggio then we play a C7 so we need a B-flat\nwith the pinkie very simple measure number four again\narpeggio first C7 and slide alright let's let me play from the very\nvery top one two three four one you and that's the first phrase let's move\nup to the second phrase bar number five okay the second phrase is a little\nbit simpler I think bar number five you have a G chord so we play something very\nsimilar to bar number one the same slide then we slide back from three to two and\nopen D because we need to play something over the D chord and back to the G chord from measure\nnumber five again down slide down the slide pull-off down right number seven measure number seven\nwe have a G run all right so very very simple down down\nup slide okay let's play the second phrase one\nmore time from measure number five three four right I think we are ready to move on so\nthe next phrase starts on measure number 8 second beat and it goes like this so let's see what's happening here\nmeasure number 8 second beat I will play the first note the D note with my ring\nfinger because we just played the G run so my middle finger just played the G\nnote here so I will need the ring finger and I go like this look at my fingering you see it's a ring\nfinger hammer-on index ring and middle finger on the third\nstring measure number nine it's kind of a bluesy lick right right after that just play the nice little triad this is\na G triad root fifth third and we slide that's an upstroke by the way right so we have a few double stops here\nright after the G triad we go to this double stop index bar then the\nnext double stop string number three and two third fret I like to use my\npinky and my ring finger and I slide back down slide down up all right then after that we have a C\nchord bar number 11 and we have this is a nice triplet that pull-off\nhammer-on down up down pull-off pull-off C and it sounds like this and this is a little tricky make sure\nthat is very nice and clean measure number 12 again we are playing\nthe B flat with the pinky just like a C flat C7 chord so that's pretty\nsimple okay I will play the third phrase again\nmeasure number eight second beat one okay and now we're ready to play the\nvery last phrase measure number 13 now measure number 13 is very similar to\nmeasure number five we play a down slide\nand then we wait and play an upstroke that's the offbeat of the third beat three and you see that okay that was measure number 13 and this is a famous lick for a famous\nD lick and again look at my left hand I'm doing\nit down index middle ring and then I move my index and I play a bar on string\nnumber four and three hammer on and the ending tag measure\nnumber 15 very simple so I will play the last phrase one more\ntime

"[Music] [Music] welcome everybody to a brand new edition of tasteless train on this episode of tasteless train if we have a wonderful indica called 9 pound hammer this strain is 80% indica is a mixture of a bunch of different strains especially the main one is blueberry mixed with Jack the Ripper so it has a little bit of that blueberry and a little bit of spice with it and as you can tell I'm pretty hyper right now and need to calm down another thing I learned about this strain is it's got a little bit of a grape and wine taste to it so I look forward to those two tastes mixed together now let's see what the buds look like on the inside from what it smells like this is gonna be a very powerful indica it's got a little bit of a wine smell to it so let's see what fully tastes like oh well these buds are a little tiny it looks like from the inside it's very dark the strings very dark with the with the green there's not too many red hairs I see on this one it's mostly all just a lot of crystals I see I definitely see a lot of crystals compact on the inside I look forward to tasting this strain all right it is time to calm down I just want [ __ ] slippery let's get moving let's take a look oh look at that pretty it's pretty soft so you can pack it pretty easily nice and packable making new balls as you can tell it's it's got a little bit of light look to it but a lot of crystals everywhere in this and it's gonna be dark let's test this out shall we why isn't showing them we're about have lift-off her own taste the strain on coop and this is not it's not as powerful as the dang strainer but when it comes to it was hard for me to breathe right now now I still see a nice clarity but eyes are been tweaked a little bit this is really hard to breathe right now so let's take another Bowl I do taste that lime flavor to it the great taste it feels like more of a of a a green grape more than just like the right and the right it's definitely one of those hardest strange smoke I still see everything clearly it's not as powerful when it comes to see a seaside we'll see we'll see the the downer effect probably like maybe it maybe it's got a little bit of an upper right now and then goes into that smooth relaxation state so I feel like right now after after coughing out all out my vision was still clear a bit but it's probably gonna go into a little bit of that down time where it's a little bit like that's what I feel that's going let's smoke one more Bowl shall we and once again I want to thank all the people that have been supporting this series from my producers on patreon that goes up to indigo crystal I see I'm already feeling the [ __ ] down see there's there's the [ __ ] indica coming down the words are starting to get slurry shout out

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so hi friends today we have a video on nine pound hammer classic bill monroe tune in the style of tony rice i'm going to show my version of the song starting with a more stripped down arrangement and then a more intricate arrangement with more embellishment slides going up and down the neck all that stuff i'm going to be doing a lot of cross picking filling in space with this song so make sure you're comfortable alternating your pick down and up a lot going from the low strings to the high strings we'll be doing that quite a bit basic melody i like this you do this song using what would be called like the cowboy g chord shape easy to get from g to c to d7 so i'll go middle finger third finger pinky you can do it this way too but some of the ways i move my fingers in this song are more um or they're a little easier to do with the cowboy g so starting with the g chord we're gonna go open d d d d e second fret of the d string open g down up down down up down this is the third fret of the b string d note d first fret c then we're gonna go third finger third fret of the g slide up to the fourth fret open g right into a c chord i like to hammer on my middle finger into the second fret of the d string to give a little more spice [Music] again intro [Music] see what i'm doing with my right hand is i'm alternating a lot going down up down up try to not do too many downs in a row or too many ups in a row keep that hand moving down up down up it's going to help you get faster and more accurate so we have the first section now we're going to go [Music] little hammer on pull off [Music] g-a-g e open d i'm going to a d7 chord now couple down up down strums open d second fret of the d open g back to the g chord so far [Music] do [Music] next part we're going to go a little higher i like to take my pinky finger since i'm in this g shape bring it up one string to the b this is our d note again [Music] let those two notes kind of rub together [Music] and then i'm going to slide down from three to two with my middle finger [Music] open so we have this [Music] then we're gonna go kind of an opposite slide second the third open hammer on that c chord again [Music] similar thing now d7 [Music] open d hammer open g g chord whole thing top to bottom in that style [Music] do [Music] so hopefully those are a few tips you can use when you're playing uh your version of the melody and then next i'm going to go over some of the more intricate uh embellishments i add to spice it up so you have the basic melody down now now we're going to be doing some embellishments i like to add when i'm playing the song with with the catawampus band starting the same way hammer-on pull-off will it really quick first the second fret on the b slide that third finger three to four on g third fret of the d hammer onto that c chord again sounds like [Music] going to a c sus4 leading into that d7 quick hammer and pull off on g to a e second from the d string open d kind of rolling back on that d7 chord high notes to low notes very similar that first basic melody part here's where it gets a little tricky partial f chord no ring finger slide up from first and second to third and fourth i'm going e string back down back to the c chord hammer on pull off [Music] now pentatonic a little g minor pentatonic here uh six to three same thing on b same thing i'm using my ring finger to slide down to five and then going into a g chord [Music] i'm going to hammer on my middle finger [Music] sliding up going up to 12 on g 12 on e so 12 11 10 then i'm gonna go f chord shape but now i'm on the uh eighth fret this is gonna be a c chord now just like we would do down here [Music] again i'm just rolling back down first finger hammering on to the tenth for eight to ten banding a little bit on g ten going into a d chord just more like the b flat a chord shape instead of here and then to end little uh bluegrass lick there [Music] that one's pretty tough when you bring it up to speed i have trouble uh getting my right hand to go as fast as my left hand so practice doing down up alternating picking as fast as you can and hopefully those are some tips to play the basic melody of nine pound hammer and then some other ideas to add to your own version of playing nine pound hammer thank you and hope to see you guys soon",

freak", "OMHHx3CpWcM": "hello and welcome to simplify guitar where my goal is to make popular songs playable for beginners by simplifying them down to a few easy to play chords and strum patterns now in this lesson we're going to learn the song nine pound hammer but before we do that if you would like to learn the 18 chords that I use for this song and all of my song tutorials then you can get my cord family cheat sheet by clicking on the information card up here at the top right of this video at any point during the lesson now let's go ahead and get started all right for this song I'm gonna be using the G chord family and I'm gonna be using only three cords of the Jeep C adenine and D / F sharp which means this is a great song for beginners to learn because also the strum pattern is very simple for strumming I'm going to be using a four beat drum pattern and we're going to be having a Down strum for every one of the beats and then we're gonna throw in an up strum after beats three and four so basically we have one two three and four and one two three and four and one two three and four and one now to add some variety to this strum pattern we're gonna be putting emphasis on the second and fourth beats meaning that we're going to strum harder for those beats than the others we're also gonna just be plucking the very first note of the chord for the very first beat of the measure so let's say I'm playing the G chord for the very first beat I'm just gonna pluck the first note of that chord which is the low E string and then four beats 2 3 & 4 & 1 2 3 & 4 & 1 2 3 & 4 & 1 2 3 & 4 & 1 so let me play that strum pattern for you at full speed just holding down that G chord so you can see what it would sound like [Music] [Applause] Schneider is a little too heavy [Music] see my baby [Music] well I'm buddy but you will so may I can [Music] roll on buddy [Music] long way to Harlan [Music] you can make my sister [Music] Oh [Music] all right I hope you enjoyed this lesson

getting a little chunky starting to get some size and some stat going on my hand up here for comparison she's about halfway through the flower cycle I expect to see a lot more nug meat clumping on as the next couple weeks go by here overall she's looking pretty happy pretty healthy not too bad of a run hanging out here under the single-source led from black sale market Canon 320 watt light it's got monitoring going on by the pulse unit pulse lets me know what's going on in the grow got the humidity probe here hanging down you can see this is letting my AC infinity fan know what our humidity and temperature are for the tent so it can kick on my light automatically excuse me my fan automatically starts it out low bumps up the speed and runs until it achieves the step parameters that I have programmed in keeping my environment nicely in tune and I'm pretty happy with it I think that's about all I have to say about that we're running this in the tips container down there it's kind of dark with inputs by build a soil all organically ran and nothing but water am one and mammoth P going into our reservoir I do a top watering every now and then every week maybe every four or five days want to make sure that that top soil stays warm and sometimes warm wet and sometimes that wicking action doesn't work very well so I take the cheap and sprayer fill that up when I do that I'll often throw in a little bit of yucca extract just to help keep the soil condition nice and wet and not hydrophobic yeah just did that to take she's looking a little bit thirsty but I'm pretty happy with the way she's Guerlain nicely shaped but I like the way she's just stacking up [Music] again that's a nine pound hammer bred by jinkx proof genetics gifted to me by Miss Rose that's sweet lady and I just couldn't wait to run it getting pretty excited about her she's definitely getting sticky she's getting a little bit of a stink to her not super distinctive yet on the smell hoping that that will develop a little bit more over the next couple weeks here and let me know what she's really gonna be like all right that's all I've got for you today I hope everybody's having a great week I will see you next time peace guys", "2xQ8rrqws3c": "well now hammer yes live too heavy [Music] for my son hold on buddy why Rosalie how can I roll [Music] [Music] it's a long way to Harlem it's long wait has

you today with the classic song 9 pound hammer I had an intermediate version of this that I did a while back maybe a year or two ago but I had some requests to do a beginner version so I simplified it even further we're gonna break things way down we're gonna go real slow on this one and we're gonna break down a whole bunch of fundamental techniques slides pull offs hammer ons stuff you absolutely need to know how to do if you want to play bluegrass style banjo I've got two solos worked up for nine pound hammer they're both beginner arrangements I'm gonna break them both down note for note and then show you a bunch of backup I would do for this song so really simple down the neck rolling back up and then some really basic up the neck vamping back up we're gonna say again in the beginner realm for this lesson if you want a more advanced version go check out my intermediate version and if you're watching the preview of this lesson you can head over to my website Mike heading music.com and grab the full length lesson you'll get access to watch all the videos you can download the tabs and the practice tracks alright here's nine pound hammer in the key of A alright let's start breaking down this beginner version of nine pound hammer remember I'm doing it in the key of A so I've got my capo on the 2nd fret I've got my fifth string spiked up at the whole step from G and that's where I commonly do the song and you know fiddles and mandolins like the song in the key of a but you if you don't feel like putting on your cape or you don't have a capo you could easily learn the song in the key of G but you won't be able to play along with me or with the practice tracks but you could easily learn this solo and G as well alright so here let's start breaking it down let me play the first five measures [Music] do that a few times one [Music] one more time real slow [Music] they start with a really simple pickup on beat two of measure one beat one is gonna be arrests we're gonna hit the open fourth string twice and then we're gonna put our second finger on the second fret of the fourth string using my thumb of my right hand three times in a row so they're all quarter notes so you got one and then we're gonna go up to the open third string four measure two that's kind of completes the walk that we want to hear so we have one do that a few times one I'm just working my thumb there I'm actually using my thumb to help me not play that too quickly so I'm using my thumb multiple times in a row it actually kind of helps slow my self down and make sure I'm not rushing through those quarter notes so counting out a lot if you need to one one more time a little faster one I'm never gonna go up and do two forward rolls so thumb index middle with our right hand and we're gonna use strings 5 3 1 so thumb index middle we're gonna do that same roll again measure 2 is a really good one to loop it works great for lead playing it also works great for backup I'm using my thumb twice at the beginning again to help slow myself down to make sure I play that first quarter notes we have one and your thumb would come back down you can loop it I recommend if your absolute beginner is make sure your index finger is going up so your thumb plays that third string first then your index finger takes over your thumb comes back down so you might be saying to yourself why would I why would I just start that with my index finger you could not that you wouldn't you wouldn't ever want to do that but the reason why I would is because it's easier to rush through that if I do index thumb so it's a it's actually trickier to believe it whereas if I use my thumb twice in a row kind of like a governor for your car it naturally just slows you down a little bit yeah also there's another kind of unwritten rule and Scruggs style banjo that if you can use your thumb you should so your thumbs the most powerful of your fingers usually you know you're pushing down with your thumb it's also most beginners and most people are most coordinated with their thumb that's again a kind of an unwritten rule and Scruggs banjo if you can use your thumb you should so that's another reason why I'm bringing my thumb down [Music] I'd be great when to practice just your string accuracy or work on your speed [Music] that's a great backup early lik like I said so let's put measures one and two together so count beat one one one one more time real slow one and the melody there is the is in measure one all the pickup notes are melody this 9-pound if you're singing along the words and then our melody and measure two is just of the open third string hit it twice but what we're doing there is filling it up now with a roll so I want you to practice there is you're gonna initially accent your thumb and then when you come up now I'm gonna start accenting my index finger my accent my thumb the whole time you're not gonna hear that melody [Music] so we need to accent our index singer [Music] and what we're doing there is we're bending that melody into a roll so it's not coming on the downbeat it's actually syncopated that's what's really cool about banjo and that's where the that's the kind of the genius of Scruggs a banjo it says it syncopate s-- the melody because we're using three fingers and three notes doesn't divide evenly into eight so we're gonna we're kind of playing on and off the beat and that's part of the kind of again the genius of Scruggs style banjo so make sure your accent to your index finger and get the basic roll down first don't don't try and accent too early but if you've got the roll down make sure you're not being overly heavy with your thumb otherwise it's not gonna sound quite right so let's do it one more time here's measures one and two one measure three our thumbs gonna come down again play the open third string and then we're gonna use our second finger on the third string and slide from two to four while doing an alternating thumb roll thumb index thumb middle three to five one are my strings so I'm sliding up right when I get up to that fourth fret I'm playing the open second string it would be the same note [Music] make sure you're not playing it twice with your thumb it's not this don't let your ear be tricked because it would it's the same note if you do it that way you're not taking advantage of your three fingers words if I do it this way thumb index thumb middle [Music] I'm using all my fingers another thing another tip for beginners is don't slide too quick it's very easy to get get excited and kind of slide you're quick let that first note wring out you need a reference point for your slides the other thing is if you let's say that you're having trouble with that slide you can just take it out doesn't sound that much different [Music] so you can always just take it out and if you're ever having trouble with slides just take it out just play the first note of the two of them so it'd be the the second fret you know so that's another option slides pull offs are always optional so let's do that again we have open third string that's a great one to practice if you're a beginner [Music] might have heard that Creek if you've played that song that's a very classic banjo lick you'll hear that a lot of songs okay so we slide up then we're gonna do a three to pull off thumb middle third string first string and this time I'm gonna get three notes so I'm not lining up the pull off it's not now it's I have one two three if you count it for E and if you wanted to count it kind of pulling back toward my palm you got to keep your first finger down as well those are just general techniques for beginners that you're gonna run into all the time so you can't get too much practice with that three to pull off let's do measure three on its own real slow here we go [Music] melodye there is so we have what's our Mele there's open third string at the beginning of measure three and then the melody is actually the second string open and then twice and then second fret on the third string and then open third string string goes into measure four it's basically a walk down on this of scale notes three or three blind mice cross buns if you play that song so it's just walking down the notes of a scale so not super interesting to play on the banjo right so we're not going so what are we doing to imply that instead of just hitting that open second string now we're sliding into it so more kind of kind of more implying like a vocalist might do where they're sliding into a note rather than just singing a open note sliding into it give it a little more flavor same thing instead of just doing that walk down it's a very square three two one are my notes my scale now we're doing a pull off kind of implying those notes if you if you play them chromatically it B so now we're just doing that with a pull off that's what we're doing there we're basically just implying that melody in a more interesting way so we have yes let's do the first three here we got one [Music] now measure for open third string that's gonna get you in to go into your full C chord here even though you don't see it so I got my second finger on the second front of the lowest string first finger on the first fret of the second string and third finger up on the second fret of the first string if you don't go into your full C it'll kind of sound like an e-minor which you don't want if you're if your first finger is not down that's an E minor so put your first finger down even though you don't see it in the tab so we're gonna hit the open third string and then do two four rolls this time four three one and then do that again that's the same role we didn't measure to now just different strings that's fine so I'm actually using the first open third string and measure four to give me time to put my hand down [Music] and the melody there is down to the second fret on the fourth string that's where I'm kind of highlighting that note with the rule so we have let's do 3 & 4 together slip those two not too hard there keep your C down now that's your five open third string again with your thumb now you're gonna move your second finger up to the second fret of the third string and do an alternating thumb roll thumb index so three two are my strings and then take your second finger off move it back down and do open third string second fret on the first string so you have do that a few times down to the second fret fourth string measure five is a good one your your thumb is moving around a lot there [Music] melodye there is all with your thumb so we have let's do four and five classic seelix on banjo so remember put your whole sea down really important it's easy to get out of position or think you can do that initial see and measure fool maybe in a different shape that's when I follow the left hand fingering is really closely there below the tab so they're the numbers in the circle so your one is your fur finger two is your second finger three is your third finger four is your pinky so follow those closely because a lot of times again you could go into in measure for me this way and then you realize in measure five okay and now I'm in the wrong position so really important set yourself up just do this lick and measure five now measure six open fourth string this is a classic Scruggs philic TI m-53 one back to the index finger on the open third string second fret on the fourth string open first string that's a good one to practice [Music] [Applause] that's a really good on for beginners another really good thing you could practice is starting that first note on a different string with your thumb so in this example we're doing it on the fourth string exercise would be now started on the third string everything else is the same yeah I'm moving that first note around I'm just practicing moving my thumb around that'd be really good practice for a beginner [Music] you'll see that variation just with that first note being different that's why I'm telling you to practice that so let's do that measure 6 one more time now measure 7 is a open 4th string pinch the outside strings 5 and 1 and then do an alternating thumb roll 4 3 4 1 so open and open and then 2nd fret on the 4th string and then open first string [Music] let's do six and seven together and then measure eight you", "QQhhImufwWA": "[Music] five five five [Applause] so [Music] go fire tonight [Music] foreign [Music] fire tonight [Music] uh fight [Music] go fire tonight [Music] oh [Music] [Music] fire tonight [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] you", "567H1ss5hW8": "on two three four-one all right everyone out there at banjo land mic heading here today I've got two solos to the classic bluegrass song 9 pound hammer in the key of a the first soul is gonna be kind of more of a basic version that stays pretty close to the melody the second version we're going to look at inserting some kind of bluesy licks into our solo and how do we do that I'm gonna break down the whole thing note for note and then talk about you know how I made my arrangement and then we're gonna do a whole lesson on how to play backup to the song all right so here's 9 pound hammer in the key of a all right let me break down the first three measures a nine pound hammer remember I've got my capo on the 2nd fret we're gonna be playing out of the key of G but it's gonna sound like the key of a I just put it into the key of a it makes it may be a little more jam friendly for the mandos and fiddles but you could easily play this this solo out of the key of G or you know b-flat or be where ever you want to put your capo alright here we go okay so let's break down this arrangement so we're gonna start at the pickup I'm gonna show you a couple different ways you can do a pickup on this one I for the tab I real kind of more of a roll what I would call a rolling pickup we're gonna kind of roll into it so we're gonna start on the second fret of the third string and we're gonna do a two to three slide while doing a forward roll so I'm gonna do with my right hand strings three two one so I'm going one so it's on beat two one two three I'm lining that slide up two three and then I'm gonna go back to the open third string with my mitt with my index finger of my right hand so I'm doing so T I am i there and then I'm gonna land down on the second fret of the fourth string with the thumb of my right hand that's gonna be a quarter note so I'm gonna go one two and then I'm gonna pinch the open third string and first ring for the beat one of measure two so it sounds like this one you know give B for plenty of measure I also recommend counting beat one so you say one that really helps you you know kind of get the timing of it so you don't jump in too early so one more pick up you could do this probably a little bit closer the melody would be just playing the open fourth string twice and then hitting that second fret on beat four so instead of doing that rolling pickup we're just gonna go one that's just probably you know straight melody you know so if you want to get a little bit closer the melody or do something a little simpler that's something you could do okay so one more time here's measure one one and then we're gonna pinch on beat one of measure two and then we're gonna do a two five slides here your second fingers right there on the second fret and then we're gonna slide it from two to five on the fourth string while doing a forward roll strings four three one same timing as is measured to or as measure one excuse me we're going we're pinching on beat one and then we're rolling a beat to never to go up to the fifth string and do five fun so we're doing a pinch in then two forward rolls we're gonna do this a bunch in this song another way you can do it is you can also just hit the open third string you know but that pinch just gives it a little more pop another thing you could do is you could roll at the beginning of it if you wanted so you could go so instead of doing a pinch there I did open third string open second string and then I rolled so we're gonna use that a lot it we're gonna use that rolling thing a lot in this song so that's a couple variations you can use you can you can pinch a single note I like doing the pinch though because it kind of pops out that first melody note that's up to you to see what you like so here's measure three we're gonna hit open fifth string open first string and then do a two three slide on the third string oh it's kind of the opposite of an alternating thumb roll I'm going TMT i/o with a slide so then I'm gonna do basically that same thing again open fifth string open first string and then I'm gonna do a three to pull off open first ring so I did notice not reporting the emphasis on a different beat instead of going like you might have seen it on other songs one so on that one I'm doing the slide on the one and the three and the pull off so notice how we basically inverted that we're going one so we switch those slides to the two and the four the slide and the pull off instead of the one and the three so that's a little interesting variation notice how that lines up with the melody there this nine pound hammer is a little too heavy right there you're not seeing that right on the downbeat your that comes in a little bit late one two three four one is a little too heavy so it's it's not right on the down because it's just a little too square that way so we're letting that first beat take up with a roll basically and then we're emphasizing that note on beat two just a small thing but it brings out the melody a little bit stronger watch if I play it the other way so it's not wrong it's not bad but it just doesn't imply the melody quite as as rhythmically the pitches are still the same but we're not getting the rhythm of the melody there so I'll play it the other way we're just we're just emphasizing those melody notes a little bit different so measure 3s are really good one to look at again we took a simple lick and just inverted it a little bit to make the melody come out a little bit stronger okay one more time here's the first three measures and I will say I measure three you can also play it the straight way you know so doing the slide at the beginning if you want to create a variation so that's another thing you could do you could also do some of those variations and measure to that we are talking about with the different roles this is a great tune to have a bunch of different ways to play it you're going to see this song a lot in jam sessions and it's one to have it's a great song to have multiple breaks to you", "LeYGbaKQXEY": "hi this is Mike Marshall and you're watching a sneak peek from my school of mandolin on YouTube alright now we're going to do the same thing with the 9 pound hammer great classic bluegrass tune in the key of G again that's kind of a bluesy thing how can I hold when the wheels wrong road so how am i doing that following that voice the word slid into that G note sliding into the be pulling off on the B flat sliding backwards from the G even sliding backwards from the G and out into the eat really vocalizing that melody 20 for my size and sliding of the beat but for my side slide let's try it with the guitar wants key G don't you do it now I'll play rhythm it's long just get a little fruit just to get a little fruit fly it into that role don't you roll so slow how can I", "97XnVi14qyE": "howdy welcome to

had about 40 or 50 gold pick members say I want an advanced version of it so here you go this is got a lot of great melodic licks in it in kind of a different way of presenting this melody I thought it's pretty cool so jump over there and grab that we're gonna learn it measure for measure as I mentioned then I forgot another video segment where we're going to slow I'm gonna play it very slowly from start to finish no interruption so you can really see what's going on all the way through and then I have a rhythm tracks video where I've got my guitar and we play for different speeds starting from very slowly all the way up to speed so you can practice long so no excuse not to go over there only thing I don't have a little granny's blackberry cobbler I'll have to work on that you never know this technology I might be able to serve you up a slice of blackberry cobbler one day all right here at the kickoff I'm going to give you a kick off just like you were gonna kick this song off and to start singing it you could also use this kick off and measure one to come into your break after someone sings of course so it kind of serves a dual purpose but you'll really want to pay attention to the counting here because it comes in on an upbeat or on an offbeat okay if you'll notice that first little squiggly line and measure one that's called an eighth note rest okay so the very first downbeat we don't play anything but we come in with the pitch on the upbeat of one okay panting and I have those fingerings circled our right hand fingering circle beneath each of the notes so if you were counting it one and two and three and four and one okay so that that may kind of throw some of you off I've just here at the start and don't let it do that if you have a hard time with it you can just start right on the downbeat but I just think that's cool this being more of an advanced version to have kind of an advanced kick off there okay one thing I do want to say is after you hammer on on that third beat so one once you get there I want you to leave that fret down that's it second fret down there you may play it with your index finger I play it with my middle but I want you to leave it down after that hammer on all the way through the slide and measure to okay because we we want that ringing note to be there still want it there almost want I wanted to create kind of some dissonance because we're we're we're following the melody but we're doing it in a more advanced way we're kind of creating a dip in the melody there and measure to okay some people kind of sing it like that some people just sing a straight hammer okay so those are two is fairly simple we start off with a pitch the open G and E string we already have that second fret down we're gonna slide those are quarter note slides so don't get too fast on me end it with a pinch okay so first and second measures one good now measure three we're going to start off with a quarter note but there's something here that I want you to really pay attention to this makes a lot of a difference here but the first hammer on that we have from the second to third fret on this g string is an eighth note hammer on okay we know that because if you look at the little stem beneath the notes of the hammer ons there's just a single bar line down there as opposed to the pull off later in measure three if you'll notice it has those two little double bar lines so what that means is that I'm going to hammer from the second to the third fret at precisely the same time that I pick that B string so it sounds like this okay now you might be tempted to play an eighth note hammer on which would sound like this and that would be okay but the reason why I did an eighth note hammer on instead of the sixteenth note hammer on it so that we could contrast it with a sixteenth note pull off okay so we get just a little bit of variety there in the third measure that pull off coming back from the third to the second fret some of you may pull down I pull off going either way some of you may be using these two fingers it's okay whatever you want to do but that pull off happens before we hit that open D string for that so it creates a little pop there now a measure for we're going to pick up the melody again little too hand and then go ahead and create your whole full C chord shape there hey cuz we're going to afford role third measure for let's look at measure five we've still got this C shape down it starts out on the B string at that point we're going to be releasing our ring finger to get ready for this pull off and it's an eighth note pull off from the third to the second fret okay don't get too fast on that a lot of times people want to play okay know this pull off it's an eighth note pull off so it goes the same speed as the rest of our notes let's measure five once again you can pull that off going down or you can push off people sometimes call that a push off okay measure six pretty straight up measure start off with a quarter I'll do a forward reverse roll sixteenth note pull off I do use my ring finger and middle finger a lot for these love you may be wanting to use your first two fingers that's fine too at this point measure seven we're going to jump to a partial D chord closed-shell but what we're going to do is just grab these first two okay middle finger on the third fret pinky on the fourth fret and then we're going to use our ring finger and we're going to do a little bit of single string pick in here you'll notice the the fingerings beneath the notes on the third beat we have thumb and then an index both in the g-string okay so that whole measure seven sounds like this so I kind of go ahead and jump to this shape these three fingers and then keep my middle finger I'm sorry my ring finger mobile cuz it's gonna have to do a little jumping around good then we're just going to end with the julik measure eight now we're going to start getting really syncopated and get into some more melodic let's take a look at that", "v_QTuSBHkE0": "hey what's going on guys my name is josh also sweet bunnies in today's video we're going to go ahead and

in the effects all the way got a lemony tiny taste i would say on it and it's definitely got that uh signature true leaf little soapy aftertaste they have in all their concentrates for some reason i don't know if that's the extraction process or cooling or whatever the hell it is curing i don't know what they do they all have that little bit of soap in my opinion soapy aftertaste to it but lemon and pine come through first i would say almost like a uh i don't know a wood polisher wood cleaner oh i said i'm gonna go ahead and another one in me i'm definitely enjoying this nine pound hammer said i should have got into it sooner so you guys can see what color that is there very it's translucent you can see all the way through that see my screen door behind it behind there and now i should have got to it when i still had a little bit more left in it but uh your boy is pushing [ __ ] off over here i had a full gram of it we got about a half left now i said it's hot as [ __ ] out here but i'm out here sweating my ass off i'm gonna see the sweat running down my face i'm sweating out here in florida so let me know down in the comments where you guys are smoking from and what you're smoking on where you got it from i said i'll definitely like to try it go ahead and get one more cheers it's a little more low tap that one get that pine through there for sure that one made me cough when the other one did it go figure the harder dab stay hydrated guys got your gatorade so i got my gatorade stay nice and hydrated whenever you're smoking of course water whatever you do drinks with you it's coming in i haven't said it yet it's coming in at 80.7 thc uh two points two percent cbg point six percent cbd for a total of eighty three point six percent total cannabinoids but no it's that cbg i think is what's got me feeling nice i don't know but like i said eighty percent all these true clear syn ranges are coming around eighty percent i've noticed i've got three or four of them now recent in the last uh last month or so i'd say they're all coming in around that percentage this one's old too say 12 24 that's [ __ ] is the package last last december i don't know i saw somebody on the reddit saying that true leaves changed their uh expiration dates to six months from a year which i don't know if that's necessarily true that is let me know see me wiping the sweat off my face let me know down in the comments i'm not sure but if it i hope it is because i'd rather be packaged in june than uh december last year holy [ __ ] you know so it's eight month old syringe now it's [ __ ] ridiculous if there's anything you guys want me to review i said definitely down in the comments or go ahead and give me a dm over on the instagram at the wii funnies and if i get my hands on it i'd love to try it out and i'm saying uh florida products of course i'm trying to get some no boof off the street or into that [ __ ] because what you're getting is definitely not the booth i'd be trying to get the same package at least cheers i'm going to get another glob man there's any video ideas or uh questions you know i'd like i'd love to do a q a uh q a down the road eventually uh like i said leave them down the comments leave them over on instagram over there in the dms and i'd love to get to it if i get enough for a q a i'd love to do that i had somebody say they'd like me to uh compare the different florida dispensaries and the products they offer that's i think that's a great idea but i don't know it varies by location and uh location and uh company of course the dispensary itself or they distribute their stuff but i break down what they have you know i mean i've been everywhere except uh harvest and fluent i believe and i'm gonna hit fluent very soon next time i go to tampa i'm gonna try and go to fluent if they have any flowering last time i went i went to tampa a couple days ago and they had what they have they had blue note that was the only flower they had in and if i'm going to try a new dispensary i'm going to i want to shop around get a couple different strains you know get a taste of the uh taste of the land sample you know what i'm talking about but say this night hammer's hidden got me feeling i'm be chilling look at me talking as well my approach to ride i'll tell you what i filled a cartridge with uh the which one the um not this one obviously but i filled a cartridge with the last uh syringe i i not had but the last one i reviewed it was what was it i should know gdp truly granddaddy purple it was great indica i think i like that one a little more than this honestly i love knife on hammer but i'm saying granddaddy purple is a personal favorite strain of mine you know i'll tell you what it's uh i think it surpasses the nightmare hammer just a little bit in my opinion but grand eddie purple it's uh it stays true to my heart you know i've i've had it for a long time had it from a lot of different companies on the legal market and uh homegrown packs as well that i knew was granite purple or at least granddaddy purple genetics because that [ __ ] was green with purple or purple notes and you know what i'm talking about but no this video is all about nine pound hammer i'm not getting into that i'm gonna go get one more here cheers real lemony that gummit i'm good i'm feeling nice now so we're gonna get out of your hair very soon i said i think that was it honestly i might get one more minute yeah [ __ ] it we'll get one more for the video so like i said don't want to stay here too long we already had about yeah almost nine minutes here we go one more and i'll get out of y'all's hair hope everybody's having a great day staying medicated and lifted um shout out all my boys flmmj collective [ __ ] me you know what i'm dropping everything today [ __ ] me we're gonna end this video have a great day guys just drop the night collector cheers love you it's the weird funny side of that smoker for me so good for

Cartwright and welcome to continuation of nine pound hammer History Month here in November this is part two so if you've accidentally clicked on this one first by all means go back to part one you will not know what the I'm talking about lets you see that one first and assist skip to first not behind my first record you know we'll talk about the music in a second I told myself that I was gonna kill myself or kill everybody if I did have an album that came out before I was 25 and with six months to spare the mud the blood the Bears came out on Wayne head records put out by Lynn touch now speed cult we played together in Louisville and this thing I think it sounds like hell personally but it's like the same same thing is in their first national record which we thought sounded like hell I think it touched with people and as I introduction you know and people in foreign lands going what the hell how this even how this mutation happen and if you look at her there's not what a cow Punk yet and but one thing about this record it got a lot of attention when it first came out me and Scott were hoping just one person out there would write something nice about us and understand what we're talking about now I was like our goal in life for a dead girl at the moment and we end up have an ecstatic review is probably the best reviews I've ever gotten for anything getting like nine out of ten and now John Peel and higgling played this so much that someone imitated impersonated rather raw Halsman and acted like he was an iPhone hammer drummer to get access to John Peel now I didn't know the hell of John Peel was at the time so it didn't mean a lot as it does now anyway this is a great record and when dead on a high note we thought were gonna be famous but if you listen to this it's not count Punk at all the only thing it really sounds Punk accountably Cal rather the only thing early sounds Cal is Scott's voice and that brings us to today's playlist Johnny and Johnny now talking about Johnny Cash and Johnny Thunders because that's basically like the last one with Jason to scorches and the Ramones that was who we were wanting to be and hoping to be what we actually sound like I'm sound like Johnny Thunders Scott sounds like Johnny Cash and we're very very lucky on the Johnny Cash part as far as Scott because the best advice I can give anyone is what I read that Chrissie Hynde said about being a singer go into a closet shot your brains out listen to how it sounds that's your voice deal with it that's it and luckily Scott always had this like really deep Johnny Cash kind of twang and anytime he did Johnny Cash number oh man and I mean it would just it would be great and we would nail it and also anytime that anything was Johnny Thunders related we could totally I told I totally nailed that so that's what kind of what we what we could do we were very very happy about that and it's easier to set your guitar to sound like Johnny Thunders and you can't really set your voice to selling Johnny Cash I mean if I could set my voice that something Wilson Pickett but not sound like me that's the way it goes so that brings us to today's playlist Johnny Cash and Johnny Thunders now if you don't know Johnny Thunders was they bleed guitar player of the New York Dolls and also split off to form the Heartbreakers and basically introduced heroin to everyone and including Sid Vicious but besides that he had an amazing guitar now on this playlist I put the same 13 Johnny Thunders songs that he's recorded we did record a thousand times now the interesting contrast between these two people as during the 70s when Scott never growing up Johnny Cash wasn't the  do you and Johnny Cash rebel Johnny Cash his family entertainment Johnny Cash came on Christmas special with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and saying saying gospel songs come on Johnny Cash was something that we had shoved up her ass and we liked it but he definitely kind of devolved into this family entertainment like I was saying before he had his big resurgence I mean there was an even in one point where he hadn't gotten dropped by Columbia Records and the 80s and he was just doing kind of really standard country fair but the Johnny Cash that's on the plate that trying to cash us on his playlist is what I'll call Johnny Cash in happier times I don't like listening to those later records when he's about to die I like we like to not bend hammers definitely stuff's not been hammer drawers on it is a Boom Chicka Boom Chicka Boom Chicka Boom Chicka Boom Chicka songs about teenage Queen and candy stores and the big rivers and I'm gonna cry and it comes that train and it's interesting that he became family entertainment because Johnny Cash was obviously a very very secret there's a secret back Tim he's obviously Hellraiser if you've seen the movie and knowing that any idea he was like that ever thought it was always past him and but he got famous for singing you listen to me songs there's songs he's singing to a bunch of revved up jail convicts and he's cussing there Bob I'm gonna kill this person I store some cocaine Lou and Johnny Thunders I don't know if you ever custom one song but Johnny Thunder everything a exact opposite spectrum in the seventies Johnny Thunders was known as everyone's bad exam everyone's favorite bad example because he was a heroin addict I guess from the get-go and someone told Johnny Thunders once to Johnny Thunders had a Keith Richards fixation you wanted to like Keith Richards and someone told Johnny thunder is that Johnny Keith Richards waited till he was a rock star become a heroin addict you know and Johnny did not Johnny it seemed to focus more on heroin but if you listen to that guitar sound what do you think like that like that at all uh and you put that with the boom Chicka Boom Chicka Boom happiness of the Johnny Cash songs and they sound had he could be singing about man in reading Hobie and I mean family could sing along I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die you know that's just that's pretty severe but the way it sounds it's just peppy and moves along and a way to Johnny Thunder sounds it's like I'm just dragging stuff down here I'm like too lazy to keep up with you guys and screw you guys I'm gonna play over here by myself and so anyway the other two cornerstones of the non pound hammer sound Johnny Thunders and Johnny Cash and you can get this list on Spotify or click on the link down low and this one doesn't flow as good as the other lists have and will because they seem to be kind of push and pull they're you know they're very and that's where we kind of put things together and came over the 9th on hammer sound naturally that's like I said the other that Jason scorches Ramona something we were trying to do this is something that came very naturally being a lazy stone guitar player cambrian actually made having this big authoritative voice like I'm right you're wrong him definitely you see this Scott so anyway unless you guys enjoy the playlist and the reason we're doing this I didn't mention last time besides it being declared by wherever's president nothing bout hammer History Month we've got a new album bluegrass conspiracy it's probably the best one I don't know you buy it you tell me honestly you can get on PledgeMusic side or go just do a search for it and while I'm at like to thank plays music for putting up with our shenanigans and helping us get this thing out so until next time okay one more thing I forgot it's gonna say all right Johnny Cash everyone likes Johnny Cash just because you like Johnny Cash Damian like country but he's revered around the world and before he died he gave one interview on Larry King and Larry King goes who do you like in country music he's I don't like Moe he said he didn't like countries nowadays it and that was like from my 8 10 years ago whenever was he said he did not like Martin country music except for two people one female and one male two female Emmylou Harris the male we're gonna get to him but that's gonna be probably a place you guys can be jumping off but Johnny Cash said he liked one guy on his death interview who was it all right that'll be coming up and stay tuned for 9 pound hammer History Month lesson part 3 and enjoy yourself and enjoy knock down hammer and that's it thanks", "Lsijp6pwORs": "[Music] okay we're gonna go over the instrumental from Tony Rice's version of nine pound hammer it's gonna use a lot of hammer ons and pull offs and it's gonna be mainly flat picking so up and down strokes and I would just recommend going over accuracy versus speed when you're starting speed will come but here's what I have note for note so we'll start out with the first fret or I'm sorry the second fret of the b-string it's gonna be a hammer on under the third fret okay next is gonna be the first fret of the e-string so so far we have [Music] okay then we're gonna go from the second fret to the first fret of the B string so so far we have okay okay next is gonna be some alternate picking between the third fret of the g string and the first fret of the B string [Music] okay so let's try that again okay next is going to be a slide from the third fret to the fourth fret of the g string then open G on the end okay [Music] okay to finish off that little lick it's gonna be third fret of the D string open D string open g string [Music] okay so it'll be all together [Music] okay so up to speed [Music] it's a pretty cool lick all by itself okay so after that we're going to have some alternate picking between the G and D string [Music] okay on the end there that was the second fret of the g string back home it saw us Kouji [Music] okay let's try that all together [Music] okay next is gonna be second fret of the d-string back to an open G okay so so far [Music] okay with the next part we're going to transition into the C chord of the instrumental so it's going to start off with a pull off from the first fret of the D string to the third fret of the a string okay then it follows that by the standard bluegrass riff and C but it's a little bit different than that but it's in front of the C string her up the a string sorry open D first fret of the D string second fret of the D string [Music] then open G second fret of the G smell and first fret of the b-string so from that Selig [Music] okay so let's try it from that see turn around actually okay now this part is the same lick for the first two segments of the four-part instrumental the only difference is the next part so if you learn that part you've essentially learned the first half of the instrumental [Music] okay so for the first part that makes it different we're gonna start off with the third fret of the g string to the second fret of the g string [Music] to the open g string so from that C turn around [Music] okay then we go to the second fret of the D string back to the open G back to the second fret of the d-string back to the open D string to the second fret of the a-string from the C position [Music] okay that last little part was a slide from the third fret to the fourth fret of the g-string okay and then we that's just G [Music] let's try that again [Music] okay and then we go from the open D string to the 3rd fret of the D string open D string again open g string again that's third to the fourth fret on the g string the last note is the the third fret of the e-string so from that slide [Music] okay that is 25% actually closer to 50% of the entire solo so let's piece it all together [Music] okay now to touch on the last little bit of it the second half or the next part of that which goes over the same chord progression is exactly the same it just will change at this next part I'll show you so a little more up to speed and then this is where it changes [Music] okay this is where it will change so that it was second fret of the g-string [Music] - strums on the g string open strums so I did pull off there [Music] it just helps with the up and down technique [Music] that was the second fret of the d-string [Music] okay next we'll do the second fret of the d-string I can fret of the d-string [Music] second fret of the a string fret of the d-string so this part gets a little confusing but it's a lot of alternating hammer-ons between strings on the second fret [Music] you okay so let's try that again it's all second fret with open strings [Music] the D string second fret of the d-string second fret of the d-string second fret of the g-string okay and that's gonna be a run from open B first fret of the B string second fret of the B string to it third fret of the B string so so far we have [Music] and that's the third fret that one's kind of a tough one because you're gonna have to maybe bar it with your ring finger [Music] okay [Music] so let's try that one more time [Music] okay next part is gonna be a pretty quick pull off from the second fret of the B string the first fret okay to the third fret it's gonna be similar to that first part where we alternate between the two so that's a third from the g-string back to the first fret of the b-string that's the common riff there is gonna be that slide third fret to the fourth fret okay so let's piece that part together from the C riff [Music] [Music] that was the third fret of the d-string gee okay so let's piece that all together real slow and then we'll pick up speed with it [Music] okay and then it repeats [Music] and this is where it changes for the second half [Music] and that is the first half of nine pound hammer", "FdXDjkk3p_A": "don't you roll so slow how can i roll when the wheels don't go [Music] [Music] hey everybody chris eldridge here at sonic junction and uh this week we're gonna look at doc watson playing nine pound hammer um and the version that i got this from is uh there's a video on youtube it's a black and white video and uh it's doc and a fiddler and another guitar player and singer and uh it's just it's really it's super cool to hear doc watson pick this tune to hear doc watson play anything he had such a cool um sound on the guitar just the way he the way he played any note um he had this incredible swing he really did have there was a real swing to the way he played but there was also this incredibly um on the front of the beat kind of forward motion thing to the way he played too there was nothing laid back about doc's flat picking but in the best way possible um and so this was a really fun thing for me because um i hate i shouldn't admit this i'll probably get my flat pickers card revoked but um i never studied doc when i was young i was like tony rice as you guys i'm sure of guessed was my man and clarence white to a lesser degree and in recent years norman's kind of you know i've like learned some norman stuff and tried to get inside that but i've never really studied any doc stuff so this week was actually really fun for me because i kind of got to get inside of um this break that he played and try and figure out how to how to you know play these notes and it's an interesting thing about studying someone else's thing if you transcribe somebody else it gives you a chance to get inside uh well once you can play the notes that they play you're only a small fraction of the way there in terms of being able to imitate them and really learn the deep lessons which have more to do with how you would play something how you would play those notes um there's a lot of cool stuff to be learned in that and for me it was fun you know this is this is a pretty easy solo it's not going to take very long today because because it's um content-wise it's not very hard but to try and capture that doc watson thing is is really tricky i i can't even almost do it um but um but but that doesn't mean we're not having having a good time trying and um well yeah enough talking let me uh let me get to showing it to you so it starts on um you know as most things do there's a pickup so it goes i'll play the whole break just kind of slow one two three [Music] do [Music] that's it so you might notice uh a couple of things there is uh the two halves of that break are similar in the sense that he uh he does this thing where he's doing a like a backwards roll like cross picking roll on a d chord [Music] it does a little bit of that on the c um but also there's this or [Music] did you do that thing again here we go so you have that motif of [Music] um and uh and and those are kind of the the big component parts um so from from the get go again it starts on starts on the end of three one two and it's so swung it swung to an almost to me it feels like a caricature-y kind of degree but that's just how doc did it and it sounds so awesome um so one two three so after that strum there's like a kind of he kind of um they're not the strum after that uh the pickup notes sorry uh he does do like a little strum to take to hold some of this space before he plays this [Music] that lick that lick comes in on beat three so between basically the the top of between the downbeat and beat three he's sort of strumming so one two three one three [Music] you see what i mean sorry i can't i can't speak every beat while we're doing it because i'm just not that coordinated but i was saying one and three and uh so so that's what it is and those strums are not um you know it's just it's a filler it's strum so you don't need to worry about getting that super right one two three [Music] so the content of this lick it's it's sorry [Music] so it starts on a flat seven look at this as because nine pound hammer is essentially a blues this is like these are bluesy notes flat sevens and things [Music] so and then after that he goes which we've seen before i think we've seen norman doing that where he's at this point we're over c chord the chord has changed over a c so he's playing like a flat seven a six and a five kind of really getting that c7 sound happening that bluesy c7 so um and then after that right after that he walks up chromatically into this d position [Music] and that d for as a refresher it's just like this this d we all know except we're taking this high note the uh the third in the chord and we're dropping it down an octave yeah that's the same note these two are staying the same so this becomes this i'm just doing like a backwards roll [Music] and then a big old g-run [Music] and that g-run by the way that's like the uh that's the super generic g-run so he's got chromatic notes and an interesting thing about doc i don't think that doc really played a lot of um like hammer-ons and pull-offs i could be completely wrong about that but in my kind of you know my concept of doc and just trying to figure this out i think part of the way he gets the sound he gets is that he picks everything so and he definitely picks that g run [Music] sort of how you it's sort of the part of the way that you get that um really insistent forward driving thing okay so that whole thing i know i kind of jumped from one thing to the next to the next but if we stitch those component parts together we get one two three [Music] pretty cool right now the second half uh starts on kind of using this a similar motif [Music] that thing you know starting on the flat seven but the second time um well first of all it's not the second half of the solo starts on the downbeat that's a downbeat okay and then it goes [Music] so we're doing some things where we're getting we're having fretted notes against open notes right there on the between the second and first strings got fretted and open notes and then this is where we get kind of the the tangy notes we've got the third fret of the third string and then the open b string [Music] so um so after [Music] then we have have a little f note here and then we get into this exact same shape that we just looked at right here um just down a whole step or the other way you can look at this is it's just these two notes in a c chord which i should have also pointed that out when we were looking at this a second ago sort of like these notes from a c chord just moved up okay so anyway again we have the backwards roll have that kind of um kind of fun flat picky bluesy lick [Music] and then again the same chromatic walk up same cord with the backwards roll [Music] and now we have this great super doc watsony ending lick so what is that it's uh so third fret of your second string the d note an open second string open first string and third fret of the second again so so after we get back to this this note the next note is this third fret of the third string and open so let's actually let's zoom in a little bit on one spot because just so that you can get this let's just look at that much and actually put those notes in it in their own little musical context one two [Music] right now i'm kind of trying to take it i'm taking it out of this solo for a second just showing you how this little lick works you can use it in a lot of different ways [Music] sorry [Music] see i'm i'm just playing a few little variations where i'm starting that sequence of notes in different places on different beats and you can see that's a very uh it's a very useful little collection of notes you that's a you'll find that in flat picking all over the place [Music] that's how you play it over c chord um okay so uh where were we yes the second half of the solo uh let me just start at the beginning beginning of the second half three four [Music] right okay so we [Music] so that's that first half we just we're looking at that and then he lands on a g again that's a little like three note pattern that repeats so one two three that's where that falls in the measure one two and three okay that's the whole thing um so if i play it all slowly one two three [Music] do and notice even doing it that slow speed i'm really trying to accentuate that swing because when you speed it up one two [Music] i'm not saying i can sound like doc but but it gets you closer it gets you closer than when you play it really straight so that's that lesson um doc's the man you should uh check out that video it's really good and um and uh yeah have fun with it let me see what you got uh okay see ya until next time [Music] you", "3mHpyPV88ng": "hi everybody welcome back to mando lessons in this lesson I'm going to be working on this is part three of the nine pound hammer song series in part one I talked about the melody and singing along with with the song itself um finding the chords getting the chords in the right place and playing rhythm part two I introduced a little break that I invented that was mostly just the melody with adding some shuffle and a little bit of a turnaround at the end so check out those lessons if you haven't already because this lesson is going to use information from both those first lessons and I'm going to talk about playing this song and singing this song in different keys so what we're going to do is the the goal of this lesson is to make it so in ten minutes or however long the lesson takes I'm going to teach you to play this song in every key to there is as well as the break you're not going to learn to play the chords and the break in every key in ten or 12 minutes is my hope let's see if I can hold myself to that if you need tabs standard notation chords melody all that sort of stuff so ver Amanda lessons calm as well as a couple ways to donate always appreciated but not required new lessons come out every Thursday so please subscribe and here we go so we've been working in the key egg using this chop shape you're unfamiliar with that check out the previous lessons and the chop chord lesson at mandalas calm so we're going to be playing and b-flat so we're going to take that a shape move it up one fret flap I don't get out of my singing range I'm sure I will at some point here this man pound hammer this little too heavy is B flat flat s one last time back to beat like the pros the local plan after the road when the wheels go through next door we've got D plan your flat F B flat it's the same shape as a d e and a that we've been using just everything is up one fret and that is going to work you know you can do the same thing we can take so take it down a half step in there and a flat or G sharp if this is an unfamiliar concept to you do check out the the chopped chord lesson and this lessons on learning to play in every key and learn all major and minor chords a lot of that information it's transferred into what I'm talking about here so now we're in b-flat we've got our chords we played along with it hope it's not too high for your voice but if it is stick with us and we'll get to a key that feels comfortable for you now we've got this melody that we were playing an a that sounds like this it's sort of like the basic melody with some shuffle I added in the key of a what we're going to do is we're going to take our pointer finger and we're going to just lay it over the first fret like this this is kind of like a visual guide just for a moment and we're going to pretend our pointer finger is the new nut here's the nut of the instrument and we're going to take that nut it's like putting the capo on exhibits our first finger our first finger is just going to hang out around this first fret and the the new break in the key of B flat is the same notes just everything's up a half-step and it sounds like this and watch my left hand as I do this [Music] that's the melody I didn't play a quite note-for-note with the tabs the standard rotation are over on the website but I'll go through that in b-flat and then you'll start to notice something so the notes we're going to be using are all third fret fifth fret and first fret so the first phrase again that's a little pick up so that's that's all a stranger for that fifth fret at the end on the D string [Music] and yet this melody should sound familiar to you because you've done the part two of this series so I'm kind of speeding through it in this way because the melody should sound familiar and it's just about finding these notes on the instrument so let's play that first half again so as you're watching this you'll notice my pointer finger never moves from this little area I kind of just keep it ready and any time I'm tempted to play an open string my pointer finger drops in and says it's no longer an open string it's now 1st fret let's do that again [Music] that's into the D part instead of this open E string we're in B flat which is a half step above so our open E string role Bodhi is now 1st fret 5 3 1 so that's the last little phrase get that that's sort of the one little part that moves away from the melody and again watch my pointer finger everything's just my all my fingers are just staying in this little shape here all five threes and ones and if you can really remember that the whole break that I've designed here is all 5 3 & 1 your fingers will just naturally all just those notes just six different notes the pentatonic B flat 6 note I guess well yeah pentatonic scale there's six notes but two of them are so there's five different notes and an extra F so that um that's the break you know work through it check out the tabs and standard notation on the website and really just more than anything well I've got my picks if you've watched my beginners series you'll know that dropping your pick gets you 10 points because it means you're holding your pick nice and loose so I just gave ourselves some points there but that might be the first time I did in the lesson yeah so you know you really use your ear more than anything and just try to get work on b-flat first [Music] and get that under your fingers it's close enough a work on getting those chords and then if you've been saying this whole lesson but I can't sing anywhere near that pitch it's either way too low or way too high for me what you can do is move to a different strength so you can move down a string so rather than going one let's take it down - mmm so now the g string third fret of the g 5 g one of the d KU and that's going to bring you into the key of E flat let it go man your chords are going to be e flat so this 9 pound hammer this went too heavy for less than how can I go so that's too low for me but it could be right in line with where it's comfortable for you to sing it so that's one option you know ultimately the thing with singing songs and bluegrass is it's about the the singer of the song gets to pick the key because that's where it's comfortable for them to sing and hopefully they don't think a key that's too weird but uh if they do what I've got is I've got all the the tabs written out in every key so a B flat B C C sharp D E flat E F F sharp G a flat a all the way through and just play through play through in a couple different keys and you'll see that you're using the same shape so just go back to b-flat if you want to do it in be you're now once you start using these three Bible shapes and you get your pointer finger kind of acting as the capo like I was talking about earlier you can then slide that anywhere so let's go to four go up again five seven and three or you can move over a string to five seven three starting on the g string and the the way to figure out what key you're in when you're doing this on this song when you get to hammer Halen whatever note you're playing on the word hammer that's here that's the key of the song hammer so first fret on the a-string is a b-flat I can just put my hand down somewhere random like sixth fret on the D string and use that shape [Music] I don't even know what key this is until I look at it hello the fourth fret of the a-string so I'm playing in c-sharp [Music] and then finding those chords using those shapes from the previous lessons so I hope this helps if you have any questions by all means shoot them down in the comments and we'll help each other out figure out what's going on here I hope it's been a helpful series for you getting into playing in some different keys learning to play a little bit up the fretboard working out break for a song things like that again it's not about this song it's about gaining the skills to play any song in any key thanks again for watching again if you need the tabs or standard notation they are over at the website mando lessons.com and again I've got all 12 keys written now so if you want to go this is going to be a big PDF on the part 3 of 9 pound hammer lesson in the song section I was having all written out in all 12 keys so you can kind of check yourself but really work on using your ear getting your pointer finger in on that first fret or just come to the lowest fret you're at [Music] and you'll really start to get a feel for it and it'll be that much easier when you try to apply these rules to a different song thanks again for watching hope to see you again soon bye bye", "H4RCVOBAiHM": "let's make welcome ralph stanley at the old home place [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] don't leave me baby someday [Music] awesome [Music] better making love [Music] hammer all day [Music] awesome [Music] all day working for the stage is awesome", "1hmlrz-7qU8": "okay so this is steve from aaron's music service and i'm going to do a quick little lesson here on how to play the song the nine pound hammer that's rural travis tune and i'm going to show you how to play it not how to play it and sing it because when i sing it i sing it in a but when merle sings it he sings it g but when you just play it you play it in the key of e and the first chord is a b7 which is right there and you start off with that b note which is your melody now [Music] okay so that's the basic thing b7 and super slow-mo i go right to an e [Music] chord that's an a back to e b see i did the same thing that's the b b a e and then right here i learned that from my dad he would always skip the the d and a string but it's basically a b two so it's a it's like playing the e right here but up in the seventh fret and then you play the the uh c sharp note which is the first string at the ninth fret then you play an e right here it's just like an a form but it's played at the bar the seventh and then and i tend to leave the low e string open because it's part of the chord so [Music] a [Music] again do [Music] that last lick [Music] that's uh you're splitting from the sixth string to the third string on the fourth fret and then you play pretty simple they're double steps that's most of it so learn from there", "GPu_HVYVxmU": "what's up everybody this is your boy nick knacks here back again in the 4k we are here starting out week 5 and i got a lot to talk about tonight now a lot of you guys probably saw my last video I had a little bit of a nine-pound nightmare came in here about I think it was two nights after my my last garden update and I found some male pollen sacs on the first plane that I was really looking at all right you know I heard this might happen wasn't too worried started looking at the rest of the plants and then a I found six more now you guys know I had eight to start with I've already thrown one of them away because it was seriously bad in my opinion there was absolutely no working with it so we got seven more 9 powell hammers left in here that might sound crazy to some of you but I spent that whole night up here looking over each one of those plants and removing is on any male pollen sacs that I could possibly find and there hasn't been any sign of them since which is really scaring me you know it's really like waiting for the other shoe to drop at this point so we'll see what happens there the last video i posted I definitely got a couple shots of some of what was going on and i put in a bit of a funny video but at that point I really didn't know what to say about it since I've had time to really think and look back on it and get a bit of a better perspective now to address the issue I think there are really three ways to point the blame I think it's a bit of everybody's fault in that in that case you know I think that uh this is def let me start by saying I think the real blame lies with me in this particular situation in the case of pudding model garden in jeopardy no I decided to pop 18 seeds I decided to select eight of them and I decided to run eight of them in this garden you know where I should have known better I normally would have never done that you guys would watch them for a while you know that I'll pop a five pack i'll hit one see you off at one point and run that in blue maybe two if it's really promising maybe two but that's it you know I usually dedicate no more than a quarter of my garden to testing out new genetics in this situation I dedicated three-quarters of my garden to it which is just you know I'll never make that mistake again I know better than that and hopefully you guys can take that into account if you're thinking about doing the same thing now with any any company I should have been wary of doing something like that although you know I think basically I was gifted these seeds from a good friend of mine I you know I really appreciated having them and I want myself I was excited about it and you know that's kind of this is something that does come along with being a tester now i'm not a official t see a test or anything like that I think of myself as a decent gardener and you know I definitely have a dial broom here and i enjoy i like Tesla I like trying out new things and you know the idea of having something that everybody else wants of course is appealing you know especially when it's it's it's frosty truck like this stuff is and this is that this is the number six cutting it's just a beast you know I'm still impressed I have to say that you know back to the back to what's going on you know as I said and no big part of their lives with me right now also with the breeders you know with TTA in general I suppose as they they were the ones that ultimately released it put it on the website and actually put it out to the public you guys I didn't pay for my seeds so you know I don't consider myself a customer in this particular situation but I think you know the demand was so great for these seeds after seeing some people you know post pictures on the histogram and stuff like that that they were obviously rushed out I mean nine pound hammer came on the scene over the summer time people had seeds late fall you know going into winter time I needed to me that was just crazy I mean the seats were released before I even had a chance to pop mine which you know I procrastinated a little bit maybe a month or two on top of my seeds but I never expected them to be released them quickly on the market you know and I think that they're obviously a few standards of quality had to be bypassed to make that happen now you know and now I gotta say the third and final place that I can really point some blame that is us all of us you guys me everybody who was demanding nine pound hammer secrets you know I wasn't necessarily to be honest with you guys I wasn't saying man I need that nine pound I need that nine pound like I said it was gifted to me by a good friend of mine how do you guys probably know who but that's not what's important here what's important is that there was so much demand and we all need to learn to be patient all right wait when you see something coming around and you know sometimes it's good to sit back and watch what happens instead of rushing into it headstrong here's another really good cut of that nine pound here is number five if i'm not mistaken she's a pretty big girl very nice cold is in frost 102 but as I was saying you know we need to all learn a little bit of patience in this industry you know this is I think this is a very good example of what happens when you want it too bad it uh this obviously is something that hopefully they're working on you know I'm sure that they're going to stabilize this if they put it back out when it's time to release it again and I'm not trying to really knock them I mean it's like I said just kind of stuff that comes along with testing out new genetics I accept that you know I've decided to continue with this because you know worst comes to worst if things get bad I'll run all this stuff for oil and I'll I'll be fine however like I said it's a mistake I won't make again with any seed company all right I'm not trying to put TGA down here as you guys know I've been running TGA for a while and I do like them now let's talk about some other stuff all right that's all I really wanted to say about that and I'm gonna leave it at that all right I've got no no hard feelings or anything like that towards anyone I think it's just the lesson that everyone needs to learn from and that's that's about all there is to that alright let's talk about these right here now as I said we're starting week five so I wanted to utilize a feature that is I think unique to these ballots it's called sunlight feature I think it's just them to do it I don't know if there are other units out there a way but what they do is supposing I run my lights at 1000 watts ok in fact they're actually good at 1100 right now so let's say 11 heart wats when the lights come on they would start at 400 watts and slowly work their way up to 1100 over the first hour and then in the 12th hour or the last one they would work their way down from 11 hundred to four hundred watts before turning off again this feature does not work they are programmed to do it and they will try to do it but you will have bulb misfires I'm very disappointed in this that's definitely not good for your bulbs to be you know and when you have a misfire with this it tries it again it tries to do it again within the first couple minutes so you're going to keep firing bulbs and potentially do damage to them I don't know a whole lot about bulbs but I know that turning them on and off quickly like that it's not a good idea so I'm no longer utilizing that function and I've got to say you know anybody if you're looking at these ballots because you want to use that save your money you know the technology apparently is not there yet you know I've I've been trying to figure out what i can do to maybe a remedy the situation and it seems the only thing I can really do is just go back to using them add at one solid strength you know pick a wattage to stick with it run 12 12 keep it simple but you know if there's anything any changes with that I'll definitely let you guys know but I just did want to say that you know many of you guys that we're considering this for them particular to the technology it's not going to be worth it at this point I am happy with them overall they work really great as you know dimmable ballast it's just that as I said the technology is not there to enable them to do it themselves so now everything else is pretty good though guys you know hermaphrodite dual sex issues aside now again alright whether or not they're hermaphrodites dual sex I don't know that much about reading you guys whatever take that for what it's worth what everything is doing pretty well here as I said that if in no other signs of the issue and we've got good production going on in here I want to show you guys this it's been a little while but I've got the blue widow right here your look out of here running right next to this Esen speed which is just couldn't hurt a shame the reason i got them next to each other is because i want to see which one really is my biggest producer I like the smoke better on the blue widow but I've got to say it's looking like the hay suspension system beast and it always a very easy plant to grow I've said it several times before I wish all my plants would grow just like this ace of spade now my favorite smoke but man it really is a hell of a producer the plants very smart it builds itself perfectly almost I mean it really takes no effort to build a perfect plan I really like that about it and to be honest the other buds in plenty demand where I'm at so that's you know it's definitely a good thing I said a while back though I wish I would have built the the blue widow a little bit better because I think it could definitely hold its own with the ACE will have to wait for the next run to find out though here we got another good cutter that up at nine pound nice and frosty good fun development but stuff like that going on here really nice smell I've got to say they almost all smell the same which is which is strange and I've got to say I've never had that much uniformity with anything before as far as the way the plants bill and the way they smell it's really really uniform which is cool i meanit's that's definitely a plus you know and they really all smell just like some type of like honeydew melon or not quite cantaloupe but a melon you know I love cantaloupe so I've know if that's what it was but you know it's a it's really sweet very very nice smell I I definitely enjoy that i'm looking forward to smoking some of this oil man i can't tell you enough anyway it really isn't a whole lot more to discuss in here things are rolling along as they usually do it's not quite cruise control because I am coming in here every night and I'm looking for male pollen sacs that aside though like I said everything is doing real well so thank you guys for watching got any questions or comments go ahead and lean down to the bottom see you guys next time you", "0EP0wNR2dTk": "well it's nine pound hammer just a little too heavy for my size for my size don't how can i you know down in east kentucky a coal miner does sing a song called the nine

basic melody how do we spice it up a little bit how do we add some licks some kind of bluesy notes we're gonna do some drone strings so we're gonna show you kind of how to take the bare-bones melody and then spice it up a little bit in kind of a bluegrass style so super cool stuff here I'm gonna break down both solos note for note and then show you a bunch of backup stuff you can do on this song alright here's nine pound hammer in the key of a alright so here's the first three measures to the beginner break two nine pound hammer remember we're in the key of a let me play the first three measures and then I'll break it down one more time [Music] okay so we're gonna start with measure one we're gonna start with the pickup we're gonna start with our first finger our index finger of our left hand on the second fret of the D string and we're gonna play that note on beat two so we're gonna do a Down stroke with our right hand and then we're gonna play that note again also with the down stroke and then we're going to put our second finger of our left hand up to the fourth fret of the D string so it's gonna sound like this cow beat one one [Music] and that's just the words this and then we're gonna get up to the open a string for the beginning of measure two so what again like I said I'd recommend counting b11 don't do those pick up notes too fast those are just quarter notes so keep your keep your first finger down as well okay so now for measure 2 are getting up to the open a string and then we're gonna do kind of a fiddle shuffle with our right hand so we're gonna do down and then a down up and then a down that's a very common kind of shuffle pattern we're going down down up down so follow the pick directions closely below the the tab the staples our downs the V's are up so down down down and the counting of that is one two and three four and so okay let's put one and two together so one okay now for measure three we're gonna hit the open a string one more time and then we're gonna flip the fourth fret on the a string with our second finger of our left hand we're gonna play that note down up down and then down to the second fret with our first finger so measure three sounds like this follow the pink directions closely there so it's one two and three four one more time so let's put those all three of them together one okay now for measure four we're gonna go into a D chord so we're gonna play the open a string and then down to the fourth fret of the D string we're gonna play down up down up down up there so keep your right hand moving there and then for measure five we're gonna hit that note one more time and then go back to the open a string so down up down there and then back to that fourth fret so you can keep that fourth fret down through measure four into measure five so let's play four and five together so it's a few times it's good practice for using the down ups to help you keep the time and start feeling how long one measure is so one more time not measure six we're going down to the second fret of the D string with our first finger of our left hand I'm gonna play it down and then down up down up down up through the rest of the measure so that's one to use that down at the beginning to help you play that first quarter note and then measure seven stay on that note we're gonna do that shuffle pattern again down and up to the fourth fret and then open a string that's measure eight so that's measure seven and eight so let's play six and seven so it's that's in to measure a one more time [Music] the other thing I like to do in measure seven is I go I'm actually cutting off the pressure a little bit with my left hand so I'm keeping it down and measures six so I'm letting that pressure stay down on that note and then I'm going I'm kind of cutting the pressure off to let those notes be Shorter's into measure seven going into measure eight very similar to our pick up actually and then measure eights back to that same as measured to that shuffle pattern on an open a string okay let's play the first eight measures one [Music] let's into measure nine so this is going to go into the chorus you", "ij2sX4H2jLw": "wait for my side my side we have known up the mountain gonna see my baby and I ain't coming back well in this time that was nine pound hammer we're gonna be out of standard tuning an e position and I'm gonna use this song to address a number of emails that I've gotten lately requesting level one foundational elemental lessons to help with finger picking people are struggling with pinching going into an alternating finger pattern and kind of good doing the back-and-forth gaining the independence between the thumb and the fingers and also going into a strum and then back into finger picking so rather than just giving a bunch of exercises I figured I'd go and grab a couple of songs that I can focus on those direct issues so with nine pound hammer I'm gonna work through pinching and then alternating your fingers then with make me a pallet on your floor I'm going to address the finger picking into a strum and then back into finger picking and with these two songs I think we're gonna be able to cover a lot of ground and hopefully address all of those questions I'm gonna just go over the bass parts first six for alternating bass when were in our e54 when we're in er a seven five four also when were in our B seven and then six four back in our e so that is the alternating bass patterns for this song and now looking at the right hand I would say the number one question I get asked is about anchoring that pinkie now I'm moving along we're gonna pinch the melody so we've got our e46 four and we're gonna go okay so that's just open second second string second fret open first and if you want to use your first finger for this pinching or your second finger it's up to you it doesn't really matter we want to go from that pinch to an alternating finger picking pattern and what we're gonna do for that the basic idea here is our thumb is the quarter notes one two three four now we're going to put a melody note as the ands so we're gonna go one three again this is a basic exercise for any court who know", "INQUkR-cJlc": "you know I always think that that what made me think of San Antonio business you have there been Union pickets we did picked up didn't we only y'all picked him like that he's laid a finger on he played the play yeah all just even moving on oh my god when I first got the medium that was time I really got acquainted with him easy we talked about well on stage

but you may not have noticed it but we're gonna go over some of the things in this song this lick these licks here that you can use in your picking that's pretty easy I was locking I've always heard this and sliding to the Unison note in other words you're sliding you're hitting in the aji and you're sliding to it I'm sliding from the second fret to the fifth fret on the d-string you've heard that like I said I think I mentioned another video in Salt Creek it just adds a nice little bit of I think what Steve Hoffman calls gusto and and that's as if you're in the f position of the G chord shape rather second fret fourth fret D string back up on the third fret of the B string and slide it back now an open G and then I did a little fancy so let's pull off first dinner hey we're on and then we're gonna do a little Tony rice pull off here I think he said he learned that from Clarence were uh wide it's gonna be first fret D string pull it off to the third fret of the g string you need time you wanting to get to a chord like say we're in G it's the same deal except it's gonna be the next string up from the root note the root note is here on the E string the next string up is a it's the a string so that is the string we're going to use to do the first position pull up see the next string up is the D string so that's we're going to use that same thing and then in okay and the cool thing is you use the same things for their relative monitors like for example G shape geek or dethrill the monitors Eamon you the venue in you would add the root note thing with a minor 4c and for an AF the relative minor is d-money so the last notes gonna be open string that's the root note just a quick tidbit there for you but anyway back to this pickings kind of tough on that cuz I like to do it a certain way and I think I switch it up a lot I'm always trying to get the last note to be a downstroke but it seems to always end up being an upstroke needs to be up down but always end up going down up and for it to be an upstroke you have to come up on a string but typically I tend to go down on the two down strokes it means that me enough drug but it's just you know just how you train yourself to do it I guess and then so a lot of times Tony rice just does this there's kind of that fitpaws and that little extra previous note coming gives it a better feel for the time so far we've got okay and then all we're doing is we're kind of just that's the end of that first phrase you add a G leak of some kind to get yourself started over the next section in the next section starts off with the kind of like that same sam'l thing but we don't do the full thing it's just C and you just kind of hanging out here trying to wait to the seat comes in because that's where the really CAPA and that's what we're gonna have that lick that we had the last time on the last last video okay if you go back to that last one we're talking about the C the G run late for the see that's where that's going to come in so second section so I'm just kind of hanging out typically what I do is I'm waiting to get to the real lick by doing something to just pass the time before that so that's what this is and the same thing when I get here the second sacred sauce if I'm getting time so I got the time to get on that I'm going a little bit behind and that lick is we're going to slide from the third fret on the a-string to the fifth fret toward that D is we're gonna use that open D as a pedal tone this will be down up every time so with five three or five four three on the a string slide up and then we're going to go to the first fret and slide up to the second fret of the second string 9 pound hammer guys I was holding my breath the entire time so I could get that last thing in time and it worked so just as a reminder what I'm using is the dunlop tortex peaks of 1.1 4 millimeter I really really love the sound of the D'Andrea Pro Plex better but there is to me a significant size difference for one thing the now this one's black typically they come in purple for this this millimeter gauge but I like the black better so I wore them in black color but this one is wider for one thing so it fits on my thumb a lot easier and it's longer and so I can get in those notes a lot better with this one I kind of have to kind of have to crimp up and get in there real fast and everything but that was with the dunlop tortex this one is a little mellower a little more woody sounding and I like the the people I like a little bit the pic sound in it but I just love the sound of a Deandra Pro flaky I haven't found a pic with a better sound and if you look on my pics video way back when you'll see all the ones I'll use and I experimenting for like a year or so trying to find the perfect pick and for me sound wise it's the d'andrea but feeling wise it's the the pro play I mean the Dunlop so how it sounds with the the Andrea it's like this so having figured out really to have to link this park trying to get it all together it's the kind of tricky you kind of just got to work in until you find that the best pattern but the strings I'm using our Martin lifespan I'm using medium gauge they're really good they have a clear tone coating they sound really good I'm actually about to have to change these because I've used them in several different shows and it's it's time to change them already so but just a little idea on what that is and this is the Martin DCX 180 in case you haven't noticed by the other videos I did I did a samuel review video and i just a regular review video on this guitar and i love it it's got an amazing sound amazing tone at over a year just keeps sounding better and better it's a cheaper version it's not a high-dollar one so you're not gonna get the complete volume but it does have does have that boon which i love about it and it's a perfect guitar for me until i can someday get rich in the for the big dog high dollar ones but i'm rambling on so thank you guys for watching and I've got another video I'm gonna do today then I'm gonna call it quits for the day and but I've got a bunch of these two posts so appreciate

let's go ahead and walk through the nine pound hammer here um P and G of course and you know a lot of people do this in different keys so if you want to take your capo and put it on the 2nd 3rd 4th fret whatever you feel is necessary you can still work out a G position and do all the same licks but I just did it for the key of G for now so whatever works best for your vocal so it starts on beat 2 and I'm gonna go ahead and play through the first two and a half measures there and then I'll break them down slowly but so this is what this the first few sound like 1 2 3 4 1 again two three four one okay so have a pick up there on the D string pull off to zero on the D okay I'm not going to get into like pull-offs and hammer-ons into detail about them or how to do them for this arrangement it's kind of advanced so have some of that stuff in my beginner arrangements in lessons but yeah two and three and four and that's that first little bit all down all in that D string open g fifth fret g string it's the it's the same no they're both g sounding notes and so it kind of creates like a little drone effect and you can slide up to it but that's throwing you off a little bit you can just go right - it stood for about the third fret or even the fourth fret of word so that measure on the G is so my first fingers on the 3rd fret of the B there and then G is open and then third finger on the fifth fret of the D so two quarter notes and then some eighth notes one two three and - ready go 1 2 3 you you then that last measure just some quarter notes we have some double stops my double stop is just two notes played at once if you're wondering but open G and I'm going to be right here third fret of the B fourth fret of the G and you kind of want to use 1 & 2 4 for your fingering too so and so as you see there you have a have a slur that's that line above it that's slur and then it has some slides right and so that's indicating that I'm going to pick and slide down and not going to pick them notes on one and two not going to kick themselves the chena be open so as I gets up to speed it sounds really slick and just kind of nice and smooth as I'm playing you could pick it if you wanted of course it totally works it totally works I just went with via the slides this time so okay that's that those two measures right there so yeah this little double stop if you're not familiar with that I would get familiar because it's really popular in the grass and goose guitar in general just a good move to no kind of position so those two half measures and then we'll move forward here so one two three four one go faster one two you for you okay cool so let's move on to the next three measures and now we're going to come up on the C chord here and I'll play them and then we'll break them down again so you okay again two three four you all right so as I get in that seeker module go across picking over the C chord and if you've seen some of my videos as far I like to do this little this little sequence over the C chord this little cross picking thing so 0 2 on the D hammer that's all on the B the G and the D string now it can be tricky to get going up to speed but so it takes really a lot of practice in the right hand very precise picking slow backwards roll you sit around just do that for exercise perhaps so I'll carry on here but okay so the next scene Maggie I got a quarter note first fret of the B then two three hammer on the G back to the 2 to 0 on the D pole it's a little bluesy lick they're pretty common little move this little move right here that's the blues note right there the b-flat it's the exact measure so those two measures three and four robot again three and four two three four", "LJpt7CDk8lY": "[Music] hello I'm Pete Martin thanks for watching if you're interested in other videos of mandolin fiddle improvisation and many other musical subjects click the subscribe banner below and if you want to be notified when I post new videos click the bell icon right next to it the purpose of this video series is to teach improvising to people who've never done it before I'd suggest that you go back and start at video number one of this series and progress through there there's a PDF file that goes along with us so email me and request improv from scratch number three nine pound hammer in video 2 we learnt how to outline major and dominant chords and then we played those outlines against a chord progression it's real important that you feel comfortable doing this and that you understand that the reason for doing this is to help you understand or is to help you hear the chord progression and understand the sounds of that chord progression because you'll use those sounds that you're hearing to help you make decisions and improvising down the line so it's a very important to feel comfortable with doing those outlines so if you don't feel comfortable go back and review video number two first ninth pound hammer is a very common traditional American folk song that especially bluegrass players play a lot will use it and learn the chord outlines for it in the key of G it's up to you to learn them and other keys but I would definitely do this with nine pound hammer first thing we need to do is take a look at the chord progression and we see it here you in example one we see the chord outlines go ahead and learn this now [Music] whenever we go from G to C we can use a g7 chord we did that in the previous video we can do that in nine pound hammer and you see this progression with the g7 here you in example 2 we see the scale outlines for this progression a new thing with the dominant 7 chord is we can use it if you want a bluesier sound so over the C chord we're gonna place c7 here and we see that now you we hear this in the scale outlines in example three [Music] [Music] [Music] make sure that you move nine pound hammer to some different keys and try it in those different keys and then I would suggest taking some major key songs that you know and learn these scale outlines without as well when you're comfortable with that then move on to the next video I'm Pete Martin thanks for watching [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "_I1QmHYvlEo": "we are going to hear another of the very fine folks who appeared with us in our talent scout show for Toni products last night here's a great

quick one on adding in some double stock into those shapes that I was just talking about when you're playing in any key so I'm going to be working out of b-flat and we're going to take the song from something like this so I'm not going to be doing tabs for this one because I've done that in another lesson I believe it's the man of constant sorrow lesson I believe I do I talked about some double stuff and actually give you the tabs in standard notation but in this one I'm really just going to be going quickly going over a lot of that same information but applying it to nine pound hammer again this the rate the regular tabs not the not the double stop tabs and the lyrics and the chord structure are over Amanda lessons calm so check those out and then listen in here for kind of how I'm adding in those double stops so I've still got the regular melody b-flat I'm working out a b-flat from the previous lesson and what I'm going to be doing is I'm really just adding I'm keeping mostly by keeping fingers down I'm going to be adding in some double stop so I'm down hammer melody is the first fret hammer I'm going to keep that ring back sorry middle finger on the third fret when double stop is three in one and then my double stop is five in one for heavy with that shuffle so I don't think I actually do a double stop there you've got a couple options you can use the string below fifth fret on the g string third fret D string and at the end of that song when the melody ends first fret the double stop is the third fret below so far we've got five and three [Music] so then we've got and that double stop I'm using there's five and one on the five on the a string one on the E string [Music] then we're back to the one on the a string which ways there's a third fret on the D string the little end ending phrase and then it's another double stop three and one so I'll go through the whole thing without singing and just listen in look at my left hand and then know that all of this can be transferred up and down and across the fretboard so one [Music] and the only other thing I'm doing in there that I haven't talked about is throwing in some hammer ons I love that hammer on so so it's a little bit it's a little - I'm going from 3 in 1 to 5 and 1 3 and 1 to 5 in 1 let's just try that that's the only kind of the hammer on I'm using 99% of the time that's 3 and 1 then you're hammering on with your ring finger to the 5th fret on the d-string [Music] it also works on the 80 strings [Music] so again no tabs for this section but if you want to get a better idea of this check out the the double stops part of the mana cost of Sorrows lesson it's more of the same information and really just trying to get your fingers used to these patterns so that you can start adding in double stops in any key to any song again I hope this was helpful and check out mando lessons com for more lessons and hope to see you again soon thanks bye bye", "JF3OyTBoZSM": "[Music] [Music]

it's getting tuned we're in G tuning I tuned a standard 440 pitch Oh I ah Oh you Wow now to the solo all and slower Oh even slower Oh Oh Oh now the beginning of that song is taken in a banjo away from Tony Rice's break on the song with the bluegrass all-star team of Mark O'Connor and Sam Bush and bela Fleck on their respective instruments the video I believe on YouTube mark O'Connor kicks the song over this shuffle so there's kind of you you ah yes I got to do what I had to banned Marco Kyra starts with that buffeted um bump um sort of rhythm I mean you can do it that way but you don't want to do it back at the bridge where you normally play your bluegrass sounds a little sharp especially doing singles one thing if you do things like Jim Mills you know yeah it's all concentrated up kick but when you're doing that rapid back-and-forth picking I move away from the bridge here's a little trip in there Oh all of them all Oh but back to the break that we are learning here we have this a little modified with a pinch scrub girls breakdown but so we have this kickoff go back to the third string there that root note see on the second string Oh first-base sharp there there we go and so you can basically imitating as much of the melody note as you can it's it's less fancy less of that and more concentration on the melody and simpler plane and that's our first sentence musical sentence really Oh but I'm going to do they up second part the second part begins with this yeah it's kind of imitating well hang on buddy cut up out of that you know it stood very close to the way to

has a small letter H beside it this indicates a hammer on the hammer on is produced by striking the string sharply with the left hand finger as it is dropped in position to play the note in diagram

this lesson first I'm going to teach you all the chord progression then I want to show you all a good strumming pattern that you can use when you're singing this whole song and then after that I'm going to give you all a few different options for the instrumental breaks we're going to cover a beginner instrumental break then we're going to go over an intermediate instrumental break that's gonna have a really nice melody to it and finally I'm going to teach y'all two different advanced solo breaks and both of the advanced breaks they're gonna have some awesome bluegrass flatpicking licks in them in the style of Tony rice so a really cool lesson today let's take a quick look at a few different examples of what we're going to be covered today [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "oGjZATwZdSs": "hi there welcome to another one of my videos and thank you for taking your time to watch it I also want to thank the new YouTube subscribers and the new Twitter followers welcome to the family let's get right to it today we're going to check out the indica strain 9 pound hammer from true leave and Tallahassee I paid 53 dollars for this eighth and this harvest came in at 17.2% THC this eighth had very nice size and dense buds which were green with an abundance of ice on them the smell is of sweet and spicy pine a unique hard to describe scent and the flavor itself is too unique to this try and describe too many different hints of flavors together but not a bad flavor at all now on to the effects the effects start with a river of inner joy that had me dancing while the hammer was swinging backwards picking up speed that leads to a way will calm and serenity that swept away all my stress and anxiety I had which I imagine is when the nine pound hammer was swinging back towards my head then boom the knight pound hammer gets me upside the head and took my pain away full body and muscles are completely relaxed eyebrows low like each of them weighs 9 pounds each the 9 pound hammer did what it was born to do and make me tired and sleepy that sleep was hard to fight so I went to sleep and slept like a baby for the whole night can I work on the strain only am i Colossus and in this strange case I limit myself to one or two hits of my bowl every couple of hours during the work day in reality in because that are this strong are not meant to be used during work hours I reckon with this strain for after work through the end of the night youth I hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "Gp2E7Wea1nY": "hey we're back dr.

[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] do you", "YF53tdDHxfE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up guys Brandon Johnson here again and thanks for joining me today I'm joined by one of my good friends credible musician and one of my bandmates kind country Mike heading from Mike heading music calm good to be here it's great to have you here we're gonna be covering some some basic concepts that we've kind of acquired over our many years of playing this bluegrass style of music where we were chatting that band practice right and I know I had some questions about how to transition from back up to your solo and how to get successfully out of your solo into back up and Brandon said hey I've actually had a couple of those scheme questions so I thought it'd be perfect you know you can't really demonstrate leaning back up by yourself right so you need you need another music musical partner to help so that's where we're gonna work on this one together yeah we're gonna cover that and we're gonna cover nine pound hammer we're gonna kind of use that as an example so hopefully this helps you out and I hope you enjoy this one let's check it out yeah the two of you chose to illustrate this topic is the classic bluegrass song nine pound hammer and this is a really good one because it uses the three standard chords the one four and five in whatever key you're playing in and it has basically an eighth measure phrase that gets repeated over and over again so it gives you a lot of chances to get into your solo and get out of your solo and get back into backup and get into your solo this is a really good one it's a jam standard you're definitely going to come across this tune if you've been going to some jam sessions generally nine pound hammer is I think it's played usually in to keep a although I've heard yeah energy yeah probably here in the G position I mean on guitar you know actually same with banjo yeah we both got our cheaters on that cable too ya know so nine pound hammer is a one four five chord progression generally your chords are a D and E if your cable - that's gonna be a G shade a c-shape and a d show so it's really important to know not only the capo cords but it's also I always tell my students it's really important to know the real cords yeah because if you yell G to a bass player or fiddle player you know that's not going to help them at all so I always say it's the responsibility of the person with the capo to know the real chords yeah so the real cords are get our a D are ke pakore SAR G C and D we're probably gonna call the capo chords right when we when we call the song so it's just played through a really slowly okay so here we go one two ready go [Music] so what we really want to focus on is it's good practice to play through the whole song but there's two measures of G at the end of the solo before it starts over and that's really you know we want to give you an overview of the whole song but let's really zoom in and focus on that one part of the song because that's where your pick up to your solo would be but that's also where you would transition into your backups so it's basically the same two measures of G and it's really important to know what we're working with and how much time we have because then you can make your intro longer or shorter you know we know the bounds of what we're working in and then we can hopefully be creative within that so remember we're talking about the two measures of G at the end of the solo before it starts over that's where you're going to do your pick up to your solo and that's where you're going to transition back into your backup two three four two two three four [Music] basically I just played kind of a little chromatic run they're starting on the a string second fret and I'm ending on the root note the open g string and this in this case but we're in key day but and that's a little diets Doc Watson action there yeah that's where your solo actually starts and that's your fresh no D or solo that open yard Street and that makes it easy to start your solo that way because you're just dealing with open string so your left hand is free to kind of go wherever it wants to go you're not actually holding in that so that's why that's cool you're also getting out of that G chord a little early it looks like two you're kind of getting ready to get to your solo if you're not you're not trapping yourself down in that core and that's that can be valuable to is get ready you know and get your hand in position to get to get to your solo yes yep and so that that's just kind of a one-bar transition that you could use coming out of rhythm going into your solo one two three four two two three four [Music] so the the second run I did was again another kind of Doc Watson influenced run but we're starting on the low e-string this time and this is a two to measure run so this is a little bit longer and like you're saying you can kind of you know back up that that pick up a little bit and extend it a little more so that that's the typical you know G run that's kind of a variation of that and then what I do is I go to the g string second fret and I slide up use that open B and then again we're landing on that open G which is you know I like that I like using that open string to start your solos because your left hand doesn't have to do anything right away so you can kind of think about where do I want to go after this and these are these are pickups yeah quote-unquote pickups so you're kind of playing these runs going into a section where you're just gonna maybe improvise so our third strings are starting of our solo right so so one thing I used to kind of jumpstart my own creativity is okay there's two ways to get to our note right we can go up to our note or we could go down to our notes that's kind of what you kind of combine those two because you went you went past the target note down yes that's another kind of interesting concept you can explore just think very generally okay my going up to my target notes so maybe you start on your low string and you run up or maybe you start on a high string you know you walk down to your note so you can basically work those intros kind of in two different directions that's how I think of it so you can basically go up to your target note or go down to your target yeah that's that's an easy way to basically jumpstart a little bit of creativity if you don't know where to start I've absolutely one two three four two two three four [Music] so the third the third transition run that I did here again we're utilizing the open strings and like you said the target note yeah and in this case the target note is the roof note you know and that's kind of the easy yep that's very don't blame yeah very cop go to the root and I think it helps you other musicians to just get everybody on the same page but you know again with this this third transition run we're sliding up here from the second fret to the fifth fret d kind of using that that string underneath it so I'm going down down and you're kind of letting that that fifth fret d-ring a little longer that's classic so where does that come from yeah you have no idea that's a fiddle that's a fiddle bowing technique okay it's a little shuffle bow so I think they call the Georgia shuffle or the yeah Nashville shuffle one of those I forget but basically it's it's the guitar or the banjo equivalent of doing that bow that bowing technique so it's a very down it's a long short short long down down up down down up that's sometimes they call that potatoes and that's a great way to start the song basically you get that's that's also a very good way if the song hasn't started yet yeah to basically set the tempo so you would you would slide in that that's just basically again it's kinda you get the bluegrass equivalent of the drummer clicking their sticks to start the song or you could do you could do it down here yeah exactly yeah but I think it's more important is the rhythm that you're doing is that is that it's called a shuffle rhythm so it's very important and I think that really helps set the tempo yeah it kind of just gets everyone in the feeling of that of the tempo of the song I think so yeah and so you'll do that that kind of that shuffle really I'm talking about and then you can go to the open D and angle that your target note that open G which is you know the root note of the of the eight and that's kind of part of the G run as well a great way to start dealing the timing of the song if you kind of need to get yourself into the into the rhythm of the song that's a kind of a good one it's just okay this is the rhythm that were feeling and then I don't know really helps me anyways [Music] um you know I'm kind of using some signature Tony rice moves there Clarence white moves really because Tony rice got a lot of his allegiance white so I'm using that second fret bead of first fret B as a pull yeah that's the I think I call that the Blue Note right no right all right and you can you can bend that basic what I'm doing there is is um doing a pull off and then with my ring finger landing on the g string third fret and then again another hassle Tony rice uses a lot of half-steps I mean a lot players do but and then from there you're sliding from your third fret G to your fourth fret G so you know that's that's one way that you can kind of you know transition out of your solo if you're if you're in the higher register if you find yourself soloing in G and you're up in the higher strings here you can kind of start to access some of those half steps and maybe throw a little Tony rice run in there and again these are we're kind of you know covering some of the same concepts here like the open G bringing out that's that's a real nice go to when you're soloing kind of in a bluegrass style is that open G [Music] and then from there you can just throw in the standard jiron or something like that and again these are these are the same notes so you're landing on the root note of the key of the chord that of the court or the key that you're playing in [Music] it's also important what fingers you're using to that because you're basically keeping these two kind of hovering over that G yes that yogi chord and you're basically kind of ready to go into the that G chord you basically so I think if you use the wrong thinkers for that lick it can kind of trap you in a bad position that stores if you use the right fingers then you're kind of always they won't work on banjo but you're kind of always hovering over that shape exactly to where you can kind of fall back into that even if you missed the licked a little bit basically yeah use that as your safety net to get back into the core right right and sort of like you said hovering almost like you're you're soloing out of the chord shapes mentally but also literally yeah even if you're not playing them your hand is almost in a G shape right there yeah I always watch your your two fingers basically just kind of yeah hang out there ready to go back now it's ready to go yeah and also you're reminding yourself of what yard you're on so [Music] so this the second transition run here is actually one that you showed me actually but it requires kind of an interesting syncopation so it's it's basically the standard g-ronn like that but where that G is ringing out right there what you can do is you can play the G run then quickly while that G is ringing out you can play that first fret low E which would be like an F yeah additional added seventh note which really loozy yeah really blues not attention that sound of the G and then ringing together it creates that tension and then you get back into your rhythm and it's that tension this is a pretty bluesy song yeah I wouldn't do this on every song right so it's a one-time thing yeah and a bluesy song like this or a man of constant sorrow or something like that a lick like that could work really cool yeah so thanks to you for that one and I have yet to integrate that into an actual solo but I'm going to real soon because I'm getting better at it now so another thing too is when you're coming out of a solo and you know I've seen Tony do this and other other Pickers do this too but when you come out of your solo maybe you can kind of emphasize that first chord when you're going into rhythm yeah with with a smash I call it that yeah that's G smash you know we have all kinds of different terminology for this stuff but but you kind of just that confident downbeat yeah where you're sending your solo home you're you're sending it home but but then you know you might smash that G but then you kind of dial it back a little bit for the next picture yeah but you can kind of send it home with that you know and that's kind of what we were talking about with this you can kind of do do that for your when you go right back into rhythm and yeah I think it's it's also it just it show it illustrates to the rest of the band or the jam session where you think you are yeah in the song so even if you're not right or if you write it wrong at least everyone's knows like hey this is where I think I am and then it's easy to everyone do it just to you you", "oO1R5dl1C9U": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "zLBFWo47t1I": "okay nine pound hammer and a loosely based on the David Griezmann version on home is where the heart is I'm gonna group I'll play it through it a moderate tempo and then I'll slow it down and talk about some of the right hand technique that I'm using let's try a let's slow down I'll just take a minute to tell you what my right hand is doing here is it's almost a shuffle beat it's down up down up down up down it down okay that's what's driving that song is it okay and you'll hear me do that and also throw in an alternate note okay any time any time I have the time to do it you know where there's a note hanging a little bit like I throw in an alternate note so that's a good thing to practice they're just that let's go through you noticed I'll I do that alternate note you notice I also went up into a high register with double stops still keeping that shuffle beat so the rhythm too tentative there's an alternate note there a double stop you can alternate note that alternate note comes on an upstroke it's an upstroke if I were to slow that down it's almost as I look like almost what a fiddle would do so that's that's it that's Lesson four

I did for the nine pound hammer break so today I'm going to show you another 9 pound hammer break the other one was a lick that I came up with myself this one is adapted from a Tony rice version of it not exactly like Tony's but pretty closely follows it anyway I want to play through the break the whole thing through the first half of it I'm gonna do the break I showed you last time then the second half I'll do the break I'm gonna show you today [Music] that's pretty cool what's classic signature Tony Lake coming in on the [Music] sometimes I do that I like to try to hit the pinched harmonic and that sounds pretty pretty nasty but anyway starts on the eighth fret I just you can start it and Bend up or you can start Hardy bent I think that's what Tony does and then sixth and then seventh on your g-string [Music] that's eight six seven six five on the g string open [Music] so and then open a hammer on a third [Music] back open so back and open on the D string and then the g string open so disbar those three in the eighth shape 5th fret 3 2 4 5 2 3 on your D string [Music] so after the five three it's five four three one two [Music] [Applause] and that you can probably figure out

pliable and kind of leathery and when you burn them they burn all the way down to this white hash Pacific Northwest growers tends to cure their pot really well and that the smell definitely points us

now we're to start walking through the beginning arrangement here 9-pound am will bring the camera on in and yeah let's get to it thanks for watching I hope you enjoy all right so let's go ahead and start breaking down the first arrangement for nine pound hammer in this bluegrass study piece and of course is the most basic and it kind of sits in the Carter style somewhat a little you know has elements of that make note of the pick directions that are below the staff very important to make sure you in the right pick direction in any little numbers above the staff will be left hand fingering there's not too many in this first arrangement so let's I'm gonna play those first three measures then break them all down for you so got a little pick up it starts on beat two and it's three four one [Music] then again - ready go one [Music] you [Music] all right so again we had to pick up on beat two that's the first marking in this and the piece there that first little squiggly line that's a quarter note rest and then we have two eighth notes on the D string down up and then we have a quarter note on the D string then second fret on the D string it's everything on the d right there [Music] and two if you're a beginner and kind of work on some flat picking pick directions stuff is very important so down picks on down beats 1 2 3 4 up picks on up beats that's the and so 1 & 2 and those are the up so downs on down beats ups on up beats okay that's the rule general rule of thumb chorus rule is meant to be broken but for now for beginners it's the first little bit there and in the next measure to open G's and I'm going to strum out the rest of my chord now I'm going to play kind of this full G I call it I talked about this in the rhythm lesson lot playing this style of G I don't use them not using my first finger but third fret low E nothing on the a string D mu T in the a string G and the third fret B third fret E and I call it a full G sometimes as a slang term g5 be a proper term but that's we're gonna use the strum for most of this arrangement [Music] and notice I have the bottom three strings for strumming or the highest sounding three strings I should say I'm not strumming against the whole chord so two and three one two three that's the correct count there in the next measure I got that open G again and a series of eighth notes you're all on the g string 3rd fret open 3rd fret twice 2nd fret and so that note right there might sound kind of weird played all by itself kind of out of context but it's a b-flat and that's the flatted three so this piece is kind of a bluesy number right the nine pound hammer and that's where that kind of the melody lies you might run across it a few different ways but this is the way I know it [Music] and yeah that's the flat of three he gives it a little bluesy sound and that's why we want so that measure down down up down up down I guess the note on the second fret is a quarter note as well so make sure you pay close attention to that sometimes we have a series of eighth notes a quarter note can get lost in the mix [Music] so all three of those measures put together two three four-one [Music] and you might ask yourself why are you fingering the whole G chord when you only stem in those high three strings well I'm just doing it for several reasons its natural to have it and you know if I accidentally hit other strings in the chord you know I'll be alright so to speak so and there's overtone purposes so a lot of different reasons to do it [Music] little cleaner this time [Music] all right so those are the first three measures there so let's move forward here the next four sound like this [Music] there again [Music] so measure four we go to the C core but we're gonna pluck that open G first finger my seat pluck an open G note and then the 2nd fret D you're already there and then we strum kind of the same rhythm as before on measure 2 [Music] down down and the next measure plucked low string third fret quarter-note there and here's our melody again open G third fret G OPG second fret ready go up down and then I go back to a G chord but plucking an open D for D 2nd fret D [Music] okay then the next measure goes to a D chord and the melody stays on the D strum the deed a couple eighth notes on the D 2nd fret D it's a quarter note there so that measure by itself [Music] okay so those put those four measures together - ready go [Music] you can finish that phrase by playing the open G there is the first beat and measure 8 and what's not on the screen but if you ever have [Music] one more time a little quicker 1 2 3 4 [Music] and if you want on that C chord in measure five you can catch that third fret G no that's a b-flat with the pinky or third finger really you can reach your third finger on down there and lift off of where you were or you can catch it with the pinky okay either way slowly work [Music] alright then the next doors [Music]", "tuJIyG9bsT8": "[Music] how can i

nodded up a little early that came out pretty nice I'm not bitching we'll get her hung and dried and cured and we'll smoke the port here in a couple weeks she did pretty good she was in a five gallon but she could have been thrown out a little bit bigger to get a little more yield but not bad like I said I think it locked up a little early but no biggie quality looks good they do", "dWJ0zqV9oTM": "in the second video for nine pound hammer will be detailing the fretting hand and it pertains to the simple banjo break that I talked in video one with the picking end first is getting tuned G tuning a 440 standard pitch fourth string third string I the 5th string a nordstrom tune be ah now the break and slower Oh Oh Oh now what I'm doing there is just primarily the middle fingers obviously I've been influenced by Jim nails too instead of relying on that middle to index push off or pull off I find it just a little bit more fat to do it with these two fingers Oh and because I have a smaller hand it's mark my third finger falls right at that position it also leaves this middle finger free to do all things like this so it's quite handy I mean you can do it any way you want I'll play it with my middle finger deliberately to show you what it looks like Oh yeah like that so you can do it either way you want but you know you're sliding on the fourth string there now obviously I'm not getting the full C chord there when you get out of that slide notice I'm only hitting the open as a 9th chord the D note is the ninth tone in the C scale button but back to that thing that notice the kickoff to the song is a modified version of Earl's breakdown kickoff Oh in fact what I did was I just basically took the hammer on away and added a pinch Oh oh so you're just basically taking away that hammer on on the first on the fourth string Oh Oh that's into the second part of the a section that little transition lick actually comes from the actual notes sung by Tony rice on that youtube video with Jerry Douglas and mark o'connor and there's actually two ways you can play that lick I did it two ways on the first video with the threading at the picking an scuze me that's the first way Oh the second way it would be like this you're the only thing different is you have 0 instead of going straight into the slide you have a little hello pause on the eno so first thing show a different and in the second time but that's about that if you need to see anything else you can run the video back and see implants Laura play one time slower through is to give you a chance do you learn it and if you have any questions just leave some comments and I'll get back to them as best I can thanks for watching Oh Oh I", "PR9uYQblXQg": "[Music] i'm going on the mountain just to see my baby but ain't

"what's up everybody this is your boy knickknacks here want to stop in and give you guys a look at how things are going is we start week six here and the fourth that's really nice but going on in here things are looking very very good we've got seven nine pound hammer Zin here along with the blue widow she's doing real well there's a really good wait for me and I would really like that nice blueberry flavor it's got I've also got an ace of spades in here lots of coal was for her she's filled out really nicely there's some real monsters on that and we've got a Doctor Who also dealing a real well this run and like I said we've got eight nine nine four seven nine pound hammers in here now a couple weeks ago I had a little bit of a male pollen sack issue and like I said man I've been in here really looking them over every night and I haven't had even the slightest sign of it since which is really great I mean I didn't like I said we're starting week six now it's been a good two weeks since I've seen anything you know I keep thinking it's just going to be a matter of these until I do see something else but we're getting to that point where I really don't think it can really hurt me too much right now we're looking at that number seven so as I said before guys we're gonna go ahead and finish this run see how everything goes you know I've been thinking a lot about this issue you know about how everything happened although it is very you know kind of alarming that all of them seem to do it the fact that you know they really haven't done anything since is really great you know and you know I know I've heard in the past that seedlings do have the ability that just you know [ __ ] around and change sex on you and I mean that among other reasons are why I usually don't run seedlings in flower I usually like to you know venture plan out clone it get some cuts and then run this right here is the number two by the way right now I'm really thinking about keeping the number two and the number seven the part of me really wants to give them a run as clones and see if I still have the same issue because I don't think I will it's all super frosty I've got to say the the nine pound hammer I'm still like I said before you know I'm still very impressed with her here's that plant the number six that was giving me some of the kuan-yin and such she might turn out to be one of the pros to us out of all of them it was trichomes just lining up everywhere on here leaves are just completely covered it's a it's nice it's nice and in every single cut smells like cantaloupe there's some type of melon you know it's it's it's a it's really sweet fruity delicious smell I really can't wait to see what the with the smoke and what the oil is like I think this stuff's going to be [ __ ] amazing I'm glad I'm really glad I decided to go ahead and keep it and finish it off you know I I really don't think things are as bad as I thought they were as I said there's been no sign of any kind of tolerance axe or anything like that that's that number for backyard corner you guys will notice a lot of the buzz look almost identical here I basically got two type of blood so far there's one that's a we'll pick a good example we've got these here which are more the fat solid colas little more rounded off around the top and then we've got he's here which are twisted up at the top they kind of want a crown that's the number six right there I'm sorry that's yes the number one I think and this is that number seven and this also is the same way it's not so rounded off at the top it tends to want to go ahead and keep going up you guys can see I mean leaves are just Harvard for us they're all starting from resin rail and I mean they're super healthy I haven't had any other issues nothing I mean these plants have been really great to grow you know I look forward to see what happens here you know it may just be wishful thinking but if there's some chance that I can go ahead and run a couple clones of this and not the same problem you know I think I think this might be something to keep we'll see what happens that's definitely another month or two in the future before I'll be making that kind of determination but you know I just I just want to let you guys know you know it's not the it's not the end of the world here in this garden and everything's going really hard let's go ahead and take a look from the other side now right has had to reposition a tripod there for you guys now this right here number five this is looking like one of the cuts that I want to keep and play with it's really nice good solid Cola formation lots of frost this which is kind of you know every every single one of them has got a lot of frost on really liking the way this one's growing along with the other number two in number seven this and the number two are very similar so we'll see what happens there is things finish off and go towards the later two weeks we'll get it figured out you know if anything I might keep three cuts to play with and that's about it everything's doing great in the room temperatures humidity all that's under control all this functioning real well not a whole lot else to say alright that's about all for now that guys want to give you a chance to look at some nice buds got any questions or comments go ahead and leave

smoke along with me guys entails real quickly I just want to apologize to all my overseas fans all the overseas subscribers and Watchers actually say everybody outside the country of that day US or whatever cuz apparently the last blast room I did had a song on it that was ok to play but was banned in some countries some countries out of the United States the song was bent so I apologize you guys can watch that last episode there's a song in there with Usher which I thought was cool and so far it's cool the only problem is it's banned in some countries I don't know why but the songs banned in some country so I apologize about the last livestream if you couldn't watch it this one here to be able to watch because we have a big shout-out to Freddy bricks putting me on to the Cash Money ap got cash 20 AP beats that are free to listen to and have on the [ __ ] YouTube and [ __ ] let's go and do a green stage test I got the 9 pound hammer load it up into my mom's piece guys and picked it up yet don't ask me why I'll let her have one of my other pieces to borrow check out the marbles and stuff as you can see though it's like green and stuff it's like a weird like gasoline green I think it's called on Grand Theft Auto and it has a weird like sparkle to it it's a very strange glass there's definitely good work done on it and then I don't know if you guys can see it but it like sparkles and shit's weird I don't know if he even salt it yeah I can't even salt it it has some sparkle to it though Oh toast Green's taste a sweet lemon pine sweet lemon fine kind of like a Lemon Haze super Lemon Haze there's the water of this bog well hold up I'll be right back I need to get some water all right I don't got some water I could not believe I had a volume that didn't have water in it it's very uncommon for me we got some water in this [ __ ] I done flipped it over to someone want to get a greens taste test in the water to see if I get like the hash she taste I usually get when I smoke through a bong so they flipped it over a little bit got a little bit greens but so far five out of five but the green say sad it's got some nice sweet lemon pine on that first hand off the spoon pipe we'll see what it tastes like in the bowing though see what that filtration desk toast don't be taste of trichrome and that cutting out like how she tastes a little bit more so yeah so five out of five for the green sage test very strong in the palette and just sweet lemon pie with that a little bit of passion there now Hoshi keep America tasting so they're gonna take up more hits here and see what it tastes like a math degree nice taste that's gonna keep off smoke along guys toast so that screen say so so three out of five just kind of average tasting don't really taste the women no more nothing sweet you know nope I'm like I said no lemon no house no nothing there's gotten just regular already combusted flavor so after grease a sense the three out of five the high though I will say even though it's supposed to be an indica I do have a very strong sativa high and I guess the somewhat decent body indica high so I'll definitely give the high a four out of five pretty good strong on the THC but not very good on the CBD not very strong I should say and it's supposed to be an indica or at least to any codominant so yeah I love this point it on the indica side but still still got me stoned in those couple of hints so I still give it a four out of five so my official give the nine pound hammer pretty good wheat it's it's no I wouldn't say it's super duper top shelf five out of five but it ain't no Reggie no average mid grade so definitely give the nine pound hammer a four out of five definitely recommend you guys to go ahead and try this out once you don't go get yourself a grabbed medically recreationally or black market or the [ __ ] you get your [ __ ] at don't see if you go just grab a gram of it I'm gonna see if you like it because so far I like it it's not too bad when I buy it again probably probably I would not go out and try to get more of it like I really need this is the best [ __ ] in the world but you know if I went in there that would be one of my choices you know if I can't get super duper top-shelf that would be the next option right there so I definitely recommend it and see if you guys try it out you guys my liking a little bit better now I'm pound hammer I give it a 4 out of 5 not too bad so if you guys enjoyed this [ __ ] of course make sure to hit the [ __ ] lock button to fight against the [ __ ] who flag the [ __ ] also make sure to comment down in the comments and of course definitely make sure to have great date night all on 24 hours to post a somebody gets up $10 very piecey guys next time with Chris Kyle's TV with one more 9 pound hammer out of the spoon pipe to bong combo thingy oh hey I just look about just locale hi guys who's", "aTVvR7E1AGE": "hello I am Duane Cartwright and we were declared in November to be nine pound hammer History Month it's official nothing anyone can do about it that's the way it is thirty years ago not that hammer we moved from the small small town of Owensboro Kentucky to the small city of Lexington Kentucky to make it in the music business I think one reason we went there is because we had a bunch of friends there and stuff - it wasn't like a big move like you go to LA and things don't happen for you and you don't know anybody and you move back and it's like basically it was also a good place to like develop - we played we played at a several times a month in town anywhere we could now in a pen hammer started off we were a blatant combination of jason-2 Scorchers than the Ramones now in the mid 80s Ramones weren't revered like they are now I mean the idea that they were be a subject of like that on the TV show Entourage where they're they're fighting over a script based on Joey Ramones alive I dad just seems so  far-fetched or moments were kind of down and out and but we champion them because they wrote songs about having fun and partying then the beach and hot rods and stuff you know and that always made sense to us I remember vividly being into the singer Scott Llewellyn's car drinking tequila and turf in a cornfield blasting your Ramones on it on a ghetto blaster in the front seat you know it's car called the Crawdaddy we wrote something on the first record now there we were Ramones bass because that's how I play that's basically what I could do I could set a amplifier to certain have a certain sound and play like The Ramones you know that but the Lord wants to learn Barre chords that was basically it so most bands around that time the way they do like the Ramones or not we're still Ramones bass because that's the Ramones are the basis of punk rock yeah the other band we really try to be like a Jason and Scorchers now by the way of making a playlist for Spotify for for our 320s videos right and the one right now I'm putting on the adjacent versus Joey like Jason's quarters and Joey Ramone now if you weren't around the integrity of Tennessee Kentucky and in their early 80s and mid 80s you did not understand the significance of chasing the Scorchers they were a big big deal and we were so blatantly ripped them off that we were almost embarrassed about it but now when I show people Jason is courts of stuff they don't see the connection at all but there was two bands and like 82 83 out of the South there were huge one of them was a REM they released an EP called chronic town in 82 and it didn't do anything except be on the village Voice's top-10 number two number two album the EP or the year or whatever it was and the same thing happened with Jason the next year at fervor but got on the critics poll and everyone started paying attention these guys they were both kind of neck and neck for a while and in fact when the REM and started playing four or five thousand people in Nashville Jason came out and saying rave on and broken whiskey glass and it was great but I've made this playlist of Jason versus Joey and it goes from plate and order because it goes Jason of Scorchers The Ramones Jason's courses Ramones and I've listened this thing I made it as a novelty and I listened to it non stop it's amazing and it just smokes and it it's just touch it shows where our heads are at we were that's what we were trying to be yeah that's exactly what we're trying to be the Scorchers did these this great first record and then they got they got a on a bigger label and they did an EP then they did their their big label record job that was great then they started being cheesy as  I don't know what half and I think than being in Nashville or something they just they started putting their hair up and the cow Punk was like got it gone and that's just it as far as like they don't get enough credit for they invented Cal Punk for sure we some people think that now if I'm hammer invented it we didn't invent it we didn't invent it I think we perfected it but we did not invent it but when the comment and the common thing about Jason is corkers end and the Ramones they both had these singers there's these goofy lanky people that that somehow gave this humanity to this scorching music behind them they looked like both Joey Ramone and Jason he didn't look like you know you couldn't tell if they were one I'm like trying to kick her ass or they're gonna be in a corner crying you know they both had they had this and they're both the other one who could sing for any other band but those dance that's it and they put this so much personality in that bad now the very the reason I'm talking about these guys so much is the his very first knock on hammered gig which we had another guitar player very first gig was David Everson play lead guitar I played rhythm Scott sang Toby Marcus on drums and a guy named Brian Payne who the only person we knew to play bass he liked more like u2 and stuff like that would play bass we played the Ross Theatre in Evansville Indiana and half the set list was Ramones and the other half is Jason Scorchers and that's what you know we it took us it took us like to like smoking taters to get this tall down to finally settle on that and get that style down and just and it just uh as far as the Scorchers it just can't be emphasized enough like I mean we we like jumped around like they did and everything else too you know we we had we had a video of those guys on they showed on Showtime for upcoming bands and we basically like this copy whatever move and everything and way Jason's corpse was when the bands have moved around morning when I ever saw because when you're a kid and you picture these bands in your head when you go Sam you're listening to them you think they're just going around going crazy like kiss did but not Jason's courses actually did that twenty wait so the so to celebrate the very birth of not found hammer they will get into Cal Ponca on the little next next episode and we'll get into specifics but right now a show where our heads are out and we started like go to Spotify and click on its link where this is at and listen to Jason versus Joey did I'll get back to you next time alright happy now I found hammer History Month everybody", "6lzapnX-qSQ": "[Music]", "Seb3GSTaq_4":

everybody welcome back to the harmonica barge we're not on the boat today in case you haven't guessed we're in the countryside there's green fields and sheep and tractors going by it's harvest time what perfect environment to do another bluegrass video so Rudy done to bluegrass videos today we're going to do a song study we're going to look at the song the nine pound hammer it's a bit of what we call a bluegrass standard so a common bluegrass tune in the repertoire gets played at sessions and gigs and all over really this is going to be using a C harmonica so key of C playing in the key of G okay so in second position and here's the melody [Music] [Music] so I'd recommend is trying to get that melody down if you can do it by ear not using the tab that is fantastic I would strongly recommend that because that's going to build your ear training and if you want to improvise more and if you want to sit in at sessions and gigs or anything where you don't know the song that you're going to be playing having a good ear to pick up melodies is a very very valuable skill and really the only way to get better at that is to just do it more I know it seems daunting at first but trying to work out melodies by ear I think is a great way to learn to play and it's also used a lot in the folk tradition okay so to to work out melodies by ear now get that going nice and slow okay you could do it to a metronome if you like you could find a backing track or you could program a backing track in if you if you know the chords but you won't go into that too much today even just listening to a version you like slow it down on YouTube or copy my version why not do that okay once you got it down you can start to speed it up now of course it does have that difficult bending on the three draw that whole step Bend if you want more info on that check out my second bluegrass video and I go into that in a lot of detail how to how to work on that Bend you could use a paddy Richter tuned harmonica or if you're going down that route an option which I'm not doing but so gain faster [Music] [Music] so we've got the melody and that's very important because the melodies King in bluegrass music so so much is dictated by the melody and if you know some melodies if you want to go to a session you know it's going to give you the ability to sit in and you don't just have to play licks then or blues you know more bluesy stuff as especially if you're a bluesy play wants to play bluegrass get to know some of the standards get to know some of the tunes you can even try singing along if you like once you've got the melody down nice and nice and slow you can start to mess around and try and fill in the gaps between the melody so the gaps are coming here so we've got three gaps there haven't we okay so three gaps to fill in I'm not going to go into massive detail what to do there today I'm just going to play around a little bit and try and play a few a few licks in the space if you can or maybe a chord chug wherever you like but the most important thing is to not stray too far from the melody at first [Music] so this is sort of thinking like a like a bluegrass player and if you listen to a fiddle player they'll do this a lot they'll play a melody and start to fill in the space you should get used to the melody speeding it up a little bit which is good preparation for a session because it might be very fast at a session so towards the end I'm going away from the melody a little bit and kind of riffing [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I'm messing around with the style a little bit they're embellishing it with chords but the fundamental thing is to try and get the melody down before you start playing around with it okay so I hope you have some fun with that we've been here at the harmonica barge in the countryside I'll see you very soon for another harmonica related video if you like the stuff subscribe leave comments see you very soon

aches and pains of all kinds meanwhile its ability to provoke hunger can help those who have lost their appetites due to medication or treatments like chemotherapy just like with any other strand it is important to know what your body can and cannot handle nine pound hammer is a very intense strand with high potency i've read a number of user reviews stating that this strand caused them to experience levels of extreme anxiety others report long bouts of paranoia and even hallucinations nine pound hammer has a sweet grape aroma with a hint of earth and a taste of sweet berry lime that intensifies as you inhale this dank bud has bright neon green grape shaped nugs with dark forest green undertones [Music] it can be grown indoors or out although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees fahrenheit it is easily accommodated indoors where its plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching growers should be sure to trim away any broad light blocking fan leaves in order to encourage the growth of flowering nodes on lower branches thanks to some very stable genes it is also resistant to mildew finally roars looking to bring out this strand's full appeal should bring out its shades of purple by exposing the plant to cold but not freezing nighttime temperatures nine pound hammer tends to flower within a brief seven to eight weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield for their efforts [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "oOduANgjdzk": "[Music] there's not old hammer is little

the spring songbook and rather than doing what we do in a regular weekly meeting and what I kind of started doing when what all this started doing a whole bunch of songs doing seven or eight or nine songs at a plaque what I'm what I think I'm going to do is so I'm going to go through this I'm going to do two songs at a time so the videos will be shorter so if you want to play along with something you can play along if you want to repeat a song it'll be a lot easier to do that than in a big giant video I'll do two songs at a time I'll go through the chords a little bit and if I'm using a different storming pattern I'll go through that strumming pattern a bit it won't be like a strumming lesson but I'll give you an idea what I'm gonna do when I strum it and then we'll play through it and I'm gonna try to stay at a moderate tempo but since nobody else is here it's very likely that I won't do that that I'll go too fast so inevitably so you can use the controls in YouTube to slow me down to a speed that is easier to keep up with if you're having trouble keep it up okay so the first song first two songs we're gonna do we're gonna do Hot Tamales the red hot mr. Robert Johnson tune from 1932 this is a great song it's got a great turnaround to stand will go through the turn around the beginning the other song is nine pound hammer which is Merle Travis song from 1947 which is really good one of one of the things about these two songs is they both swing so we're gonna be doing kind of swinging strums on these so let's go down here I know you can't see that last chord over there but it's a c7 which I think everybody probably knows pretty well sorry okay this is just like the meeting I'm just screwing up the open song stuff so here we go hot tamales they're red hot so we'll start out with this little turnaround I'll just play it it's a nice turnaround so the way that I'm gonna strum this I'm gonna use a pretty much [Music] [Music] whenever you want to swing something you can do in a triplet so in this case we have two beats one of the two and instead of doing them in two we're gonna do them in three and the way you do that is you split it into thirds so each third so st. triple let triple lift look that's the third trick bullet trick bullet so we're getting that we're splitting that count into thirds but you in triple it now as I go through the song I'll probably change my strum and and I'll make myself a liar that I'm gonna do all down strums because I'll probably stop doing that and do something else but that's my intention is to play down strums oh this song also as an instrumental part so I'm gonna I'm gonna try to do the Walter we get together okay let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if since then he can take his rest and I will say me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay well sorry about the scrolling it's just like being in the meeting that's a great song and I really look forward to doing it with you all together one of the things you can do at the end of like the first [Music] at that sale at the end of the fourth line in each of the yes she got it for sale you get you get a remove strum there which would sound really needed some neat little ornament so the triplets drum that's a good thing to work on now if you're sitting at home it's really not that hard it just takes some practice so the way we're gonna do it make a little fist like this kind of a loose fist you have your thumb right here by the side of the neck and you want to do this up where the neck and the body come together strangers fairly loose you can start you're gonna do a finger down and then a thumb down one of the secrets to practicing this is don't say down down up say triple it when you do it cuz the thing that's hard so this is a good one you sitting from the TV you just do this for a while couple of days and then you'll get it you your fingers and once you have it start sticking it into song so you're playing it makes a really nice little ornament at the end of a phrase or summer at the end of the song so hot tamales are red-hot this is gonna be fun when we get together again I think we could do a great arrangement of it sorry about all this coughing and hacking okay we're gonna do nine pound hammer now this song I'm gonna I'm gonna do the Train strumming video so it's my finger [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] sorry about all the coughing crazy scrolling in there that's just the way it is okay thanks for tuning in for these two I think that's plenty of time so we'll do another couple next week oh they'll be on the webpage I'll send out an email with links to these two so

resist the temptation to bring my backpackers mocha daily and occasionally sing one of my favorite folk songs dying to pound hammer since this was after all coal country recently during my lockdown due to the Colvin crisis I stumbled across a recording of the song that I did a few years ago and also an old CD of pictures from the trip so why not put them together my version of the song is modeled after John prions sadly John was a casualty of the crisis which is another reason I felt compelled to do this video since this is a traditional song there are many other versions in different styles for example Earl Scruggs or doc and Merle Watson of course the vs. aren't necessarily standard and I actually decided to add one of the my own you will notice it in italics [Music] [Music]

"okay miss Emily here and I thought I'd do a little bit of a video today about harmony singing harmony singing is sort of like you are making a chord with your voice it's two it's two pitches or more that are kind of moving together making a chord with each note for example I've got my keyboard here I'm gonna hit a C and an e so there's one Harmon you know in there with new notes just like you make a chord on your guitar or on your banjo or fiddle or whatever mandolin okay you can add C and that's a C chord so when you're singing harmony like the leaves note might start on no then the next person's note is gonna start on the next one will start on to make a chord and it kind of moves together there's an F chord and a G chord so you're hearing Z so you're making words with your voice that is essentially what harmony is and like I say it can be two voices it can be three can before it can be a whole chorus of voices although who probably wouldn't be that many different combinations and harmony is either sung you can sing it all together at the same time so you're moving right along with the melody and harmony but today what I thought I would do for you all is to do call-and-response harmony just like when you do a call-and-response song someone's gonna sing a line and then that person will sing a line back we've done this summon our singing class like hambone hambone where you been then you guys would sing back hambone hambone where are you being and of course in our class we have been doing the song nine pound hammer but we've been doing it where you would call the melody back to me so it'd be like oh the nine pound hammer oh the nine pound hammer is a little too heavy is a little too heavy for my size for my size buddy for my size buddy for my size today I'm gonna show you how to do call-and-response harmony on nine pound hammer so when you're calling it back to me you're gonna be calling back the harmony part and if you want to hear some examples of this song done in this way there are three examples of early recordings and since you guys are on YouTube you can access these easily and one thing that's pretty interesting about the three recordings I'm going to be discussing with you is they're all pioneer musicians from our area that recorded back in the 1920s you can listen to the version of nine pound hammer by g/b Grayson and hen Widder where they're kind of doing unison call-and-response this is recorded in the 1920s then there was one of the first old-time bands that ever recorded called the hillbillies and some of them were from ash County some from Galax and and some from Smith County Virginia all around our area now they have a little more complex version of doing nine pound hammer when they do their call and response they're responding in four-part harmony so they've got a lot of different harmony voices going on and another example is of Frank Blevins and his tar hair Rattlers Tar Heel Rattlers who are from right across the line over in Ashe County North Carolina and their their version is kind of what we're going to be working on today they're doing call-and-response harmony and another thing interesting about Frank Blevins and the Tar Heel rattlers is they were just a little bit older than you guys when they first recorded back in the 1920s so they were teenagers so check all those out on YouTube it is Grayson and Witter the hillbillies Frank Blevins and his heart Tar Heel Rattlers they were all recorded in the 20s and they are all available on YouTube ok so I will do the best to try to show you an example of call-and-response harmony I'm gonna be singing harmony to myself I'm doing a little lower than what we usually do Oh pound hammer and here's the harmony all the nine pound hammer is a little too heavy it's a little too heavy for my size for my size baby for my size baby for my side so here's we'll try that again down hammer on the nine is a little too heavy it's a little too heavy for my son [Music] the course roll on buddy roll on buddy don't you Rosie your son how can I roll how can I roll with like wheels won't go when the wheels won't go [Applause] to see

doing today is identifying a very common question that I get I get gosh well over a hundred emails a week asking me questions and sending in requests which I really appreciate y'all doing and one of the most common questions is how do you come up with a break I know how to sing a song but how do you come up with a break to a song with lyrics and so today what I want to do is take one of those most common standards that we all know we all sing Nam pound hammer and we're gonna do it in the key of a and I'm gonna show you how to take it from just the melody that you hear that you sing all the way up into a full break you can do that did you know that check it check it out what we're going to do first is I'm gonna play it one time through just playing the straight-up melody at least the melody that I sing there's several different interpretations but the melody that I would sing and then we're going to add the second time through just some common Harmony notes that we find in our chords that we're using okay and then the third time through I'm going to start combining in another just few licks that I've made up that gets us from one point of the song to the other so check check this out starting with the very basic melody working all the way up into a full break okay you saw the progression there from the standard melody to using the standard melody with harmony notes into adding some more licks to kind of spice it up a little bit I can show you how to do that that's what we're going to do today with this 30-minute video lesson here banjo Ben Clark comm if you're watching on YouTube here in the wall I'm going to ask you to jump over to my website banjo Ben Clark come and join as a go pick member where you'll have access to all of these videos and tabs that I'll update each and every week I sure appreciate all of you who have done that you you're the ones that allow me to do what I do so let's dive right into this one a little bit of that 9 pound hammer but I'd like to look here at the first measure and essentially what I've done when we're first starting to build a break is just hum out that basic melody to ourselves if we can hum this melody if we can sing this melody then we can find it on our instrument or at least we can get some good practice in trying to find it and you'll get better and better at that as you go along but I want to sing the song thank you a so I assume that most of you are probably already playing rhythm to this song now just just as many different people have recorded this song there's as many different versions of the melody okay Doc Watson sings it one way you might put a melody note here there Tony rice might do it a completely different way or whoever it may be so I kind of took my own interpretation and whenever I sing it I'm I'm not saying well there's a nine pound hammer okay so I'm going to find those notes here on my mandolin there's my starting second fret I found it there on the fourth fret as you can see and where does it go from there the open a string and that's sewn into this second measure let's look at that we got a is that downstroke alone on the quarter note there and then we've got mur the second syllable of that word that's going to take us out through the rest of that measure now this isn't really this is an abode sustaining instrument like it may be a dobro or a violin a fiddle would be so we don't have the luxury sometimes and just playing one note and letting it ring out such as a fiddle might just be able to bow that same note and it sound just fine so what I've done here in this particular song is whenever we have those notes that hold out through the whole measure I'm just going to play eighth notes to kind of fill in that time so let's look there at those first two measures and it's going to be just exactly as how we'd sing it or at least how I sing it - ready go one and remember I just did the eighth notes through that mer syllable now we're getting to measure three we're just going to continue to hum the song is a little - it's the way I sing it it's a little - so we're gonna find those notes it's a little right there fourth fret just as you see there on the tab is a little too and there's our other multi note that second fret it's a little too and then what's our next melody notes heavy some measure four we can find those there we go now that V and heavy is going to carry out through the rest of that measure song we'll play its nose own into measure five but if for mine you see the melody there measure six size size takes up that whole measure so I'm just gonna play sighs and then we're gonna do some more eighth notes one into measure seven buddy for mine yeah now you get the hang of it size and measure eight size which takes up that whole measure measure nine well Roland I found in there that's quarter notes then measure ten buddy got kind of little blues sound in there buddy play the notes to take up the D and Buddy is um buddy don't you roll so don't you groans don't you bulls that was in measure 11 slow that's pretty easy less fun than right there measure 12 pretty straight for rolling 14 16 so there is our basic basic melody of non pound hammer yeah now that's great for simple melody but how do we start spicing that up a bit and what I'm going to show you here is now that we know which chords are going with the melody we know our melody now we know which chords we saw the chords in there in the tab I'm going to teach you to find harmony notes to play with the basic melody so we can start filling this break out a little bit start building a break and that sounds something like this so we're gonna start working with some double stops and then eventually we're going to start filling in with more licks good stuff let's move on", "q8wE0SjyJ_I": "I got it [Music] to see my baby back [Music] [Music] this man that ever Italy like silver it'll shine like gold it'll shine [Music] ever [Music]

come back [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "NYuvxf7fhuY": "[Music] everybody this is star from start out than mine coming into Tuesday morning how the [ __ ] are you I'm from my kitchen right now oh you son you I'm smoking on some little bit of my harvest harvest still got plenty I am excited I wanted to bring you the 9 pound hammer oh my god I've never had the 9 pound hammer in my garden these were gifted to me for a donation I made and I'm so grateful that I got them I have seven nine pound hammer here one month's there Barry they're all been gifted to me from mr. missus trichome thank you very much shout out to mr. mrs. chai khon these are jinx proof genetics shout-out to jinx proof and Miss Rose much love to you you and your family thank you I'm so grateful and humbled behind your genetics in my garden what I have read and what I know about the nine pound hammer wasn't much I never have smoked it I never have had it in my garden and they didn't know much about it but I had heard a lot about it and wanted it so everything I know Fred tells me it's a pretty big fielder pretty high THC content pretty good for pain really good for stress PTSD and things like that and insomnia which are all some of the things that I have so I'm excited to see what it flowers like it flowers in approximately twelve weeks or fifty to sixty days whichever you prefer they say this suggested hype is 30 inches 32 72 inches in flower and then it'll yield you approximately 3 to 6 ounces perfectly no I mean take a rope with you Cheers this is a indica 80% 20% sativa so that makes it a hybrid strain but everything I have read says it takes on that indica dominance and I know it's a cross between a good goji berry house kitchen oh gee and Jack the Ripper I mean just Jack the Ripper in Hell's Kitchen right there sound like [ __ ] fire game don't they [ __ ] so I have my alcohol here and my scissors because everybody got top today because they're above a fourth Lisa no it's supposed to smell like grape and mine have really dense buds and the flavor is supposed to be really amazing so I'm excited to see like I said what she does in my flower pit now um I don't know if it's good for pain I don't know if it's good for stress but I know anything that has to do with the indica family which is my favorite strains to smoke is indica for pain and stress or in some their because I suffer from all three of those things and I need a really heavy hitter to do that that's why I like the men men they say also that which is really surprising much to my surprise guys that they say that this nine pound hammer is best prone indoors did you know so you know when they say fifty to sixty days on the yield that's so general twelve weeks is a general so you know you watch your trichomes and things like that but these girls are just getting silica at this point and they're getting soil balance Pro and they're also getting a mammoth pea once a week I don't generally feed nutrients until a certain point in my garden and they're they haven't reached that point yet so I don't like to feed hot or give high PPM's at such a young age they have all been taught so I'm gonna take another trip with you and I just wanted to frickin share them with you because I'm so stoked that I almost pissed myself floured them but I have two flower Kings going right now and I'm not gonna put up another one I want him but I can't I can't I just can't so Cheers ooh that just makes everything perfect okay so let me show you these gals okay okay so here is and now the numbers that I'm telling you are the numbers on the way that I labeled them because they're the way they came up in the Solo cups okay so this is number two she's gorgeous this is number six this is number one this is number five I mean they're spinning right look at the stocks are nice and the swing daughter I don't think they're gonna be boys I think they're all gonna be girls God willingly prick don't words this is number four just beautiful plants you boys this is number three and as you can see they've all been college and now they'll have two pots could you notice they're just the ones I generally pop at the fourth fifth Lisa and I don't care I don't count these they have to be Foley's follies stick the King Center to set okay this is number seven spinning [Music] okay now I have one more in here and it is the monster berry and I had dropped five monster berries on 9:17 and it took a long time for them to come up and only two out of the five came up and this is number one the other one I left in the seedling ten because she's the one that I was showing you guys on my last update from the seedling tent that I was bathing didn't really pick her out so I talked this one she's not ready to be topped and I'll show you her she's a stunning plant she's just gonna have to catch up that's all what she were [Music] pattern on this girl and she's been talked to and I I think
