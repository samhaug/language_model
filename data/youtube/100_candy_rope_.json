{"PQ8Kg3Uisr0": "[Music] i did a licorice in today's video we are going to see if candy is strong enough to hold the weight of a person i wanted candy uh-huh you got a good amount of it it looks like 12 pounds that's probably more than we needed but not more than you wanted you wanted to do some strength tests i did i actually wanted to see if you could climb a rope made out of licorice or maybe nerd rope or something like that but before we even attempted that i wanted to try something a little bit easier strength test about whether or not it can hold the human's body weight i think the most popular brand of this is the twizzlers pulling peel just like nine of them you peel them off yep i think this brand is tougher than those which is good for our experiments i think so they're a little bit stretchier but i actually got them because they were the longest pieces that i could find it is much longer than a twizzler's pull and peel that's like two feet and that was kind of what i wanted because i want to be able to hook them onto something and then try and swing from it like we've done in the past with other things yeah so i'm just tying this in a square knot i don't know if there's a better way to attach the ends together so it can hold a scale but i'm going with the square knot okay we've got our fish scale here okay turn it on and i'm gonna pull and see what pounds and ounces this gets to okay [Music] wow it's a lot stretchier than i thought that stretched a lot and it got to about two and a half pounds which is not a lot no but we have a lot of strength we do have a lot of strength i'm gonna do another one see if we get the same result [Music] that one hit like two pounds exactly okay so if we calculate that each one of these is two pounds i'm going to need 80 to hold my body weight that got two pounds but then it broke pretty quickly so i think we want a little bit more time than that especially if you were hoping to swing so i've got four strings here just together and then i've got four strings that i have braided together yes it is a four strand braid and i want to know which is stronger which is stretchier now i'm going to think this is going to be a lot stretchier with the way that it's braided together but let's find out [Music] okay got to like seven ish okay and uh it does seem like we're kind of cutting through with the hook so if it were like a wider could be anything like say hands maybe it would do better i like your idea then about putting a hundred because that gives us that leeway [Music] about the same seven okay so it is getting a little weaker but that's okay i do think that if we use 100 that's 20 extra strands that are just and it does really look like it's breaking on the points these narrow points that's how it always is with our rope test it's going to be at the fail point often with ropes the fail point is the knot and that does not seem to be the case not the knot it's not for me not the knot all right let's count out 100 of these [Music] i believe that is 100 strands all divided up into bunches of four singing moods today they're so oily i think they're coated in oil like yeah explains why it's so difficult to hold on to now you want to tie these i honestly just want to loop them you just want to loop and hang we can try that the time is first the tying is maybe to make it easier to hold on to i want to see if i can hold on to it with my teeth your dad is a dentist callie don't do these things that's exactly why i can't do it free dental oh dear all right let's add some hooks into the ceiling sure we have our reinforced spot let's not take well i mean i guess we can't really i can't take the shoes down no i'm just gonna put the hooks in right here and that should get the two by fours and possibly even well not the wall beyond but it'll get into the two by fours how many nates does it take to screw in a hook just one oh i might either back up one [Music] this is heavy it's a shocking amount of licorice does licorice go well it's really oily i would think that's by far the biggest risk here okay is not the strength of the licorice but how well you can hold on to oily like slimy ropes how's your grip not great not great nate [Music] this is gonna be a problem but it is holding my weight if you uh if you grip through paper towels wait yes good but it did hold me it was holding for me it did hold me and the one that was breaking is the one that you tried to hang on by itself so you had already started to break some of them i think let's count out 100 again and see if you can hang from it okay [Applause] [Music] all right now it's my turn i'm gonna see how long this licorice can hold me up one two three four five hey you cheated you ate it it didn't hold me up after i started eating it but it did hold your body weight and i think it would have held a lot longer if you hadn't started chowing down maybe a little that was pretty great guys you can hold a human's body weight with licorice and i'm thrilled alright so i've braided in other strands to see how well it holds and i'm curious if it will break or if it will actually like pull the strands out i guess oh yep the strands unwound i don't think anything actually broke now that one did interesting so it's maybe possible to make even longer ropes out of this stuff but it wouldn't be difficult yeah so you can hold your body weight with candy but whether or not you can make a rope out of it it's not looking like it i think you could but by the time you had a rope that was functional to do anything it would be as thick as all 100 of those strands together and it would be a ton of work to braid them all so what you'd end up with is a rope that barely does anything is thicker than your wrist and takes a lot of work to make so basically my weekend plans are shot [Music] oh my so bad gosh hurt are you okay okay okay but you're okay i'm fine guys you can jump rope with licorice look at it oh that's gonna be a whelp hey let's go before uh nate comes back and we have to clean all this up that's a good plan yeah let's go guys that's it for today but you know we've always got more great stuff for you see go ahead and hit that box right there to check out another one of our cool videos and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "G70-Bp6kHGU": "is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear goodness gravy I've got a story for you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from this it's this weed is for sinners and I'm going to help [Music] ped accidentally took 400 milligrams of edible",

might look like i just slapped a bunch of licorice together and called it a day in reality making a licorice rope that works like an actual rope is a lot more challenging than it seems which is why if you search for giant candy rope all you'll find are a handful of people who made half-hearted attempts and a few that are just straight-up fakes it's easy to say you've made the world's biggest candy rope but actually doing it is a very different story so today we're gonna put to rest another ridiculous question of mine can you make an actual rope out of licorice rope but before we put this rope through the ultimate set of tests i want to take a sec to show you what we actually had to do for the past three months to make this project work the ideal licorice for this project would be as strong as possible flexible enough to weave and accessible enough that i could get my hands on a lot of it you can't exactly google what licorice fits this bill so i had to test them out myself to measure strength i bought four common kinds of licorice cut five inch lengths of each and performed two strength tests first i measured how much weight it held when bent over the hook and next i measured how much weight it held when pulled along its length to make them easy to compare to each other i then converted these measurements into strength to weight ratios as a cool side product of this we're now able to calculate the maximum theoretical length of a single twizzler when held by the end that length is a surprisingly short 28.5 feet any longer than this and the weight of the licorice below it will cause it to just break off at the top after seeing the results of the testing i wanted to use twizzlers because they performed the best but fresh out of the package twizzlers are kind of too short and fat to weave and i discovered you can't really re-melt them or weld them together with heat either that's because unlike gummy candy which melts because it is a gelatin base red licorice has a starchy wheat flour base meaning it actually has more in common with spaghetti than it does with gummy worms being unable to lengthen my licorice meant i had to use a strand that starts out long so either super ropes or licorice laces i tweeted all my math at red vines on twitter asking for a sponsorship by way of some free super ropes but after a couple dms they ghosted me at which point i knew i was going solo this might have been a blessing in disguise though because super robes aren't actually all that strong according to my testing so i headed to amazon in search of a bargain on some licorice laces these are just as strong as broadway laces and i got them for an absolute steal loki abusing an amazon subscribe and save promo to get myself an extra 40 off their already discounted price before i went full scale i wanted to test the strength of various weaving styles so i made a two strand twisted rope a three strand flat braid and a four strand round braid each with a similar total number of licorice fibers in the test the three and four strand braids perform by far the best so i plan to use these in combination for the final rope these ropes are designed to bind against themselves when under load maximizing their strength and also locking in any extraneous fibers at this point you might think this video is all about science and while that's kind of true it's also kind of not rope making is an art and it's one i have absolutely zero experience with so instead of struggling through the making of this massive rope alone i called up my friend jeffrey who i knew could help me out oh here's here's the situation right this is a three strand and that's that's your four strand jeffrey's a craftsman who knows way more about rope making and leathercraft than i could ever hope to he also makes a ton of other stuff and without his help i'm not sure i would have been able to do this so please go follow his facebook page and check out his incredible work as soon as the licorice arrived we got right to work but even for someone as experienced as jeffrey making a rope this big with these materials was no easy task the mountain of licorice seemed unsurmountable at first but bag by bag and strand by strand the rope began to form i handled the licorice wrangling and jeffrey handled the weaving we started by making two 32 foot long three strand braids making sure to keep them as consistent in thickness as possible then we match them up at the ends and slid in a 2x4 to keep them in place as jeffrey leapt up onto the table to weave the final rope he admitted to me while weaving that even he found this a bit intimidating because the licorice is all basically the same color and since it's translucent light shines through it making shadows less visible making it really easy to lose track of where you are in the weaving process even so we pushed through and eventually after two days work we finally had the world's biggest licorice rope to catch a big fish now while we could have technically left it just like this i was going to have to move it a ton while setting up my testing and that repeated pulling and pushing on the weave could cause the rope to fall apart as a precaution we wrapped the rope with a handful of zip ties to help keep the fibers together but to be clear these don't add any additional strength to the rope they're just there to help keep the licorice strands from shimmying out of place at this point the rope was done so i thanked jeffrey for his help packed up the rope and came back the next day to finally test it out the only way to really know how strong your rope is is to push it till it breaks so i was determined to do just that and i figured why not start big yep all right i've got it going we're in neutral make sure we're freaking rolling we are all right here we go so i'm gonna call this a success if i can get from there to that pole let's test this thing out three two one go come on yes we got it yes yes let's go oh yes holy crap guys this is like 1200 pounds of machine that got moved with a pile of twizzlers that's freaking nuts or is it i was absolutely thrilled that it worked but to be honest pulling the car felt kinda easy you see the carpool used in ads for adhesives and here on youtube as this epic test of strength as if to say that pulling a car means the rope or glue or whatever can support thousands of pounds but that's actually kind of deceptive when you pull a car you're not actually pulling the full weight of it you're just overcoming its resistance to rolling which is a much lower weight how much lower well in the case of my car instead of 3 600 pounds it's closer to 36 that is way less so as impressive as it looks it's actually not that hard to do in practice so next time you see a test like that on tv now you know it's complete bogus but that also leaves us in a weird situation because we still haven't broken our rope if i was going to break this thing i needed a harder test so i packed it up and took it to a local gym to do just that oh and by the way if you think this kind of thing is cool please don't forget to subscribe it's free and it really helps me out and if you change your mind you can always unsubscribe later we are here at fit club in columbus ohio where they are graciously letting us use some of their equipment to test out this ridiculous licorice rope i am here with ron who is actually going to help me do this rope thing what's your official title man like crossfit instructor or certified crossfit trainer but i also manage this whole place and stuff like that that's sick and nobody's ever come here with the licorice rope before right that's correct all right cool sick so what we're gonna do we're gonna put it to the test with a weight sled to see just kind of what it can pull all right we got two 45s on there all right so that's working so we got 85 pounds so far that's pretty good this is 90 90. you think all right let's try it all right how many pounds is this now can i even pull this let's find out holy crap yo it's holding let's go let's go even more i guess how many is this i don't even know if i can move this you want to pull this you got this all right ron yeah holy crap yeah it is that is nuts what is this 305 here we maxed out the capacity to sled at around 360 pounds but as we know pulling force can be kind of deceptive so how much weight did that actually put on the rope based on my calculations we put about 118.8 pounds of sustained stress on the rope and even after that this thing was still going i was still determined to break this thing though so fortunately i had a trick up my sleeve i knew the hardest test of all would be trying to actually climb it because not only would the rope have to support me it would have to support the weight of the entire rope below it if this didn't break the rope i didn't know what would so this is like the test robe and this is the giant rope we're just gonna send it we gotta go slow that's the thing that is gonna be the hardest part about this i see it just stretches that's the thing yeah the rope is getting longer as i do it here let me wrap pull round so that far worked i feel like this is long enough that we need to hang it from a higher point i mean frankly this is holding together a little bit better than i anticipated look how big this freaking thing is i'm so glad this didn't fall apart immediately i was like there are two ways this is gonna go that's the thing that's holy sh the higher i climb the heavier this oh my god like come over here look at this that is just dummy big i think we just got to send it louis unwise let's do it three two one let's go we know this thing is climbable we climbed it one time over there how about then we hang up this end let's just give it another whirl we got this grab these gloves we're gonna do this again new end of the rope i'm just gonna try and be efficient right here we go ready all right two one got it it's got it it just held yeah it's just stretching that's all ah and there it was finally after everything we put it through we managed to break the rope but my calculations including my weight and the weight of the licorice being supported this rope held around 180 pounds but why did i do this why make the world's largest licorice robe

Hopefully it'll be very interesting look it's an actual whistle *tries to whistle* It's not doing anything *mores whistle noises* Okay, it's not working But it tastes good.

You guys do get to\neat some of the candy. Yes! That's all I was looking for. Two brand new segments-- Get Crafty, followed\nby Magic Time. And then we round it off\nwith everybody's favorite-- Cool Not Cool. --Wheel Unfortunate. Oh! No! OK, before we dive into\nthat, giveaway for this week.

Yeah, OK, let's head to Top 10. Here we go! [MUSIC PLAYING] Ladies and gentlemen,\nwelcome to this Top 10. Today we are talking about the\nTop 10 candies of all time. I'm going to start\noff with number 10. If you even think for a second\nthat black licorice even deserves a top 50 mention-- Hey, you know what\nI'm going to do? --we're going to have problems? You know what I'm going\nto do for you right now? Talk to me. No, I'm going to\nabsolutely freak out. Throw it. Yes! Typically, this would have been\nin my least favorite candies, but thanks to my good buddy\nCodes, number 10 on the list, Swedish Fish. I agree. Gotta respect it. What a stick. Give it a go. Number 10, there it is. Number nine-- the single\ngreatest movie watching candy. Ladies and gentlemen, Milk Duds. Oh! Number nine. I do like a Dud. There it is. My wife got me on the Duds. OK, I'm sure there's other\nmovie favorites out there, but in my opinion,\nyou can not be Milk Duds at the movie theater. Let's all agree\nthat Tootsie Rolls-- Oh, see ya! --are the worst\ncandy ever invented! Goodbye! Can we just do this real quick? Yep. Yep. Punt it. Throw it. No, no, no! What? I don't know what those are. Orange Slices, Circus\nPeanuts, and Tootsie Rolls! No, no, no! See ya! See ya! They're not in\nthe same category! And then chunk it harder. Yes! [CLANG] Oh! You just spread them forever. Hey, good news,\nCory, there's a lot of Tootsie Rolls on the\nground right down there. Time out. Time out. This is the worst\ncandy of all time. Yeah, they're horrible. Eat it right now. I want you guys to taste the\nworst candy in the world. Black licorice kills this. Punt it! Punt it! Punt it! Punt it! No, I'm not doing it. I won't punt it. I promise I won't punt it. But I'm going to throw\nit against the wall! Oh my-- Everything's going to be OK. Everything's going to be OK. That was excessive,\nand I apologize. Wait. Where's the Fun Dip? I would like to take this\nmoment and apologize to Fun Dip. Fun Dip would have\nmade my Top 10. We had a hard time finding it. We couldn't find Fun Dip. It's sold out? Let's take a moment of\nsilence for Fun Dip. All right, let's move on. Number eight-- can\nI please get there? Yeah. This is the most\nunderrated candy bar in the history of the world. Yeah. Payday. No! What were you saying? Snickers! No, no, no. I think this would\nbe a good time to hit some honorable mentions. Orange Tic Tacs. They're so good. Take a few. Because they're\nnot really candy. They're not candy. It's tough to put\nthem on the Top 10. But who doesn't like these? Everybody likes them. For me, this next candy\nat the number seven spot is a candy that I\nvividly remember the day that it came out. I am in my school cafeteria. I'm going through the line,\nand all of a sudden-- oh my. What is that? Sour Skittles. Oh my goodness! A game changer for the\nSkittles organization. Number seven. Top 10 candy for me, 100% Thank you. Sour Skittles. Number six. I'm nervous about this. I feel like I'm going to\nlose some people here, but I have to be true to myself. This is a unique candy. The packaging is unique. Oh, PEZ. Come on. I love PEZ. I just buy the accessories. Fruity Stripes with\ntattoos on the packages. Put it in there. Sure, it loses its flavor\nin about 10 seconds- 10? Five. --but that's why it\ncomes in packs of five. Not even in the Top 10 gum list. It's not even a candy. It's a gum. Do you want me to remove it? Yes! Punt it. The world wants a\nfake version of me, and that's what\nthey're going to get. What happened to be\ntrue to yourself? It's back up there! Number six, Fruity Stripe gum. We almost got Fruity gum off. I don't care what his list is. I just disagree! I would like to welcome\nyou to my top five by suggestion of Tim Bits,\nthe editor, Sweet Tart Ropes! So good! So good! It's a Nerds Rope\nwithout the Nerds. It's just half as good. Peach Rings-- send them. I need a full send\nfrom everybody. Full send! Send it! Boston Baked Beans? Disgusting! Good bye! Jelly beans? Yeah, send them! Send them! Yes! [CRASH] Oh! Oh! [LAUGHTER] He just threw away 30\nminutes of his time. What about a Toblerone? What is that? Oh, those are high--\npremium candy. First of all, that's\nmy number one. Whoa! Dude, it's up there. And if you don't believe me,\nyou can call my wife right now and ask her. Speaker phone. What's your number\none candy bar? If she doesn't say it, you know\nwhat's happening to this thing. Full send. Full send. I agree. What is my number one\ncandy bar that I love? Easy-- Toblerone. No way! That's insane! No way! I've known him for 15 years. I've never even\nheard of a Toblerone! At number four-- greatest sucker\nin the history of the world-- Caramel Apple Pops. Nearly made my top three. In the number three spot-- Pop Rocks. --we have a three-way tie. Let's buy Cody's support. Nerds Rope. Bang! Number three. I'm in his top six. I'd go on record and\nsay that I've been over 25 yards of Nerds Rope. I would argue that I've eaten\ncloser to 65 yards of Nerds Rope. I can't even throw\nfootball that far. Yeah. That's a lot of rope. You digestive system has\nto hate you for that. Can anyone beat 65\nyards of Nerds Rope? Comment below if you have had\nmore than 65 yards of Nerds Rope. Let me know your distance. Three-way tie third place. We've got two more to get to. Top three candy for me\neasy, no question about it, although I prefer a\ndifferent variety-- Sour Patch Bigs can not be beat. I'll dare say that I've\nhad them at breakfast. OK, to round off the\nthree-way tie at third place, Laffy Taffy. Oh! 100%! Laffy Taffy is like the\ncandy you get at Halloween and you cry. Well, I can't wait to see what's\nin your top five number two. [LAUGHTER] At the number two spot, the\nsingle greatest chocolate candy-- Oh god! You cannot say a word\nuntil you've had one! Open it up and have it\nready, and prepare to all bow down to me at one time. 3, 2-- you already ate it? You prematurely put\nit in your mouth and spat it on the ground. It was not very good. To be a number one\ncandy in the world, you have to have good marketing. Do the words lick the\npop, dip, and shake it mean anything to you? Is that Baby Bottle Pops? Ladies and gentlemen, the\nnumber one candy in the world and the greatest jingle\nfor a single candy item in the history of the\nEarth-- (SINGING) lick the pop, dip it and shake it,\nthen lick it again. It's a Baby Bottle Pop. Baby Bottle Pop. Doesn't even rhyme. Next time, I'm going to\nlet someone else take over the Top 10. Great. Apparently, I'm too\ncontroversial for the world. It's true. And I'm not going to put\ngum in my Top 10 candies. OK? We're doing top\n10 cheeseburgers, but I threw a chicken nuggets. Go clean up the office. Thanks for watching\nTop 10, guys. Let's send it back to the desk. I got some jelly beans to\ngo clean up, unfortunately. [MUSIC PLAYING] These are the most overrated\nold man candy of all time. Hey, guys, the segment's over. Let's move on. Lose the candy. We're headed to a\nbrand new segment that is bound to be one\nof my personal favorites. It's time to Get Crafty. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, gang, welcome to our\nfirst episode of Get Crafty. Today, the guys will\nbe building a chair. They will have 30\nminutes to build the best chair they can using four 2x4s. These are the community tools\nthat they will have to share. You can only use one at a time. Best chair wins. I'll be the judge. Good luck, gents. Have some fun. 30 minutes in 3, 2, 1. Hit it! All right, let's see. You going-- oh, going\nstraight for the holder. I have zero clue\nwhat I'm going to do. [MUSIC PLAYING] My dad is a\nphenomenal woodworker, and he's going to be very\ndisappointed in definitely me and probably Coby. [MUSIC PLAYING] Is there a power button, or-- Maybe I go with a bench. I'm going to make a bench. The key is to be able\nto sit in it, right? That's the general concept. All right, I just\nwanted to clarify that. [MUSIC PLAYING] Cory's yet to do anything. He's just moving his wood. I'm going to cut something! [MUSIC PLAYING] This is majorly unsafe. That's hard to watch. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] It's going to-- [SCREAMS]. Are we allowed to film this? My first cut was\nnot a clean cut. [LAUGHTER] Guys, he's just standing\nthere looking at his saw. Meanwhile-- He's going backwards! Oh my-- What is happening? He's going backwards! [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey! First cut, Coby! [MUSIC PLAYING] Quick update-- it looks like\nCoby's trying to build a raft. [MUSIC PLAYING] We've got hammering. I don't know why\nwe're hammering. We've got screws. That's well on its\nway to being a chair. I'm almost sure of it. Perfect. Setting up perfect. I did realize that this\nis my last piece of wood. Four 2x4s goes by very quickly. All right, so the\nguys think this is all about looks and\nthe structural integrity. This is literally going to\nbe all about durability. I'm throwing them\noff the mezzanine. Best chair, most\ndurable wins the game. [MUSIC PLAYING] I mean, we are still on\npage one of the directions. [LAUGHTER] I have the chair in my\nhead, but executing on it is much harder than I\nthought it was going to be. Really struggling,\nI think I'm going to have to go the nail route. On what Earth is a nail better\nthan a screw in this world? I've been asked that,\nTy, the entire time. Well, the problem is look it\nCory putting in the drill bit. I think that's probably\npart of his issue. [LAUGHTER] Oh gosh. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ty's currently\nsitting in his chair. You're sitting in your chair? Ty. Hey. What's up, man? Me too. Hey, can I help you? This thing stinks. No, it doesn't. You just don't know\nwhat you're doing. Unreal. This is unbelievable. Oh, you tighten this part down. No, you just add power. You're on like 2%. There's a power? There's a power on the drill? Oh my goodness! That changes the game. I always knew he was Team Coby! That's my guy. I got to see what's\nhappening over here. What are we doing? Are we building a bench? We said scrap the chair? We're building a bench. So why is this piece way longer? I was going to go through\nthe four legs right here, but I realized\nthat's real wobbly. He's going to fall. And so this is coming\nout here, and I'm going to go leg down there. So you went with the\nthree-legged design? Yeah, a tripod. I can't wait to see it. Oh, this is so good. [MUSIC PLAYING] I could eat off this. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, light bulb! [MUSIC PLAYING] Cory's hammering a screw. Coby, if you get stuck,\nhammer the screw. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'll be honest. If you told me at the\nbeginning of the day that my chair would look\nthis good at the end, I'd have been thrilled. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh gosh, I almost died. 100 seconds left. [MUSIC PLAYING] What is he doing? I'm adding a foot rest. Gotta get this screw\nin and I'm done. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That's it! Drop the drills! We can let him\nhammer one more time. All right, you can\nhammer one more. [MUSIC PLAYING] Done! He's done it! [MUSIC PLAYING] Time's up. It's time to judge each\nchair individually. First up, we've got Garrett. There's not a wobbly\nleg on this sucker. Boy, did I start slow but, boy,\ndid I pull it together, huh? Anybody who just\ncomes off the street, they look at that, they\ngo, that's a chair. They will say that's a chair. This is nice. The cuts are exactly straight. I was way over there, but\nhey, Cor, where's your chair? [LAUGHTER] He's done it! He's done it! He's made a chair. Tornadoes frequent Texas often. This is a little\nsimulator test to see what would happen if your chair\ngot thrown up off of a two story balcony. 3, 2, 1. Should be fine. [CRASH] [LAUGHTER] [CRASH] [LAUGHTER] That one's done! Literally every piece is apart! All right, Coby. 3, 2, 1. [CRASH] Oh! [LAUGHTER] [CRASH] [LAUGHTER] The seat is totally fine! Dude, yes! All right, I'm up. See you later, chair. It was fun while it lasted. 3, 2, 1. [CRASH] Oh! Yeah! Not bad! [APPLAUSE] [CRASH] Not bad! Second place is\nguaranteed, baby! In 3, 2, 1. [THUD] Ooh! [SCREAMING] Winner! [THUD] Ooh! Winner! What a performance! Unbelievable! He's done it! Sit down! Sit down! Sit down! [CHEERING] Tyler is your winner! Thanks for hanging\nwith us on Get Crafty. See ya! Hey, who am I? [SAW SOUND EFFECT] [LAUGHTER] Coby using a saw. Next time, I personally think\nwe should go through tool safety before we start. I completely agree. I didn't know you didn't\nknow how to use a saw. Listen. Once I figured it\nout, it felt so right. Before that, it felt so wrong. Is it as bad, though, as\nCory hammering a screw? Probably not. You also don't know\nwhat a chair looks like. Coming up, we have a segment\nthat I have been looking forward to for quite some time. Anybody that knows me well knows\nthat I am a huge fan of magic. Raise your hand if\nyou're huge magic fan. Me too. Huge. It's fake. Everything's fake. You think it's fake? Yeah. What do you guys think this is? Matchbox. This is a matchbox. You want your mind blown? You think magic's fake? Let me show you a\nlittle something. [MUSIC PLAYING] Whoa! What! I know what you're thinking. That doesn't have matches in it. There's plenty of matches\nin there, big fellas. OK? Your fake box was\nbehind your hand. It fell out, and\nall of the things fell out in the\nmiddle of your trick. Can we see that in slo-mo? Play that in slo-mo. If you play it in\nslo-mo, and just people will be more impressed. Guys, I think you need to\nknow we have a real magician downstairs. And so I think that's\nwhere we're going to head. Let's head downstairs\nand get to Magic Time. With a real magician! [MUSIC PLAYING] Ladies and gentlemen, please\nput your hands together. An illusionist, a\nmagician, Harris III. I don't know if I have anything\nthat can top that actual intro. That was amazing. Why don't we do a little bit\nof audience participation right off the bat? Is that cool? Yeah. I might save you for the finale. Let's try something\nelse with you. How would you rate\nyour imagination on a scale of 1 to 10? Oh, I've got a really,\nreally good imagination. OK, I'll tell you what. I need you to choose a card,\na random card that you think no one else would think of. The jack of clubs. The jack of clubs. How crazy would it be if\nthe card that I turned over in this real deck of cards\nis the same one that you turned over in your mind. OK, I'm going to go\nthrough the entire deck just so you can see out\nof all of these cards, there is a single card\nturned upside down. No way! No! [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] The jack of clubs. No way! That's good. I don't get it! Well done! I don't think I've ever\ngotten a standing ovation after the very first trick. That was crazy. I love it! Let's try something. All right, Cory, come on up. Come on up. Good luck, Cory. Here's how the game works. I take the paper off. I wad it up into a\nlittle paper wad. Your job throughout the game\nis to guess which hand it's in. Take this, move it down\njust a little bit-- there we go-- so\nit's out of the way. All right, let the game begin. That feels impossible. Left again. Left. Dang it! Give it a little snap. Tap on my hand. Blow. It totally disappears. [LAUGHTER] We'll give it another shot. Here, take this. Roll this back up a little bit. He's trying to look\nat one hand even though I'm waving it around. He won't take his eye off of it. Don't take your eye off of it. [LAUGHTER] What do you think,\nright or left? Get worked, son. Get worked. You got this. Right. Right. Aw! Show me your left. Show me your left. Gone again. Big round of applause before\nyou go back to your seats. [APPLAUSE] Well done. Well done. I need to get one\nof you actually up here on stage this\ntime to help me out. OK. All right, Tyler, come on up. Come on up. Big round of applause for Tyler. Confirm for everyone\nat home there's no weird strings in the\nair or on the stage. OK? All right. All right, that's cool. Tyler, I need you\nto help me hang onto the corners\nof the tablecloth. I'm going to do the same thing\non this side with my hands. If the table moves, I just need\nyou to move with the table. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] His hand's not moving at all. I know you want to look. Have a good look. Lift up the tablecloth. Lift it up so you\ncan actually see. [SCREAMS] OK. All right, let go. Let go. Let go. [MUSIC PLAYING] No way! No way! [MUSIC PLAYING] What! Big round of applause for\nTyler, ladies and gentlemen. I have so many questions. You guys might officially be my\nfavorite audience of all time.

Coming up is the segment\nwhere people tend to clap, and hopefully I don't\nhave to own a cat. A segment that people think\nis great but we tend to hate. The game show we play but\nwe wish we could delay. Coming up, the game\nshow that we play but we wish we could delay. Why did you just say that again? I already said that. I just wanted it\nto come from me. People think it's great. It's the one that we hate. He tried to mooch his joke. From the middle. Let's go. Wheel Unfortunate. [MUSIC PLAYING] Chad, cue the serious music. And add a big like\nwhen that drops. Like there's a 50\npound weight there. Like Indiana Jones when he\ndoes the stamp in the library, and it's like ... Drop it again. You're going to feel\nthis one in your bones. [BOOM] What's the total\neveryone's spun. I'm just curious. I've only done it once. You've only done one? Yeah, I did the first one,\nI haven't done it since. First one ever, and never again? Yeah. Cor, pick Cody's name out. Pick his name. Pick a name right now. Just do it! Pick it! Get it over with!

Spin that wheel! I am Ned Forrester, the greatest\ngame show host of all time. Let's bring on our contestant. It's Cory Cotton again! [SCREAMS] So you\nmiss old Ned, and you want to come back on the show. Is that what it is? I'm pretty sure this is five. Five times. And you know what they say-- best friends of five stay alive. I think you know how this works. I don't need to explain\ntoo much about it. You know, I'd give you a Golden\nBoy, but you got five of them. So I went out of my\nway for you this time. The Golden Boy youngin' edition. You know, fun fact, I\nactually wasn't even flexing for this model shoot. I just stood there, and\nthat's what it looked like. So keep that. Enjoy it. Put it on your fridge\nor wherever you keep the rest of your Golden Boys. Hold the mic for me. Cue me in, big fella. 3, 2, 1. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right! OK! Send me to the wheel. Thank you. Go to the wheel now, Cor. I don't even have to\ntell you what to do. You say it for yourself. Spin that wheel. All right, spoken\nlike a true champion. Here he goes. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh! Ladies and gentlemen,\nthis is amazing! You're the de-haired guy. You got a stage of 50\nmillion people to influence. What are you going to tell\nthem right now in this moment? Special shout out to\nTeam Cory for hanging with me through the lows. Yeah, I thought it was going\nto be better than that. Say it with me, folks. That's unfortunate. Hey, Cor, see you next time. All right, let's give it\nup for Erica, who will be waxing Cory's pits today.

bear walls down y'all have a blessed day and i will see you in my next video", "aAnvCnaXJMY": "today we made a 400-pound unbreakable wall of candy and by today what I really mean is we spent the last five days melting four hundred pounds of sugar skittles and all types of candy we melted failed and pretty much wrecked my entire warehouse multiple times and once it was made it took a cargo van to move and was nearly impossible to stand up but if it's this hard to move it must be this hard to break so let's find out yeah I know it's beautiful right it's even got those little banana can't like the fruit snacks what are those called I don't know nobody knows what those are called but they know they're delicious or at least the bananas are delicious we got a ton of skittles as well there's literally skittles melted all the way through it as well and gumballs make my face is just sticky now and well it's good sticking to my shirt okay oh I got one on my shirt wait wait wait wait wait wait mmm tropical skittles you're not here to eat the wall you here to break it eating it is breaking it hear me Bob I just not at for long enough to know how to break now you do not maybe we should just break it candy reminds me of school school reminds me of football football there's there is powder on an on the ball right that's right they're not bad football's not even a weapon that's why Oh what dumb ball time oh you see all that exploded I just realized this is gonna be a big big time mess video my shirt says that I should get a new shirt you should new shirt new claws here we go oh this oh yeah see the thing you guys don't know is that look it looks Brown right but then when you scratch it it's green oh and when you scratch over here as a blue yeah we look at that okay so oh wait ah hmm the bananas are the best oh he's always fits my hands okay what we found out is that cats don't do well against candy balls we're gonna need something bigger you can go get that money I'm okay eatin skittles chocolate bat Naruto Naruto I said it right you said all right ah oh I said it right yeah yeah here we go oh she's like a there's gonna be a lot of candy desk no you sure still no so no don't know now usually around this time I say it Mallett time and it still is but this time it's candy mallet time oh yeah you might have a candy apple or two okay but I got a candy mallet how's it taste you knew I was gonna taste it I know you were yeah oh God Lucy's like yeah I think the rubber maybe involved see it holds up as a weapon that was like a blue a blue like you know yeah look at Oh ironic we squished a blue skittle with the blue hammer hmm it's not holding up very well it's not well if it's not gonna hold up very well we may as well really destroy it yeah it's really broken yeah it is oh my god it's uh it's broken it's very sticky it's picking up hair next candy weapon Oh next can you lift the others more okay here we go wait that that was made of candy no I wasn't but this is hilarious we got our Chronicles of Riddick sort of thing can they see the green yeah yeah yeah hello miss not bad oh not bad kind of sharp at the edges I probably shouldn't be a surfer like oh yeah assess the damage Oh [Music] doesn't really I'm not sure if the candy really adds to the whole damaging factor but this is doing something you shave like all the candy off the wall nice we're just making a bigger mess yeah we are Oh get more skills gum gum gum oh yes no not skill skill mmm I ate apples get off the ground you know what I got nothing to hide you said it pretty good oh yeah you guys would do the same top of axe axe without the handle yeah it's the best way to describe it oh there's candy everywhere there is don't eat that one ah no okay um damage report it's pretty good ah look at looking pretty good actually look at this dude the yellow layer underneath there Oh Grande the yellow layer okay it's like I'm hoping exactly like a drop right yeah oh we're at files things you look at the candy I am not allergic Andy but I'm but you should have just blessed me from that here we go Rafael's things [Music] this is really what you guys I understand is this thing weighs literally like 400 pounds and even though it looks like we're doing a lot of damage like this thick what do we do no no I'll get something remember when I said I was all out of candy weapons which I didn't actually say but you probably figured yeah well I wasn't look at this right oh it's really good it actually does not bad how's that McCool okay fine yeah sure I don't know oh okay like like burn trigger I'm gonna hit a green skittle oh where's the arrow and went behind you oh my god it's all the way over there land here and it's it's 40 feet from the wall but we're hit right here right here right there yeah I think that was a green skittle that was there I don't know but also take it as a victory good three good good no you're on my side yep next one next grab their time Oh do that again grab my time oh my goodness yeah Dustin well walls over there yeah but it's a grappler and I wanted to grab no case I mean grapple I know I'm fine I'll attack the boss yeah it's like the wall attack the wall oh not the best way guys are interested in taking down a candy wall if you don't use a grappler ah oh not tough now okay the wall is still pretty fabulous what a hit here yeah was here yeah this is all just surface damage huh it is we need if we need to do more thank you if I just have another but net okay now maybe not notice anything different about me Jeremy yeah I got some jewelry on yeah right some people rock big change the cater that's nice but are they functional no I know this one is oh my yeah again the whip all over again yeah this is a good new weapon it is it is you myth I don't know what the point of that was they were just kind of around so I thought why not kick oh I got this whoo twice the damage oh my god yo that was that was close that was close I wet and then it's bent and imagine that shattered yeah I know yeah yeah Wow why does that sound so like good right does it don't ya you guys knew this was coming Hey Oh super speed there's candy everywhere whatever even assess damage it oh yeah oh my got candy chef ah maybe I could just oh yeah that's a good one that's a good right yeah mm-hmm yeah rings good yeah pretty good damage I'm just gonna say this is our surface layer this is technically fruit ninja look now chop the banana five points Oh next weapon next weapon Park Oh be careful harpoon time it's time for the harpoon it's gonna be the best one yet three two one oh oh that's deep goodness another one another one another one good one see this red one right here I see you say goodbye to it three two one Oh direct it yeah what do you guys know about that harpoon accuracy honestly I don't think I'll ever use that because I like fish fish are friends not food Finding Nemo oh yeah yeah but to be honest I do eat fish I just don't some around the oceans I dig them myself take this away from me thank you looks like we're gonna have to take fruit ninja to the next level I got a samurai sword yes okay I know it's burned and it's bent and you guys are timing me testing get another samurai sword no yes that is fine look you look this looks like does it look like this looks like the door to like a Velociraptor cage if it was made of candy doesn't it it does it really does this side though looks like one of those well the whole thing actually kind of looks like one of those brownies you know the chocolate brownies that you get in your lunch yeah yeah I don't know what to do anymore you know to do what good idea here we go whoa whoa whoa whoa yeah I think it's a girl here we go you know I think you're healing yet nothing back together it's crackling oh my god it's literally fixing it well that's disappointing yeah but the flamethrowers always so fun yeah I know and tree lon musk made it oh that's a big deal it is it is next weapon skull claw yeah you guys see how it holds it like this now and not like this cuz it just cuts my knuckles oh oh whoa it's actually pretty good though when you actually like use it it's like multiple cuts ooh this is this is a dumb idea every time but these are always smart what are these call I don't know but Baraka from Mortal Kombat uses these songs it's pretty cool oh we got peace oh I see that ya gotta get on angle like this yeah Oh double double double chopping chopping chopping yeah we're like a third of the way through I wouldn't say that not even know Oh God fresh area to slice this I'm gonna lie I'm running out of ideas how to break this what if we just kind of stab this in the wall and then stop and think about our lives okay I'm with you yeah I'm done let's go get into the weapon yeah just uh Senor interrupts news programming to let you know that Joshua Ferrer from Puerto Rico my man you won the iPhone 11 make sure you check your email or I'm gonna have to maybe you know give it away to someone else so check your email you shot us you top I should move closer you should I should move closer and use the shovel shell but not just any shovel I don't know what it's called but it's a really sharp really heavy shovel oh my goodness stick a pinata it is like a pinata ooh be skinny okay oh it's like weak or along the edges they broke through the frames oopsie yeah oh so maybe we should just hack it along the edges all the way and tell us nothing good plan but that'll take forever I want like a boom you know oh yeah a boom yeah let's try to find a boom oh gee bad time let's get it this is way harder I don't know it's gonna break in one hit or not oh my god oh my goodness the aubergine bat is been broken once again I'm not that sad about it because I feel like the more that it breaks the more og it gets ah there's no need to show down there because with you missed yes because I because I missed I hit that time though I don't think you did I actually did out with the old bat and in with the new with her nice flex seal handle you guys like that right huh here we go the vibrations I need batting gloves oh yeah right there bro this was way too much and it's chipping everywhere okay I got a throat that really hurts oh my god this is literally like smoking up concrete wall look at my hand yeah wow this is so much stronger than I thought I know right it's like not even a joke love love strong they should make houses out of candy maybe really strong except for their debugged and what's a range and then this trick yeah that was not a good idea Bart if you want me to make an entire house out of candy maybe I'll do it oh you know I will you might want to watch out for this one oh we just cleaned that we we did axe time oh yeah next time or axe handle time axe head top of act actually might magic you put this on top of your football helmet and then you ran we're not gonna do my gun but we're not gonna that would be cool I know we're not gonna do that that'd break the wood I think it did huh I mean that's what actors do they chop wood but what about this axe what does this student nobody knows this probably like hunched trolls or something oh that's candy walls candy candy Wow bro this is super effective that's the one so eating candy yeah Cloudy with a Chance of candy Jeremy we're really getting somewhere we're getting somewhere I feel good about this I guess maybe cuz look doesn't do that much damage here I think it's just cause like you're breaking off things that have been like loosened you know yeah yeah yeah yeah there's actually my name Stephen see oh yeah it's blue they're always please turn the like button blue this took a long time please it's really hard to hit things because like it's just the debris just gets in your face oh oh yeah bananas this is this is a sticky mess yes Oh ready ready for this yeah I'm ready I'm ready oh say that's a pretty good shot thank you I got a crossbow nice but I'm really scared of it so I got a mask maybe you got a zoom lens oh yeah oh that was awesome it was another one another one oh this is the best you get no these should oh my look at this apparently the candy wall is much stronger than the crossbow arrow bolt bolt bolt not an arrow where do they even hit I'll say it's hard to tell in times of tough this walls been through a lot sneaking in a little piece yeah that's Robin next to a fan me oh oh not a good idea not a good idea we're gonna say PAC to put with this one Oh Junius Burt look at that tell me that's not a lot of damage tell me that's not a love that's a deep wound right there oh good yeah yeah we're going all the way this time hitting the exact same spot you sure yeah I'm not I'm gonna try okay good not even close not even close you're right that wasn't even close but this is I actually think the handle burned and broke off a big chunk off the side right here yeah yeah yeah this is the red zone we're in the red zone now running out of ideas fine oh just sitting here on my mace that's right I got a mace Oh Oh shadow time oh look at how cool this looks inside oh it's like a diamond mine look at all these diamonds and rubies and jewels the call quality this is this is all like oh oh my goodness you know looks like a mace only bigger and better and stronger what a bigger miss you have a bigger miss no no I have a bigger mass I have something similar oh why next sledgehammer okay oh my god let's just take you in for a second that I'm hitting a wall made out of candy with the sledgehammer and it's not breakable it's breaking but they should be shattering all in one hits but yeah I use amazing I gotta really try oh okay there's a big crater in this area it's a  lie of the feeling Hudson feeling I can see some other colors we still got to get to I'm really concerned but it's aw it's feeling real loosey goosey you know yes a lot of debris that could just easily fall a lot of bananas that can be grabbed this is you know what guys this is like come on we're going to the center of the earth here yeah just mining we're mining yeah this is my favorite area that we're mining mining get it my name you know what to use for mining oh I know what to use a vacuum I know this vacuums not doing that much but it's been a huge part of this video off caman well I just feel like maybe it should be should be on cam maybe it is a weapon it does damage and cleans the damage nice the greatest weapon ever but our next weapon is gonna require an even bigger cleanup oh it's time it's time definitely time you hear fruit put in make sure you help up this channel I tell you watch another one of our videos for us we'll move there to those videos and you guys know whether we're breaking the candy wall or not we always like glue our high notes 3m", "OEPQUjvwr7k": "this your last chance stand to the iPhone 11 giveaway just you guys know this is custom karo just dusted on here and open I'm gonna throw in a little bit later and now it's definitely you think they even want this oh yeah do you want it yeah I'm gonna put this in right here see that key straight from just destined that's gonna dirty the whole inside of the button you guys even want this anymore yeah they still on it all right you guys these things work down in the description there's a link you just click it you enter it just get yourself an iPhone speaking it down I'm gonna put this down so we can focus on the 100 layers of play-doh wall look at this see this already Wow that's been drying okay geez give me a minute now just in case you guys were wondering you know how does an how does this get built I maybe want to do one of this myself which you probably shouldn't do but you're going to BAM you get yourself some Crayola plasticine or play-doh what is this this is what I use modeling clay kind of like play-doh yeah it's play let's play dough same thing I think so it's not the same but okay it's not the same we tried play-doh it doesn't like it's not like as hard but like this this is what we got now only thing is to build a wall that's a hundred and fifty pounds yes I said a hundred and fifty pounds you're gonna need a lot more than than this and we went and bought a lot more than this we basically went to every store and cleared out every shelf taking everything so viewer in my city and you were looking to buy some play-doh this weekend we unpacked the packmaster together mix it thing slapped it on did the thing and then mash of ours took a nap and then like maybe like then cry myself to sleep because it was like two days long but now we're finally done whoa look at oh yeah impact it was like we don't have slow-mo cameras around here comment down below if I should buy a slow-mo camera that would be really useful for me it would be but those are really expensive I meant like yeah I should do it anyways yeah or not do it I meant down below if I should Jerry yep what's your favorite sport faster oh hey I guess football what would you say back football yeah football football is your favorite sport fine my favorite sports are actually not football what is it it's actually yeah I guess now it is okay basketball is it's basketball yeah I don't have a basketball so 100 it is I should get about now usually right about now I would try and play some tennis Oh but today's gonna be a little bit different we're gonna play sweet tennis you've ever played sweet tennis I have not you have not well let me teach you basically you got some throwing knives and you could throw them or you can play tennis with them um I'm a little worried meet you here we go it works this is the greatest game ever but Iraq Iraq Iraq it may not survive the whole time but it's working alright I miss but it's a good game oh the part of the game ah yes what where did where did the damage is that right there that's it I think that's it it went in but it didn't stay let's just buff that out okay Sooey tennis is fun but I just can't resist wait a second the ground I'll consider that a win it's a win it is a win what because the play-doh is like kind of like soft it like anything could get stuck it does even need to be sharp if it was sharp and the sharp end hit it may go all the way through oh forget it stuff you know this is art see this is a Rembrandt number five I got nothing I don't know yeah I'm gonna take this back of that hole and boom I'm looking for something bigger I never actually knew the names of these you guys probably commented it down below and I probably missed that sorry if you comment down below the names of these this time I'll google it and if I know I'll give you a heart but for now see this brush the camera now I'm gonna throw them what is that who's it okay been having a lot of interactions of bees lately a little paranoid let's throw these at the wall oh wow those are deep in there pretty deep those are deep so I'm not sure how we're actually gonna do damage to this because it's kind of like the rubber wall where you like you go in you take it away and like there's a hole but like now there's not we're gonna need something that like obliterates it obliterates it bring me the obliterator now personally if there's a weapon named the obliterator to me there'd be like this big lent rule sort of guy dragging it like this and he'd have a weapon like

Good bye.", "mncCR3wehF8": "we know we know you absolutely love challenges involving food and today we're offering you something you'll find even more appetizing 100 layers of food monica katie and tad are having a grand old time [Music] huh ted is the happiest of them all which is understandable as he's got a mountain of burgers monica just about inhaled her small serving that was fast though katie won't be outdone by anyone and she shows off her skills and quickly destroying food as well nice look hun [Music] ted wants to make this round as impressive as possible and starts to build a tower of burgers we've all dreamed that at least once now it's one thing to build something but another to make sure it won't come crashing down [Music] that didn't last long but the taste has not been affected thankfully [Music] oh wow seriously mentos and coca-cola we all know what comes from that particular combo [Music] filled with fear and with shaking hands ted opens his can of coke [Music] hmm well that was underwhelming [Music] you can all breathe a sigh of relief and ted can sip on his soda no problem [Music] all right now it's katie's turn and things are gonna heat up that's a much bigger bottle boom hope that was refreshing [Music] too bad just about nothing at all is left for katie to drink maybe if she rings out her clothes though last but not least in the slightest we've got monica this is going to be a massive explosion guys you might want to back away from the screens too just in case there she blows everyone was in the splash zone don't try this at home kids your parents won't be amused by the results oops we've got ice cream we've got a spoon but the two don't really match one another in size do they [Music] everyone in our trio has been served up such a pairing funny stuff monica gave her spoon a go but it just wasn't meant to be it's out of here and she's treating her treat like a finger food bit gross really [Music] but manners be damned the ice cream is gone [Music] everything ted's got is just right a medium-sized spoon for a medium-sized carton of ice cream what a mess ted katie that means you're up that giant bucket of ice cream is insanely huge and it's gonna take ages to eat it with a tiny spoon the other two drift off as they wait how much time has passed a day a week a year oh she's frozen solid what's with this measly serving [Music] ted isn't exactly living the dream either what and somehow katie's plate is totally empty how unfair right no one is particularly happy but monica knows that one skittle is better than none [Music] ted bit greedy aren't you got a showman all the same too [Music] now that was quite the trick he just pulled off [Music] things keep getting stranger [Music] what's with the umbrella huh i don't think rain was in the forecast well regular rain wasn't at least but a skittles downpour has already begun if only bad weather was always this sweet candy rain and ice cream blizzards that would be awesome yeah ted monica what's with the faces yeah a few candies went places that perhaps they shouldn't have but that's no biggie now it's time for our heroes to finally feast [Music] a kit kat do you love these crunchy candy bars as it goes the more chocolate you got the tastier it is monica is drunk with power with all those kitkats before her monika you need to take a chill pill right about now ted isn't going to put anything off he's going to dig in small as his portion may be that crunches music to the ears [Music] katie whoa go big or go home huh girl [Music] if that's how she likes to eat more power to her i see though it is a tad frightening for those of us watching [Music] all right now for the main event wow monica and her horde of candy bars oh would you look at this she knows just how she wants to come at it all quite an interesting recipe though to pull this off you need some specific superpowers like monica's got that's got to be a very sweet soup [Applause] [Music] eggs that's a far cry from the delicious chocolate bars from the last round you three big egg lovers by any chance what [Music] yeah no guess not katie you're the bravest start us off already a raw egg right in the mouth that is beyond disgusting ted won't be following her example he's got what he thinks is a genius idea i'll see hey man be a bit more careful would you [Music] and what's this going to be [Music] an egg smoothie [Music] it looks innocent enough but the taste is just horrible but who expected anything else oh no what um what's going on guys any clue [Music] i think this might be a special place for those who have already completed the egg round but what about monica [Music] there's no saying no my dear [Music] that was an epic fall right into the pool made just for her raw eggs are everywhere i wonder if she'll ever wash them all out of her hair and clothes [Music] not very nice to laugh at your friend oh i think all three of you may need a shower now [Music] oh no peppers things aren't getting any easier and for one lucky contestant this round is going to be crazy hot namely ted oh no we feel for you man but you knew what you signed up for with this challenge katie takes the tiniest nibble from her chili and feels the burn immediately [Music] monica picks up her peppers and takes a bite out of all three that was so brave [Music] wash it down with water now [Music] ted knows what awaits him and there is nothing he can do to change it do it man there's no turning back the only way to douse those flames is with a bucket of water thank goodness their dishes came with plenty we're dead once a minute or two hmm that's it one piece of gum ted's sitting a bit prettier to be sure but the big winner is miss monica by a long shot [Music] katie isn't going to wait around she pops her piece into her mouth what turns out she's not exactly a master blowing bubbles but ted thinks he can show everyone how it's done he's got lots of practice in this field but there's always a catch bubbles pop sooner or later to take your time and clean yourself up bud [Applause] monica isn't messing around at all no tricks or funny business she's simply shoving as much gum in her mouth as possible and now she's going to show up even ted's bubble he's got nothing on her this might be a world record someone called guinness [Music] still attached to her balloon monica starts floating upwards so long hon have a nice trip and hold on tight [Music] sweet little gummy bears hmm well gummy bear ooh now there's a whole lot more in that bowl not too shabby but when there's a virtual army that's even better katie wants to show off a bit with her one bear if you don't have much make it unforgettable ted loves to play with his food too his mother would just be appalled by his behavior but it is pretty entertaining girls don't be such sticks in the mud what's with the judgy faces monica is on cloud nine right about now would you be in her place she's really rubbing it in the other two spaces but her greed has really come back to bite her have you ever found yourself in this sticky situation who's got an idea on how to free up her hands from that

need during those times and made sure that they can supply it fortunately at 3:30 p.m. on April 24th and in the span of 22 hours Caden was finally found and he was located about half a mile away from his home he was totally spared away from any harm or injuries and for that they were all able to breathe with utmost relief with the joint efforts of the local authorities the fire department and the local volunteers in searching for Katie unbelievably they were not the ones that were hailed as the true heroes of the search operation it was chula his black and white Terrier that was with him all this time that he was missing the loyal dog had guarded his master and kept him safe until the rescuers could find his location Blanc County Sheriff's Office chief deputy Jeff French recalled how the brave dog growled at them when they approached Katie all through this cold night Chula never left Kate inside and they could tell how dedicated his furry friend was Kayden was cold when the rescuers found him and immediately wrapped him in jackets he was then taken to Blount Memorial Hospital and his family expressed their thankfulness to those who have taken part in the search the community of Blount County was admired to be seen by how dedicated the volunteers were through the effort and extensive help that they've put into the search staying up through sleepless nights skipping meals and other things these people were supposed to do just to help a community member in deep need no matter what each and every one of us has a purpose and hidden power to help those people in need or in any unfortunate situation be it neighbors co-workers the cops or even anyone everyone is capable of being a hero including animals just like chula did and even nature itself Caden and his trusted companion chula were finally out of the woods literally and figuratively they were rescued back to safety and are currently living peacefully in their own home with the help of the community that surrounds and cares for Kathy indeed faith in humanity is restored thank you for watching until the end subscribe to our channel for more unbelievable stories and check out one of the two videos on

see I you see nerds ropes so much when I was a little kid today we're gonna make a bigger version of it because I'm a big kid now so basically what it is it's a whole bunch of little nerds on a thin strip of taffy ish gummy like substance in the middle all right here are some basic ingredients need for this you need nerds lots of nerds some red vines a pot and some sugar noodles oh yeah now let's unbox this big nerd right here oh yeah look at that Oh what oh what oh man this is so disappointing is that what that's the only thing that came out of it oh my goodness that is such a disappointment anyways as soon as you unbox the Nerds all you gotta do is unravel it and put it into one little pot to make it easier for your day so at this point I was like is this enough nurse to fill the giant nerds rope we'll find out later in this video now get your quad put some Red Vine in it and start melting it this will serve as the coating for the sugar noodles you gotta be careful because if you don't watch the pot correctly it'll melt and burn the house down that's right it will cause a fire and then you'll be in trouble anyways after adding a little bit more Red Vine and melting it for another 10 minutes I think we are good to go from here all you want to do is just add the melted Red Vine into the sugar noodle all around just like that once you covered the whole sugar noodle with Red Vine you want to coat the whole thing with nerds the question is do I have enough nerds to cover at all and the answer is yes [Music] how does it taste it's good it's good alright everyone thank you all for watching hope you enjoyed today's of DIY junior trope and then yeah see you next time bye [Music]", "igQnJtS2tH0": "all right you guys before I get started with the video I just want to unbox something that I received from YouTube it's just insane to think that I got 100,000 subscribers and I received an award from YouTube I mean I'm at 400,000 now which is even more crazy which is like four times more Plex than this one that I have right now so here is the Box I'm not gonna show you the other side cuz that's my address I don't wanna get exposed just yet you should put it to the side and take it out of the box so as you can see here let me just grab it again [Music] a plaque from YouTube so let me go ahead and take it out of the box a nice new black box I don't think the other ones came with the black box but you know I don't watch that many plaque unboxing videos we put this box to the side and most of you know that I received this from Twitter I do post a lot of things on Twitter and snapchat so if you haven't already followed me on Twitter make sure to do that I'm not like 15k followers so if I get to 20k that'll be amazing so please follow me on Twitter and add me on snapchat if you want to get in contact with me I open up my snapchats pretty often so make sure to follow me on there and first thing we do when we open it is let me go ahead and so here it is right here you get a nice little letter I'm not gonna read it right now because obviously if you have watched unboxing videos from other youtubers of them opening their plaques that's what you receive so let me put the camera back so yeah let's go ahead and open up so here's the letter at the top and now alright I need to I need to show you guys this alrighty sorry for the lighting I'm in my closet if you haven't noticed so let me take this off let's get our first reaction oh my gosh that is so sick the new play button the hundred K plaque was changed a little bit from the old 100 k plaque because like I think the font is a little bit different so let's go ahead and show you guys again just how amazing this thing looks so let me go ahead and get a nice you can see the cameras down alright there is the 100 K plaque so let's go ahead and take it out of its wrapping here or whatever you call it let's just try to take it out I mean I it's kind of hard it's like stuck in here there it is the 100,000 subscriber plaque you can see my camera ooh so yeah the plaque is just amazing guys I cannot thank you guys enough for this crazy support looking at this plaque will just motivate me to keep going and letting me know that actually did something right and I got this award because without me not giving up on YouTube when my chin was dead I just kept going and kept going so that's a little motivation for you guys if you are not firing YouTube if you have 50 subscribers or something just keep going if you know what to do because some people don't know how to make videos but if you know what you're doing just keep going just spend that two hours of your day to grind out YouTube and that's what you get these crazy awards from YouTube so yeah this plaque is just amazing I'm probably gonna hang it on my wall right now so let's go ahead and start hanging on the wall so let me get I don't like closet cuz this is where the all right so I'm thinking of hanging this bad boy somewhere right here so let's go ahead and get so actually no right here it looks way better yeah let's please stop right there so let me go ahead and get some thumbtacks or whatever I can and I'll be right back all right well I couldn't find any thumbtacks or like something to put it onto the wall doman no I'm pretty cool hanging on my wall right here I'm the only one filming so I can't really get a film guy but I'm gonna put it right over here for now temporary and I don't have a setup yeah that's kind of weird since I have like 400,000 subscribers without a setup so my setup is literally this and me sitting on the floor or on my bed just recording so if you guys are saying I don't have a good setup so I can do YouTube well all I have is a laptop and I sit there with a microphone that I have so yeah if you didn't know what microphone or you were wondering what microphone I had I actually have a sort of the lights here it blue Yeti right here so it's gonna go right here a little bit it's with a pop filter as well just on top to make it sound a lot more crisp and this is where the box I'm gonna put everything actually back in the box let me put everything there any quick and it was actually written and signed by the CEO of YouTube which is like if you don't know what a CEO is basically like the main person of YouTube so that's pretty well not just YouTube like anything so it's pretty crazy let's put the box somewhere over here right below it and when I get my room fully like set up and stuff I will be showing you guys a setup tour and stuff like that so once again thank you guys for all the support help me helping me get this plaque right here I'm kind of antsy me so yeah let's go ahead and get started with the warheads video let's take the old things when your mother won back we're not gonna be able to [Music] and all right so we're in the booth we've got a crap ton of warheads that we purchased it seems like there would be more since the bag was a huge but once you fill it up here it's not really that much and they're all like glued together as you can see since they're really like warm because they were in a car for long I just want we got there's an actual Jolly Rancher in a bag of Tralee warheads so what we're doing basically is just opening it up and filling this up and we're gonna blend it together so let's keep going here hopefully the blender does not crap itself but I'm going strong here no one's helping me I'm doing it all myself saw matter takes some out because it's too much and I'm going to blend it and keep you just for eating purposes so I think that should be enough Gatorade check with Gatorade a little bit of ice make it a smoothie all right while I'm filling up the blender I think that should be enough all right let's get her correct all right I'm gonna get some ice as well come right this way you're going grab a little bit a little more [Music] all right get her cracking put the lid on its to combi [Music] voila here we go it looks like crap it legit looks nasty surprisingly actually blend it up pretty well let's take a shot all right I'm gonna add a little bit more ice it's a little liquid I sprayed fun with Jay King make it like a smoothie type Oh wake up we got baited there's floating warhead passed away recently all right that's good all right I'm gonna liquefy it right now alright there's more like a smoothie now gloating do it nope never or after drink it at the same time alright alright we're gonna drink it at the same exact time so if you don't go that's pretty good accident

can kill number ten hippy sippy the 60s were more experimental time that's probably the only explanation for how a product like hippy sippy ever made it onto shelves the sweet treat consisted of multicolored chocolate balls that were contained within a vial and to get to them you had to suck through the needle the similarities to drug use weren't accidental but were in fact the whole point of this candy it was designed to replicate hippy drug culture with the needle and syringe being associated with heroin use and the colored balls representing uppers and downers to make things even worse each hippie sippy came with a button that had slogans such as hippy sippy says I'll try anything and we sell happiness needless to say sense prevailed and the products were pulled from the shelves less than a year after being released making drug use feel fun to children clearly risks then moving on to harder candies later in life so this could have potentially been one of the most dangerous products to ever have been developed number 9 kinder eggs and Wonder balls the only way to Alcala could be made any better for kids as if it includes a plastic toy to play with once all the sugary goodness is gone and that's exactly what kinder eggs and Wonder balls tried to offer the kinder version is available around the world and each one contains a plastic egg that contains a collectible toy to assemble but for a long time they've been banned in the US it's all because of a law that was introduced in the 1930s that strictly prohibited non-nutritive objects from being embedded within any type of food the concern was that some people wouldn't be aware there's something in the treat that can't be eaten and it would therefore pose a serious choking hazard while this may seem like overzealous law making the concerns aren't completely unfounded in 2016 a three-year-old girl in France died after choking on a toy in a kinder egg and there have been a number of instances elsewhere where injuries have happened because of swallowing the plastic figurines despite repeated attempts to finally bring the candies to the US it looks as if the ban is here to stay number 8 toxic waste chew bar toxic waste candy has become popular recently because of its extreme sourness but there was one product that arranged a toxic waste nuclear sludge chew bar that was banned in 2011 it had been originally launched in 2007 but there were serious concerns about the ingredients that were used to make candy not as you might suspect in regards to how they made it so sour but more as a result of where and how they were produced the company's Factory was in Pakistan and following tests the FDA revealed that they had detected significant levels of lead within the chew bars to a level that could be potentially harmful to small children infants and pregnant women regulations require lead levels to be below 0.1 parts per million and the bars were found to have at least three times this limit candy dynamics the company that sells the toxic waste range of candies complied with the recall the bars were removed from stores and instead of reworking the recipe they gave up on that particular candy for good before we move on be sure to subscribe to top 5s with notifications on number 7 roadkill gummy candy there are countless different versions of gummy candy available in stores and in 2004 Kraft thought they had come up with an idea that would help them stand out among the rest roadkill themed gummy candies each one was in the shape of chickens squirrels and snakes with tire tracks on them but what was intended to be a tongue-in-cheek joke soon began to cause problems they ended production of the treats the following year after a series of campaigns by animal rights activists who claimed they trivialize the idea of injuring animals through fears that the product sent a message to children that was okay to harm animals Kraft was forced to relent and rethink their strategy number 6 Lucas Mexican candy candy from South America is one of the most in-demand products around the world but a company called Lucas began targeting their products at children and it was controversial from the beginning known as Lucas Mexican candy the powdered candy was sold in a shaker container that children would use to shake it into their mouths others was seen shaking the powder onto a table arranging it into a line and then sniffing it which immediately worried people about the similarity with drug use lucas claimed that this was the result of using the product wrong and then it was designed to be lightly sprinkled on fruit to make it taste better but they should have known that kids would find a less healthy way of consuming it the company's undoing in the end wasn't because they were teaching children how to partake in adult candy though but because of what their products contained tests showed that it had more than twice the allowed levels of lead and was so immediately banned by regulators number five Haribo sugarfree gummy bears Haribo is one of the world's most popular candy brands but despite making plenty of products that kids and grown-ups love they haven't always gotten things right in 2014 their sugarfree gummy bears gained attention because of some rather unfortunate side effects that were experienced by people who ate them in large quantities of the sugar used in normal recipes was like asana a substance that's almost as sweet as sugar but contains half the calories its main ingredient is mallet all which is a sugar alcohol but our bodies can't fully digest it and if it's present in high enough quantities it constructor ferment in the stomach because of this the Amazon reviews were rather detailed with some calling it napalm and saying that it caused intestinal distress and reminiscent of trumpets calling demons back to hell number four exploding gum candy companies are always coming up with new varieties of tried and tested favorites but there is such a thing as going too far a Ukrainian chemistry student learned this - his cost in 2009 after supercharging his bubble gum with tragic results he liked to increase the sour taste of his favorite brand so he would often dip it into citric acid before chewing on this occasion however he used the wrong powder and instead dipped it in explosives all it took was one chew and his gum exploded his jaw and most of the lower part of his face were blown clean off and died soon after needless to say this particular recipe for gum won't be making its way onto shelves anytime soon number three free candy you might think that the best kind of candy is free candy but in Madrid Spain the traditions of giving any sweet treats for free is actually been banned on the 5th of January each year towns across the country hold a Christmas parade called Kalighat de Deus which sees three wise men greeting children before handing out gifts the men are taken through the streets to a church in a carriage and part of the tradition involves throwing candy from the carriage into the crowds it has however led to a number of injuries as children scrambled to collect what they can and in 2013 a six-year-old boy and melago was killed when he went into the street to collect some candy and was hit by the carriage rules are now in place to prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again and children in the region will have to resort to getting their candy the same way as the rest of us by pestering their parents until they relent number two lollies pipe even though lolly pipes were never intended to be sold to children their availability in a wide range of flavours meant that it was inevitable that kids would get their hands on them and this posed a real problem made from candy these pipes were designed for smoking certain substances through and one of their marketing claims was that they were flame proof so could be used time and time again they became really popular with smokers but they were believed to encourage children to try out what they were designed for and this resulted in a significant increase in drug use by underaged people the pipe was banned from sale and every 7-eleven store in Indiana following complaints by parent groups and they are now very difficult to get ahold of in physical stores but those who really want one having to rely on purchasing them online [Music] number one candy cigarettes candy cigarettes first began to be sold in the late 1800s and were made from sugar gum or chocolate that was wrapped in a paper in a pack that resembled a box of cigarettes some varieties even included powdered sugar that you could blow through the candy stick to simulate smoke they began to be seen as a way to desensitize children to the idea of smoking however and for a time cigarette manufacturers even helped with the production of the candy and allowed their branding to be used on packets as medical organizations began to become more aware of the dangers of smoking these collaborations became less common and the products have now been banned in virtually every country around the world apart from the US and Canada studies have shown that a surprising percentage of smokers had candy cigarettes when they were younger compared to people who don't smoke so the link between the two has been proved to be significant what seems like an innocent children's treat is probably responsible for the most deaths of any candy ever and it's no surprise that very few places now allow them to be sold subscribe to top 5s for

make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast

day one nation out there you remember when me and my boy war yes me Royer still brothers we made a 100 layers of dental floss rope together this is gonna be a little bit of a taste of how strong it was oh yeah that her stands I'm sail how much dental floss I have to buy comment down below the craziest idea you could think of using dental floss and I'm gonna do a video on the best one let's take this wall down what is going on guess we're just gonna have to push harder what this makes zero sense how this literally it makes absolutely no sense now I never wanted to get to this I told myself I would never use this weapon for this wall leaves me no choice we're gonna have to use the scissors yes what that's it it's ready ready it's ready ah actually think of her artist again Oh family's is

is sponsored by Ray Khan in today's video we are back with our cotton candy machine to see if we can try something new cotton candy rope [Music] [Applause] and I think we've had a lot of people ask about this we've made a bunch of stuff with cotton candy done a bunch of experiments with cotton candy and we've also done a bunch of experiments making rope out of weird things and so since a while ago people started putting together like hey maybe they could make rope out of cotton candy I think we've hit like a critical mass if people ask me if we can make rope out of cotton candy so we're gonna try it we're gonna give this a shot we've got a lot of cotton candy supplies here so many we're just gonna use the normal cotton candy sugar nothing fancy nothing weird not throwing any different types of candies in here and we're just gonna try making you know the longest bits we can twisting it down into sort of a cord and then see if we can twist those cords into rope we'll see what it takes to actually get some kind of strength out of this I kind of want to try and see if I can not necessarily knit but I might try and like macrame a scarf for myself out of cotton candy this is gonna be real messy Oh studio is not gonna survive this [Music] were you feeling that your body had gone too long without cotton candy it was it was really it was starting to feel the cotton candy depletion it's curious if it's like a self-correcting problem eventually making his own cotton candy for us like a little ball our last cotton candy machine had been used for entirely too many things that were not cotton candy good yeah and it wasn't working very well so we got a new one Arthur hopefully it works better let's just start making cotton candy here we go no no turn on all the buttons this machine comes with a music button apparently doe a deer from The Sound of Music is perfect cotton candy making music yeah enough of that I refuse to make cotton candy Bob well then I'm just gonna make cotton candy and you can go ahead and refuse possibly want this ah I was dancing you threw off my groove you do off my groove but look at this big beautiful fluffy cotton candy that's not in horrible ropes well we wanted ropes but it was strings wonderful all right guys at this point we're gonna do the thing that we do so often time for a montage everyone knows a good montage needs some music and providing our music today rake on earbuds rake on earbuds started about half the price of any other premium wireless earbud the newest model the everyday e 25 earbuds are the best ones yet they provide up to six hours of play time seamless bluetooth pairing and even though the housing is smaller the base is stronger the newer smaller design gives a nice noise isolating fit and they come in a lot of fun colors these earbuds come with this nice small carrying case that can charge your earbuds four times on a single charge as you can see they are completely wireless there's no anything wrapping around my ear there's no stems hanging down there's nothing that was going around behind my neck it all just fits right on your ear I tried these out for awhile and I was very impressed I was using them for music I was using him to watch TV shows and I answered a phone call while I was using them and the person on the other end of the line I actually asked because I was testing them out and said like how is the sound he said he didn't even realize that I wasn't just holding the phone up to my head so apparently they worked pretty dang good for calls and I was able to hear him very well as well right now our subscribers can get 15% off their order by clicking the link in the description or by going to buy rake on Comm /tko are [Music] just get ya peace like that so it's perfect yes that's exactly what I need and that is exactly how long I needed it [Music] we can get three pieces this length I can macrame all right so a few things I'm observing is like go I am by no means a professional yarn maker when I was little I read a book from book series by Tamora Pierce called the circle of magic where people had magical gifts in everyday items and one of them was able to sort of weave magic into her weavings and her her yarn pulling there's a couple of other different parts of it in the song of the song the lioness I think anyways small Pierce made wonderful books people learned how to do everyday things a couple of people learned how to weave and how to do yarn making I made my own drop spindle and I never looked back so a couple of things I'm noticing from that experience is this stuff is coming out of the machine nearly pre carded what that means is when you get wool you have to have it cleaned and then it'll be you know kind of lumpy so you take two brushes very fine fine combed brushes and you brush you brush the fibers in whatever direction you need them to go so that they're all smooth and uniform that's almost what this looks like and that makes it very very easy for me to wind all of this together [Music] not adding small pieces of carded cotton candy as I go I'm just making big strands of it so kind of breaking all the rules but you know what I changed their mind no I'm not breaking any rule I might be the first human to ever attempt this these are my rules now [Music] grandmama it's me and stage [Music] we've got seven different cords here I'm gonna try twisting three of them into something of a rope Kelly's got her macrame thing she's gonna try and we're gonna see if any of them can hold together long enough to even be completed let's discuss the tensile strength real quick because it's falling apart very little I think we've now discussed it so nate is working on making one of the conventional ropes you normally see us make on this channel I'm gonna attempt macrame macrame is when you sort of weave together a bunch of strings or ropes or whatever and you get a pretty pattern now I want to explain why we're doing this by hand instead of using the Rope machine that's pretty basic this would all fall apart instantly if we tried to put it on the Rope machine so 100% so bad just so bad nate is winding things together I am time not after not after not if it works I like knowing that I do things that I'm pretty sure no one else in the world has ever done before here's the biggest difficulty normally when you're making your Opie want it to go really tight to hold itself together here's just a piece of this if we try and tighten it beyond right about there fibers are starting to break apart and it just tears right through so there's a real limit to how much you can twist this to tighten it down and that limit is not high I did it I'm not gonna cry not gonna cry but I made maxima cotton candy I didn't say it was good macrame cotton candy but guys I just wove cotton candy into every summer camps friendship bracelets that's ever existed and it broke fishing scale mm-hmm we're going to see how much weight we can put on our cotton candy rope before it breaks okay first a single strand ready [Music] we hit 15 ounces that's almost a pound it's a guppy we kind of caught a guppy almost one peso we might get up to like three pounds let's try the Macra man all right ready ready come on I saw two pounds eight ounces that's two and a half two and a half pounds two pounds this macrame cotton candy rope that's probably about two pounds more than I thought yay there we go three pounds three point that was three pounds 12 ounces oh that one only got to one pound 12 ounces so that was a weak point all right so in terms of strength we got up to three pounds 12 ounces that is three and three-quarters of a pound in terms of taste how would you rate this compared to say sisal rope or hemp rope or nylon rope no I'm not great sisal okay hemp rope I mean it gets stuck in your teeth I think this is probably your best go to snacking rope yeah oh my teeth that is how we end the video thanks again to recon for sponsoring this video to get 15% off your order click the link down in the description or go to buy rake on comm /tko are [Music] guys that's not all you know we've always got more 42c click the box of the top to check our most recent video and we'll see in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "JTRjPpe6Qk4": "this is the one underlayer challenge versus my wife Breanna this is

I'm gonna show you it later in the video but you got to stick around but I've got a big spoiler for one of Rihanna's videos that's coming up so you're not gonna want to miss it okay one shirt I'm so

well we are going to resell these so hopefully you guys like him okay I smell like I showered this morning I went to the gym but I showered after put on cologne and deodorant so I should smell really

I've cut off my circulation in my arms I feel like I can't why should we go bigger size this is you know pressing technically there's no rules about how many pieces of clothing so you could put on 10 sunglasses after this can you wrap me send me two Unspeakables house his address is he ordered a hundred shirts and he said I'm only ordering these if Preston delivers them all why did he order a hundred shirts anyways [Music] 25 min and I feel like dying I'm gonna be completely honest with you I have experienced childbirth and this is much worse for you counted wrong this is 25 8 I need you

foundation oh that's my purse and why standing on a box because we're actually not doing the 100 layers challenge of nails this is the 100 layers challenge of duct tape Nick is going to take me to this wall and then once we have the hundred layers of duct tape on he's gonna kick the bucket off hopefully I don't fall that's the goal we're trying to hang with the duct tape it's actually really

that's a hardcore spray my hair is gonna break off this 20 we're feeling it oh it looks really good actually yeah yeah I think all the fumes are getting to my brain so I think that we should be done we're only 1/5 of the way there 80 more layers to go okay Bree how you feeling I'm at a loss for words I don't know what's going on behind me or in front of me or what I'm seeing there's smoke

happy we're gonna get pizza no no I hate the dark", "QBSrdw19k8M": "[Music] candymakers start by cooking up a big batch of sugar water and corn syrup next they prepare a mix of starch and flavoring like peppermint or strawberry as they blend together the flavoring binds to the starch the flavoring mix is emptied into the middle of a syrupy slab then the whole thing is fed into a machine that folds the batch repeatedly using shovels and a plunger this distributes the flavoring evenly [Music] now it's over to the automated pullers these puller stretch the mixture around a metal post this action aerates the candy turning it white this batch will make 3200 candy canes but there's still a lot more work to be done the candy is rolled into a fat log while heaters warm it until it's pliable enough to shape [Music] next strips of red coloured candy are rolled out a worker stretches and folds it to widen the strip [Music] two of the red strips are arranged on either side of the white candy it weighs a hundred pounds so it takes two workers to transfer it to the next machine it's called a batch roller and it's cylinders roll the candy thinner and thinner dramatically reducing the logs diameter until it reaches candy cane dimensions a torch moves across the candy to keep it pliable then the sugary batch travels between wheels that slim it down even more the rope of candy moves forward in a wave-like fashion this gives it some slack so it doesn't stretch as it moves through the next set of wheels the candy rope moves through two angled belts that twist it and a chain of knives cut the twisted rope to candy cane size this production has been perfectly choreographed one misstep and the job would hit a snarl [Music] you", "dMEzptxS9zE": "three two one go and it's under

cooking up a big batch of sugar water and corn syrup next they prepare a mix of starch and flavoring like peppermint or strawberry as they blend together the flavoring binds to the starch the flavoring mix is emptied into the middle of a syrupy slab then the whole thing is fed into a machine that folds the batch repeatedly using shovels and a plunger this distributes the flavoring evenly [Music] now it's over to the automated pullers these pullers stretch the mixture around a metal post this action aerates the candy turning it white this batch will make 3200 candy canes but there's still a lot more work to be done the candy is rolled into a fat log while heaters warm it until it's pliable enough to shape [Music] next strips of red colored candy are rolled out a worker stretches and folds it to widen the strip [Music] two of the red strips are arranged on either side of the white candy it weighs a hundred pounds so it takes two workers to transfer it to the next machine it's called a batch roller and it's cylinders roll the candy thinner and thinner dramatically reducing the logs diameter until it reaches candy cane dimensions a torch moves across the candy to keep it pliable then the sugary batch travels between wheels that slim it down even more the rope of candy moves forward in a wave-like fashion this gives it some slack so it doesn't stretch as it moves through the next set of wheels the candy rope moves through two angled belts that twist it and a chain of knives cut the twisted rope to candy cane size this production has been perfectly choreographed one misstep and the job would hit a snarl [Music] you", "sC_2erJy3u8": "what's up YouTube so last night I was watching some YouTube and I was watching David parody hey dude this shirts for you and I was watching this video where he stacks up 100k to one deep feeling so I'm just like I want to try it out so this video is needed to you David today I'm gonna stack hundred players go go go go so here's the game plan I have a whole bunch of like uh buh buh buh buh buh buh and then I have here a blowtorch what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use the blowtorch to melt the top layer so I don't you think it looks like a staff but keep going there's currently like 24 right now the only difficulty right now is how do I get this like balanced or I can just lay it long ways from there I ask you [Music] [Music] all right that is what happens when you put 112 hubbub of a bubblegum stacked together huge man like you're gonna like hold it from both and you're trying to do this without it collapsing oh man collapse right there anyways this is one here hello all right so unfortunately when I try to pick it up it all broke so I'm just gonna you know put it all together on the floor 112 layers of a public thank you check that out you don't get it Wow oh my gosh check that now let's get to it bubble gum bubble bubble bubble gum this is the bubble gum bubble bubble bubble gum this is the bubble gum son I got layers and layers of these pink bubble gum I really like it because it makes me go yeah yeah I gotta be careful cause if I accidentally swallow it it's gonna be my tummy for years and I regret it and I know I won't believe it can't believe that I achieved it and I have to go to the doctor and then surgically believe it cuz I know it's bad but Islamic is fine I know my

"what's good bass draw militia bass draw keys here i'm your friendly neighborhood negro and welcome to another episode of good eats in today's video guys we got a highly requested video for you today we're going to do our own homemade nerd ropes and you know that they're goodies for 20 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do [Music] way all right guys and real quickly here i do want to invite everybody please check out our membership program that we just started here on the channel it really does help with making all these videos also if you're interested

videos so guys please if you can support us right here on the on the youtube membership program or on patreon now let's go ahead and get into this video here we go all right guys so let's go ahead and get into today's video today we're going to be doing our own homemade nerve ropes this video has been highly requested for quite some time so we're going to go ahead and make it happen today now there is an easy way to do it and there's a hard way to do it of course i'm going to show you the easy way to do it today if you guys want the like the harder way maybe we can do that at a later time but today i'm going to show you the easiest way to make your homemade nerd ropes so the first thing that we got to do is i'm going to show you what we need we're going to be using some is it haribo i don't know is it haribo hariba let's go haribo we're going to use haribo um gold bears this is what i was saying about the easy way and the hard way these are ways just to take these bears right here we're going to melt them down in the microwave that's the easiest way the hard way would be the harder way i was ashamed to be to go ahead and make our own gelatin just like you would do when we're making our gummy bears you can go and make your gelatin that way as well and do it but we're going to go ahead and just melt these down and do it the easy way and of course with nerd ropes you're going to need some nerds so i went to the store and i got some nerds so as you can see right here i have a baking sheet on the baking sheet i have some parchment paper what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take some aluminum foil and what we're gonna do is we're gonna actually make kind of like you can call it like a mold and that way we able to we'll be able to distribute our nerds and make our our nerd ropes the way that we want to make them all right but first what we got to do is we have to take some aluminum foil and we're actually going to make our mold you can say so that way we'll be able to distribute our nerds evenly let me show you what i mean you're going to take some aluminum foil we're going to make kind of like an accordion shape let me show you all right so you can see we have a piece of aluminum foil and we're going to do an accordion shape what i mean by that is you're going to hold it like this you're going to fold it like this and then we're going to [Music] hold it back like this we'll do that back and forth all right so you see we folded it back and forth now we just want to open it all right so that way you can you guys can see what i've done i've just made you can basically say like a w or m whatever that way we have places where we can actually put our nerds right we can put our nerds in here are you guys getting a good picture this way i don't think so let me raise up the camera and get a better angle for you guys but i don't think you're getting a good a good angle let me raise you guys up some there we go i think i made this a little bit too long i do believe i can fix that though there we go so i made him too long but i fixed that just by tearing off so now you can guys can see better what i'm talking about so what i'm proposing to do is [Music] now you see we have peaks and valleys in the valleys we're going to actually form our nerd ropes you see what i'm saying so what we're going to do is we're going to pour our nerve ropes in here right for the bottom layer and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these bears inside of this measuring cup and melt them down in the microwave at that point that's where we're going to medicate it now as far as how to medicate this you can use tincture you can use coconut oil it's up to you we're going to use some coconut oil today but if you got some tincture use that and as far as how much you want to use it's really based upon how strong do you want it i'm going to use two or three tablespoons of coconut oil for this but it's really up to you about how much do you want to medicate it if you're talking about how much thc you're putting in it that you know it just depends on how strong did you make your oil how strong did you make your tincture and then from that you can go ahead and you know put it in accordingly so let's go ahead and do the first part of this which is putting the nerds in here i'm gonna take a box open them i'm gonna start putting them in here i got seven boxes so hopefully that's enough [Music] if it's not oh no [Music] oh nerds all right [Music] and i said i'm going to try something on this last one what i want to do is i really want to take some spray and like spray it in here [Music] because as you can see i did these without any spray right here and so i'm wondering how how they're gonna be as far as sticking to the aluminum foil in the past when i've used things with aluminum foil and it's sticking it's been really hard to come off i'm just really trying to make sure they got an even coat so let me do that coconut oil cooking spray and i'm just going to [Music] and that's going to be our test to see if we should have sprayed it i just thought about it right now all right so look take some more of these nerds put them in here all right so we're pretty good on that i have four rows ready to do four ropes i bought a lot of nerds so i can now always do more batches so now what we got to do is we're going to take our bears right here we're going to put them in this measuring cup pyrex measuring cup put it in the microwave we're going to melt them down and then that's when we're going to take and our fused oil and medicate this up obviously if you don't want to medicate it just don't use the oil don't use any tincture if you want to make fantastic nerd ropes just like this that'll be just fine so yeah here we go all right so there's two cups in this bag we're going to use one cup right now like i said i'm doing this in batches so that way everything will work out the way we want it to so i'm going to take a cup of these gummy bears there's two cups in the bag we're going to take half of this and let's go ahead and put this in the microwave and melt this down and i'll show you what it looks like when it's finished this is two and a half minutes in the microwave and so you can see it's melted down now look at that so we're gonna do now that just melts it down we're going to take our coconut oil you can use tincture if you have tincture and like i said depends on how strong you want it i'm gonna do two tablespoons you know what i really you know what three tablespoons why not three tablespoons in there we're going to stir it up make sure you stir it up nice we're going to put this back in the microwave so we can warm this back up and keep it liquid once that happens and we take it out i'm going to put it in this squeeze bottle to make it easier to do the lines for the nerd ropes there's a lot of ways that you can do i've seen people pouring it cutting bags and that kind of stuff i think the easiest way to do is going to be with a one dollar squeeze bottle that you can get from the dollar store if you need a link for this i will put it in the description for you but yeah back in the microwave we go all right guys so we're out of the microwave now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna take this and i'll pour it inside of here to make it easier [Music] so now we got this in here let's go ahead and do some lines that doesn't sound right let's put some lines in here so we can go ahead and medicate this go slow all right guys that's pretty hot so i'm going to use my magical butter glove in order to do it [Music] there we go very nice [Music] and this is going to be the easiest way for you to do it so you can control what you're doing what i like to do is just go down one time up one time and that'll be good enough [Music] it's like the easiest way to control what you're doing you can put exact strings in there perfect look at that look at that beautiful that's the way to do it without any of the waste and what's so great about it is in this squeeze bottle if it goes down in temperature all you got to do is warm it up a little bit and you can continue to do what you're doing all right guys so now that we got that done before this dries up let's go ahead and put some nerves back on the top of this [Music] all right guys so now you can see that we have everything covered there we go so now we have our [Music] gumby mixture in between the nerds and now all we got to do is just let them sit all right guys so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put these in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then i'm going to take them out and take them off the take them out of the mold here and show you what they look like so yeah give me 30 minutes we're going to put them in the refrigerator and we'll be back in 30 minutes all right guys so it's been 30 minutes inside the refrigerator all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to attempt to peel these off see if they're set [Music] look at that it doesn't matter about if all the uh excess nerds fall on the tray that's why we put the parchment paper down look at that yeah i told you guys this is the easiest way to do it nero nero all right so these have been coming off pretty easy here doing it the way that i did it these are the ones by the way these are the ones that we didn't put the the spray down this one right here is the one that we did this right here is with no spray nerd rope nerd bro all right now this one is the one with the uh with the sprite and they came look the one with the spray came right off so i would say guys you might want to use this break because the one with the spray came right off look at that [Music] alright guys so i hope that you found this

like that is coming right through from my insides to my outsides so maybe I'll still explode in today's video we're gonna see what we can do with about 10 pounds of fizzing popping candy [Music] alright guys ever since we started putting strange things into our cotton candy machine we've had people requesting pop rocks so today we're gonna try this out but we figured while we're doing stuff with pop rocks we might as well try out several different things so here's the basic idea we've had plenty of requests of things to try doing with pop rocks well we got our hands on a bunch of these in a couple different brands and we're gonna try out everything you requested this is like the biggest pack of pop rocks I could find on Amazon it actually came with a few more that turned into gum but I am 100% positive that nothing with gum in it is going to work in the cotton candy machine so we've got these set off to the side and so we're gonna try some things with the pop rocks but I wanted like a lot of pop rocks and I mean this is a good number but every single one of these is one third of an ounce and so you know it takes three of these to make one ounce to take 16 ounces to make a pound so we're gonna get like maybe two pounds out of this and we've wanted more than that so I went ahead and did some research and I found another company that makes this carbonated candy this right here is carbonated crystals made by the company pop in fun I believe this is the only manufacturer of this type of candy in the United States and they sell for pound bags so a lot more crystal for your buck you don't have to get these tiny little packets instead we've got big old packs and we've got them in navy blue and red in case anyone is unfamiliar with pop rocks carbonated candy in general it's a small sugar crystal and the main ingredients are sugar and lactose and the way they're produced involves introducing carbon dioxide into the candy at extremely high pressures and the carbonation actually gets stucked inside the sugar crystals and when you eat them and they dissolve the carbonation escapes and you get fun popping sensation and sounds and that one actually just popped out of my hand I guess moisture in the air and the moisture on my hand was enough to I was fascinating we're gonna play around with that a bit these became popular in the 1970s as a fun little candy and then they became somewhat less popular as a rumor spread that a child actor from popular commercial had died after eating a pack of these and then drinking some coca-cola and and the rumors that his stomach had expanded and popped and he had died in the hospital or something like that complete nonsense he was fine but I think we'll play around with that rumor as well so the first thing that we were gonna try is putting pop rocks in our cotton candy machine if you've watched all of our cotton candy machine videos so far I have a time to explain that to work you really have to have candy that has mainly two ingredients sugar and corn syrup real quick before we try and make this cotton candy let's go talk to Callie who is currently testing out a product for the sponsor of today's video all right Callie explain the product you're using from our sponsor today Nate I am using the footmouse this thing is revolutionary for video games let me just pause real quick there so it actually allows you to play with your entire body so you're playing both of your hands and now with your feet too so how do you feel that the foot Mouse is impacting your game so far oh my gosh my

oh yeah you got this alright okay pop rocks we're gonna try grape I'm just gonna pour this whole packet in that scared me I missed with a bunch of them I hear the popping actually getting something oh and now I'm also seeing smoke a little bit of smoke just coming out of there which does happen with non pop rocks so I'm not saying that's just because it's pop rocks see if this is grape flavored there is like leftover cotton candy sugar in there hard to tell all right I'm gonna go green apple that's a more distinct flavor I think it'll be easier to separate from the other ones and the color should be more obvious to the taste for what these are like that's green apple hey we're getting cotton we're getting quite a bit of something thrown on to the sides and it's green so we know that something is not getting processed super well all right green fluff it's got the green apple flavor I taste a little bit burned and unfortunately there is absolutely zero sensation of popping it just so happens that one of the flavors of pop rocks is cotton candy flavor so I think it's only fair that we try making cotton candy out of cotton candy pop rocks so you can actually hear it like all the carbon dioxide I believe starts just escaping as soon as the pop rocks start melting down and so it's all gone by the time it gets into the cotton threads well that won't produce way less than the green cotton candy flavor is not good for making cotton candy look out a little bit is just tastes like chemicals so does pop rocks turn into cotton candy yeah technically a little bit it works way worse than just white sugar not even cotton candy sugars regular sugar I've had better results with skills better results with Jolly Ranchers lifesavers work really well pretty much every variety of lifesavers I've tried works great I do want to try the pop and fun brands and see how those turn out I haven't even opened these yet so let's see what these are like four pounds at a time they also sell like a 30 pound bag mostly they aren't sold for like individual consumption like this they're sold as like ingredients you can put these into other things like chocolate and ice cream and we may even try a little bit of that layers Wow they weren't kidding when they said like navy blue and it's not quite Navy but that looks like aquarium rocks wow that's way more energetic too I think because we got like the larger crystals [Music] she'll just kind of taste like slightly burnt sugar there's no flavor added into this so it kind of makes sense but less chemically and I think that's like because we aren't burning the artificial flavors that are added to the other ones and we did get more fluff still absolutely no pop rock sensation in the cotton candy itself so well we got slightly better cotton candy sugar out of it still wouldn't recommend it because you are not getting as much yield as real cotton candy sugar you're leaving residue from probably the lactose to be burned inside the oven and yeah they're spraying a ton out on the sides here so yes it is working it's just not working very well all right well we currently have more popping candy than I have ever seen in one place so I think we got to do some experiments first I'm gonna get these out of whose bags I mean a bulb I genuinely thought this bowl was gonna be big enough but I we actually still have like a cup and a half of the blue and half a cup of the red in the pouches but uh you know we'll get around to using things that's so much carbonated candy the famous fable is eating a pack of pop rocks and then drinking coke your stomach exploding to test the plausibility we're first gonna take a bottle of coke here I figure the bottle is a little bit more appropriate for the 1970s and get one of our retro style packs original flavor I'm just gonna pour it into the bottle of coke and see how much of reaction we get hopefully it stays contained within this bowl which I am now going to move farther away from our large bowl of uncovered pop rocks original flavor pop rocks is getting poured into a bottle of coke we'll see how many oh there we go a lot of those pop rocks got pushed right out by the floating coke and now you can hear them it's actually kind of what it just sounds like in your head when you're eating them you just hear and feel the popping go through your whole head it foamed a lot I wouldn't call that a dangerous level I am actually going to try eating the pop rocks and drinking some coke see what it does so the hard part to me is like how fast can you eat pop rocks without like chewing them up and like to get them down into your stomach I'm confused on that maybe you're supposed to like put him in your mouth and then swallow the coke to chase it but I feel like you're just foam up in your mouth the goal is to have it happen in your stomach and not swallow that quickly all right that's as much as I can swallow up quick [Music] so far I burped like once it was really nothing interesting so I'm gonna try putting it my mouth and chugging the coke after it [Music] I can hear me I can hear it bubbling and reacting inside my belly that's bubbling around in my stomach like I can hear it bubbling a lot and popping and crackling like that is coming right through from my insides to my outsides so maybe I'll still explode maybe it's still coming I'm gonna take pack of pop rocks and pour them into this balloon now I'm gonna take a little balloon with an entire pack of pop rocks in it put that over the coke there now all of them made it in there you go you can see it see just how much we actually get out of this so far it's not how much we're just gonna set this off to the side let it do its thing react how fast and slow wants to react we've got more experiments to try when I put some of the pop rocks just in my hand some of them started just popping right away so I want to just try taking some pop rocks and putting them on a plate with like a little bit of water to see how like excited and jumpy they get a lot of pop oh jeez some of those really went flying little ones not all of them but some of them went fly oh wow it shot me I would actually flew off and hit be hard enough to be like it didn't really hurt but it wasn't comfortable let's try this again I'm using the popping fun brand I've actually run it through a sieve to get rid of some of the smaller ones we're gonna see if we get you even more energetic response with just bigger crystals here [Laughter] they're exploding out of there I am now covered in pop rocks the camera and cameraman are covered in pop rock like it's just like stuck to my hand from being nearby I had my phone there as a flashlight to give extra light and it's just like coded everything it's probably on my face even like I am just decorated it's such a fast reaction that's so fun all right so this cup of water is basically at boiling temperature we're just gonna pour a whole packet in see what does it just like started reacting instantly all right we are gonna try and make some ice cream we've done this before we're gonna be using milk cream sugar flavoring and liquid nitrogen to make our ice cream and I don't want to put the pop rocks in early because I think that the liquid in the milk and cream will start dissolving them so I'm gonna get it going until it's almost ready and then add the pop rocks a little more liquid nitrogen and keep it going to get it all the way frozen I think that's gonna give us our best chance of not having it just pop everywhere so we're gonna get some of these red unflavored ones I think the color is a good look obviously some reactions happening you can see it going oh that's exciting being attacked all right it's ice cream and it has the carbonated crystals and pop rocks in it I just don't know if you can actually like get the sensation as you eat it so here goes [Music] yep yeah it definitely does can't have to let the ice cream melt away on your tongue though but once you do like the pop rocks are still in your mouth well I really enjoyed the result of pouring really hot water onto the pop rocks and pop rocks on those really hot water and I want to scale that up but I do not dare do it inside so I'm gonna take this outside hey look here's how much our balloon got not a ton and then I'm gonna pour like a gallon of boiling water over all of it and just see what kind of mayhem we get I'm gonna be so covered nearly nearly it was boiling as I took it off the stove that was only like a min and a half ago so it's still extremely hot and I'm just gonna pour it right on this is gonna go everywhere ready three two one [Music] didn't actually spray as much as I thought it would it's obviously reacting a lot but it sprays the most in really shallow areas so it did spray and I am covered working my legs just it actually just keep going that's how covered I got just from it spraying out this is a lot of fun the boiling water thing was unexpected to me I think it was actually maybe more entertaining in the small-scale but it's still a cool in the large-scale very fun to try these things out I highly recommend the carbonated crystals in ice cream if you ever make ice cream you can check out the larger batches that we got that's from popping fun calm you get the four pound bags or I think they also have like a 30 pound bag if you

This is Troy and his coach is\ncoming off a couple losses. - [Man] Bruh! - And this is Payton\nand his coach is Marcus. One of their body parts\nmust cross this line for it to count as a swing. If they don't, we have a ref. (squealing) If they don't cross it, they're not out, but what'll determine if\nthey're making an effort. - I'm very distressed. (smooth hip-hop music) - Give you a dollar to get out. You guys could split it, 50 cents. - Yoink! - Good thing I have another dollar. - I'll give you two if you stay. (energetic funky music) - We're gonna prank our cameraman. Hit three! (air horn) (laughing) - That was scary. I can't hear now. - We're doing the first challenge! Stay behind that bag of chips. Here's a marshmallow. If you land it in his mouth, you get to push him for a minute. - [Chandler] What is that? (buzzer)\n- Oh! (groaning)\n- What is what? What is what? Yeah, yeah, come on! - [Angry Man] Boy, if you don't get-- (buzzer)\n- Wait-- - Wow! This is where everyone else was. Since you're Chandler, you can go up here. - Ooh!

(ding)\n(shouting) Let's go! - Now that he's pushing you, is it easier? - Tons easier. - I wanna make sure I'm very clear, you guys cannot touch the contestants or the red lights will\nbe forced to come on. - Oh, oh!\n- Look at this, I'm not touching him! Ooh, look at me! - Oh hey, look at that, Troy, Marcus, can't touch him. - [Uneasy Man] No, no, no-- - Did he get you? Did he get you? - Yeah, he got me. - Troy touched Chris. Let me show you what happens if a contestant touches one of you. (ripping) - Oh my--\n- Oh my God! - [Chris] There is no way! - See how Nick is suffering? This is why you guys shouldn't touch them. I don't know if you're out there, if they swing and just touch\nyou with their toenail. - Like that? - But did you? - Yes! - Jake just got touched! Hey, I won't move yours as far. We'll put his right here. And I think it's time to move his back. There we go, now he's back to normal. - Troy, we don't wanna\njust pick on you, so-- (air horn) \u266a Oh my God \u266a (air horn) (laughing) - Yo!\n(claps) (smooth hip-hop music) - You can't go too deep,\nI'm telling you now, bro, it's going on two days. - [Cameraman] You know you're saying that you have to win now. - No one's gonna last more\nthan a day after, like-- - [Cameraman] Interesting. - I'm gonna win in a day. - You have to run through\nthem without getting touched. We're gonna use the smoke to\nmake it harder for them to see. Hut, hut, hike, go! (aggressive rock music) - [Blunt Man] Nope! (shouting)\n- Was it? Jake, you got touched! - Yeah, Frankie! (growling) - Hut, hut, hike! Give him more! Give him-- He got him! Chandler, are you ready? - Hey, no! - Hike! - Ow, fumble! (beep) - To hike 2.0. - Ooh! - He hurt to himself. So, the punishment is you have to lay under your contestant for five minutes. - I feel like my ding dong's\ngonna get kicked any second. - Oh, this kinda nice, actually. - You know what? - I'm a great motivator. - So now that you guys are\nall laying on the ground, this leads perfectly\ninto our next segment. Chris, I need you hold this\nand let your guy punt it. - All right. - Distance.\n(thunks) (ding) - Whoa!\n- It's good! (ding)\n(shouting) - Shut up, I need your help, dude. (ding) - It's good!

Plop the Unicorn of Wealth right here. We have some Beats, rip off of AirPods, AirPods, we have an iPad, a speaker, and an Alienware laptop here for the next person that gets up. The laptop's worth two grand. I know you wanna get out\nnow, go ahead and grab it. - No, I am stayin'. - [Jimmy] Okay. - Not that there.\n- Not that? - Not that. - [Jimmy] Oh, not, Marcus! He just said not that, but he said something bigger. You might wanna have to\ngo have a talk with him. You wanna be the first one\nout two times in a row? - It's not happening. - There's a lot of good stuff in there. - Oh no, not interested at all. - [Jimmy] Mr. Nick, I can tell. - Guy ain't even a PC gamer. He don't want that-- - [Jimmy] Nick, go grab it. - It's nice, but can't take it. (smooth hip-hop music) - [Jimmy] What'd you just say? I know, Aardman, who's\ngonna get out first. Is that what this is right now? - I'm doing a business\ndeal, and we're gone. - [Jimmy] A business deal and you're gone? - A business deal and we're gone. - [Jimmy] You, what? Now, here's my question. Are you gonna beat him to\nthe punch and get off first? - I'm already on the ground. - [Jimmy] You're already-- (laughing) So you're sayin' you're ready to go. - The way these legs hurting right now-- - [Cameraman] So, Nick, you openly said you're struggling, right? - I'm struggling right now. - [Jimmy] So here's the thing. Before I make an offer,\nI wanna remind you. One million dollars. You could work the next\n15 years of your life and make a million dollars. Or you could push through\nand win it in a few weeks, when we have the next challenge. Having said that, $5,000\nto the first person. (record scratch) (shouting)\nOh! Okay! Chris, that's two challenges you lost. - I gave him linguini! I couldn't have been a better coach! - [Cameraman] You got offered $5,000. - My legs hurt so bad. - [Cameraman] How do you feel now? - I feel like my legs are\nin bad shape right now. - [Cameraman] Was it the right decision? - Yes, for my legs! - All right, come here, Nick, come on. Come over here to the couch. Let's escort him. Oh, hey Chandler. Did you wake up from your nap? (grunts) Here you go, this should\nease your pain, $5,000. - Cool. - [Jimmy] You didn't\nwin a million dollars, but you got five grand. - [Chris] How do they feel? - Dude, they hurt so bad.\n- Do they? - The way you sit on it, it's like, it's like digging into right here. Think I have a bruise\nright here, actually. - Geez. - [Jimmy] Payton, you already sound like you're on the edge, so-- - That wasn't the business\ndeal I was looking for, I'd just stick up the gum. - [Jimmy] So we already\nknow, Payton's struggling. Tony, it's really you against Omar. Are you gonna be the one\nthat stands up to him and wins a million dollars? - Yes. - [Jimmy] 'Cause if Omar wins, that means Jake's contestant would've won the first\nchallenge and the second. - I feel like I don't\nreally have much pain. - [Jimmy] If you win the million dollars, what would you buy with it? - Firstly, I'd give back to\nmy whole family, my parents. $200K I'm gonna keep to spend. - Oh, only 200 grand?\n- Only 200. - Now we're gonna call all\nthe contestants' parents. We're gonna start off\nwith Payton's father. - [Automated Message] I'm\nsorry, the person you are try-- (somber piano music) - Now we're gonna call Troy's mom. Hey, are you Troy's mother? - [Troy's Mom] Yes. - He's been swinging on\na swing for 10 hours, and if he wins, he gets to\ncompete for a million dollars. - [Troy's Mom] Just hold on, boo. Just don't think about it, just keep swinging. - Aw. - [Troy's Mom] Just go with the flow. - How's dad doin'? Is he getting any better? - [Troy's Mom] Yes, they\nshocked his heart to restart it, and then that makes him\nfeel back to normal. So, I'm gonna go and\ntell him what's going on. Just concentrate and then\ndon't think about, like, oh, I'm tired, or something. Just don't think about it. - No. - [Troy's Mom] Just hang in there, baby. - Oh, now I want you to win. Omar, get out!\n- No! - Okay. We're gonna hit the phone\nwith the next contestant, we'll update you on how he does. - [Troy's Mom] Okay, thank you. - All right, all right, later, mom. - [Troy's Mom] I love you, son. - All right, all right. - [Troy's Mom] Okay, go hard. - Oh.\n- I will. - All right, wow. Omar's about to call his sister. We're just gonna fill her in. - Hey!\n- Hi, homey! - Hey, hey. So I'm currently swinging. I'm doing good, slightly sore, but I'm mostly good. - If he wins today, he competes for a million dollars in a challenge in a few weeks. So, if he plays his cards right, he could become a millionaire. So I want you to just encourage him and give him some motivation. I'm gonna hand him back. - Keep swinging, keep going, it's just, uh, however long it is. - [Omar] Don't worry about it. Talk to you soon. - Call me after. - Yes, I will. - Everyone just got a\nlittle bit of motivation except for Payton. - You know what? We're swingin'!\n- Yeah! - So just keep swingin'! - Yeah! - [Coach] Whoo! (smooth hip-hop music) - Chris, my brother, can you\ncart Steve onto the court? - Uh-oh. - If you get out now, you\ncan have all the presents. (shouting) Marcus! Marcus is asleep.\n- Sound asleep. - Hey buddy. You know how we're recording these? See how do y'all rate? - You did the best you could do. Appreciate you comin' out\nhere, you know what I'm sayin'? - Me and Marcus had a\nlittle bit of up and downs during our challenge today. - Yeah, we did, we did, we did. - But I think we overcame\n'em when Marcus fell asleep. - I think you're right.\n(laughing) - They've been swinging for 12 hours. - 12 hours, 12 hours! (bursts) - Ooh, that was nice. I have a feeling you're\nboth gonna go a while. Would you say so? I guess we'll just do a time lapse! (smooth hip-hop music) So the last to fall challenge came down to Jake's contestant and Chandler's. So this is the exact same thing. On top of that, Jake was still here at nighttime, Chandler wasn't. Change history, though, Troy. I believe. - I will change it. - I don't know you guys do this. I'm tired.\n(chuckles) (smooth hip-hop music) It is six AM. I now you guys have to be tired. - I'm feeling great, Jimmy. - I don't get how he feels like that. - I feel great.\n- At six AM in the morning. - I feel great, dude, I feel great. - You could've gone a day.\n- Yeah! - Troy, you still gonna go on? A little off, guard the table, but that's where you are, or are you just dragging? - I'm going off beat. - Lemme consult the team. I wanted to consult with the team, but the team's asleep. I might offer some money, you know, to see who takes it. Okay, let's try Chandler. We're offering them money to see if anyone wants to get out. Do you wanna come talk\nyour guy into staying? He's like, asleep. Okay. So we woke up Jake, and\nwe woke up Chandler. Now let's go offer them some money. (squealing) - Congratulations, you're awake. - You know how we do things. Sometimes people just need a little bit of a nudge to get out,\nwould you agree, Chandler? - Yes. - For the next 30 seconds, if someone gets out, $10,000. - 10,000.\n- That's a lot of money. - Omar, I know you want this $10,000. - Nah, I don't. - What could you buy with it?\n(laughing) - I don't want it.\n- No, I don't. - [Omar] I'm going for the million, and I decided that from the start. - What's going through your mind, Troy? - [Troy] I wanna get that one mil, man. - You wanna get the million? But even if you win here, you still have to win\nanother challenge after this. You could not win that and be in the same scenario, but with way less suffering. - [Cameraman] Yeah, Omar,\nyou've had a smile on your face this whole time. - Yeah, why not do it with\na smile when you're winning? - [Cameraman] Would you\nhave taken that deal now? - C'mon Omar, just let me win, man. (laughs) - Bruh, I'm not leaving 'til tomorrow, you can stay if you want to. Trust me when I say this,\nyou're wasting your time, I'm not leaving. - [Jimmy] The energy you have,\nI want that, I need that! (laughing) - [Chandler] Are you givin' up? - Dude, I'm breaking right now. - [Chandler] Do not, dude, don't break. - I am physically, like, hurting so bad. - Troy. How are you feeling? - I'm hurting. - Okay. I can tell you're hurting. So if someone gets out\nin the next 30 seconds, I will give them $10,000 in cash. - I'm gonna give him one\npercent of my winnings if I win the million. - Oh, I didn't hear that!\n- I told him that. - If Omar wins, he's gonna\nface up against Akira and the winners of the\nnext two challenges-- - And win off this thing.\n- For a million dollars. You get 10 grand, and you can potentially\nget another 10 grand. - Dude, I could go for\nat least one more day. (laughing) - Troy, all right, give\nhim another 30 seconds. - A million, you heard it, I need it. - [Jimmy] This is\ndetermination right there. - [Chandler] Keep fightin', keep fightin'. Omar is--\n- I'm surviving. - All right, Troy. Stick it out and go, or you could walk away\ntoday with 20 grand. I know that would help\nyour family greatly. So Omar has now offered two percent on top of the $10,000. - And since some of you\naren't that good with math, if he wins a million dollars, two percent might not seem like a lot, but that's still 20 grand. - I'm not feeling so good. - If he gets up, okay, 100% up to you if you wanna keep going or not. (applauding) Omar is the winner! Let's have a draw! - You didn't-- - I don't even know what to say, man. You killed it. You got guaranteed 10 grand. If Omar wins, you get another 20. And I know that'll help for sure. So, I'm proud of you. Everyone's proud of you. Your mom, your family's gonna\nbe proud of you for sure. - Yeah, I feel better up here. I really wanted to win\nit to break, you know, the losing streak.\n(laughs) - That's why? That's why? Well, I appreciate you trying for me, man, but that was awesome. And you're gonna get that $10,000 now. - Gotta give thanks to\nmy fans, and my family. - I'mma give you that $20K, for sure, bro, 100%, you'll gain that $20K. (murmuring) - Jake, Akira won.\n- Yes. - Omar won, you're two for two. - Two and oh. - Which means two of the\nfour people competing for a million dollars will be your guys. - Honestly, one million means a lot to me. And like, my family has\ntaken care of me all my life. And all I want to do is\nlike give back to them, and this seems like\nthe perfect opportunity through, like, getting a million. - Based on the comments\nsection up in the last video, people really like Akira. Well, we'll see how they\nrespond to you, Omar. And we'll see you in a few weeks. (explosion) \u266a Oh MrBeast 6000 \u266a \u266a Oh \u266a\n(Explosion) \u266a MrBeast 600, yeah, you know his name \u266a \u266a He changed it once or twice \u266a \u266a But I think it's here to stay \u266a (explosion)", "fpM1VsXxMtw": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "3kJc5xl2DLE": "[Music] you you", "UFa-RR17P3I": "- [Both] High five! - Oh my gosh. Would you challenge us to mix together every single sour candy into the largest giant sour gummy bear of all\ntime, but there's a twist. So, right now let's go. All right, Devan, so\nwith your eyes closed, you gotta guess what this is. Oh my gosh. - Oh, okay. - Pop it open. - Sounds like a bag already. (coughing) Bro, what? (clapping) - Holy crap, my eyes are\nliterally watering right now. - Is it there? - [Collins] Three, two, one. - All right, it crunches like a chip, but oh, oh, whoo, oh, it's spicy. - It's spicy. - Dude, what is this? (screaming) - What are you hitting? - The sticks of glory. - Ow, my lip. - Wait a second. Open your mouth, Devan. - Okay. - [Collins] Keep your eyes closed. Three, two, one, here we go. - Oh, ah, what was that? That was not the same at all. Dude! - Take a bite of it. - Ow, my lips burn. Ow, is it a fish? - A fish? - It's a chip. It's a Dorito. - Yes, but what kind of flavor? - A spicy fish? Spicy tuna. - No!\n- What? - Devan, you can open up your eyes. - Okay. - They're Wasabi Doritos. - Oh. - And I literally put a chunk\nof Wasabi in your mouth, bro. - Oh my gosh. Now you can choose a sour candy from the Mystery Bag of Doom. - Okay, got it. - I guess we'll have to make\nthis go away, so here we go. You ready? Oh, snap. So, Devan, now let's see\nwhat sour candy you got. - Oh! - It's like a clump of gummy worms. Yo, so wait, are you just\ngonna take a bite of that? - Yeah, I mean, I think\nI have to at this point. - Well, save some though\nbecause we need to use this for the giant gummy bear\nthat we're making, so. - All right. - So I guess, put a little bit in here. - Dude, you're just\nslamming everything around. - And, here we go. And take your bite, Devan. - All right, here we go. Oh, oh, dude, whoa. - Make sure you stick around\nbecause we will be making the largest giant sour gummy\nbear in the entire world, but right now, you're onto the next round. He's gone. Where did he go? - All right, Collins, close your eyes. - Okay. - This is the next item. - What is that? It sounds like it's gonna chip my tooth. - Oh, it might. - Let's see if I can get some flavor. - All right, go for it. - Oh, what is that? - Let me see this. - What is this, bro? - Wait, can you guess it? I mean, it should be pretty\nobvious by now, right? - I think it's a cucumber soda, which is the weirdest thing. - Dude, you got it! - So, we got the Bag of Doom back, Devan. Choose your next sour candy. - No, oh, it's sticky. It's got ants in it. - That reminds me of the\nliquid glass that we made. - Oh, no. - But it has ants in it. (laughing) - Oh, really? - Dude, if the ants just wanna crawl away on the table, that\nwould be so freaky. - No, don't even say it. - But you got it now, Devan. Take a lick of it. - Dude, is this even sour? - Yes. Yeah, look at it, it's got the malic acid looks like on there. - Oh, no, you're right, it does. Three, two, one. - You're gonna chip a tooth. - Ow, that hurt so bad. All right, oh, oh. - Are you good? - No, dude, what do you\nthink, it's malic acid. - Bam! - Look inside of this. - Dude, you cracked like on an ant. All right, guys, so Devan and I, we're gonna do the\nlargest gummy bear ever. We'll be doing at the end, but right now, we are on to the next round. All right, Devan, close your eyes. - All right. - And here is the next crazy, weird, food. Check this out. - Oh no. - Wait a second. That is not what was supposed to be there. There's only way to fix\nit. It's called Yeet-Za. (laughing) - Oh, dude! - Yeet-Za is not for everyone. - Oh, man. - Let's just see if it worked. Boom, there we go. That's more like it. Devan, I'm so sorry. - Dude, can I just win this\nround automatically for that. - You literally, hold\nup, hold, up, hold up, on your forehead. - What? - Nothing, you look great. Here we go and remember, a\nsour candy is on the line. - It's a pizza. It's like a Pringle and it's a pizza. - How did you get that right so quickly? - Dude, you said Yeet-Za. - I'm gonna go with the claw, you ready? Move this off to the side that way. - No, no, no. - I don't wanna do this. These are gonna be terrible. This is, hang on, sour pink lemon. Feel likes a pink lemon. - It's a grapefruit, bro. That does exist. - Here we go. Three, two, one. - No, you can't pull\nthat all the time, dude. You gotta eat it, bro. - Okay, fine, okay, here we go. - [Both] Three, two, one. - Yeah, oh finally. How's it taste, Collin? Really good? Really good? All right, well, maybe try another one. Maybe it'll help. All right, onto the next one. What, I don't, what are you saying? I already said onto the next one. - The bowl! - The what? - The bowl! - Oh, got it. - All right, next round, let's go. - Collins, close your eyes. And this is the next item. Whoa! All right, ready? - Yeah. - Three, two, one. It's not that bad. - It's all like hairy and fluffy. - Any guesses? - This is not good - I feel like this would\nactually be pretty good. Really? - Oh my god. - Well, do you have any guesses? - Oh, it's got a sweet and kinda salty... Oh, oh, bacon! It's Bacon Cotton Candy! - No, how did you get that? - Yahoo! - Dude, how did you get that? - Sorry, what did you say? - How did you get that? - Sorry, one more time. I can't hear you. - How did you get that? - Sorry, what did you say? - What, bro, how did you do that? (Collin mumbling) - This one's really cool. - Dude, what? How did you do that? - Magic! Damn, Devan gotta choose\none of the Bag of Doom! - All right, fine. This one! Whoa, it feels really light. What's inside? I don't know.

It's Goldfish S'mores. Ah, man, I can't believe you guessed it. Oh, yeah, these are... - These are not good. - These are rough. Three, two, one. - I remember these. I think I tried these. We're grabbing the bucket, bro. Are you good, no? (Collins mumbles) All right, onto the next one. What? All right, cool. I hope you feel better. All right, Collins, your eyes are closed. - My eyes are closed. - As they can see. This is the next item. All I can say is good luck, Collins. I'm very glad I'm not doing this one. I'm just gonna toss them in there. All right, here we go, Collins. Three, two, one. - Wait, wait, wait! First, let's do a 3 Second Like Challenge! I want to see if you can like\nthis video in three seconds. Ready, here we go. - [Both] Three, two, one, done. - All right. - Three, two, one. I missed some. - It's a little bit spiky, a little bit. - Any guesses so far? Dude, you dropped one. - Chocolate covered, I don't\nknow, scorpions or something? - What? Chocolate covered insects, bro. - No, god. - We've got crickets. We've got worms, bro. - It stuck to my tongue at one point. I was trying to get it off my tongue. - You sound like a goose. - That was horrible. I can't believe I have to\nhave another disgusting thing after I just ate bugs. These actually, if they weren't sour, I'd probably really enjoy them cause they're like Life Savers all much. - All much? - But I. Let's see how these taste. - All right, there we go. - One, two. - Oh, yeah, has it hit yet? Oh, there it is! - Number three is the charm. - Bro, are you good? Wait, did they get better? - Yep. - Nice. - So, this is definitely the weirdest one we've had so far. I am so happy I don't have to eat this. I'm serious. - Weirder than insects? - Oh my gosh. - Three, two, one. - He counts himself down. - It just tastes really\nfizzy and very sweet. - Well, take a bite of this\nand try to mix some flavors together to give you hint of what this is. What is it? - Well, they taste exactly the same, so I'm going to guess that\nit's either bread soda or toast soda. - No, you didn't get it. - What? - It's butter soda. - Butter soda? - With some bread. Instead of butter, I was gonna\nput a little bit of the soda on top of the bread and\nthen try the bread now. - I don't think so. - Dude, try it. - You try it. - It's part of the rules. I can't eat the item that's not my round. - Oh, so good. - Unfortunately, Devan, you\ngotta get another sour one. - I know. I choose you! - Let's see what we got. - Oh, no. Oh, these don't look good. I'm gonna pour a little bit back in. All, right, here we go. Three, two, one. - You went fish lips, bro. Do not spit on me. - Oh, man. - I need to grab the bowl. - Okay. - Don't spit on me. - I won't. I won't. - Oh, gosh, it got on me. Yo, all I gotta say is this\nsour gummy bear is going to be crazy and we'll be making\nit coming up here shortly, but right now, we are onto the next round. - It tastes really good now. And here is the next item. - Yay! - Wow, it actually smells\nexactly like what it is. I'm gonna do it, so you can't smell it. Three, two, one. Just bite, just bite, you can't smell it. - I think I know it! - What? Yes? We're all waiting. - It tastes like ketchup. - Yes, dude, you got it! - Dude, right, you know\nwhat would be even better? - What? - Oh, yeah. - What? Oh, dude, what? Where did that come from? Oh, man. - Too much mustard. - All right, I'm going for this bag here. I think you clawed this one. Oh! Oh, snap. - Like sour rope. - And you know, since\nyou lost the challenge, I think you're gonna have to be the one who eats the giant sour gummy bear, bro. - What? No! Three, two, one. - Oh, yo, it's like a guitar. It's like the sourest spaghetti you've ever had in your life. We'll put these in here\nand now the moment you've all been waiting for. Time to mix all of the sourest\ncandies in the world together and make a crazy giant gummy bear, so right now, let's head to the kitchen. Welcome to our kitchen!

Now is the moment you've\nall been waiting for. It's time to take all\nthat candy and pop it into the sour Jell-O. Let's get the candy and I think we're gonna go with some vines first. Just kind of sprinkle them. - Just a whole chunk of worms, bro. - I was going for a handful like this. Dude, watch out, are you ready? Hold on, I gotta start\nmixing it in though. Dude, you're missing like a ton of them. - I forgot, bro, the clump! There we go. That's the\namount that we want! Oh, I'm stepping on it! - All right, Devan, get\nthe gummy bear mold.

What a privilege! - I feel bad though, so how bout this? I'll take a bite of it as well. And comment down below, what\nare some other giant gummies you want us to make the\nmost sour version of?

You have five seconds. - [Both] Five, four, three, two, one. - Bye!", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "gL6iSCSHjco": "last team to leave this roller coaster wins $20,000 Chris and Chandler

What have I brought today? I brought stuff that\u2019s hot online these days. It\u2019s mostly weird jelly, which are made overseas\u2026 Let\u2019s get right into it. There are loads of stuff. Let\u2019s check it out. First, there\u2019s eyeball and Earth jelly, something I reviewed last itme. These are still popular. Theses are tending these days too, Maltesers! It apparently melts in your mouth if you eat it with milk. Also, Whoppers! I\u2019ve prepared this as well. This also goes well with milk. This is also something that\u2019s hot these days- it\u2019s something called wax jelly\u2026 It\u2019s super hard. Is this even jelly?\nIt\u2019s not rock\u2026? I\u2019ll check this out as well. There\u2019s also UFO candy, which is also hot! This is really good! I personally like this\u2026 You can easily find this at the convenience store. Other than that, this candy is called \u2018Rock Candy\u2019 and it resembles a jewel. It\u2019s made mostly out of sugar and it\u2019s really pretty. You can make this at home! Let\u2019s check this out later. Lastly, this one\u2019s a rope where jelly is stuck onto another jelly. I\u2019ll try this as well. Anyways, let\u2019s eat all of this up today. Let\u2019s try the Earth jelly first. I actually really like this. Earth jelly! Open up the package! In the inside, it just has squishy jelly. Ooh, kinda like a mochi\u2026 Wait\u2026 it\u2019s stuck. That\u2019s how sticky it is! Boing boing- Let\u2019s try it\u2026 I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s strawberry or cherry inside, but it has syrup inside. Mmh, so good! Foreign jelly has a stronger smell and taste in sweetness than Korean ones. Eyeball jelly, this time. Boing! This is also good. See? Let\u2019s see what\u2019s inside this time. Mmh\u2026 This also has syrup inside. So good. It\u2019s very chewy! I actually reviewed these the other time, so it\u2019s time for recently trending items! These are jelly that's hot nowadays. This is getting crazy attention online including Youtube. Why is this thing trending? If you take a look\u2026 Oooooh! It\u2019s a bottle shaped jelly. The colors on the inside looks like syrup. Let me give it a try. Hold on\u2026 There\u2019s syrup inside\u2026 (*re-tasting it*) Mmh- Kinda feels like gum. There\u2019s actual beverage inside, not syrup! It feels like chewing on a plastic\u2026 (*keeps on chewing*) I don\u2019t think this is edible\u2026 Is it edible\u2026? I don\u2019t think so\u2026 Is it\u2026? No? I\u2019m not sure\u2026 Can we even eat this\u2026? (What is this supposed to taste like\u2026?) Let\u2019s keep chewing on it. Kinda like chewing on gum\u2026\nI feel like I can taste wax\u2026 I don\u2019t think this is edible\u2026 (It\u2019s advised you only drink the beverage inside the candy) See this? It has red, green, yellow and orange- I think only the drink inside is edible. (1. Open the bottle with mouth) (2. Drink up!) (*drinking up*) All done. Wow\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect this\u2026 I thought all of it was edible, but only the insides are. The drinks in it are good! Mmh, so good. I\u2019ll try drinking the jelly upside down. Wait, but is the outer part really inedible? There are 4 flavors in total,\nI\u2019ll try each one and see what kinds of flavors there are. Start off with red\u2026 Mmh\u2026 What flavor is this\u2026? (Cherry) It\u2019s orange this time. Orange one is probs orange flavored. Yup, I was right. Yellow! What will yellow be? It\u2019s lemon\u2026 (Sour but so good) Lastly, green! Hmph? Kinda tastes like apple. (Melon) Let\u2019s try something else. This is something called rock candy, which is going viral online. Oooooh! This is so pretty! It\u2019s like a jewel! Kinda like sugar clumps\u2026 I thought I could break this into pieces but it\u2019s real candy! Should I try another one? They all just taste like sugar\u2026 It\u2019s super pretty though! It\u2019s really pretty. I think it was well made. I can kinda taste the difference. This time, it\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s Nerd jelly. Let\u2019s open it up. What does it look like? What the? There\u2019s nothing. Oh, it\u2019s here! Whoa, looks kinda cool. This is jelly! Whoa! Looks good. It\u2019s hard to cut if off mid way. It fits in one bite! (*tasting jelly*) Whoa, this is good! If you take a look, it has red jelly inside. On the outside, it has rainbow candies attached. The jelly itself is sweet but the candies on the outer part are also yummy. It\u2019s very fruity. I feel like my teeth is going bad though\u2026 It\u2019s stretchy as well! This time, let\u2019s eat Heopop\u2019s favorite, UFO candy! This is also one of my favorites. This is really good! It won\u2019t open\u2026 It won\u2019t open up\u2026 It\u2019s called a UFO candy cause it\u2019s in the shape of a UFO. If you take a bite\u2026 It\u2019s crunchy on the outside and has sour powder on the inside. The sour powder that\u2019s inside is really strong but addictive at the same time. It just keeps going in! Ugh so sour! Makes you keep wanting more! It\u2019s now time for Maltesers and Whoppers! I\u2019ll go get some milk. First, pour milk into the bowl\u2026 (How about Maltesers...?) Mmh\u2026 The milk tastes good. Let\u2019s put em Maltesers in! It just looks like chocolate\u2026 But it\u2019s crunchy on the inside. Let\u2019s try pouring it into the milk. A friend of Maltesers, Whoppers! Mmh, it\u2019s a bit different! Maltesers and Whoppers! Whoppers has more stuff on the inside. Let\u2019s pour all these in\u2026 I wonder what it tastes like\u2026 The moment you take a bite of the chocolate and milk\u2026! Will it melt\u2026? I\u2019ll try it. (This isn\u2019t what I expected\u2026) (?!) Mmmmmh\u2026 When I first took a bite, I was like \u2018why do people eat this?\u2019 and was kinda doubtful. But as the milk and Maltesers mixed in,\nit starts to taste like caramel. Mmh- The more you bite into it, the chewier it gets and the more sweetness spreads throughout your mouth. I like the aftertaste! But the first bite isn\u2019t all that good. It gets all caramelly as milk and Maltesers mix in your mouth! It\u2019s really tasty. It\u2019s not my style though\u2026 My personal favorite is this UFO! Mmmh. Anyways, today I tried foods that are going viral online. I mean sweets\u2026 Anyways, today I tried sweets that are going viral online\u2026 All of them were good! I think they had really cool things. Foreign sweets are so cool\u2026 Anyways, you guys! Please leave a comment down below on what your personal favorite is! Mine was the UFO! Eeek, so sour! (Leave suggestions on other cool stuff to eat!)", "7aYS6Sbf0TA": "- You challenged us to make a whole bunch of giant candy like this. Check it out. Boom, look at that! - Whoa! Wait a second, lemme try! Oh! - Nah, bro, you kidding me, man? All right, no more magic. It's time to make some giant\nkinder eggs, so let's go. We have the kinder egg mold,\na whole bunch of chocolate-- - Wait, there's mold? Where's the mold? - Devan, these are molds,\nit's how cooking works. Come on. - I'm just kidding. - Time to fill it in, so here we go, ooh! What is that? - This is cookie dough that I dyed black to look like a geode. There are three parts to the kinder egg. There's a chocolate outside, the filling, and then the truffle on the inside. I'm making the truffle on the inside, you're making the chocolate exteriors. - I feel like a chocolatier right now. Oh! Dude, I'm like one of the three musketeers but with chocolatiers, man! Just a whole bunch of\ndudes covered in chocolate. - Oh, dude, since this is\ngonna be a giant kinder egg, I'm gonna make a bunch of\ntruffles on the inside. - Okay. I'm just trying to get this-- - Are you kidding me, dude? - Oh, man. Well, that wiggles a little bit more than it should right now. I gotta grab this mold over here, do a quick little flippity flipadoo. One, two, three. (crashing noise) I kinda bailed mid-way. So here we go. So, I'm just gonna take it like this, just gonna squeeze it down. What are you doing? - I'm putting these into the oven and letting them expand. - So as your geode truffles are baking, my egg is gonna be shaking. We call this the shake and bake. Wow, that wasn't fun. Time for me to shake this around. So here we go, wow. - Wow, all right then. - Coat the inside like that, okay! All right, that's pretty tiring, so there we go, egg is-- - That hurt? - Yeah. Now we just gotta fill in the filling as well as the little truffle\nthingys on the inside. Is yours done cooking yet? - Not yet. (elevator music) And we're done! - Okay, you didn't need to\nwake me up like that, man. I was having a great dream. - Careful, the oven's open. - I wake up to such a dangerous world. - All right, gonna pull\nthese things out of the oven. Here, thank you for\nclosing the oven for me. And now, I have these halves. Having some troubles there? - I got it. All right, well my egg is all ready to go. So now, it's gotta let it-- - Whoa, you're already done? - Nope, what I meant to say,\nwas it's not ready to go, and I need to put it off to the side to let it set in the fridge. - All right then, well. - It's my child. - As you do-- What? - Nothing. - As you do that, I'm gonna hollow out the rest of these, here, and then fill em up with these nice rocks. What are you-- - Somehow I forgot the\nfridge is over here. - I got a shaker here that\nalso doubles as a hammer, so. - Yeah, well I got a hook that also-- - Is a hook. - Doubles as a hook. - Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I think that's one of those pressure point things for your back. - Yeah right, man. - Yeah, seriously. (makes painful noise) Oh, geez. Here we go. - Oh my gosh. I feel like I just got like tasered. - You've gotten tasered before? - It was a rough weekend. Gonna take the bag like this. (banging noise) - Got a problem, bro? You just stopped. - I feel uncomfortable right now. - How could you feel uncomfortable? - Who are you? You've changed! You are now me! And I'm you! - Yeah! - This is weird! Here we go, gonna add in a whole bunch of sour patch kids right\nnow, in here, like this. Whoa. I can't talk over that, man. - Yes, you can. - No, I can't. - And you will. - I got a whole bunch\nof sour patch kids here, so now, I just gotta melt all these sour patch kids down again. This is gonna be-- I can't even right now. This is gonna be the inside\nfilling for my kinder egg. - [Devan] Look at this, man! This is looking sweet! - I melted down all the sour patch kids. I had to add in some blue food coloring, 'cause it was looking pretty funky. - I've got half of the geode truffle done, but now, I have to coat\nit all in chocolate. - The next part of my kinder egg, I'm doing a filling with this jet-puffed marshmallow right over here. - Wait, I wonder why\nthey call it jet-puffed? - Oh, you've never seen it before? It's this signature look, man. Here we go, three, two, one. Boom, look at that jet engine, man! - Whoa, are you kidding,\nit's like the arm rocket! - It's awesome, bro! - Okay, then. - And the best part is boom, look at that, it can fly by itself, man! - Is it pointing at me? - Yeah, it's building\nup a little in the back. (explosion noise) No! - No, no! What did you do? - Nothing! - I have a hole in my chest! - Well Devan, as you figure that out, I'm gonna continue making\nmy kinder egg right now. - Are you kidding me? You gotta help me out! The next thing for my mousse sauce is putting in this cool whip. - The next part of my kinder egg, I'm doing a filling with this jet-puffed marshmallow right over here. Yeah, we had a very bad\nexperience with this stuff. - Yeah. - Time to tear open\nsome pop rocks right now and just add these in. Oh, boy, okay there we go. Dude that sounds so crazy, man. - Whoa! - All right, well now\ntime to mix it all up. - Also coated the inside\nof these bowls here with some chocolate,\nnow I'm gonna add this-- What are you doing? - Hold on. - What are you doing? - I gotta inspect it. - Why? (sniffing) - Yep, it's chocolate. You never know with Devan. You just never know. - You kidding? With me? Whoa. Okay, there, yep, yep, yep. - You wanted us to use this, if you're not even using a piping bag properly. (gulp) I'ma keep mixing this over here. - Yep, the piping bag doesn't really work. I'm just adding it in like this. - Oh, wait, wait, wait! Oh, but wait! Oh! I get it now! You're doing for the truffle, you got chocolate on the outside, chocolate mousse on the inside, and then you're gonna use\nthese geodes inside that. - Exactly! - Holy cow, the whole dish\njust increased exponentially. - Got the two domes done, now it's time to grab\nthe geodes and put em in. So, there's one right there. - For my truffle, we've got a whole bunch of jolly ranchers over here. That was a quick grab. Oh! - That wasn't supposed to open yet. - Oh, are you kidding me, Devan? - Oh, man. - I'm gonna take a whole\nbunch of jolly ranchers, place em down over here,\ncreate a beautiful pattern, and turn it into the\nouter shell of my truffle. - Nice, well I-- - It'll make a lot of sense. - Are you done? - Yeah. - For the filling of my kinder egg, I'm making nutella, but better. - How are you gonna make\nbetter than nutella, man? - I'm gonna home-make it. - And you think you're really gonna nail the recipe more than the nutella brand? - You know, when you say it\nlike that, it sounds unlikely. - All right, well I'm gonna continue constructing this absolutely\nbeautiful masterpiece here, and let's speed it along. - Yo! Wait, whoa, I switched places with Devan. Wait, where'd Devan go? - Huh, wait, what? Why am I over here? - Oh, sorry, I've gotten\nreally rusty at this. You should probably take\nback your sack of hazelnuts. - Hazelnuts. - I was trying to avoid\nthat, but all right. I'm gonna take this right here, and again, I'm gonna use it as the outer shell of my truffles. We're gonna flip it over, here we go. Three, two, one. (screaming) okay, there we go. That's so satisfying! - Yo, that looks cool! - Wait 'til you see what I\nfilled the interior with. It's gonna be saucy. - Like, is it actual sauce? - It's not actual sauce,\nit's just going to be saucy. - So, sauce. Got the hazelnuts all blended up, now just gonna add the chocolate. - All right, for my truffle, I've got some peanut butter that I'm gonna pop inside. It's still got the cover\non it, so here we go. Three, two, one. - [Devan] Now just gotta blend this stuff. - Well, we've got everything we need, so now it is time to fully put our kinder eggs together and\nsee their gloriousness. We've got the kinder eggs,\nand dude, look at this! This is absolutely massive! - Dude, they are really heavy too. - Exactly, so right now,\nwe've got everything we need to fill it up, but first, we've got a chocolate layer, and then a white chocolate layer\nwe've added on top of that. I've got some candy slime over here, and as you know, there's\ngoing to be a surprise inside the kinder egg, but right now, let's put these together. The giant kinder eggs are all made, and bro, this is an engineering\nfeat of genius, man! Like, they are so massive! - These things are huge. - But the best part is wait 'til you see the surprise that's on the inside, man. Like that's really what takes this whole thing to another level. Here is the big reveal, three, two, one! Tada! Look at these, bro! - Dude! - These turned out to\nbe absolutely insane! So we're gonna be\ncracking these things open and eating them at the end of the video. You challenged us to\nmake a giant Butterfinger and Snickers bar, so let's go. First thing I'm doing is making the inside of my Butterfinger, so I got a whole bunch of peanut butter right here. - And I'm making a peanut for my snickers. - I'm gonna add my peanut\nbutter in here like this. Here we go, three, two, one. (grunting) That sounded like a pterodactyl. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. - What? - There's corn syrup? - Yeah, man! - You are the worst\nfarmer of all time, Devan. You couldn't farm a peanut,\nyou don't even know what it is. - Why would I want-- No, what? - As you can tell, we got a little bit of peanut butter over here, so now, I think I can\nmove this off to the side. - What? Just a little bit? - Yeah, I gotta get pumped\nreal quick, so here we go. All right, there we go and then-- All right, so there we go! Three, two, one. (grunting) Easy, totally easy! Whoo, I feel exerted. The whole thing with the\ninterior of a butter finger is you gotta make sure\nthat it's super crunchy. So, got some corn flakes here. We got some chick-o-sticks. Whole little tower right over here. Stay. I've never even like,\nheard of these things. - Oh, they're right here too. - My stick, no touching my sticks! Bro! Devan has butterfingers. - Watch this. (crashing noise) - I'm a little scared. - I meant to point it at you, but. - I feel rather uncomfortable right now. - All right, this thing is heated up, now it's time to add\nsome baking soda here. - Here is Helga the hen. - Whoa, yes! - Gonna smash up the\nsticks with Helga the hen. This is gonna act as the crunchy texture on the inside of my butterfingers. - I'm putting this into the mold here. - That looks so gross. - Collins? - What? - Can you help? - I finally figured out\nthe perfect mixture, now I'm gonna pour it into the mold. - You hold onto that for a second. No, no, no, no, no. - What? Collins! I don't wanna hold it, it's all you. - Okay, so here, no, no, no! We can't just set it-- And we're back to where we started. - [Devan] Oh, wow, this is\nreally not going in very well. - [Collins] And that's\ngonna create a peanut? - Hopefully. - All right, here we go, just gonna scoop out a little bit of peanut\nbutter over here like this. Oh, yeah, just give a nice\nlittle plop down here. Boom, bigger scoop! Call me the peanut butter dude! - Haha, I don't know if I wanna call you the peanut butter dude anymore. You're like a pokemon. They say their name\nbefore they do something. And if you're a pokemon, that\nmeans you could be caught! - You can't catch peanut butter dude. - Oh you can't, well let's try it out! Three, two, one! - Ow! Holy cow! I almost wish I was caught, 'cause it probably woulda hurt less. - Bruh. - What? - Can you see how slow this is going? - Did you just say bruh? - Bruh. Oop, I missed. Completely missed. I completely missed. - I mean, it looks kinda cool. - It kinda looks like a goober. Right, isn't that a fish,\nor something like that? - What? (stammering) - It looks like one of\nthose fishes that go. - Peanut butter man does not\nseen one of these fish before. Next up, I gotta melt down a whole bunch of candy\ncorns for the caramel. - All right, just gotta let the mold set and then the peanut is done. All right, next up, I'm making my nougat. - To find the illusive candy corn, I brought along the silly scissors. - That was a voice crack? - Nope, that was just me. - Okay, well, what do they do? - They cut a hole in the\nspace-time continuum! So silly! Time to cut open the\nfabric of time, you ready? Three, two, one. (zapping noise) Oh! Snap, yo! - That looks like you. - That looks like me. This is alternate universe me! - Haha, yeah. - Where is the candy corn? - It's been here the whole time? Just gonna put in this\nmarshmallow fluff here. - There is one other use, and that is you can use these to slice off the top of your recently found candy corn. - Just what scissors do. - This is what I call the\nbasketball dunk spike. Excuse me, I'm going backwards. All right, here we go. Three, two, one, dunk! Oh, snap! That was pretty cool. We got even more candy\ncorns, and here we go, gonna add that in like that. Boom, there we go. Then we got this one over here. - Are you making this on\nthe floor, or in that? - I know you're not really\nasking this question, Devan. - I'm not. - And that hurts. I've got some dark corn syrup I'm gonna add into my candy corn. Is this gonna be the nougat? - Yes. - What, whoa! That looks like-- - [Devan] No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I'm gonna get a new one. - We've got the candy bar molds, and the first thing I'm doing here for my butterfingers is the topping. - And the first thing\nI'm doing is my nougat. - This is very heavy. Three, two, one. Oh, let's see, okay a little pour. - [Devan] Look at the rolls, dude! - [Collins] Dude, that looks beautiful! Mine's actually looking\npretty good as well, man. All right, so here we go,\njust gonna pour this down. - Now it's time to add the peanuts. - [Collins] Those are the peanuts? - Yes. Gonna try to plop it outta here into here. Yeah! - [Collins] That looks so cool, man! - Now it's time to add the caramel. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We can go at the same time! We can be bros! Okay, three, two, one. Just pour it straight in the center, oh! That's a lot of peanut butter. - Dude! - Time for me to get my hands in here and kind of mix this up a little bit. - [Devan] Wait, what? - I feel like I'm doggy-paddling right now to get all this stuff in here. We gotta douse all of this\nin a lot of lovely chocolate. But right now, we'll\nget it all finished up and then it's time to see how they taste. All right, the giant\ncandy bars are all done. I gotta say, I was expecting big, these are massive, bro! - These are not any\nnormal candy bars, man. - Oh, no. - Holy cow! - Trying to take a bite of these things is gonna be next to impossible. Right now here is the\nbig reveal, three, two-- Wait, a three-second like challenge. We wanna see you like this video in three seconds, you ready? Here we go, three, two, one, done. Three, two, one. What's up? - I messed up. - Well there's mine, reveal yours! - Tada! - There we go. - You get to comment down below, which one do you think will taste better, and we'll be eating them\nat the end of the video. - You challenged us to make\na giant donut and nerds rope. So the first thing I'm\nmaking for my giant donut is the round donut-shaped dough. - Yup, and the first thing I'm making is the nerd of the nerd rope. So, to make my nerd, I got a jolly rancher on the tip of this hot straw. Just gonna try to blow it up real quick. - Oh no! - You broke the faucet! - I broke the faucet! - Are you kidding me? - That's an issue. - Bro. - This is an issue. Yeah, let's just have-- - Bro, are you kidding? - Haha, whoopsie! I don't think it's that noticeable. - Are you kidding? I'm actually gonna use a mold instead. That might work out better. - All right, all I gotta do is just take these\ndifferent cakes right here, like this, just gonna let it go down and-- Devan? - What? - I need this space right here. - Okay. - Three, two, one, let's see. Oh, there we go, that's\nwhat I'm talking about. Sweet moves, bro. Oh boy, yeah, this is-- - And you got it on my arm. No! I knew you wouldn't do it. - My commitment level is weak. - So, before I do this, I have to wash my hands, but Collins? - What? - I would normally wash\nmy hands right here. But now, I have to go all the way over there to wash my hands. Look what you've done to me, bro. - I'm sorry. It was the cakes, man! - Shame. - Blame them! - I'm all the way over\nhere, washing my hands, and I'm totally separated from the action! - Yeah, you can't even see how cool my donut is starting to look, man! - Actually, I can see it. - Well, what do you think? (laughs nervously) - It's looking good. - What was that laugh? - All right, so I've melted\ndown the jolly ranchers, now I've gotta pour em into the molds. - While you do that, time for\nme to move my donut over here! I tried to talk normal, but that is a very heavy donut right now. So, next up I've gotta\nmake some cotton candy for the toppings on my donut. All right, here we go, cotton\ncandy machine is turned on. - [Devan] Just pouring\nit into the mold here. - Let's see if this works, here we go. You ready, three, two, one. Whoa! Yo! - Yes! - Wait a minute! This is what I'm talking about! - [Devan] This is the real stuff, dude! - Yeah, man! Look at that sight! - Calm, calm, calm. That was too much. All right, it's gonna\njust take way too long to cool this stuff down, so\nI'm gonna use liquid nitrogen. - Okay, don't try this\nat home, by the way. I think the cotton candy was much cooler, just saying, just putting that out there. Can you do this with liquid nitrogen? Boom! - It's always the coolest. Did you get that? It's really cold. - It was a joke. Next, I'm gonna use a\nlittle bronca-ya-jus-just-- Bronca-saura-donk,\nbanca-donka-donka-brunkis. You got it, here we go, three, two, one. Just gonna pour it in\nlike this, here we go. - Okay, do I just hold it here? - Yeah, there we go. Oh, no, no, gotta catch this! Yep, keep it going! - [Devan] Do I spin it? - Yeah, just keep spinning it. I think we're reaching the limits of what the bronky-donkyus can hold. This will be perfect\nfor the top of my donut. - This looks like a wand with\na spell on the end of it. - Yeah right, man. - Abra-cadabra, you shall\nnever do the dab again, bro! - What? That's not a real spell. - Yes, try it. Uh-huh, I told you, bro. - Third time's the charm. - Oh man! If that's what happened\nif he tried to dab, I'd hate to see what happened\nif he tried to floss. All right, so now we got these two halves, it's time to heat these things\nup and fuse them together. - Sorry about that, man. Okay, caught a couple of peeps. Wait, I wonder if this\nworks with other stuff, like hot cheetos for instance. Let's try it, here we go. Nope, more peeps. It's infinite peeps. - All right, so, why are you\nusing these things, Collins? (crickets chirping) - That's a good question. Oh, sorry, to make a topping for my donut. - This is made now, now it's\ntime to move onto the rope. - This ain't made, this is wack. Well right now, it's the moment I've always been waiting for, time to yeet 150 chicks at once. Yeet! Picked up 15 chicks just like that. - And I'm just picking up\na big tube I made here. - What did, where? - This is for my nerd rope, bro. - No, where did that come from? - Collins, we aren't playing around. - Devan, on a real note,\nwhere did that come from? - From the ground, it's\nbeen there the whole time. - I literally didn't see it at all. (gasps) (stammers) Gosh, it's so tough to open, holy cow. - I thought you were strong. I thought you could pick up 100 chicks. - 150. Whoa, peep slide, bam! Tilt it! Look at that, bro! You just made that peep's day. - I hate to say it, but this\npeep is about to be eaten. You do not wanna give this\nthing life and a name. - That's so dark. - All right, so I'm\ngonna fill this thing up with some jello, then let it set. Three, two, one. Okay, it's going in. - I can't see anything. - All right, there we go, got one. Hold up, stay there. - Bumped me. I don't understand why\nI'm always being bumped. - Karma. Pouring this one in here. All right, you're gonna let\ngo on the count of three. Here we go, three. - No more three, two, ones! We are banning three,\ntwo, ones on the channel! - Oh wait, but first! (laughing) Sweet baby Yoda. Well, time for me to mash\nup a whole bunch of peeps! - Next up, I am making a red nerd with a red apple, some candy\nmelt here, and some nerds. - I think these peeps are gonna act as a lovely texture for the\ntopping of my donut, man. - Lovely. Beautiful, glorious. - It is. Kinda disturbing, I've got like a peep's eye just chilling on my hand. - Hey man, that's a little\ndark, don't you think? - I got peep vision now. - Whoa, wow, okay. Whoa, getting a little close there, bro. - So it's basically\nlike a candy apple, man? - Kind of. I got a bunch of different\nflavor profiles, you know? (spatting noises) - You shoulda just poured\nthe whole box on it, man. It's like you break open a box of nerds. Ooh, missed that. - Collins, I think the key\npoint is you don't break it! - There we go. - Collins! You're not supposed to break\nit, you're supposed to open it. There you go, there you go, there you go. That was like, nothing. - Exactly, they must be filled with air. - It's almost like you\nsmashed it on the counter and lost everything that was inside. - I don't know why you\nwould think that, man. This just in, nerd boxes are\nfilled with 90 percent air, and only ten percent candy. - Wait, wait, wait, dude,\nwe don't wanna get sued. You can't say that. - Okay, yes. - You can't say that. - Just kidding, fake news! - Exactly. - Back to you Patricia! Okay, right now it's time\nfor me to glaze my donut. - And time for me to\nfinish up my nerds rope. What are you saying, dude? (grunting) - What is that? I've got the glaze, bro, you gotta chill. Three, two, one. - Oh, that's a good coat, man. - That looks chunky! - It looks like a smoothie. Oh no! It's going down the\nfront of the table, dude! I just gotta remove this nerds rope. - Oh my gosh, dude! - Yes, wait, hold it, hold it! - This is so dope, bro! Time to finish things up, and then we're gonna be eating em. Giant candies are done, and bro, that nerds rope is absolutely insane. - It is massive, bro. - Like, the nerds are\nlarger than my fist, bro. - Seriously. - And this donut, I gotta say, I think it's 800 pounds, to be honest. - It's pretty huge. - I've had a lot of trouble lifting it. So here is the big reveal. Three, two-- Oh, wait, five-second subscribe challenge. We wanna see if you can\nsubscribe to the channel and turn on the channel post\nnotifications in five seconds. Are you ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one, done. If you were able to do that, comment down below Keyper squad right now, and let's see how these turned out. Three, two, one, tada! Look at these giant candies! Finally time to eat the giant snickers bar and the giant butterfingers. So Devan, which one should we eat first? This whack, square-looking snickers bar, or the beautiful, shapely butterfinger? It's the shape you want. - All right, let's do yours first. - Thanks. - Let's be disappointed, together. - So, to cut it open, I've\ngot an ax right over here. - Are you kidding? - Here's the thing. If you you ever got a giant candy bar, do not try this at home. Just gonna kinda give\nit like a downward dog. Here we go, three, two, one. - Wow. - Okay. - [Devan] Dude, yes! - Holy cow! - [Devan] That works! - Boom, boom! Yeah! Ax-man, I'm the ax-man! - I won't, I won't. - And don't worry, we will not be eating all of this by ourselves. We'll be sharing with\nour friends and family. Holy cow, this actually\nlooks really, really, wow! Hey, hey, hey, hey. - What, what, what, what, what? - Use your own fork and grab\nyour own piece of the bar. - My fork is on the floor. - Well, it was your decision. - [Devan] Just gonna grab off. - So, you're the first one to get the feeling of the texture. What does it feel like? - Yeah, terrible. - Let's see how it tastes. Ready, here we go. Three, two, one. Whoa. It tastes like a butterfinger, man! It can't be that bad. What, it's that bad? - It tastes great, but wow, is it crunchy! - Well, yeah, it's all about that crunch. So, I think I have a strong chance of winning this round, but Devan-- - So do I. - I like that. - I mean, no. I'm actually going to undo\nit from the back here, and do a nice little reveal. - Don't worry about me. Tada! - [Devan] Yeah! - [Collins] Look at that! - Yeah, the back's not so great, but, you know, the\nfront looks pretty good. I have no idea how I'm\ngonna cut through this. - [Collins] You need a bigger knife. (elevator music) Three, two, one. Oh, oh, it's going! It's happening, it's happening! Look at that! Holy cow! It's beautiful. - It looks great. - I might actually cry. - Okay, maybe don't cry. Just gonna pull down here, yes! Got some of that off. That's a chunk of chocolate. - That's like a full\nchocolate bar, normally. So, I'm gonna take this\nlittle piece of chocolate over here, I'm gonna be tasteful. All right, I'm gonna place\nthis down and layer-- (grunting) - Yes! I just wanted to do that. - Holy cow. (yelling) - I want the peanut. - It's definitely wedged\ndeep in the crevasse. Hey, don't bring that up. - All right, here we go. Three, two, one. Whoa! - The peanut is too hard. - Whoa, whoa! Are you kidding me? You crushed it, bro! Creme de la awesome. Well, as you can tell, my egg is starting to fall apart, so now it is time to crack it open. So, here we go, three, two, one. We have made it into the egg. Here it goes, we're moving pieces. Tada! - Wow. - First, take a look at\nthe surprise on the inside. It's got a balloon in it, here we go. Oh, it's getting a little bit stuck. All right, so this is the surprise that Devan made for me on the inside. - Yes. - What is it? - You can't tell, dude? - Well, it looks like a little jet-engine-propelled telephone. No, no, this is how you handle\ncustomer service calls, man. Hey, so my car phone isn't\nworking, and I'm mad. - It's a car, Collins, but it's okay. - I think you should probably grab like a slab of chocolate first. Let's try to remove that ball. It's like a game show. Remove that ball! Oh, yep, this is nice. \u266a Scoop-de-doop-doop-Doop \u266a Okay, there we go. - [Devan] You got it. - It's been scoopa-dee-doo-- \u266a De doop doop doop \u266a Wanna cheers it first? - Sure. Three, two, one. - Whoa. This thing here-- (evil laugh) - That tasted like a\nsandwich with chocolate! - That was pretty phenomenal, man. - I agree. - With the filling on the inside, combined with peanut butter and jelly, the chocolate on the outside. Woohoo! - All right, let's do this thing. You ready? - You want me to help out at all? - Yeah, definitely. - Do it with the spoons. - That's what I'm gonna do. Three, two, one. Oh, it's very soft. - I gotta say, this is\na resilient egg, bro. - It is, man. I make em good! - I smack it, I smack it hard! - Three, two, one. - Karate chop! Ow. - Tada! - These truffles look\npretty delicious, bro. - Yeah, they look a little dented though. Honestly might've been your spoon. - Couldn't have been. - I think it was. - I don't think it was. - What should we serve us first? - The surprise! - Wait, it has a rope on it? - Yeah, well I don't know if it'll get-- It makes sense with the whole thing. - A pendulum. You're getting sleepy. Hold onto this. - Okay, cool, here we go. Two things here it's a climbing man. - Oh! - He can climb the rope! See, look at that. - Look at that! - Boom! - He's getting to my hand. - So right now it's time to\ntaste the delicious kinder egg. - I think you take one of\nthese massive truffles. - Don't touch, it's mine. - What are you doing? - That's mine. Okay, so listen. Oh, that's uncomfortable. It's like reaching into a pudding. - Yeah, there you go. - Ba-bam! You need to move yours off to the side. - Move my egg? What are you doing? - I help with my foot. (crashing noise) Okay, well I'm gonna try right here. Three, two, one. Oh! Look at that! - Yo! Yes! Three, two, one. Oh! - No! - That was close. - That scared me. I feel like you're doing something wrong. - I made these things, bro. I know what I'm doing, I think. - I don't think so. I have it already open. You hurt your pride\nmore than your fingers. - [Devan] Yeah! - [Collins] There you go! - Look at that, man! Remember I got those geodes on the inside. - Oh! - Yeah! - Oh, dude, I'm over here\nlooking like a prehistoric dude. Three, two, one. Oh! - [Devan] That looks so cool, man! - Here we go, brute strength. Boom! Why does mine look so\nmuch whacker than yours? - I'm gonna dip it into here a little bit. All right, here we go. Three, two, one. This is so good! Holy cow! Wow. Our friends are gonna love this. - If you were only able to eat one of these giant kinder eggs, which one would you wanna eat? Let us know in the comments down below, and we're onto the next giant candy. We've got the giant donut, and the absolutely insane nerds rope. Devan, which one should we eat first? I think let's do yours. - All right, so here's the thing. I'm gonna lift it up, you're\ngonna give it a slice, okay? - Wait, wait, wait, where, where? (yells) - [Collins] Don't try this at home. I don't know why you\nwould, or how you would. - Why is it blue, dude? - You should never cut towards the person. - This looks gross. - Forget this, yeah, wow. - That looks like soggy bread. - Well, that's kinda actually what is was. - I'm a little queasy. - Man up. Grab a fork. - Bring it on, brother. - Clink it. I want the pink! I'm gonna take off, here we go, boom. One of these cotton candy balls. And then put the peeps on the top. - You crazy. - Whoo, it's falling apart! - Are you ready to go, dude? You're stalling. - All right, yep here we go, can't wait. Three, two-- Wait, if you wanna win\na 15 minute video call with Devan and I, text the\nword best to 81800 right now. After the video. Text the word best to 81800. You will automatically\nbe entered in to win. Let's see how this tastes. Three, two, one. - Dude, this is so good! You got a big peep in your mouth. Way to go, man! So many different flavors, this thing-- - It just tasted so good, man! - So good! - I am over the moon with my creation. - Wow, now it's time for the main event. So, Collins, can you move your donut? - Devan, can you move my donut? 'Cause I can't. - It's your donut. - I'm not strong enough. - I'll give it a shot. - Lift it all the way up. Are you actually able to lift this thing? - I think so. - Holy cow. Need more leverage? - Yes, okay! - Holy cow! Dude! - That was definitely very heavy. So, I'm just gonna cut a small part right in the middle here. - What about me, what do I do? - I actually cut yours,\ndo you wanna cut mine? - That would be a pleasure\nand an absolute honor. - Man, these knives are really blunt. - Yep, they are definitely not sharpened. - You might wanna not cut so fast. Reveal the toothpicks. - Check it out, I'm a magician. It's gone. - This is the nerds rope here. - Another toothpick! - I couldn't make it stick, all right? And remember, I made a bunch of different nerds with different flavors. This was cheese popcorn dipped in-- What are you doing? - I want that. - So I'm just gonna\nbreak this guy in half. Wow. - Ooh, that was good. - We gotta split this in half. You know what, I'm just\ngonna pull it apart. Just say some words man, fill the time. - So, Devan's clearly\nstruggling so hard right now. Your hands have been all over that. I don't even wanna eat that anymore. I'ma slice off a new piece for myself. - Are you kidding? This is really not easy, bro. That took you like a solid-- - Oh! - What, what, what, what, what? - Little bit of a oopsie. - [Devan] No! - That's not rubbing away. - Let's get into it, man. Let's eat this thing. Three, two, one. (mumbles with mouth full) - Okay, that one was good. Very good. - They're really good. - I mean it's like, it's a rock. You choose your life,\nbut all together, good. - Dude, all of the flavor profiles in this thing were insane! - That purple one! - I know, but seriously,\nall these were delicious. - Even the popcorn. The flavor profiles were\ndefinitely on another level. Don't worry, we won't be\neating all this by ourselves. We're gonna be sharing all of it with our friends and families. So, you get to comment down below, if you had to eat one\nof these giant candies, which one would it be? You wanna see another video,\nclick right over here. You got five seconds, here we go.

have no idea what black is if you look at it it looks like water I can put my hand in it and it just sinks right in it just like water however it's not water not water it's some type of slime material that whenever you put something into it slowly it will just sink and it will act as a water however when something comes in contact with it extremely fast it acts as a solid so it's gonna be really interesting to see dropping things into it check this up so I have a ball here right got a little ball here and then I'm gonna put it in my hand and now it's water yeah oh it's this away pounds no how am I gonna properly drop this thing oh this is so gonna shatter the first thing we're doing maybe the best item kickers gonna have to watch the entire video to see all the items that we use alright alright you ready dude yeah I'm gonna try my goals for the toilet to land on the bottom you know I don't really know how that's gonna work alright here we go three two one [Music] let's go down let's check the damage okay so we gotta get the toilet out no I got it kind of not really oh my gosh dude Oh pull inflate and three different layers though yeah okay then we're good okay so we might have popped the pool but the two other layers are good can we just look at this toilet roughly I think it looks good and it looks great I mean we could probably return it they functions right it goes down the drain you know perfect it's definitely coming down the drain if you look at the back over here oh yeah perfect and not one scratch done to the pool other than wait you broke it over here but that's it I don't know where the piece of glass went yeah the other half of a toilet I have no idea where it is I don't feel anything is gone also that cone he's not calling there if you guys watch the last video that cone was in there and it's still in there because I tried to get it out for an hour and um well it's still there wait I found the glass I don't know how I'm gonna get it out I got my finger around it just trying not to cut my finger oh dude there's no way there's no way that's coming out no I'm sorry there's no way don't be a little girl I'm pulling as hard as I can oh I got part of it yeah peace the rest is history this is 30 pounds of laughs your steel baby bail feel ready yeah let's say [Music] Oh God come on you got it oh my gosh you weren't joking on this you got a wrestle it's like a wild alligator that hasn't eaten in three months what you mean you just got go slow watch three two what hump I thought you said 35 now how dare you what you got next I got a bath bomb it's shaped like a I don't know it's a gnome you know the gnome alright I get on rapid Oh give me a second oh oh wait nope this is half percent all right here's the other half of his head he

dissolving yeah what what wait what I got a center block holy cow ready yeah they're not getting that one oh dude it's almost disappearing grab it oh my gosh I told you there you go look at these bath bombs by the way wait hold on hold on hold on ready oh that's just nasty oh that's just nasty no that's that's gross no that's just nasty I got a game you see this this is Legos there's a hole in the middle I got a dry bowling ball up there I can drop the bowling ball make it through this what do I get free lunch dinner yeah now it's all yeah there we go let's go stop the bowling balls up there so this is my bowling ball now I didn't do this on purpose I bought this a couple weeks ago because I knew we were filmed it's video however the bowling ball is the same color as the black pool but not that pool but I just think it's cool because it's blue and green and the Oh black pool is Bluegreen all right if I make this take me out to dinner all right I accept McDonald's - oh yeah that's where you were gone nothing above the dollar Minetti [Music] oh no my dance for you all right that's fine try to get it out candy is this the bowling balls only like ten pounds but it's more so the suction of the oblique oh my gosh one use all that muscle all of it not 10% not 20 all of it 105 percent 1-5 I think this is a worse than quicksand I just want to go ahead and point that out all right maybe if I sink my hand and then roll it on top of my head oh my gosh dude you know I'm just gonna pick up this leg over Oh nope nope okay that one's not coming out come on oh oh you got it you actually got it you know what this is this is an Xbox this is an Xbox and it's going into a black void bounce that's pretty cool we should probably go get it yeah Miz I have all my games on their favorite nerf gun dude now if I can throw my biggest fan it's actually not my biggest fan my biggest fans right there this is my second biggest fan I just love her oh it broke we got a watermelon I mean to be fair it does act like a solid so yeah Wow now we gotta clean all that up at you gotta clean that up [Music] go go go go go hurry hurry we're trying to hurry because if we don't go sink to the bottom we're never gonna get out oh there's the plug oh yeah look at the fan dude all right I'm gonna I should probably grab this nerf gun oh oh well that's interesting oh look at the giant chuck coming off yeah I don't think this nerf guns are gonna work anymore oh there's the magazine nice hey James what you got there no it's gone it's gone good luck yeah on the bright side there's some watermelon in the air so that's cool oh my gosh there's a little black in the toilet look I put my hand in here I try to get out hope it's stuck all the toys falling the toilets falling this whoa this is so cool so all the new black that came out of the bottom of the toilet I was like hardened and it feels so weird it's like really smooth like tile it's so weird you can kind of see its cracking a little bit but look if you kind of like chip away at it it's so cool kind of feels like chalk you got it or the mysterious world of blue black hey there it is the front of the fan yeah now why did we get that out if we're just gonna throw it away you ready yeah my pits smell terrible you see normally I would try to do some crazy like loop and go around the backyard and then land in the black but you know I'm not dude perfect so you know it's probably not gonna happen but what I can do is drop it right yeah you definitely aren't dude perfect no but I mean you still made it in the pole here we got the other half of my laptop the cable smashed you guys didn't see that video I pranked her and then she got really mad and ended up breaking my laptop before I could show her that I actually bought her a new laptop and it was just a disaster but this is the other half of it it works it sounds like yep here submersed whoops back they subscribe I messed up subscribe enter subscribe on this video guys oh and also leave a like let's drop it I'll try to do some crazy twirl oh my gosh it's literally it's almost summer it's like almost completely alright and we got a brand new TV literally brand-new as you can see the cord is still bundled up and it still has the plastic wrap on it might as well take the plastic wrap off I mean it's kind of look nice for what it's about - you know all in - this is the most satisfying thing I've ever done ready all right brand-new TV you know for most of these products we've just been dropping them but for this one I think we're just gonna what the flip I missed the pool I mean that was cool too I've missed the pool I didn't mean that I did not do it on purpose I swear I just have terrible and as I've never played baseball and football hello we're playing Jenga no dude it bounced but it's solid logic and now it's thinking we should probably go down there to get all the stuff out of the black I got the laptop no all the way down there who's at the bottom my hands are at the bottom right now so trying to move my hand to the other side but I have to move my hand incredibly slowly otherwise I won't be able to move it oh I love playing with this stuff I mean seriously like you put your hand in it like water and then you punch it and it just doesn't make any sense you know I don't make any sense so I feel like we relate very well other than all the watermelons being in here it's kind of gross if you ever want to know what the inside of a TV it looks like I've been the Oh black do that to the TV I don't know wait oh yeah everybody pull the wire out geez well as you may know we have a lot of cleans to do I have to somehow find a way to dispose a couple thousand pounds of Oobleck the thing is is I can't pick it up so how am I gonna I'll figure it out we're gonna get to cleaning thank you guys so much for watching this video this was a ton of fun if you guys wanted to do more Oobleck let me know I would love to fill my pool with it however I feel like that's also a really bad idea because if I get in it I could actually like drowned and die if I don't get out fast enough so it's like it's literally like quicksand and it's so incredibly demean you saw how much we have struggled in this video and the last video just to pull things out of it and pull our arm out of it if you've got your whole body in it I mean it's like quicksand thank you guys so much well I think it was black is a really cool experiment you guys can do at your house the only thing you need is cornstarch and water now add double the amount of cornstarch that you have water so let's say you have 2 cups of cornstarch and 1 cup of water that's the ingredient you want to have now if you want to make more black just double the ingredients so for example here we had 1200 something pounds of cornstarch and then we turned the the pounds into gallons and then we figured out how many gallons water weighs and we just we put this big nice recipe together and we we made this just a few curious how we made all this but thank you guys so much and also all the you black or all these cornstarch that we ordered was delivered it on 18-wheeler yeah that was fun thank you guys so much before you guys go be sure to click that subscribe button because be dully you're gonna be missing out on all the future content but I'll see you guys soon they're brand new put out

there's too many. (light music) OK, so today we are gonna\nmelt all 100 chocolate bars into the one epic\nchocolate bar, hopefully. Let's get started. I'll move these to the side. Oh no. (pots clanking) I've got a little bit of water. Which I'm gonna start boiling. Um, how do I start this thing? Wow, cool. So I guess I'll just start\nunwrapping the chocolates. I'm just gonna chat with Tasty. You think, Matt, a Tasty\nproducer, should just pop in to make sure I'm doing this right. - Wow, this is a lot. I didn't know there was this\nmany candy bars in the world. - I don't want to mess it up. You don't mind helping? - No, I'd love to. - I'm gonna start throwing\nwrappers on the ground. OK. - Oh. Wow. You know, what a lie. They're supposed to be candy bars. York, that's kind of a weird flavor. - Yeah. It's not gonna taste good, I don't think. - Oh, I've been very excited about this. Oh. I'm into it. Yeah. Are we being exciting and fun? - It's time to start giving\nit a little bit of a mix. - OK, it does look like\n(car honking) literally. - Yeah.\n(laughing) But it'll taste good. This one is chili so it's\ngonna be a little bit spicy. - Mm. This one has cornflakes in it. - Opening some of these is\nbringing back my childhood insecurities of not being able to open up. Watch you do it in one second, one try. (laughing) We're on the home stretch.\n- We are. - And I'm ending with\ngood 'ol Three Musketeers. - All right, classic. - I think that should be stirred. But I don't think it will all fit. So why don't I get another bowl. Wow, sensual. So I'm gonna go back up and shoot. But once this is fully\nmelted pour that one into one of those and then let them chill in the fridge or freezer. - Not this one. - OK, got it. So I'll check back on you later, right? - Yes, please do. Chocolate soup. Chocolate soup. You guys want to try it? So delicious. It tastes like frosting. - It's very minty. - Think it would fit in this? We're just gonna do it. There's some interesting\nchunks at the bottom of this. Some wafer, peanuts. You're right, this is a good size. I'll get this one going. This one does have different bars. You can tell. Alright. Put it in the refrige. Oh if I make it safely. So while the other\nchocolate is getting cold, I'm gonna melt this chocolate. I don't have anything to\nsay while it's melting. (crickets chirping) Oh, it's solid. - Yeah I'll just rest it on my bump. And then head off. I don't feel super good\nabout this next step. Let's go, upstairs,\nmaybe Matt will be there and he'll help us. We found him, he's up\nhere, he's making sushi. I think I need a big sheet pan. Yeah. - Well wait. So you're taking the one\nfrom the freezer on to here. - OK. - Oh yeah, look at that. Let's put a little pool\nof it in the center. I'm feeling good. I think we're good to go. Three, two, one. Wow. - It's pretty on this side. - Yeah, now I think you\nshould do the honors. - OK, oh, wow. It worked out like the right amount. How did that happen? - So now I say that we\nput it into the fridge. - So are you gonna come\nback and eat it in an hour? - I will try part of it. - Ta-da! Matt come look at this. It did crack a little. But you know, I still\nfeel like it's beautiful. Alright, going for it. Mm, taste great. - Oh do I have to do it too? It's like chewy on the inside. - This is delicious. Oh it's kind of peanut buttery. - I'm getting coconut too. And a little bit of everything. - Alright guys! - Oh. - [Everyone] Wow! (laughing) - Well, see ya. - This is good. - It's great. - Legit. It's happy hour. - Today when the day started,\nI did not expect to be here. - Yep. - But we did it.

smelling 98 dollars one of the dollars was to some charity thingy which was great are they yes I'll do the dollar thingy and then there was some like tax and stuff so it was like 99 something basically a hundred dollars okay I'm just being accurate to be honest I always go into candy stores to like browse but I never actually buy anything but because I was making this video I was like okay I gotta go ham I'm about everything and I literally did this is all from its sugar this is not sponsored at all I paid for this $100 of candy I got so many things you guys don't even know I cannot show you guys everything imma show this all to you and then i'ma taste it later can I just give a little shout-out to the employee that works there she was so nice like so helpful so sweet we have ended up talking and I told her about my on YouTube channel and then this is all for like a video so that she didn't think that it was like all for me which it kind of is but y'all this is my excuse to eat a ton of candy and she was so nice I ended up giving her at my um YouTube channel and she said that she was gonna check it out when I post I was like it'll be posted smart girl literally just such a nice person girl if you're watching this you know who you are I forget your name well I didn't even ask for your name so I don't know your name but you were so nice and I love you and I just love nice people but yes anyways I'm so touched you guys everything I got this is so exciting like I love doing hauls y'all know that dollar store haul that I posted y'all were so into and thank you so much so I was like I need to do another haul kandi yeah I'm so surprised it's not cracked yet my luck but before we start y'all going for you to hit that subscribe button to become a juicy red tomato maybe even like a candied tomato is there such a thing as a candy tomato if there are candy tomatoes out there I'm gonna make you know I'm gonna make me a candied tomato also hit that notification bell if you wanna get notified every time I post a new video so let's just get into this I'm gonna talk about every item I got why I got it the price too by the way oh this is just my own review and haul and my own opinion so if you have different opinions don't get upset first of all this back is huge it's laid me i neva no candy stores head back this big but apparently they do let's Mary Poppins if y'all let me just reach in and find something so birthday I got when I was a kid I was obsessed with these I don't remember what they taste like but there's literally just like dots of candy on a paper and something about that looks so magical I don't know what it is but I love it um these are the mega buttons though like y'all they were small ones too but then I saw these and I was like I'm just gonna member ones hello look why not it comes with three sheets blue yellow orange oh wait they're all different flavors I forgot about this like I said I haven't have you since I was a kid so I didn't know that there's different flavors cherry orange lemon and raspberry oh my gosh Barry's gonna taste so good they were 399 uh I think the small one was like 199 or something like that uh but like candy stores like you're not gonna find like the cheapest candy in a candy store so I mean don't expect it you know 18 of these dots are only 35 calories damn like honestly no that's good I can eat this with my lunch just kidding eat actual food this is a nice little snack though um well yeah oh my gosh I just cannot wait to taste these because I truly think they're gonna just take me back what even is this though it contains egg whites okay so is it almost like a meringue I don't know I'm excited I cannot wait to taste those next up y'all okay so this is by its sugar first we just talked about it sugar yeah so these are both by the actual candy store which impressed me I didn't know the candy stores made their own candy I thought they just carried like everyone else's candy oh I don't know these things this is mikage sugar yeah it is a marshmallow pop so it looks like a lollipop it she I've never had one of these in my life I assume it tastes like a marshmallow but I'm excited just because it looks magical it looks like something that would come from Narnia or but like I have a magical ABS oh uh it's 349 which I think I mean for a marshmallow that's a little pricey but you know it's candy store like I said um and okay wait this is enough for two people it has two servings in it so the whole thing is 240 I mean it is pure marshmallow so but it looks good y'all it

so far oh okay so I saw this at the candy store and I think I've seen this in like other stores - it is a very candy store ish there's a few items in there that are kind of like mainstream not so

like oh my god that is so fancy I'm the owner of like a nice purse why so each of little gummies have like a little hole in them and I think you just squirt this sour pen juice into them and then you eat it so it's like a little cup I have never tried these in my life they look so good I love like sour ish gummy candies but I only like sour candy dipped if they're like gummy I don't like like warheads that they're too much but this looks really good ah so the price was 350 which i think is a lot for this but whatever is the candy store like I said I will keep saying that I just feel like candy stores have at different prices then like the cans you buy at like the grocery store either I mean it's like whatever that's just how it is I guess the calories overall the feed this whole thing it's 200 so I mean this was on sale it was 50% off the girl told me and I was like I'm gonna grab that yeah it is milk chocolate filled with Reese's peanut butter so it's basically like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but in the form of like a filled chocolate bar I've never heard that before I think it looks so good looking at you guys that looks so good it was $5.99 which is a lot but like I said it was 50% off so I got it for like $3 I'm so happy about that this oh whoa okay this this is a thousand calories if you use the whole thing I mean it is chocolate which is more than other candies I mean you can share it also this is giant so this is not like a single serving you know but it looks delicious I cannot wait to break this open like Charlie from the chocolate back to me and be like oh I'm gonna dig it ma'am by the way I thought some other candies at the candy store like I thought Japanese candy and like fast food candy and all those different candy and I was like oh my

teeth into it okay this next one is my face because it's called sugar daddy is it for me I didn't even know there was a candy called sugar daddy if I did I would have eaten it my whole life it's some sort of lollipop but made out of milk caramel I have no clue what its gonna taste like I don't even know what it is honestly but I got it cuz of the name you guys like this name is iconic it was $1.99

this is a chocolate frog from Harry Potter and I think it's literally just a chocolate shaped frog I don't know baby it's filled with something that's what I'm hoping maybe like some green slime or something that'll be really cool but I have no clue if it is or not um the whole thing is only ninety calories that's really good and it was 399 399 for a piece of chocolate but it is a Harry Potter item so I mean hello also it comes with a collectible wizard card on my wall what a frames are if I picked 399 for I'm gonna frame that Bobby tide see what it's all about what it tastes like I'm expecting something delicious so I hope so next up you guys my childhood goal was to have one of these like you always see people like licking them and like Willy Wonka and stuff and honestly it's just so magical now I think I have tried one in my teenage years I don't know I think I did and if I can remember correctly I think it didn't have much taste but this is by it sugar so maybe it has a real good taste I don't know it's apparently cherry flavored which is amazing I love cherry everything so it's called rainbow cherry lollipop and it was $5.99 you know I mean yeah this is like one of those novelty items you're like I have one of these like this is for like Instagram pictures like you got three servings in it and the whole lollipop is 672 i calories i trudge calculate but I decide to taste this it's gonna be so qiyamah be uh okay next um well there's still a lot we got god I got a can of worms it's like a joke because of like the same don't open a can of worms or it's like something like that right well this is a can of gummy worms I thought it was so cute such cute packaging I will snatched by it and I didn't check the price until afterwards it's a dollar oh my gosh and this is $7.99 so this is one penny more than the giant Hershey's kiss let me just say they better be like the best gummy worms ever they look really good but they look like normal so I hope that there's something special how do you even open this I don't know oh it's taped okay whatever open it later by the way yo I think this videos gonna be really long and I'm thinking like y'all if it's too long I might have to split this into two parts I don't know I will make a choice after I'm done showing you guys all these items I got a giant gummy bear I had to you guys like these are iconic they're always at candy stores and it's watermelon flavored I love watermelon like watermelon flavoring tastes nothing like an actual watermelon but I just love the fake flavoring like I love that this was $7.99 as well just like the other two items but it's really really heavy like it feels like a lot of gumminess in here like it's heavy I could lift weights with this but I don't lift weights the whole thing is 1,200 calories and it's literally one serving this is you're supposed to eat this all me if I just really want to like buy into it just like stretch it oh my god I cannot wait um okay okay we have two more of these lollipops I would have to try all the different flavors and stuff so I got I got three yep this one's smaller and pink this one is cotton candy lollipop I didn't see that and this one was only 250 so I think it's a much better price than the big one and the calories only 298 so it's also a lot less calories this just looks delicious concavity usually is on my favorite flavor of everything I like cherry more but I think it's gonna taste really really good and then we have this long rainbow one it is oh it's a cherry one two so these are the same flavor okay so I got to the same thing but this was 250 well 249 and the calories on this are I don't think it says does not thing I don't see anyway whatever so yeah I got a lot of your lollipops just oh my god so I saw these in the store and I was like I have never heard of Binney before they're sour tornadoes I have no clue what they are but they're Benji almost like a licorice they just looked delicious

generation oh but it's a cell phone it doesn't work obviously it is full of candy they're called cell towers queue there 399 which I mean you know it's like you buy this more for like the phone like it's cute it has 18 servings in it but each serving is only 10 calories so it's 180 calories if you use the whole thing apparently they're just smart fruit flavored candies they're smart can you solve this equation piece of candy I am to try these just because I have no clue what they're gonna take like they're on a cell phone better taste like the future okay next we got oh oh okay so these pop rocks are bubblegum what I had no clue that pop rocks made bubble gum it turns into gum after it pops I guess um I love the sensation of pop rocks and if there's a gum version I was oh my god I was like yes I'm all-in I forget the price and it doesn't say it on here so but it was probably very cheap let's just take a little pocket I just have to chew this I think that's gonna be super interesting to try I also got a Charleston chew yow I've never had this in my life I have heard of it but look I've never had it it was 249 apparently it is weave vanilla it just says vanilla what is it it's vanilla that's it and it also says try frozen oh wait here we go it says chewy flavored and nougat with a delicious chocolate coating so it's not just vanilla this looks vintage it's 230 calories for the whole table time and it feels pretty big I'm excited to try that I got these little Valentine's little sweetheart things that say different things on them it's so cute and when you're supposed to give them to the love of your life it says to and from so I'm gonna give them to my BAE after I taste them I'll give them an open box I used to love these as a kid I stopped them all the time but I haven't had these probably in like literally like 15 years carnival I decide to taste these they were how expensive where is the price tag it is I have one their primary cheapest is tiny and light and you know um the whole box is 100 calories playing Wow okay no it's makes those now y'all I do not support smoking whatsoever I don't think it's good for you you know and I've literally never smoked anything in my whole life I'm very proud of that don't smoke ever thank you but y'all this is bubblegum cigarettes when I was a kid I remember these were so popular and we used to get them no I don't know what the purpose of it is I'm like what why but I'm to taste them just to see what it tastes like because they are bubblegum so they should taste good they are $2.49 and I cannot see the calories because the price tag is covering it I'm excited to taste these oh my god you guys so many flashbacks right now when I was a kid I used to have these all the time they are literally like little bottles of juice contained in these little wax bottles it's so weird you like bite off the tip and then you drink it and then you chew it like you chew the bottle I don't know if I'm gonna do that it does not look that appetizing but the juice inside does I just remember loving the juice inside so much when I was a kid so I guess it's kind of like God I don't well okay it doesn't stay gum anywhere but it sets of Xuan so I'm like okay want to be gum I don't know I got it from the liquid inside they were $1.99 great price and each of the bottles is five calories yeah okay y'all that's good like Chum is like take a shot yeah now I also have razzle tea guys okay still fun fact I have never had rattles in my life when I saw them in the candy store I was like oh my god those are from 13 going on 30 if y'all know what I'm talking about they're always eating Razzles I'm always like oh my god those look so good so apparently it's like candy that turns into gum so many like weird candy gum like mutants going on is this like the x-men but like the government they look delicious I love like the packaging of stuff like it makes you want to eat it honestly there's 11 flavor

subscribe to become tomato", "7xt3Evjb4N8": "Hi, everyone. Byron Martin here at Logee's Greenhouses, and today we're going to be talking about Begonias. Begonias, actually, have been part of Logee's for a long time.\nIt was my family that got involved in them in the 1920s, so it's been about 100\nyears that we've been cultivating and hybridizing this\ngenus, or this family, of plants. And begonias really have a\ngreat place, in terms of indoor horticulture\nfor houseplants, and also in terms of their use in ornamental horticulture\nfor bedding plants, and in tropical areas for outdoor landscaping. Basically, within the begonia family, or Begoniaceae, the begonias-- that's the genus that we grow--\nare grouped into several different types, and those types have their\ncharacteristics, as well as their cultural needs,\nand their ability to grow, say, in the home or not.\nSome plants-- some begonias-- are very sensitive; others are really hardy.\nThere are begonias that actually grow in arid areas, almost like desert plants--\nspinosa is one, peltatifolia is another one--\nwhere they take tremendous amounts of drought stress, and you can imagine\nthat in the home situation, that's perfect, because if you don't water them\nthey're fine, and you can go on for weeks without water and they're fine. So, within the groupings, we have the Rex Begonias,\nand these are begonias with very brilliant colored leaves,\nand they're quite showy. They have some downsides to them, in that they do go\ninto a winter dormancy, so they can actually almost go back into\nthe rhizome, and that's the stem that's creeping along the ground.\nMost rex begonias are rhizomatous in their\nstructure, but not so much in the way they flower. And then we have the\nRhizomatous group, and actually that's one of my favorites,\nmainly because they are so enduring. One of the most famous in the\nrhizomatous group of begonias is Erythrophylla or Erythrophylla Helix, also known\nas the Beefsteak Begonia and there are people that have had those for\n50 to 60 years, passed along from generation to\ngeneration; they just don't die. I mean, they take the stress of the home and\nlack of water, and so on, and lower light. Then there's Fibrous; and we will look at\nsome of those-- those are actually the angel-wing types.\nAnd then we have these oddball ones like this one, right here. This is Richardsianna or partita, and these are the\nsemi-tuberous or caudiciform ones, and you can see, right\nhere, the caudex that's forming at the base of the\nplant. And these can be used for bonsai culture, as well as just\nindoor plants that have kind of a crazy structure to them. This\none hasn't been pruned back because we're harvesting\nseed off of it, but you can trim them back so the caudex is more\nvisible. And, they're really a dry-land begonia;\nI mean, they take long periods of dryness, that's part of the caudex\nstructure on them. So, within the rhizomatous group--\nand \"rhizomatous\" meaning, obviously, they have rhizomes. You can see the very large\nrhizome on this older plant, right here. Most of them are that way, and some have\na little bit more upright habit to them, but there's many different color forms\nand structures to them. This one has a black leaf with a curly\nspiral to it. This is a hybrid that came off of bowerae, called\nKitkat, and you can see that it's just turned into this\nhuge plant, but the tiny leaves. And, also, they make great basket plants. You\ncan imagine that plant clipped on a hanger, and hanging up, and\nit would do very well. This is a hybrid we did call Solar Flare;\nit actually gets redder, depending upon the light level. And\nthat's the other thing about many begonias, is they can change--\nparticularly rhizomatous and rexes-- they can actually change their color\nfrom season to season, to the point where we sometimes get, in\nour 'Autumn Ember,' really deep oranges, and this time of\nyear, the greens come in because of the high light level that they're being\ngrown under. There's a famous one we did. It's made it\nto the big-times, in terms of the trade. This is 'Marmaduke.'\nIt's a very large one; you can see the size of the leaves. And it can get much\nbigger than this, particularly if it's grown in bedding\noutside. But it has this chartreuse leaf, and you can see the green coming in it\nfrom the highlight, and then it has the bronze, or\nburgundy, spotting on it. We did talk about rexes. There's one called 'Satin\nJazz.' I believe this might have been a hybrid\nof Mike Kartuz's, out in California. And, 'Satin Jazz' is\na little bit different than many of the rexes, in that\nit doesn't really go dormant; it never drops its leaves, and it pretty much\nstays together throughout the season. Has a\nlittle bit more of an upright habit to it. Talking about fibrous, this is the famous one done by\nPat Worley many years ago; this is Begonia 'Looking Glass,'\nstill a very strong and vigorous grower, and it has been\nin the trade for quite a while, and grown freely in tropical areas, as well as for\na houseplant. There's another rex begonia; this was\ndone by Mike Kartuz years ago- this is 'Fireworks.'\nIt's kind of a small plant right now, but they get much bigger.\nThese will get twice as big as that. But, beautiful coloration on it,\nand it's been a stable in the world of rex begonias for a very long time.\nMike has done quite a bit in terms of his life's hybridizing.\nSo, we talked about rexes. Originally, they came from\nspecies. And, there was rex-cultorum which came into the, I think, in the 1800s\nand they started hybridizing that. And, the interesting thing about rexes is,\nthey have a flower stalk that comes up with just a few flowers on the top; not\nterribly showy. This is 'Sizemoreae' and this is really\nvery much in the rex- coltorum type, in that it has a rhizome;\nit also has a-- it has a hairy leaf, but it also has\nthat same flower structure that most of the\noriginal rexes had. Then there's these begonias with\nthese wrinkled leaves on them. This is 'Gehrtii.' It's almost like alligator skin, or such things as that.\nAnd this one is fairly easy to grow, as far as a\nspecies goes, but it is really more like a rhizomatous,\nif we wanted to group it as such. These are some of the hybrids\nthat we're working with in the rhizomatous group, right now.\nThere's some very interesting color forms that actually come out of this.\nHere's one, here, that has that kind of veining in it, or\ncheckerboarding, with red leaves, and you can see there's actually a green star in\nthe middle of it. And then there's plants with these\nbeautiful chartreuse leaves. This one we probably won't go forward\nwith, only because it's not as strong. When we're breeding, we try to pick the\nmost vigorous we can to go forward, but we can still use that\ngenetically to bring color into the hybrids. So, here's another hybrid that we did with a very interesting leaf color to it.\nYou can see it's chartreuse to golden with black veining, undulating leaves to it, and it's got a beautiful form. It's a nice,\nlittle, round plant. The petioles on the leaves are very short.\nI think this is going to be something that's worth growing as a houseplant\nfor color. And, also, we have to remember that the rhizomatous are actually quite\nshowy, in terms of their bloom. This is off-season; we're in the middle\nof the summer, but occasionally we have them flower off-season. You can see the\nflowers on a rhizomatous. They come up and they form this crown of male and female flowers that, most of them are pink- we have some white ones that have pink in there, varying in shades of pink, so, some are\ndarker, some are lighter, and that happens during the winter time.\nSo, if you're growing them in the house, it's best to try to keep the plants in what we call 'normal photo period.' You want to keep\nthem away from a lot of continuous lighting, so they sense that decrease, and that stimulates the flowers on them. Here's a great example of a rex begonia.\nNow this is probably a lot less, in terms of color, than\nmost rexes are, because it's, you know, silver spotted, green leaves, and so on.\nBut, this is, really, an indestructible. There\nare a few of them-- 'Helen Teupel' is another-- just can't kill it. It just survives. I've\nseen them on coffee tables in the middle of living rooms, living there for years,\nthese begonias, and they seem to be pretty nearly indestructible.\nYou've got to choose the right variety, but 'Francis Valentine' is one and, as I mentioned,\n'Helen Teupel' is another. And then, we have the grouping\nof fibrous, and this is really a kind of a mixed bag of many different\nthings. I would assume this is probably\nconsidered a fibrous. This is one of the hardy begonias; these\nactually can be grown outside in warmer zones, but\nfreezing zones they go back into their rhizomes in the wintertime, and just kind\nof sit there; and then come out in the springtime.\nColoration is usually green; not terribly showy.\nWe have one called 'Snow Capped.' This would be an Angel Wing variety.\nAnd 'Cracklin' Rosie'-- this is a famous one in terms of its color. Actually has\nspotting to it, but the spotting can actually\nbe pink, and very ruffled leaves. I spoke about\nsome of the begonias that have tremendous drought stress on them\nbecause they come out of very arid areas. 'Kalamani' is another one like that, and it\nhas what's called a peltate leaf to it. We see the petiole goes right into the\ncenter; it makes, almost, like a spider web on it.\nthis is a very, very hardy begonia, in terms of drought stress.\nAnd then, here, we have a fibrous one called 'Odorata'\nor 'Odorata Rosea' there's a pink form of it. And these, actually, have 'Odorata'--\nmeaning, has fragrance to it-- and there are some begonias that have quite a bit\nof fragrance. The hanging variety 'Solananthera' is a\ngreat plant, winter blooming, that has a tremendous amount of fragrance to it. You\nstick your nose into it and it's quite sweet,\nas does 'Odorata.' And this is actually grown as a\nbedding plant in tropical/sub-tropical areas where it grows very fast, very\nvigorous, and puts on a huge display of flowers. And so, as we were talking about, like,\nwhat is it? So, this one is kind of a Rhizomatous-Rex-Fibrous all mixed together in one, but it's probably\nmore classified as a rhizomatous, I would think.\nThis is 'Connie Boswell' which has these beautiful leaves.\nAnd they're silver with pink in them. However, Connie\nis a little challenging to grow. This is something that you definitely\nwant to try after you've started in the world of begonias,\nbecause it does have a winter-time slump to it,\nand and you have to be aware of that, and then\ntreat it as such. This 'Charles Jaros' is very similar in structure\nand form, and this came off of a hybrid off of diadema\nand deliciosa, with that same upward growth\nand the very sharply pointed leaves. This is an old favorite.\nThis is 'Elaine' and 'Elaine' has been around forever.\nThis is an angel-wing begonia grown as-- can be grown as a basket,\nor as an upright potted plant; kind of an upright and cascading\nhabit; two in one. You can see the flowers on it; it's\nactually been cut back, these are our mother plants, but\nit will flower all summer for you. It's not something as fast as\n'Cotton Candy' or 'Dragon Wings' in terms of the\nflowering you have to give it more time in terms of\ngetting it into its fullness. So, it's not something you buy in the springtime, put\nit in a pot, and have it turn into anything. You have to\ngive it a good season, but, it flowers for months, for us.\nThere's an old hybrid that we have. This came back to us via a customer. This\nis 'Pinafore.' It's a hybrid that goes back into\nprobably the 1950s, I would say. Pink flowers on it; it's an Angel Wing\ntype, but very compact. It was one that was done here at Logee's\nmany years ago. Oh, I spoke of 'Helen Teupel' and there she\nis. And you can see the coloration is a little more muted than\nmany rexes, but as I said, you can't kill her. She\nis just the toughest thing around, and really doesn't have that winter dormancy,\neither, I mentioned, on it. 'Madame Queen' is a famous-- this is when we\nget to the spirals and the ruffled leaves-- 'Madame Queen'\nis a rhizomatous type. It's kind of a big grower, but you can see the leaves have\nall that crinkling in them; bronze with a red background on it,\nor kind of a bronzy-green with a red background on it. And, a strong grower;\nit's been around for decades; I'm not sure when the hybrid was done on that. And then, in the world of begonias, there are plants that are--\nwhatever-- fibrous; I don't know. But, this is 'Foliosa'--\na great basket plant; I guess you could probably call it fibrous.\nIts weeping habit-- and, there have been massive specimens of this\nused in botanical gardens-- and, it really is a great plant. I mean, it goes along\nfor on for a long time. Flowers aren't too spectacular; just\nthese tiny, little ones. But, the foliage is very dense, and it just\nweeps as it goes over. You can imagine this hanging from the crotch of a tree in a\ntropical rainforest, just cascading down many, many feet on old\nplants. Then, this is a fibrous-- another fibrous\nbegonia; very compact habit. Pink flowers; they come through most of the summertime. Called Lubbersii, which is a species, and it's been a good, strong grower. We've had\nit around for many, many years. Right here, we have another really cool\nbegonia, hispida cuculliifera, which is an old, old species. You can see it has a\nleaf, a green leaf, kind of furry, and then little leaflets come out\nall along the leaf itself, and it's really a great grower.\nOne of the old, old, old rhizomatous, which is\nErythrophylla Helix. There's a beefsteak begonia; this is the spiral\nbeefsteak begonia. And, as I said, decades these have lived in\nhomes and been passed down from generation to generation.\nThere's the curly form. Here is the plain green form. This is probably more known than the spiraled one, this is the beefsteak begonia. Begonias have been in the Logee's family\nfor over a hundred years. Their texture and color brings beauty and form to both the indoor and outdoor garden. If you would like if you would like more information, visit us\nat logees.com.    ", "gm3WDogH4LQ": "hello and welcome to crumbs and doilies HQ and today I'm going to show you how to make clumps what if lumps there these I forgot already how to play the long thing they are soft pillowy pastel colored twisted ropes of marshmallow nailed it now before you get going it's a good idea to get a few bits and bobs prepared because marshmallow sets really quickly so you're gonna need to work quite quickly as well so I've got three piping bags with round nozzles already in there three bowls with three spatulas some color paste some toothpicks and then the coating which is the most important bit and that is just 150 grams of icing sugar and 100 grams of corn flour is sifted don't need any of this stuff just yet so I'm going to put it to one side clear the deck and go on with the next bit now the next bit to do is to bloom the gelatin and that means just dissolving your gelatin in some cold water and letting it soften and I have 24 grams of powdered gelatin here I'm just going to sprinkle that over 120 milliliters of cold water and just give that a little stir and then that just needs to sit for five minutes just to absorb and do its thing the next thing to do is to make your sugar syrup so I've got a small pan here and I'm gonna put 150 grams of caster sugar and I'm gonna add 90 grams of liquid glucose and this is an invert sugar syrup this will just help stop the sugar from crystallizing you can use corn syrup you can even use golden syrup or honey but the golden syrup and honey will give it a much much sweeter flavor [Music] and I'm also gonna add 60 milliliters of water and I'm going to set that over a medium-low heat and what I'm gonna be getting it to you is 116 degrees and it's really important not to take it any further than that because what you'll end up with is like chewing gum marshmallows which is really horrible to eat and to weather with so don't take it any further than 116 and make sure you use a thermometer when your thermometer reads about 106 it's time to just get a couple of things ready I've already microwaved my gelatin which it bloomed earlier just to be liquefied so it's all melted and I'm gonna put that into my mixer along with another 90 grams of liquid glucose and then just put that on the lowest possible speed on your mixer just to keep it moving while you wait your sugar syrup [Music] right that's 116 and now I need to pour it into my gelatin and liquid glucose in a similar way to how I make Italian meringue and if you wanna know how to make that then please click on the link on the screen now basically you just pour it very very carefully down the side of the bowl making sure you don't touch the whisk so the hot sugar syrup mix with the gelatin once you whip it all up creates loads and loads of air which is perfect for marshmallows and that's all my sugar syrup in so now I just need to turn my mixer up to you a medium speed and set my timer for five minutes [Music] right that's five minutes so it's looking really pale really okay gets tripled in volume but it still got a ways to go so I'm going to speed up a little bit more and set it for another five minutes all right that's another five minutes this is a good point at which to add flavor I'm gonna discard two teaspoons of vanilla extract you can use any kind of flavor extract that you want and then just keep beating up for another two minutes so my marshmallow is ready and the consistency is similar to meringue but with a bit more kind of elasticity it's ready to go but it's setting all the time so now it's time to color it because I want to be very quick when I'm coloring my marshmallow I've asked some friends to help me Rosie and Sophie let's get going and once your color is evenly distributed pop your mixture into a piping bag if you don't have friends to help you that is absolutely fine you're just gonna have to work a little bit quicker than us when you're piping bags ready you need to dust your surface with your cornflour and item sugar mixture liberally and now it's time to pipe your ropes and you need to apply a nice even pressure and make sure your ropes are all the same length [Music] and what wait wait for further instructions once you put all your rapes out you just need to give them a light dusting of your corn flour coating and once that's done you just need to wait a little while between 30 and 45 minutes until they're tacky rather than sticky let's go have a cup of tea all right these have been sitting here drying out for a little while about 45 minutes and they're still quite sticky but they have dried out quite a bit and they're much more easy to handle so now I'm gonna start twisting them and this is definitely the most difficult bit it's very very delicate if you've had any air bubbles in your rope they're likely to break there so you've got to be very very careful so the first thing to do is to ease your ropes off one by one and grab one of each color and lay them down next to each other now if you feel like you've got a bit too much corn flour and icing sugar just brush it some of it away you don't want it to cake itself onto your grapes but now with them all lined up at one end I'm gonna grab a toothpick and attach them together and now you need to pick up the other end and just gently kind of twist it into place being really careful not to pull it and there's definitely you can definitely twist it too much which will cause it to tear and you can definitely twist it to you little which won't let it stick to itself there's a kind of a sweet spot in the middle and I think I've got it and now I need to attach the other end to itself using another toothpick and I just need to keep going until it twisted all your flaps [Music] [Music] [Music] right that's all my plans twisted up and I think they look pretty cool but they are in danger of unraveling if you try and eat them now so ideally what you do is leave them for 24 hours I normally transferred into a baking sheet that I've just dusted with my coating and just unfortunately be patient lucky for me I made some yesterday so I don't have to wait 24 hours to in my flubs Wow and they're really soft and pillowy and slightly creamy and texture which you definitely don't get from shop bought like mass-produce marshmallows mmm yummy and I've been totally transported in time back to my top chocolate school oh so easy by the bag load YUM well if that's whetted your appetite for marshmallow ring then you can check out my last video marshmallows by clicking on the link and if you have a flunkey memory or you know a childhood sweet that you really really miss let me know in the comments box below and if you have a friend who really misses flumps than math share this recipe with them I'll be back next week meanwhile subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in the game another recipe", "I32RTPljszY": "[Laughter] look back with another video we're gonna be making a rope solely out of fruit by the foot and seeing how much it can hold yeah we colors too so this is why I like math 72 oh that's already - this is already two boxes oh dear I think we braid some together okay and then we braid the braids together to strengthen em more yeah I see what you're saying these are all let's see if we can set the camera down oh that's a terrible idea that's such a bad idea trick shot off the wall no the only person who's actually gravity beat this mat and we can't tell Matt no because it's technically his money also guys if you don't know this that's the new producer for rat welcome I wanted to get rid of Tanner so bad that he got fired I think what we're gonna have to do is literally lay like ten of these on top of each other like flat yeah I was thinking like cuz let's do some math - math 36 times 5 is 180 so if we lay that like 10 to a strand and then braid it those three together that'd be 30 when we do that five times and then braid the fly together that is a hundredweight horn mess I don't know like I have to lick can I lick them all to stick them together oh they're already sticky alright so let's do this I'm rolling them out like this leaving him on the leaving them on the thing and then what we'll do is pull this one out oh okay smart way let's do ten on one okay and then braid it from there so we've done three each of these have ten we kind of smushed them together so nice I ate some so we didn't so we're gonna twist these and make like a little tiny rope all three of them and then we're gonna braid them all together to make a bigger rope and we're gonna repeat that process yeah I repeat and then as soon as we break this Aladdin rubbed other ones and I'll be dead and repeat it all right off-camera we should put some glue on these on camera guys we should have put some glue on this too maybe we don't twist it maybe we just break let's just literally like to squeeze like this yeah yeah make it into a rope okay oh yeah I guess it's not sticking shoot all right how do we do this all right I say we lay them out and then we braid them together like this like a hair braid yeah yeah that works I think this is gonna work yeah the maple kind yeah the middle good yup the maple kind yeah oh yeah this is gonna ha dude this is gonna I feel like this might work I think it's might work too which is kind of scaring me this actually looks super sick I don't know if y'all could see from like the top view cuz I'm just holding it come here audience look at that that looks like a good braid this is all four by the foot that's wild wild rough okay so that's one so I think we do this again and then we braid the braids together I agree this is a short rope though yeah this is a really short rope actually do we need to extend it maybe but half what we would do is just interlace them I mean you could just hold it up like this just like hold about it doesn't have to go over there this I have to go talk actually yeah you're right no I say leave we just make the this size but the freakin thickest strongest rope we can make that's not kind of thing because I think that will work I don't know if we just if it was just this size and we try to lift up a weight or something I don't think it'd hold so let's make two more of these braids together and then see what we're left with deal okay we have been here for about four hours now actually really only took us about 20 minutes feels like it with this kid it does we made three ropes so we just decided because we have so much extra left that we're gonna make a fourth rope and then we're gonna wrap them together we're gonna braid them together and then we're gonna use the remaining 50 to wrap all those four together around it hopefully or is it gonna work your guess is as good as mine comment down below if you guys think it's gonna work he's gotten four done there's two on the bottom two on the top this is just so colorful they actually look really cool I got better as we went this is the last one we did and look how cool that one looks that's crazy so you have these much less these much left that looks nice that no solid oh we have these that we're gonna wrap the rope with and yeah just like one at a time just wrap it just to kind of keep these together and then we'll figure out a way to attach it to a bucket later we laid out all of the fruit by the foot what we're gonna do is put these on this roll it and hopefully they stay together well see ya is that that uh we'll see like a burrito wait wait oh I wanted to like at least put some white water on this interesting let's do this how I feels weird that's really good watch just make them completely elastic actually I just think the same thing no they're gonna get stick yeah they all get so those are sticky for sure okay okay okay okay let's all this actually looks so appetizing though oh we lost two then we you think we should press it now yeah we can wear it on top so hey we just did the tit 0.20 offer by the front of their okay we got the fruit roll-up baby this thing is easily way more than a hundred layer 102 roll-ups so they only testing this here bucket on this road Danny are you okay bud topping it yeah I got hit in the head with the bucket on it coming through bucket you got some talent I didn't touch you we're gonna be putting different weights of fruit in this bucket to test to see how much this fruit roll-up rope actually can hold five pounds five pounds I did the math 35 pounds comment down below what you guys think is the is the winner threshold I guess you could say yeah throw that are you guys wait you guys be the ones to hold the rope Oh sticky all right corner Bob dace stop eating it we got to do it for this why do you may know how to eat high it's like making dinner and throwing it away at understand Tanner you're literally gonna bend it to the point where I can't even all right oh yeah one piece of the edge is gonna make it sort of Camden alright so right now we have one apple in there Wow so pairing this stuff it's confirmed good it's good probe good this is laying we're here can you pull it straighter let's put the ones in there now all right now we got another that's a grapefruit okay it is annoying let's put this let's put this cantaloupe in there all right we got a coconut and they got a coconut all right that's easily like what five pounds five pounds easily easily we got bananas Oh bunny in a 100 times plausible okay good we're good it's gonna pull it out that way more pull it out ready yeah there you go we got a honeydew melon that's a coconut that's a coconut whoa-oh strong take a look in there Mitch we got a pineapple yo hey it's starting to flex this is strong though it's starting to flex okay now again you see it Netflix all right again the watermelon in there how's that gonna work Oh Lex oh my gosh it's working holding she's impressive but on top of it it's flexing pull it up I'm trying oh oh my foot put that other thing on here the other bucket put another bucket all right Wow my hands are gross all right now the grossest Gunter's forehead all right lift it up like if you agree yellow baby oh my gosh dude this is a strong rope oh it's starting to rip oh boy oh boy straighten it out string it out let go strong news we didn't you put the bite of a sunder Neath it but we found out the strength wait give me a piece can I eat it now yeah you can eat more genuinely disgusting dude look how thick that is though I don't know how you guys are eating this I literally put it together and I cannot eat this what it's disgusting Oh whenever gonna break a watermelon tack I'll reverse the fruit yeah mr. banana dude it actually cut in half oh you uh guys Benny make sure you check out this

I gotta redeem myself. I'm in! - Alright! - I'm in.\n- Nice, nice! - Is Cory playing? - Cory... is... not playing! - Oh, I'm in!\n- Oh, I'm definitely in now. - I'm in. - Okay, we've got our three competitors. Before we start the contest,\ncheck out this sweet video. - [Narrator] The breakfast\npastry you know and adore has been re-imagined with\nthe flavor and texture of the gummy goodness you know and adore to create a colossal\ncandy coated in frosting, and showered with sprinkles. Start your day off right\nwith a breakfast treat sugar high that will last\nall day with gummy donuts. - [Ben] Hello and welcome to the return of the time-honored, first annual gummy donut eating competition. I'm Ben Lyons, alongside passionate amateur breakfast-er, Kara Gruenewald. - Thanks for having me, Ben. You know, breakfast is the\nmost important meal of the day and that's why I choose to have it at least five times a day. - That she does! Let's meet our field, which is comprised of three\neaters, hungry for competition. - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome again to the first annual gummy\ndonut eating contest. There are 10 minutes on the clock. Let the gorging begin! - [Ben] And they're off! Now, as a reminder, our competitors will have 10 minutes to finish as many gummy\ndonuts as they can. - Lots, it's a lotta sugar! - It's so much sugar! - [Kara] Ben, did you\nknow each gummy donut here has approximately 360 calories. - [Ben] Oh my goodness,\nthat is a lot of sugar. For the viewers at home,\ncan you give us some idea of what the mouth feel and taste is like of these gummy donuts. - So Ben, this specific species of donut is an orange flavored gummy donut covered in icing and real sprinkles. - Feel like you'd get some\ngood ASMR going here, though. (chewing) - It's gonna be a lot to get through. - Mmhmm\n- Mhmmm! Mmm...Uh oh. - Uh oh's right. - [Ben] Oh, Joey already\ngetting off to a strong lead. He's got, perhaps, the strongest\njaw in the competition. - I think that will give\nhim a significant advantage in this competition. Nina, on the other hand,\nstarting off at a slower pace. - [Ben] Is this part of a strategy, or is she just in the middle\nof a regrettable life decision? - [Kara] I'm gonna go with\nregrettable life decision. - One down. - [Ben] Now Joey's already\nwell into his second donut. A very impressive start. - [Kara] Wow, that jaw can really move! - I can't compete with\nJaw-y Graves over here. - I can masticate. (laughs) - And we're gonna have to\nbleep out that word, I believe. Oh no, it was masticate. Nevermind.\n- Okay, okay. We're gonna keep that in. - [Kara] Now, Ben, after\nI've had about my third sugar-packed breakfast of\nthe day, I'm feeling good. I'm on a sugar high, you know, you feel like you are invincible. You can do anything. Shortly after that, it's\nfollowed by a crash, and you just fall asleep. - Alright. - [Kara] John about to finish up-- - That's one. - [Kara] his first gummy donut. - [Ben] For those who have\nthe John Stahm trading card, you remember he came\nin a very close second in the gummy hot dog eating competition. A defeat that has been\n\"eating\" away at him. John, only about halfway at\nmost in his second donut, Joey is off to a very\ncommanding lead here. - How you doin', Nina? That number one? - We got 10 minutes of this? - I'm making it through. You can mind your own. - [Ben] Now, as our most\nmillennial of the competitors, Nina has to resist the urge to take a photo of her\nfood before eating it. (slurps) That's a weird choice. (laughs) - [Ben] All the competitors\nhave mugs of coffee in front of them that they can use to help wash down the sugar, take a dunk, or I suppose throw on them for what we call a scalding pick-me-up. - Oh my goodness. - Mmmm! It's really good, but\ntoo much of a good thing. - [Kara] Let's remind the viewers at home: first place takes home\n$250, second place $100, third place, nothing. - [Ben] Nothing but a stomach ache and the thrill of the competition. (gags) - That was close. - Close to what? What happened just now? - Choking. - Now, normally when we\nsay someone is choking during a competition, we mean that they're not\nperforming up to expectations. John is literally choking during\nthis competition, however. Important distinction to make. - Yeah, how is that possible? - I've got a giant mouth, guys. - Now, Joey just seems to be running away with this competition. Do you think John will have\nany gas left in the tank? - I think he'll have plenty of gas after this competition, Kara. - You're a full donut ahead of me! - I didn't come to win, I\ncame for free donuts, so... - We have five minutes on the clock. You are halfway through! - Halfway through? - Five minutes remaining. It's still anybody's game. It's getting tense down\nthere on the table, Kara. - [Kara] It could be\nanyone's game at this point. - Anybody but Nina, most likely. - Anybody, definitely not Nina though. - My stomach's starting to hurt. - Oh my gosh. Tortoise and the hare. Tortoise and the hare. (laughs) - Oh man! - [Kara] Nina being\ncalled out as the tortoise in this competition. - Now I'm not hip on slang,\nKara, is that a rapper? - Yes. - My dentist is gonna hate me. As much as my stomach hates me right now. - [Ben] Sacrificing his body for money, Joey just trading in his body for money. - Interesting. (growls) - I'm tired. I'm like, digestive system tired. - Now, I'm gonna focus in...\n- Oh John! - ...on John's face up here. Let me show you something. This is where John is\nlosing the will to live. You can tell the tighter\nhe squints his eyes, it's almost like it's squeezing\nthe life force out of him. - Bleh. - 10 minutes is a lot. (laughs) - [Ben] You can see in Nina's posture all the different places in her life that led her to this moment, and which ones she regrets the most. - Okay. Okay. - I wanna go home. (laughs) - Feel like someone\nwho's like out of shape stepping into the boxing ring. (mumbling) And then like can't even\nmake it through one round. I'm just like, okay, this\nis harder than it looks. - [Kara] Now at this point, does Joey even need to continue on? - Well, if he wants to set the new gummy donut eating record, which is also the first\ngummy donut eating record, then he needs to keep pace. - I'm feeling close to throwing up. - Mhm. - Okay, as a reminder, as\nJohn clutches his stomach, a reversal of fortune\nis a disqualification. So, this could be a chance for Nina to leap into second place. - I'm just kinda gonna take\nthis posture for a second. - [Ben] Even Joey, at this point, looks like he might have trouble\nkeeping all the food down. This could be a strategy by Nina. All she needs to do is induce vomiting in the rest of the field to\ncatapult herself to victory. - Oh! - We're in the final countdown! Will John be able to pull it off? - [Ben] He's making a fervoured\nsprint toward the finish. - This is equivalent to the last 100 meters on a track, the fourth quarter of a basketball game, and whatever the heck happens in cricket. - And that is time! - [Kara] And that's time. They all look miserable. - And our winner with\nthree and a half donuts is Joey Graves. In second place John. In third place Nina. - Congratulations or whatever. (laughs) You too, good job! - Nice job, nice job. Good game, good game. - Good game. - That's $250 to our\nchampion, Joey Graves. Kara, any final thoughts\non today's competition? - Ben, all I can say is\nI would not want to be on the other end of that\n1300 calorie stomach ache. - Oh, the price of victory. That's our competition for the day. Thanks for joining us! We'll take you now to the\ngummy javelin throwing contest already in progress.

you know but I'm thinking selfie stick you guys oh my god tell you where it was at all this time it was inside of the drawer with the crayons because I have been doing the company some more muscle took the selfie stick and put it away with the crayons but yeah I'm so wicked happy I found my selfie stick I was watching vlogs just weekend and I love the way the bloggers hold out they camera and they got the offs extended out along with your life my camera all the way up to my face or whatever no but anyway I'm gonna try to use my selfie stick more often I'm trying to learn how to blog I'm just like the worst vlogger but you know hey do the basic again learn as you go get better as you go that's what I thought anyway you guys I haven't been vlogging what I did was I just took clips and I try to you know turn on the camera when I can put them all together make of all you know I really want to just go home and pull the cover back but dream is all in my bed and I need to wash clothes and I went and I was looking inside of my own like a storage bucket just looking for something to wear and always just pulling out clothes pulling out clothes that I hate that I don't wanna um that I hate to throw away but they did not they not good enough to give away and did not bad enough to throw away you know like I still like them but I had a warm and I can't find him using the way I'm and I'm not comfortable and some of them anymore like you know I just dated dingy and old so I started to know filling up a bag with stuff that I don't need and then I want to go put it by the trash you just see this big bucket of clothes I saw cause I hear dreams said oh don't mess with the one throwing him away leave 20 ugly says I'm done with those for this year the to 2017 coming in start get rid of some of the old and bring in the new and then they Dean gotta back sell my god the energy is so chic i we all work we're getting rid of things that we haven't wore all year or use and was just putting it by the door and my daughter was like oh my god this is cute she was like mom stop it I don't know what the energy somebody gave me that I'm running anymore I was okay okay okay and I'm looking at everything and I'm like God I started doing something everybody don't need you don't even know they the energy is 4 and speaking of energy despite getting severe turkeys we have the lantern is this supposed to be about this blog is gonna stay up all but that's today but I want to show you guys when I got check this city we love these when hours of kid this is like my favorite favorite candy I never really ate the gun when I was a kid looking like a penny I know you guys know moisturizing that no this is smoke free just so wet ok don't jump I dry it up in my skirt again about into the eye socket the rambling Africa you got to be careful the energy and speaking of that light I give it simple you meet one person and have one person you're talking to and they go talk to another person but they tell like a small lie pertain to a small basically pertaining to you but you're not connected to the person they lied to so energy may not really reflect you but damn a youtuber I'm not using you - because youtubers have a whole lot of people connected to them because they put their lives out there another person our youtuber and thank you to burn gets on a channel and tell people that your example your dad you passed away something happened to you as an accident all other people on YouTube start sending you rest in peace I'm so sorry that happened to you oh my god I loved you I miss you but you're not about it but that all kind of stuff start happening around you people start dying in things start happening people start getting sick boost I can't see you know you you're getting into accidents all kind of stuff that happen to you because so many people are connected to you and they all thinking that she was in a terrible accident and that you had died because somebody put this terrible terrible not out about you on YouTube and the reason why I'm saying this cuz I'm not going to you know because I did watch a YouTube video of a person that had been missing for a while haven't been you know involved in for a long time disappeared and the last time they thought they did get into an accident all this time everybody thought he was dead because somebody else a lot and said that he got killed and he was gone to all these people thinking that he was gone and so all that energy all this bad stuff started happening to this person all around him everywhere until this damn from the last vlog he is still like side and somewhere but all this bad stuff happening to her so he did a video so I'm kind of glad he did the video because now I feel like maybe that energy start to be uplifted and now that allowed us know that he is alive and well and that the other youtuber lied or her a lot about not not on him but a lot about him you know even my daughter was crying like but you got to be careful with any Chi energy issue you know so of your type of person and you're not like a business clan and you're really feel it in your heart when you really feel like it's gonna work this time [Music] but you chill with a lot of negative people don't tell nobody about it put your plan in motion do what you gotta do take baby steps write things down record yourself telling yourself that you got to do whatever you got to do to put your plan in motion do it and then those negative people say oh I didn't even know you started a business you know a Papa didn't even mention to you without being disrespect my sarcastic I'm quite sure I didn't understand or did at that point the reason why you didn't meet you to them because there'll be the very ones that send out the energy that your plan don't work because in your face they say oh wow really that's nice behind your back are they ain't got the sense to do they they don't make it thing gonna succeed oh please they're always trying to be better than somebody so yeah something is just for you but you know a lot of us need recognition we need some type of proof from people that we can achieve what we said it set out to do you know and people always tell me well I always get common sense you need to do a life video you know our life lesson videos yeah I don't but I haven't done it yet because I just feel like my life has been a big freakin lesson now I've been blessed a lot of blessings but my life is the lessons are huge okay I don't never want nobody to ever go do a lot of the things I went through never ever you know I really don't you know I must say this the hard things the life lessons that you go through I'm telling you when you get older you're gonna look back on them and some of them you wanna cry you're gonna laugh but you're gonna say wow I get it I get it you know the best experience is mistakes those are the best experiences and hearing me tell you my mistake may help you it may help you but the best way you want to learn as your own life experiences and your own mistakes they are yours and yours the better okay but the number one lesson that I want to tell you guys that may help you everything is not for everybody it was for you is for you you don't always have to share it and you don't always need recognition and you don't always need approval itself satifactory and self-love by believing in yourself that is the hardest lesson that I had to learn it took me almost 40 freakin years I must say forty fifteen years cuz when I was ten I and really Givaudan okay by time I turned ten I started looking for a profiles recognitions and that would give me motivation to go to the next thing that I needed to do you know and I've been doing that my whole life it took me 40 15 years to finally get it by Tom I turned 40 years old I was saying to myself what am i doing I don't need to be recognized to be successful to be beautiful to be intelligent to be wise for any of those things either oh my god the less after looking for other people's approval of me the more love and spiritual bond bonding became myself the game more uplifting more rewarding okay Oh check it out and then it sounds very crazy just think about it think about everything you do every day did you pat yourself on the back do you sing good job you did well did you do that or do you go and say hey I just I just caught you to tell you but um what I did on my time I'm gonna tell you what I got plans to do oh my god obviously this I bought this today and then you wait to hear say oh really oh that's great I'm so proud of you you're so lucky you're so blessed oh my goodness really well happy for you didn't wait on it and then if you need coffee buying and they black um okay and then you hang up again get the recognition they happy funding they jealous and those things may be true they may not be true but what is true that you were looking for recognition from someone else and you didn't get it and now you feeling come alone you almost don't even want to do the next thing you need to do to be self successful you know and self successful is whatever in your your mind your mind that you want to do that's gonna make you happy okay like the day I don't know buddy and say hey I think I need to go to the grocery store and now go to the grocery store and I'm gonna get some things for the house I step back and witness and I said really wow you're so lucky you got some money oh my god I'm so happy for you and then I don't get that and I say you know hey I forget it ain't goin to the grocery store I don't even feel like I'll just giving you an example just something simple so I don't go over your head okay you need no approval from no one to be self-reliant selphie water is so successful number one lesson stop looking for approval and recognition other people to be calm the best it you can be which is the best you you just can't nobody you can't nobody be you nobody you are the best you can be the better you but can't them probably be the better nobody ok let me take my sweaty tail home oh my god so freakin crazy freakin daughter got me but you know what I won't get up tomorrow I won't try to do it again I'm gonna try but right now I'm gonna go home and I come in to release a video for your lights I'm gonna try to get a vlog up today yeah I won't try yesterday

I think it's just makeup [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey", "b91vrgVY-ZQ": "this is the impossible maze me and my crew spent days designing and building a maze that would be nearly impossible to complete the reason the maze is so hard to complete is because you have to recreate some of my old videos in order to pass certain parts like at one part you have to say Logan Paul a thousand times to proceed another part you have to ram a Lego car into a wall you see the whole maze is modeled around all my old videos and in order to complete this maze you basically have to recreate all my videos one last thing you guys know I just hit 7 million subscribers so the person competing in this maze is my 7 million subscriber I flew him down and he has 2 hours to complete this maze if he does not finish this maze in under two hours he does not get 7 million underscore underscore underscore if he finishes this entire maze in under two hours he gets seven million underscore underscore - make sure you watch the end because if he does finish it's gonna be really cool what he gets and boom you're 2 hours has officially started so first things first to buy a car with pennies come on then your two hours is window down now you have a car I think you should try to go through that wall of duct tape over there with your deepa thousand rolls of duct tape can stop the power I've different strategy there we go Oh next as you see on the side read the sign out loud donate to attractive switch here we go I got some money for you man all right we'll go complete Minecraft bags right here open up oh shoot wait what is that time now yeah okay you win that's right all right you want to keep on yeah oh well oh man it's the Sailor and Paula $1,000 guess you guys nothing go get some food ball yeah you do it be ready your wire it is you needed to exit the maze are you sure yeah cuz we tied our shoe in every country or state something like that yeah alright keep going yep yes that's a touch Michael yep you got it says build the Lego car you got build it this was a banger video man make sure you build it right so it goes off then you watch the video hmmmm looks like you subscribed at 7 million yeah sweating a little bit here well maybe it's cuz you're wearing a suit that's 100 degrees I think you should Ram the car into that llama and if you guys please don't see me public I'm alive are you hurt look at that car we're about the we're about to do a replay replay this thing like nails you in the head you sure you're good I'm fine I pop this one right here oh the one where you trying to float to

"gzQZws7yia8": "hi I'm Karthik Gert and this is Rumpelstiltskin today we're doing something that was by request on discord and I am nervous but hopefully it's gonna be I'll be satisfying and we couldn't find the right kind of beads for this but one that Wiggles are it has so I'm using Mardi Gras beads you ready to party Russell also my bathroom is under construction so don't mind that [Music] first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take these babies off for now the beads don't let me down these throw them here and then I have to pour black all over this canvas and I'm really worried because this like looks like fabric I really hope it doesn't go through and stain my carpet but we'll see Stiltskin is gnarly interesting hey weren't you interested where's my spatula where's my fainting spell ha ha yes card to doer she isn't you can't be Karthik guru if you don't carthon doer Twiggy please that's black paint you can't lick it I need to do like an activity that's like fun and safe for the whole family this isn't really it as far as Twinkie goes [Music] in a recent comment someone was like do you have to sing in every video and I was like no sorry gonna make this like the darkest night so that it really stands out I noticed also that the guy who like makes these tutorials he has like a hot like a heat gun and I don't have one of those but I have a blow-dryer so that'll probably do me this is like so satisfying like if I was a mother at home cooking some PB and J's for the kids this would be my favorite part also you'll notice that cuz of the construction haven't been able to use my bathroom in a week really unfortunate sorry - my neighbor whose bathroom I've been using it's like embarrassing when I'm like oh can I use your washroom and he's like to eat shower and I'm like no and then he like knows what I mean I'm gonna do the edges now even though he didn't do his edges first I just feel like it's the better thing to do yeah get involved this is whoa don't lick it can we like put cool music so people don't have to listen to the construction [Music] loke it feels like I'm doing construction because of the noise I'm like where's the drill we should put a sign on our front door this is geniuses at work but like just the guys who actually know how to do manual labor and not me that's pretty good hey stupendous now we get to the good part why did you say now we get to the good part okay here you we got this we've done this before you've done this before no oh we have done fluid art before at first when I saw it I was like how interesting could that be I don't know I guess I'm just really drawn to these shiny angles these are all actually varying lengths so hopefully it'll still turn out okay now we pour on that it looks like pink it is pink these are like a lot lighter than the metal balls that are originally used in this so I just have to make sure I really weigh them down with paint so that this isn't another Karthik uber disaster now I'm lighter pain [Music] silver look how pretty this silver is it's like so metallic you cheating again yeah hey these tutorials are made to be followed okay and also like I don't want to stray from his color palette cuz this gazer gets some pretty colors going okay purple oh there's two different purples here all right dark purple here we go almost there look at her go that's gonna be the one improvising the one improvisation I mean hmm looking good looking behind here we go clumsy [Music] I'm gonna pull her over here okay here we go [Music] whoa whoa okay I'm gonna have to get my fingers dirty this thing this thing is going rogue so stressful okay you have to do it again yeah I have to do it again and again and again we're just going to hope that it works out for the best [Music] I mean I'd say it's kind of working out so far and also me trying to guide it I feel was like a big part of the problem you kind of just gotta like let it do what it wants when you're dropping it onto the canvas [Music] I do look like little gummies gummy words it's really making me mad how this one doesn't like actually I'm just so like pull her up here it was like really making me mad how it doesn't spin out I feel like I can fit one more right here or shaoling not risk it but then again that's going rogue from that's how I shoot on the first one okay now I got to pull these fades off this is the part that will determine whether I did a good job or a really horrible job we'll see rings off usually when you're about to fight you put the rings on and this we're pulling the rings off okay so now they all have to be pinched [Music] that's pretty cool [Music] I definitely say that this is a success I think that the only problem with it is that these are plastic beads the original beads used for this are like metal ones so they're heavier and that's why I like the lines are breaking but it's really cool and I like it I think it's gonna look really good when it dries although filming it from the top is like kind of weird cuz like it looks it kind of looks like a like Lily's you know and like this is definitely like the top and the bottom I really like this part up here where it's like white into silver into pink I just think that's really pretty and I kinda wish that I did a gold too but I didn't want to mess it up so I don't know I think it's cool I like it what do you think we I swear this guy gets more brain-dead every day you know he's a hundred and four in dog years poor thing yeah like I was saying before I feel like the metal balls would have made it more similar to the original but I really like it I kind of like how it looks like Lily's with like ribs karthick gu er it likes to cook ribs so it really does remind me of myself and I do think that Rumple really likes it don't worry Rumple it's not your birthday present that's like a fun painting move so many painting options for people with zero Talent you're gonna try this one out do you like it don't hurt my feelings so never mind well I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you'd like see you again make sure you have push notifications and I will see you on the next one bye hey Bailey look at me like that okay never mind about all that just farewell [Music]", "w-H02hwvVgI": "When \nexperimenting with homemade pyrotechnics,\nthings go wrong, and you don't want to be too close if your composition explodes. I\nneed some sort of a pyrotechnic time-delay, so for this project I'm using items from around the house,\nto make a simple form of a slow burning fuse. If you've seen my videos on making rocket\nfuel and smoke flares, you'll probably recognize these ingredients. This time I'm mixing up\n36 grams of my stump remover with 24 grams of white table sugar. This gives me a 60 gram\ncomposition that needs to be shaken up vigorously. I have a pre-heated frying pan set at medium\nheat, so that when I add 1/3 cup of water, it boils instantly. At this point, I'll slowly\nsprinkle in the 60g mixture because I want this all to dissolve. I can stir that in with\na spatula and because the water is so hot, it dissolves completely. That'll need to sit\nfor a minute, to heat up and let the water boil out, so it's a good time to prepare my\ncord. This is 100% cotton yarn, and I'm gonna be using about 12 feet of it. Ok, the water\nhas boiled down to the point where the slurry is getting very frothy which means this solution\nis super saturated. It's time to add the yarn into the mix to soak up the chemicals. As\nthe last bit of water continues to evaporate out, it's important that every bit of yarn\nis absorbing an equal amount of the solution. Holding onto one end will help prevent the\nyarn from knotting up when I pull it out. This gets transferred onto a cookie sheet\nusing a pattern resembling a sine wave, and with about 6 turns on each side, the yarn\nis evenly spaced and fits perfectly. Now this goes into an oven set to 300\u00baC for about\n20 minutes. And while the cord is still hot, I can nudge it slightly to prevent it from\nsticking to the pan when it cools later on. Alright, the time is up and this cord has\na slightly golden tinge to it, and that's a good sign, so I'll leave it out to cool\nfor about 5-10 minutes. When the cord has fully cooled, you can see it's become stiff\nand retains the shape from when it was baked. Now I can just cut these strands at the base\nof the turns, using some scissors, and I've got a nice piece of fuse cord ready to go.\nThe cord is easy to cut, and a few of these strands will get cut down smaller to be used\nin a batch of smoke flares I made in another project. Look for how I built those in a different\nvideo. Ok, testing out the fuse, the first thing I notice is it lights off really quickly,\nand continues a steady and progressive burn. Even with a little breeze, it's still got\na nice flame shooting off the back, and seems to burn steady at about 3 seconds per inch.\nSweet. I tried making different fuses, this time soaking a coffee filter in the solution\nand laying it out for baking. I also tried soaking some paper towel, then twisting pieces\nof it into shorter but thicker fuses. After they were baked, they were very dry, and very\nrigid. I cut a strip of the coffee filter first, and tested it with a rock on top, to\nsee if it would fizzle out when it lost contact with the open air. Surprisingly, it continued\nto burn on underneath the rock, and kept on burning right out the other side. One of the\npaper towel fuses was lit, but maybe twisting it wasn't such a good idea, because when the\npressure built inside, it was gone in an instant. I tried another one, and got pretty much the\nsame result. When this one was lit without anything holding it down, it went airborne\nSo as far as consistency, reliability and aesthetics go, I'm pretty happy with the results\nusing the yarn. Well there's how I made some cheap, but functional, slow burning fuses\nwith things around the house. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll like some of\nmy others.

But carrying snacks to school can sometimes\nbe super risky. Luckily here are over 15 epic ideas on how\nto sneak candy in class plus prank your teachers and schoolmates! \u2026 is above the waterline. These are formed by snowfall in very cold\nplaces, where it will not melt in the summer. The snow builds up and compacts into ice. This is gradually then pulled down by gravity\ninto the sea. Iceberg is a large piece of ice floating in\nthe sea. We have about 90% under the water and then\nonly 10%... They are especially common during spring because\nthat... what is this noise?! She's eating candy. No, she's eating candy! Detention! Both of you! These candy belts are so delicious and I love\nall the beautiful rainbow colors. Their shape kind of reminds me of a bookmark! To make our candy bookmark even more realistic\nlet\u2019s attach a little tassel to it. Make a hole on one side of the bookmark using\na hole puncher. Luckily the consistency of these treats is\nnot too chewy and sticky so it isn\u2019t hard to make a hole at all. Now grab a tassel, thread it through the opening\nand tie a double knot. I actually made this tassel myself and if\nyou want I can show you how to make it in one of my next videos. Now our candy belt looks exactly like a bookmark\nand gives us the perfect chance to sneak candy in class and prank our teachers and schoolmates. ...Is only one star of millions and millions\nin the galaxy. So it is a star. Mm. This candy bookmark looks so realistic! No one will ever be able to notice that you\u2019re\nactually sneaking candy in class. Besides that it looks so pretty with those\nbright colorful stripes. The prettiest and most delicious bookmark\nout there for sure! If chocolate is more your thing - try sneaking candy melts in a watercolor painting set like this one. Remove the color blocks from the container. Now take some colorful candy melts - these\ntaste exactly like white chocolate which is like my favorite thing ever. Place one candy button inside each circle\nand you got yourself a super realistic watercolor paint set that is completely edible and delicious! This one is so quick and easy to make plus\nextremely convenient when you feel like having something sweet during class. No one will suspect that this aren\u2019t the\nreal watercolors, but delightful chocolate treats instead. Other stars may be larger, smaller or fainter\nthan our sun, but they are so very far away that we only see then as the point of light\nin the night sky. The sun is over 1 million times bigger Sara\nand Katie are you listening to what I'm saying?! The package of these sweet milky chocolates\nhas almost the same dimensions as a box of colored pencils. Grab a packet of 24 colored pencils because\nit\u2019s deeper and take out all the pencils. This will be the perfect box for our milky\nchocolates ! You can unwrap the chocolates to make them more easily available during\nclass or you can just keep the wrapping paper on. Put them in your colored pencils package - as\nmany as you can possibly fit in! To cover this opening print a picture of colored\npencils and cut it out. Place it inside the chocolate box to cover\nthe opening making it possible to sneak chocolates to class. Honey bee's are very important pollinators\nfor flowers, fruits and vegetables. This means that they help other plants grow. And what are honey bee's more famous for? Delicious honey! How smart right? Delicious chocolates in a colored pencil box\nare a perfect pick me up treat during class! You can share them with your schoolmates or\nhave them all for yourself. Whatever you do just be careful so you don\u2019t get caught! Edible eraser? Of course and super tasty too! Erasers come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Luckily so does gummy candy and marshmallows. Have a look and try to find the perfect match! This white eraser looks really similar to\nthe foamy candy square \u2013 yup I think we got a match! Pull the eraser out of the pink wrapper and\npush in the white candy square! It fits perfectly! Seems like it\u2019s our lucky day because we\nhave space for one more piece of candy on the other side! Voila our edible eraser looks just like the\nusual real one! Such a fun idea to sneak a delicious treat\nto class and a great opportunity to prank your classmates too. Their face expressions when seeing you eat\nyour eraser will be priceless for sure. That's why it is a perfect treat to sneak\nin class. Seems like this Nutella sticks snack was made\nto fit in a pencil holder that's why it is a perfect treat to sneak in class! Open it up - are you hungry yet? Cause this looks so tasty! Take an empty pencil holder and pop in your\nchocolaty snack. Half of the pencil holder is still empty which\nis perfect as we can put in a bunch of pens and pencils. How amazingly awesome is this idea right? I can\u2019t get over it, it\u2019s so cool! Now you can enjoy your chocolate bread sticks\nin class without anyone noticing. You have five minutes to solve this equation\nand remember we're in school kids so we are here to learn! Kids! All the teacher will see is a usual pencil\nholder filled with pens. In the meantime you can indulge with your\ndelightful snack in peace. These two seem like a match made in heaven! Literally! Sharing is caring so don\u2019t forget to share\nsome with your friends too. You can use your pencil holder to sneak other\ntreats in class too. If you can\u2019t function without coffee this\nidea is perfect for you! Place a ready to drink coffee cup in your\npencil holder. We still have some space left which is perfect\nfor all the pens and pencils. Pop them in and your coffee pencil holder\nis ready! This hack is a life saver especially if you\ndidn\u2019t get much sleep the night before and you need a good energy boost! Just stick in a straw and you're ready enjoy\nyour sneaky coffee. What is this smell... I need coffee. If you\u2019re not a coffee person you can totally\nswitch it up with with some other drinks like some fruity yogurt. These are so cute but also nutritious and\ndelicious! Place it in your pencil holder full of pencils\nor pens. Grab a straw pop it in and enjoy. The straw looks like one of the colored pencils\nin the bunch - perfectly camouflaged. This hack is ideal if you don\u2019t have time\nfor breakfast in the morning. You can still enjoy a nutritious meal in class! We have an equation with one unknown character. So what we're going to do now, is we're going\nto put unknowns on one side of the equation and then we can solve the equation. Have you ever noticed that a package of Oreos\nhas the same shape as a pencil case? Well I have, so let\u2019s transform this Oreo\npack in a legit pencil case! Grab some small scissors as they\u2019re easier\nto work with and make a cut along the entire Oreo packet like this. Now take a glue gun and apply a few stripes\nalong the top and bottom side of the cut we made earlier. You can use other sort of glue just make sure\nthat it works on plastic and fabric materials. Take a zipper and place it on top while the\nglue is still soft. Next you want to take a fabric of your choice,\nI went for this pretty blue with white polka dots. Place it on a flat surface with the front\nfacing down. Put your Oreos on top. Grab some fabric glue or a glue gun and apply\na stripe along the top and bottom sides of the zipper. Wrap the fabric around the cookies and stick\nthe ends to the zipper. And do this on the top and bottom side. To make our Oreos look exactly like a pencil\ncase the easiest way is to take two small elastics and tie them on the sides like this! Now it looks like a real candy pencil case\nwhich is super accurate as it is filled with sweet and yummy Oreos! Let\u2019s impress our friends with it! For the last 10 minutes of today's class,\nyou can start reading chapter 9, meanwhile I will correct some tests. Psst, hey! I am in love with this Oreo pencil case idea\nbecause it\u2019s just so unique and creative. You can use it for any kind of cookies that\nhave a similar rounded packaging. Yum yum sitting in class has never tasted\nbetter! Class, Silence! It's my fave! These chocolate eggs were probably my favorite\nsweets when I was little and play dough pot seems like the perfect container to hide them\nin. Grab a pot of play dough and take the dough\nout. All we need to do is to replace it with the\nKinder egg. But first let\u2019s wash it because the number\none rule is that you can only store food in extra clean containers. Time to take a Kinder egg. I have this packet of three so let's see what's\ninside! Hmm... Which one would you chose? I\u2019m going for the middle one. You can already unwrap it to make it easier\nto grab in class, but I\u2019m just keeping it with the wrapper on. Put the lid on and it\u2019s ready to take to\nschool! Whenever the sweet cravings kick in simply\nreach for your play dough pot and have some yummy chocolate! You can even trick your friends by offering\nthem a pot as well. Too bad that this one does not contain any\nchocolate. Also don\u2019t forget about the toy! Who would have thought that school can be\nso much fun. Aaa! Class! These little pringles pots can be easily transformed\ninto legit pencil holders! Basically all you need is some wrapping paper! Wrap it tightly around the pringles pot. Take a piece of tape and secure the wrapping\npaper in place. Time to open op our pringles! Mm... this looks delicious! To make it look like a real pencil holder\nlet\u2019s pop in some coloring pencils and other pens. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking abut! We got a totally useful pencil holder filled\nwith crispy pringles! From your teachers perspective this looks\nlike a legit pencil pot, while you can snack on these salty treats without a worry in your\nmind! What more could we ask for! Why settle for a bit of chips, when you can\nhave loads of it. Yup let\u2019s transform a big pringles tube\nin a cool pencil case. Take a larger piece of crafting or wrapping\npaper and place it on a flat surface. Grab your chips or crisps - whatever you like\nto call them and wrap the paper around the package. Secure it in place with a bit of tape. To make this pringles pencil case super realistic,\nprint a picture of a zipper which is as long as your pencil case and cut it out. Using a piece of double sided tape or some\nglue, stick the zipper on the case. How cool is that? It looks so real! Cut two colored circles from some card stock\npaper and stick one on the bottom of the pringles pencil case. On the other side you want to first open up\nthe package. Nom-nom this looks amazing. Place the other colored circle over the opening\nand put the lid back on. The pringles pencil case is so realistic and\ncool I am completely obsessed with it! It seems just like the usual rounded pencil\ncases but ours is completely packed with delightful salty snacks! Your teacher will never find out what you\u2019re\nhiding in there. Just be careful with noise level! What is this noise! We're in school kids so start behaving accordingly! When you finish up your chips you can fill\nthe pencil case with pop corn or any other favorite snack of yours. The pringles pencil pot works great for cookies\ntoo. These ones with jam filling are one of my\nfaves! What!? Pencils are the perfect school supply to store\nour sneaky gum in class. Pull the eraser from the pencil and grab some\ngum. I'm using this one which is pink, just like\nmy pencil erasers. Unwrap it and no no you can't chew it it just\nyet. We're going to transform it into edible eraser. Roll the gum into a little worm shape. Sorry this doesn't sound really appetizing. Push one end into the eraser opening. Time to grab a knife, cut away the excess\ngum and our gum eraser pencils are all done. They look exactly the same as the usual eraser\npencil. How cool! This makes them perfect to trick our schoolmates. They may try to take bite of their eraser\ntoo but sadly not everyone's erasers are edible. Wow, raining chocolate bars. Which one would you pick? I\u2019m going for these Milky Way rolls. Grab a marker or a pen that is wide enough\nto fit the chocolate stick inside. Remove the marker tip open up the casing and\ntake out the ink tube out as well. Wash both of those pieces thoroughly under\nrunning water. Now take the chocolate pack, unwrap it and\ngrab one chocolate stick. Push the stick inside the pen tube. Take the lid, pop it on and there we have\nit! A perfectly camouflaged chocolate stick ready\nto be enjoyed in class. Feel like having something sweet? Just pull the lid of take a bite and you already\nfeel much more energized! Bingo! If gummy candy is what you\u2019re craving, no\nproblem! We have a solution to everything. Cut a piece of candy rope that is as long\nas your marker. Push this yumminess inside the marker and\nput the lid on. Enjoy it in class, at home, or whenever you\nneed a little sweet boost! One thing is for sure - we ain\u2019t getting\ncaught eating candy rope this time! Whipped cream is one of my favorite guilty\npleasures and there\u2019s a super cool way to sneak it in class! First you need to wash an empty glue squeeze\nbottle really, really well! This DIY is super straightforward - all we\ngot to do is to squeeze whipped cream into the glue container. I find the easiest using a piping bag. When your glue bottle is full, screw the lid\nback on and you\u2019re finished. Hey! Make your friends believe that you can eat\nglue. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be so amazed. Ew! The glue squeeze tube works exactly like a\npiping bag, pretty amazing right? You can make your cookies look like cupcakes. So cool! Try drawing a smiling face on your Oreo to\nmake it even more delicious or have some whipped cream straight from the tube. Stop eating glue!

sequel thanks to you guys casual games have done really well on my channel in fact the first episode of my most recent game Angry Birds go has over 5,000 likes so let's see if we get this video in that range as well also thanks for subscribing I'm about to hit 500,000 subscribers that's a half million you may have come from Instagram Facebook or even my Zack Scott YouTube channel but wherever you came from let me know in the comments below and thank you so much for being here now without further ado let's play Cut the Rope - here we go No give him back his candy hahaha I can't believe it but it looks like he's having fun but here we go cut the rope - Tom noms unexpected adventure hopefully this is gonna be fun yeah yeah we got it oh my goodness okay there's omnomnom eats his candy right there you just gonna cut the rope I like the first game a lot I never did a video series about it but now they cut the rope to was out I thought I would do a video series about it and I'm gonna try to get as many of the yeah the three-star stuff that I can hopefully I pulled that off because that's always so fun to do for those of you who have not played this game you obviously know or have played this game you obviously know that you just cut the rope to make the candy drop down get the stars all that stuff but for those of you who haven't played the game it's a heavily physics basic game candy is attacked okay yes church to me notifications whatever candy is attached to well candy isn't always attached to but candy is involved with platforms and ropes and things you got to cut the rope make the candy fall down gets the stars cut the rope Mickey candy fall down it's very simple in concept and practice though it gets complicated because you'll see we'll go through some of these and they're gonna be a little bit difficult like what do you do when there's multiple ropes I don't know do this there you go you get like two ropes there now what now you do this and then you got to make sure to get the next star perfect there we go its eyes lined up with the stars - that's cool and Tom Nam is a really cool mascot to have this one's a little bit more a couple wouldn't you do it you do right there oh you bet you missed a star I miss a star so let's redo that one just a matter of timing here ah no came redo try again and oh oh oh I see I see it's gonna stop it's gonna stop up there you you've been presented with two-level solutions I don't want them I know how to do this I wasn't realizing that the stars are moving back and forth but as soon as that happens and this is not even ready grab this popping the balloon did he even eat the rope there I don't know who knows all right improved results thank you all right now this is a little bit complicated because you got like multiple stars I imagine this is how it's gonna work I don't know how to get it there we go there's one you're gonna slowly go over there and get that one now what second the slide there you go there you go what that was kind of easy now that I thought about it but let's see if I got all three stars there this is my kind of my goal at least my near-term goal to try to get all those Oh what in the world is gonna happen here um obviously we wanted to oh I cut too many or maybe I cut the right with a butt okay but ya know one zero stars is not going to help me there we go that's pretty straightforward we cut the rope it's not always cutting the rope it's also popping balloons that you got to do so uh um what else we got going on here this looks so just a clover that looks interesting can I pull that one off whoops okay I missed the clover I missed him even so what in the world um I think if you get some momentum going you just nope okay how does one get the clover this is already mind-boggling but it's obviously not the solution is that clover even something I can pick up or is it like on the birdhouse and I can't even tell I mean I kind of do want to do that so let's see what happens what okay Oh tricky that's how you get clovers in this game I buy clovers in every stage like Miss clovers elsewhere I don't know I don't think I realize that those are even within option level complete it with the clover that's what's what is this this may collect you complete this mission collect two stars let me take a look really quick at this entire section here um who got the clover oh so I gotta get the gold medals too let's take a look I got one clover do any of these other ones have clovers that I just like miss out on them cuz I don't know what in the world happened here what about five is five haven't see clover here but I'm going to go ahead and pop the blue there you go did I get it I get the everything necessary here the gold what is this like what Zero's collect zero stars that is weird I know k I can probably collect zero stars let's go and do that let's that's one that's close okay but I want to reduce oh that's interesting they have different gold medals for different things you missed we do um that's something I didn't realize about this game until just now so I got the gold medal there zero stars so this is interesting there's gonna be oh my gosh there's gonna be gold medals three stars and even clovers now that's insane ah that's not well I mean I don't know let's see I guess I don't have any real way of knowing when I get clovers what is this gonna say how do I get the star on this one probably by collecting 0 stars or something get out of here is that how you get is that you give the medal for this one oh no I get it for it okay wow I'm gonna get a lot of money we're done not a lot of money a lot of points so let's go ahead and start off simple now that wasn't it so enough simple right there okay simple okay what there you get in the world okay cut the rope I forgot about that wrong cut the rope pop that that's kind of not how I wanted to do it well how did I do it last time and then we're going to go up here okay not that's not it at all sorry unfortunate for sure and as soon as I get up there and get that then we're going to pop this it's going to swing back around we're gonna pop that hopefully is that enough is enough for the points oh it's an improved result but not fast enough let's go ahead and a drop oh okay I feel like I just got to do this as quickly as possible there we go that's pretty fast right right right right right right right right pop now let's go go go fast does that count is that 4,800 is it new the score before even I did very cool so that's how this game works let's try to do a whole bunch of stuff here eight did not get a medal either how do I get a medal for eight probably by cutting the rope and then there you go cut it right there drop in nice is that a three-star now I got to get to what I gotta get two stars - okay that's so weird okay got it though well obviously the solution here is out not that or maybe that that looks kind of cool but it's not going to work here we go go ahead and do this and as we get close oh you died you do weren't supposed to touch it but he touched it okay not quite here we go we gotta as soon as it starts turning Oh most I think that's how you do this there we go that's a two-star completion right there these gold medals are so weird it makes me perform subpar tits these gold medals no item I did not want to do that again how to go back to the main thing I don't want to use solutions either let's go over here and see what we got going on so and me and I don't know how to tell where the clovers clovers are but we got level 9 up let's see it doesn't even tell me what the gold medal is um what was that - we do interesting for sure I'm not going to get that other star I'll go and cut this now just going to get to just in case for whatever reason it tells me I need to get to know it tells me this time I need to get a ton okay so here we go um laughs OH I did not mean to pop it here we go oh I get it I do feel a little bit dumb when it comes to this so let's just cut this there we go got that that did not make sense but that's what happens okay okay do not mean to pop that obviously I got all the stars but I have no way of getting it to him so that's the problem here that we are facing there we go there's one there's two get out of my way here's three does that count is that high enough that was not high enough oh that was so close though I just have a feeling that if I redo this I can probably pull this off no but I did not mean to pop it so early I keep making the same mistake over and over and it's embarrassing me all right yep tada that's gotta be high enough points for that there we go there we go that's exactly but no I didn't get a high enough 450 180 Oh No okay redo I'm gonna try to okay I gotta do it super quick huh okay oh no I miss the last star there well no okay here we go here we go don't anyone tell you it's impossible because it's got to be possible here I did it there we go Wow okay next stage roto what oh it's opposite I bring him to the candy amnon to the candy but I can put one star you want me to do that with one star I can probably pull that off missed ha ha ha okay you got this just one star huh missed Wow most okay I was I was trying to think throw him maybe like use the momentum to throw him that wasn't quite working okay come on you got this wrote oh man I feel like that's possible but it just seems impossible all right we'll try again we'll try again we'll try a little bit better there you go you got one star so I got the metal Wow okay what's next oh really other than do anything what oh I get it okay there you go you're welcome that was definitely not what we wanted though let's go and refresh that I do wanna collect all the stars how did you know oh it was just one okay refresh is it poppin this guy first there we go not quite alright that looked perfect right that was like it but I did not get fifty six hundred how about that that's like as good as I can do not fifty six hundred still 5438 totally unfortunate man that's gotta be it it's gonna be it right tell me it's it it's not even it 5456 oh my gosh Oh mrs. swipe totally now that wasn't it that didn't feel like it at all trying to get everything here refresh missed I missed again miss was that it's so hard to tell nope it wasn't it not at all 54 46 what about that that looks even closer 54:51 I cannot believe it what is going on here I don't even know man ha I don't know I don't know what to do with this particular point because it seems futile improved results what happened yeah I know how to took a this seems like so pointless that's like as good as I feel like I can do but it's just like not happening so what do I do what is this all about I just want to see what happens if I use one of these guys Oh hit him there okay interesting interesting that's a good way to think about it but did I get enough points I don't know so it doesn't count because I was that faster guess we'll find out we almost got it there okay so that's cool that seemed like a good one there we go Wow that is insane that was so tough to do oh my gosh okay so what's next uh we got uh okay let's just do it let's just keep going here let's see what we got and obviously we're going to drop down I think this oh my god okay all right I think I get the middle one obviously I'm gonna get zero stars in order to show people it I still trying to get the three star which is even weirder there we go we got three stars somehow I got to do that without collecting any stars which would be fine let's go ahead and retry that with with getting far fewer stars than we need okay that's not gonna work for us right now with that that's gonna work though there we go get out of here everyone out of here everyone out of here like for real this is gonna work this is pretty funny there we go there's zero stars I'll bet he died doesn't count gotta be kidding me all right well we got this going on don't worry all right here we go he's not gonna die this time he's got he's gonna blocked over there no even without it blocked he's still one there we go and I got the gold uh what what's this dude oh cool what's that doesn't do anything um what okay uh oh I get it Oh oh he got it he took it from you now what what I don't understand what to do at this point um oh here we go he's gonna carry that oh wait wait hold on I get it I get it I understand it now I'm gonna sort of carry that with him there you go he's gonna carry it perfect now it makes sense hopefully that's something there I gotta get one for one star I can probably do that let's go and try to get one star oh and 32 what's a one's one stars what you need okay if you want one star this is what you got missed sorry we want one stars has got to be it what right I mean I would think that's right and not get the go cuz I did not get 33 Oh double double double thing here that's not good okay one star it's gonna be tough to try to get this 33 going on Oh what maybe I do gotta cut this first that was faster right that's that's a little bit faster right yes just got to think a little bit outside the box perfect balloons they're gonna want me to use a balloon to get that probably let's deal with it sooner this okay right you want me to use it right now Oh what Oh interesting what whoops but okay oh man okay let's let's go ahead and get the stars first cuz I don't know what I'm doing oops alright that was interesting for sure nope here we go all right there here you go and then I gotta get the clover somehow one star is fine as well it's gonna get the clover though let's do the one star and then we'll do the clover I think how do I do the one star it's the real conundrum here that's 1ms - oops there you go that's a one star alright so I got everything there and now I just gotta get the clover rights which is putting him up there and then maybe so there you go all right that's great that worked I got the clover three stars clover metal everything that we needed for that and then uh so okay let's do level let's keep going here let's do the first set of levels I don't know that I'll do this many levels each video but whoopee cushion cut the rope oh sorry okay I meant to get all the stars obviously one of the requirements here zero ropes cuts but I do want to collect all the stars so um another way I need to move the other way okay okay I got it ah all right goodbye there you go that's three stars right there now how am I gonna do zero ropes cut that's gonna be tough let's try to do it though up goodbye this shouldn't be too hard to get zero ropes cut there we go as I have to get up through that I don't think I haven't even have to get three stars for that I just got to get zero ropes cut there we go nice nice nice nice nice so we're looking at this I got everything I even got two clovers we need three to unlock the let the last of the stages or something sixteen level 16 right here ah ah no okay messed up obviously no okay oh man I gotta get a high score for this all right hold on Wow oh wait wait wait wait wait wait what's this that's not quite what I wanted obviously I did not get the last star hmm this is interesting what okay ah the timing here is so incredible okay we got this okay that's good but it probably did not get us get us the gold okay let's try again oh that would have been so close oh man okay oh man let's see what that score is I don't know there we go did it oh my gosh it took a lot of coordination what's next oh man all right level 17 let's try this out no clovers here okay okay interesting that was - I gotta get one and without using those okay but I still gotta get two three no she fell off all right that's so difficult do I even need these I do I do I do I need both of them though I do it's a slow drop right there this could easily be three but that's a really slow drop oh my god hurry is that even a drop all right trying here guys I'm trying to get the three what happens now what oh here we go let's do I'm still going for three and it is so difficult come on come on no I can totally get the three I know how now uh what no I know how to do it uh what is that no redo here we go here we go I got this I messed up what's okay here we go here we go he fell off again and he keeps falling off which is ridiculous to me no I didn't mean to click that I knew how to do it I didn't mean to click it I know how to do this I know but whatever okay keeps knocking that guy off that's the really hard part about this all right that's one way to do it that's pretty slow how do we got to do it we got to somehow get one star without using the without the whoopee cushions which sounds to me like doing something like this this is gonna be difficult ah one star without using whoopee cushions that is gonna be crazy hard don't even know what to do okay that worked ha ha all right what's next um okay there's a clover here even what's this do it's obviously one and no one asked for that all right okay doesn't count right there all right that's one way to do this obviously I know redo so this is a good start right here okay I get I get it I get it I get it this is easy oh okay I get it I get it I totally get it now here we go there we go that was good now just gonna get that clover and somehow get one star so let's redo this obviously the clover will obviously the one star I think is going to be here and then that's that's the one star right there and then another clover is going to be a whole different ballgame we're going to have to somehow boost him up maybe with two and then Papa and then I do this there we go we're getting all three stars and the clover delivered to them there you go alright that was interesting for sure so I got the clover great excellent what's next we do have three clovers now which means we can unlock those which is insane but we're going for it hi so what is this the fifth oh there we go but that's not what I wanted okay that helps a little bit maybe yeah that looks good actually let's drop this now and catch that and you're gonna bring that over there oh we only got one star or two stars not bad I need three stars to get the gold medal which is good all right that's gonna be good I think that's gonna be good this is gonna be good line up here I think nope obviously not gonna work like that nope not what we wanted right there let's find out exactly what we wanted I don't quite know right now now answer my pop that nothing okay I think I need that there honestly cuz I'm gonna need to be able to drop that somewhere I think that'll work I don't know let's find out well there we go that's the three stars that I was looking for just took a little bit longer than I thought I got three stars so why did I not get the gold Oh collect zero stars okay got it the gold is coming for you then zero stars nope like zero stars it's so difficult oh I got it I think I understand how now zero stars right there that's how you get the gold medal for that perfect all right that is tough let's move on what's next get all the gold medals so far three clovers hi what's that okay that's gonna lift me up here all right I feel like let's try this all right that's how to do it guys you can bring it over to um I don't know if that's gonna be enough time but I probably not enough to get the gold medal 4370 let's try it Oh messed up nope actually you know what actually I probably don't need to get that yet so here we go let's start off with that what yeah start with cut that rope come on there you go bring it over to him is that enough time that is enough time as level 20 what's next do we do this level one that's 21 all right let's find out what we got to do here um obviously totally I don't know what to do yet let's start popping stuff see what happens that's 110 okay that was one probably not exactly what we had in mind um probably gonna pop one of these and then we're gonna be able to maybe get the one and then we start popping the rest it's like um yeah I will cut this off probably yeah get rid of that and then we know okay I okay I think I know what to do so I think we pop this as soon as we can reach down there and get that star we're gonna cut it off we don't need you anymore this is what we're saying and then we're gonna try to look yeah I don't know and we can get that obviously oh and then there we go no he bounced the wrong way okay let's go get this I think this is possible there we go no wrong ways okay we do this is very tough I think come on go get that one there you go then you're gonna fall and what the heck you're gonna do all right just got to figure out the right order to do this in all right get that now right that was perfect and I even got the medal oh nice nice nice nice I'm glad I don't have to do that again know what's gonna happen here no okay we're bringing that over there you go what's gonna happen there though I don't understand okay here we go he's gonna bring this over there we go we're gonna actually cut the rope and we're gonna drop that there and then you're gonna cut the rope there he's gonna bring it over here you're gonna just drop it he's gonna catch it no I didn't catch it just two stars though if there's a two star solution that's how we do it there's a one star with no cutting rope okay cut the rope I think drop this guy over there it's all timing now it's not gonna work all right cut cut oh no no that's not gonna work that's perfect for that part okay here we go obviously messed up cut cut no okay you cut the wrong thing here we go this is gonna be quick cut cut drippity drop drop to the drop rate there now that's two okay he's not gonna make it let's try again here we go cuts cuts drop drop that's gonna make it that's gonna be good that's good that's good it's really good in fact I can't go much better there we go now the alternative here is I gotta get somehow I gotta get one star without cutting rope I think I can pull it off just got to do this just got to drop that okay yeah okay block that there we go if I just drop it oh oh no that's not gonna work at all okay let's try to drop it over here then I can't cut any rope at all so what can I do I just drop that will that work okay here's what we're gonna do we are gonna drop this right right there there we go and you're going to drop that right there and you're gonna drop that and get your one star oh but that's it that's all you can do no let's try it though man see is so crazy that was close but no cigar no there we go we got to star somehow that was luck I'm okay with luck what uh what uh what other levels do we have to do we got 23 and 24 let's see this happen hi uh okay this is gonna be weird but it might work darn hmm one star obviously two stars oh you know what I need to do I need to cut the rope oh here we go all right come on we got this we got this if I could just do it darn okay let's try again we push it all the way over there nope you pulled it away too fast man okay that's two but not exactly what I had in mind all right then if we bring it oh no he ate it not fair all right come on we got this if you just put it over here cut this out of the picture no okay now don't move anymore to stay stable man alright stay stable but no but no okay there we go that's gonna work I don't know if it's gonna get whatever bonus I need that is gonna work I'm gonna get five thousand Oh three points away you got to be kidding me I can't believe it's joking me in that manner that's not nice come on no no what okay here we go come on I did it right like one time and that's all alright come on what I don't really know what to do what I can't believe my scores that's as one no okay all right we got this where there we go that's got to be the top score right yes perfect and then what's up next is there one more level out there's level 24 let's go and try for that all right hi thanks for waving to me I appreciate it now obviously if I go in either one of those it's not going to work ok ha ha ha what Oh what do I do here oh I get it I think I get it already nope we're gonna cut that drop it there and then shoot it back in his hands he's gonna then what oh god I don't even think about that ok I'm gonna put that in there shoot it away perfect to the drop it then nothing's gonna happen because that's stupid why would even want it there ok I don't I'm gonna be able to grab that again no what do I do oh I think I get it already hold on you're gonna drop it right there you're gonna once okay you're gonna drop no okay you are going to drop it there you're gonna pick it back up perfect somehow you're gonna go over this way you're gonna drop that there then I'm going to shoot that oh okay I see I see you're gonna drop that you're gonna drop that right there okay here we go I got it I got it figured out and then I'm going to shoot it back up at you and then you're going to bring the wood over there and it's not going to be a big deal not gonna make a big deal out of it and I'm gonna drop this down here and then as soon as you get back over here I'm going to shoot that up at you you're gonna pull that over there you're gonna drop the whole thing and I wasn't you - ha ha ha ha what okay I feel like that was the way to do it obviously otherwise I won't have done it that way I'm going to bring that over there and then you're gonna drop that right there perfect I'm gonna have you catch that then what and then I'm gonna no okay and you're going to bring that over there I'm going to try to make it go over there that's not gonna work for me because it could have there we go I'm going to cut the rope that's the point of the game cut the rope there we go finish that three stars I don't see what I have okay achievement unlocked journey begins there we go one star no rope cuts let's try it out one star no rope cuts here we go again we can try this what you dropped it I think cut that alright let's try this again okay same thing same printout darn I mean how am I gonna pull this off for real there you go kind of you got to get the one star thing going on okay maybe on the other side somehow no that never is gonna work okay what I keep doing that come on there you go No yay all right that's one star no rope cuts and what we just did ladies and gentlemen took a while but if we take a look at what we just did we beat the entire first level we got three clovers we got all the gold medals we get all the stars and then we can watch a little bitty film here and then now this is the forest what's happening it's loading a video well we don't wanna do it you can watch that on YouTube obviously uh so 23 in the force is that mean I did

syrup some sugar some water some corn syrup some sugar some water and yes that is a hammer this tutorial only works if you use a hammer now we're gonna use some red food coloring to mix it all up and make it red and then just pour it into the sour patch mold like that but be careful it's really hot now what you want to do is put it into the fridge okay well there's no space just kidding this space in the fridge just put it right there for eight hours and once you're done with that you want to let it cool I come back wait where's this stuff oh well let's go get it or after the sour patch has been in the fridge for eighteen hours it should be completely solid see hard as a rock you can kill someone with this let slowly and steadily get rid of this mold check this out it should look like oh I think I decapitated his head I gotta be careful not to decapitate anything because if I do it's gonna be bad it's really hard this is really sticky oh it got decapitated let me just put his head back real quick cuz it's so sticky there you go good as new baby boy good as new so after that is done I just want to get your malic acid and just sprinkle it maybe like a alright let's see if it tastes like a Sour Patch Kid it cuz it's probably not gonna be a Sour Patch Kid tasting thing cuz all I put a sugar and red food coloring but it's worth a try [Music] [Applause] well it doesn't seems

is John Dreyer for Fender University and I like to show you one way to change the strings on your acoustic guitar now there's a couple different reasons why you would want to change your strings one and the obvious reason is that they just look dirty maybe they sound dull and or just maybe just broke a string now you can change that broken string or if you choose to you can change the whole set at one time so the materials we'll need are pretty simple string winder wire or string clippers and your new sets of strings for acoustic guitar I'm not going to take all the strings off all at one time I'm actually going to do it in twos I'm gonna do two strings at a time take two off and put two back on this way I keep some of the tension on the top of the guitar okay so I'm gonna take my string winder here start with a low E string loosen the tension on that one and the second one so you can see these two are nice and loose alright put this back here take my string clippers and we'll clip these two strings above the sound hole okay I'm gonna unwind these strings from the peg make one here and this one just pull those off it's gonna wind these up for easy disposal and by disposal I mean just throw them on the floor and then also take my string winder here again there's a little cutout on the winder that's used to pry up the the post from the bridge sometimes you could do it with your hand but sometimes if it's stuck you're better off to use the winder so we'll pop these two and I want to leave these in order so I'm just gonna put these here so I know which ones go back where now I take my new set of strings I'm gonna use these Fender fuss for bronze medium gauge strings and fender makes it very easy to know which strings go where by including this handy dandy string guide on the packaging okay I'm gonna start with my low E string which is the brass or the gold ball end here take the bridge pin and you can see here on the bridge pin there's a little cutout that corresponds with the string when it's inside the bridge so what I'm gonna do is when they put the string in first and then be sure to put the pin in with the cutout facing the string I'm just gonna press that in and pull up on the slack okay and just let that hang for right now I'm gonna take the next string which is the candy apple or the red ball end and repeat the process the string in have a little groove or the cutout facing the string press that in and pull off the slack now I'm ready to attach the strings to the machine heads okay so I'm gonna start with my low E string here and attach that to the machine head be careful on your end pins sometimes I like to pop back up just need to push them back in when it comes time to detaching the string to the peg I like to pre-cut the string what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna measure up the distance of one and a half machine head's this will give me the proper length and the proper windings on the machine head and remember most acoustics have three tuners on the left and three tuners on the right so what you want to do is thread the string through the peg from the center or the middle of the headstock and wind them the same way so I'm going to start this through the hole gonna leave just a little bit hanging out the other side it's gonna pull it down and as I wind I'm starting from the top and I want to finish on the bottom of the peg this gives me the proper angle over the nut so I'm just gonna grab my string winder here and start winding again starting on the top I don't want to overlap the wines either I want to keep them nice and even all the way to the bottom so I'm not going to knit the pitch right now I just want to get enough tension on them and I'll go back to tune them and stretch them later so let's go through the next string get to make sure these pins are staying in bridge so again I'm gonna measure up the distance of one and a half machine head's from the machine head you're winding which is about here I'm gonna clip the string again going in and winding it from the center or the middle of the headstock okay I'm just leaving a little bit sticking out the other side and just get that started and just kind of put some pressure on it hold it down and start winding again from the top to the bottom and of course make sure it lines up in the appropriate nut slot so we have our first two strings on let's continue to process okay now that I've made it to the other side the headstock same process same everything except I'm just going to insert the string from the opposite side so coming in from the middle in the center I'm going to go through this way instead of this way again measuring out one and a half machine heads which is about here I'm gonna clip that string just want to go in from this side here towards the center pull the string back give it some tension there and start winding the opposite direction of the last three again winding from the top to the bottom of the peg being sure not to overlap the wines you want to end up in the bottom of the peg there you go and let's continue on to last two and as I mentioned for the wound strings you don't want to overlap the strings in the peg but actually for the unwound strings you want to have your first winding above the inserted string on the peg and the second below this will hold the string in place and the strings are thin enough that I won't affect tuning [Music] okay now that we have all six strings on the guitar you're ready to tune it up to pitch and start playing [Music]", "FlARtGbwAOU": "there you are welcome back to another video with me cookies or else it's gonna be a great day today because we're gonna be talking about lip balms today's video was requested by my fans you guys have left me comments

gloss and it actually comes with a little Hershey's chocolate bar keychain too so if the packaging is really cute on this have not opened it yet don't know if I will because I love it alright this one right here you guys saw in one of my videos a lot of these you've probably seen in video this one is Oreo cookie flavored which is probably gonna be the most magical amazing flavored like bomb ever I'm really excited for that one too I'm so happy that one okay how cute is that Krispy Kreme donut so basically it's just the same as the Hershey's it comes with a lip balm we've got a chocolate iced glazed with sprinkles swirl lip gloss and actually with word swirl on that and then an itty-bitty tiny little mini little lipgloss to the flavor on that line flavor on that one is glazed strawberry donut and then it actually has a glazed strawberry donut keychain alright this one oh don't even get me started on how cute this is so two little itty-bitty lip glosses one of them is a latte and then this one is a tiny little donut lip gloss in there this one I've had forever and I've just never taken out of the package I don't even know if the lip gloss in here is even still good but it doesn't matter it's so cute we've got a little candy that actually has three different colored lip balms on the inside and along with this little ice cream cone a little keychain I love it when they come with keychains I think it's so cute okay how cute is that ice cream so we got a cute little ice cream little container and it has a little face on it this one is a strawberry swirl flavored anything with swirl I'm also obsessed with too okay now finally we've got through some of the packaging here Oh kind of wait a minute I've got this Dylan's Candy Bar grape rock candy I haven't opened this one but this one right here I have opened so it's exactly the same it's just gonna be in a different flavor this one's grape and then this one is this one strawberry so you just untwist the little rock candy stick and then you got your little lip gloss right there oh it smells so good oh my lips are gonna be so glossy after this video I'm okay with that there is the little stick and I just love that it just it looks really realistic come on tell me you don't want to like take a bite out of this it looks so real looks just like real rock candy all right then I have some really a fun shape one so you can see you guys remember these two I just got these ones at the Dollar Tree not that long ago so we've got a little lemon it's actually shaped like a giant lemon and then we got a giant strawberry yum yum that smells like like a strawberry starburst oh that's what I'm smelling so good I've got some really cute looking a little novelty ones in here these are so cute I love that whenever nom noms actually released these so I actually have a whole bunch of these on display but these are the ones I just keep in here cuz I reach for these ones the most so you can just take the little num knob off and it's like a little drink cup and then underneath you've got your lip gloss on the inside oh it smells good too and then this one is a peach flavored one I like this one a lot so I keep this one in my collection easy peachy deliciousness and then these little drinks right here are really fun I believe these were from I think they were either from eclairs or a Walmart haul that I had done the design on these are just so cute look at these two little twin kitties they get cherried away and then you can see the little ice rolling around on top of the soda Cup on each one of these this one's a doughnut stop believing and then this one is you baked me crazy and then of course it's got the little lip balm underneath inside the little cup so freshest these are like my favorite whenever they like make cute little designs like this then you want to remember when this one fell off in the video so I don't have that one anymore I had it in here but it just became too like impossible to use it so I just keep it for the container oh we got another little num noms in here this one is a little grape flavor name just put that one with its little buddies so we have in here oh we see unicorn and mermaid this mermaid clamshell is one of my newer ones you guys saw me review this in my Dollar Tree haul video mmm that coconut smell is so unreal it's really really pretty then I got this little unicorn head and then the lip balm is right underneath in here soda cans how sweet are these ones too so we've got cherry cute go bananas and naturally sweet full of pineapple in with these little sodas it looks like you would just open up the lid and just kind of pop it open but actually they just kind of twist open like that and then now you got your little lip balm and it does twist at the bottom so you can get your little bullet balm out from the top there absolutely a favorite these are so cute I see some ice creams so we got these little ice cream flavored balms this one is so pretty look at that cone looks like it's dipped in like raspberry sugar but it's just glitter of course and then you open it up and right in the cone there you go there's your gloss and then these ones too you just unscrew the top here and you got your little ice cream you guys also just saw these ones these really cool ones I got at the Dollar Tree that are like triangle shaped from LA Colors I love that they're actually like triangle they're actually triangle on the inside that's bubblegum that smells like bubblegum I got this little lip line around Valentine's Day from the Dollar Tree it smells just like roses exactly like roses and then I have this little star shape so here is this one doesn't look all that great on the inside looks like my nail accidentally pressed on in there hmm but still has a really nice sweet smell I like that one we've got a couple more in here that are still in the package these are really cool I'm happy I found these I believe these were also another Dollar Tree find either Dollar Tree or Walmart roof or maybe even target those are the three places I shot that all the time so I get confused sometimes which one I get things at these four that I still have in the package but this is what they look like I had these two open basically get two in one and you can layer them these are little layer at lip smackers so one side we've got a berry gloss and then on this other side we've got a cream bomb so you can apply on one side and then like glitter gloss on the other side so I think those are so cool but of course lip smacker has the best-tasting lip balms hmmm again strawberry starbursts strawberry starburst that's what it smells like so that's what these are about alright I have a whole bunch of these covergirl these Oh sugar these are so so amazing not only do they add like a tiny little tint to your lips but they smell really good so I've got them in all different flavors cupcake caramel sprinkle jelly and gum drop just kind of open them up and you can see I've really been using that one a lot so what about this jelly ones yeah see I've actually been using that jelly one a lot too these are so nice eventually I've used all of them a lot look at that sprinkle one I almost used this sprinkle one all the way up actually Oh same thing with this cupcake I've used a lot of it I do have some of these like classic lip smackers so I have these and a whole bunch of different flavors so we've got the strawberry lip smacker mmm that one this one is in Marsh mellow crisp oh it smells so marshmallowy this one okay this is not an official lip smacker but it looks like it's a Smarties cherry flavor mm-hmm yep smells like cherry medicine lip smacker this one is in gum drop this one's in pralines and cream this one is in ribbon candy and this one is in creamy peppermint I think this one was on a Christmas set they get a couple of these wearing a Christmas set and then this one oh okay this one I believe I got from Target from like the dollar spot this it's supposed to smell like pizza oh it does not smell like pizza it does not smell like pizza I have one that also smelt like I think french fries too and I don't really remember that one but I do not like using this one my lips dry out really quick whenever I use it so it's not my favorite but because it's got these cute little pizza slices on it I keep it around okay I am addicted to cuteness oh there's another lip smacker that one's in raspberry jelly and then this one too not an official lip smacker this one is from the Dollar Tree I think this is funny because it looks like you can like color your lips with like a Crayola but it's just of course a lip balm hmm YUM everything smells bubble gum to me right now so I think that's funny for like pranks it's really cute looking looks like we're kind of coming down to ant here all these are cute look at the little Claire's sodas these are so precious - looks like a little orange soda bottle this one's in the flavor of mango and then the pink one strawberry and then this one is flavored and it's that donut pineapple oh yeah cotton candy I think I remember saying that that it's really weird that it shows like really that looks like a doughnut pineapple right it doesn't look like a pineapple looks like a donut but yeah it says flavored and cotton candy and all you have to do what Oh pop the top and there is your lip balm under there let's smell sugary all right looks like we got some random things in here oh yes glitter gloss oh okay I need it use this more this is beautiful sparkly man is that justice Burt oh yeah it looks like it does have some sparkle oh I'm so excited yes I think I found my new favorite glitter lip gloss alright there's some random things in here like this covergirl gloss a color is really pretty let's check out this one oh it just has like a regular makeup II smell but nice little pink gloss got a little two-faced sweet peach I love the little peach face right on the cap this one I think I got for free I think this was like one of their little freebies very peach smelling but it's kind of like that artificial kind of peach but that also kind of a shear kind of gloss a little peachy to your lips and then the last one I know it does not look very good but I actually really love this one it looks like it's kind of separating a little bit in here this one's made by wet and wild I love this this one metallics looks so good on my lips I love a metallic so kind of mix it up a little bit and this oh it still smells so good it's smells so good I don't know if they sell these anymore but this smells like watermelon like watermelon candy it's so sweet it's so delicious so I love this one oh wait give it a little swatch there we go look at that look at that metallic lips will look just like candy all right that's everything that I've put inside the French fry and now I also have this gloss up here I think this was another Dollar Tree find I just love the fact that it's all rainbow it does look like it's starting to separate in the middle but hey the rainbow color is still basically there does this have a smell I don't know I'm still smelling strawberry now we can check out over here I had a couple extra things that I definitely keep out on a shelf at is this pack we've got for sweet little macaroons and these little lip balms that are in here and then I have these two lip smackers out because these are the ones that I currently have on my nightstand and in my purse and in my backpack so I reach for these the most vanilla lip smacker and my strawberry frosting lip smacker these are actually almost done you can kind of tell because they feel a little bit light because I've been using them so much so I'm almost done with this one I'm really proud but I'm also kind of sad at the same time because then I won't be able to smell it anymore oh but that's okay I can start another lip balm and then the last two items are these and these are my peeps I love peeps you guys you guys know that it's no surprise I love foods with faces if a food has a face on it I'm probably gonna love it so peeps are cute little

those halls instead of replacing the whole set here are some easy ways to quickly find the problem and fix your lights light sets have two fuses inside the male plug if they blow out they're easy to replace there are a few ways to tell if you need to replace the fuse plug the bad set into an outlet grab a set of lights you know is working and plug them into the set that isn't working if the good set still lights up the fuses aren't causing the problem you can also use a voltage tester to test the wires coming out of the side of the plug then test the other side if there's no power detected in the cord replace the fuses light repair tools are also great for testing fuses to see if they're working when replacing a fuse always remember to use one with the same amperage as the original fuse to replace a fuse unplug the lights slide open the hatch in the plug pop out the fuse and slide the new fuse into place using a flathead precision screwdriver or micro pliers makes this easier if the fuses are working another common problem for light sets could be the bulb one burnt out bulb can knock out a whole section of mini lights incandescent bulbs have a shunt that acts as a bypass when the bulbs filament burns out this should keep the circuit going if it doesn't a specialty light repair tool can send a pulse into the light set repairing the faulty shunt if that doesn't work the set may be burnt out from one bad bulb you'll need to find the bad light to replace it use a voltage tester or a light repair tool to test the bulb sockets for electrical current if you find a bulb that doesn't set off the tester replace that bulb or the one just before it unplug the lights pull out the old bulb with its plastic base some replacements have the base already attached if not then straighten the wires on the new bulb thread them through the two slots on the base and smooth them down and slide the bulb and the case back into the light set here are a couple more helpful tips squirrels and mice are attracted to something in wire coating and will chew through electrical wiring if you see signs of this it's best to replace the entire set there's a risk of shock or sparking a

carry let me take that oh oh you got it oh goodness", "Sl30degCmus": "tater tots are ready hey guys Eric Roma klar brothers here and I'm going to be showing you how to fix a mini claw machine today so basically this is just a mini claw machine that I got a couple years ago or whatever and you know I didn't really break anything on it but the problem is that it turns on and everything but it won't whenever I turn it on when I move the joysticks they will not work and there is a way to fix that and I will show you right now okay guys now I'm going to show you how to fix it so to fix the joystick problem where you move the joysticks you need to unscrew the whole bottom and around the sides with a screwdriver and then the top will come off and that's where you fix it so I'm going to go unscrew that and then I'm going to show you what to do from there okay guys I got the top off so what you want to do from here is this is actually a good way to stock your machine if you can't fit your hand in the hole but basically from here you want to take off there's a baseplate it will just come right off as long and then also there's a plate right here that will come right off you've got to unscrew it and then after you do that what you got to do is these wires what happens is they get tight like they get strangled basically from the machine like all the pressure on it and you got to unbend them so what you want to do is you want to unbend the wires over here and just want to make sure they're all unbend so yeah just make sure you could just bend them a little bit basically just kind of you know unbend play around them and then you could put it right back in and after you um bend them a little bit or whatever you put your top back on turn on machine and it will be ready to play I guarantee it all I got to do is I'll bend the wires stick them back to place and there you go okay guys so now I got my top gone and the machine is all set so now you're ready to play and see my machines nice and stocked but yes the machine is very nice off so now it moves side to side up and down you could drop the cloth whatever move the cloth and your problem solve so yeah there we go guys and that's how you fix a mini claw machine", "8dEdGX9bSf8": "underestimated this course we have access to a secret location where today I have a challenge for me from view whatever game is we have a challenge and that is American Ninja Warrior we have an American Ninja Warrior course we're gonna be competing the fastest time is gonna win $10,000 in today's video well hell we contact Gabe all right well let's do a rundown of the course let me show you guys where it starts where it ends and then we need to stretch and get this complex are you okay all right this right here is the beginning this is where we start and we're going to go this way you got to go over this hump no cheating you got to go over here and upward Gabe is and then you're gonna run across from here and this is where it starts getting intense you have a wall here you have to hang on and make it to the other side after you passed that there is a pole right here to slide down and then you have to climb up this wall swing on these things and catch the net if you ever fall into the foam pit or on to the ground or somewhere where you're not supposed to be you're disqualified and that's that and then you continue here and we have tons of monkey bars you have to climb up and climb down so let's say for example I'm climbing up this and I fall off one of these I'm disqualified we have James here I don't know what he's doing you do you and then we have the first Warped wall or giant ramp which is right here this one's pretty small the one at the ends a lot bigger but you have to climb across that come down and out the back and then we have this I'm sure if you guys seen American Ninja Warrior you've probably seen a wall like this where you have to jump plant your feet and you have to make it all the way to the red you can't touch any of the black if we keep going through here we have a slackline that you have to make it across a fall slackline you're done this path there's two different ways to go you can even choose to go with the rings or you can go with the ladder and then going all the way to the end that is the final right there so we're gonna have an airhorn on top of there and whenever you get to the top of that press the airhorn that's when your time stops fastest time wins when it gets $10,000 it's pretty simple get limbered up get warmed up we start in 30 minutes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my name is Gabriel from 21 years old I'm from Houston and I'm really fit from all those times my track coach made me run in high school I need that money to upgrade my trashcan boat so I support a potty and I'm gonna win my advantages over the other competitors I have years of paintball experience so I'm best and nimble I did parkour middle school from high school what is that like three four years and I'm really fast I was in track I did long jump I did 200-meter dashes fast my name is Nathan I go by the name unspeakable 21 years old from Houston I play a lot of Minecraft so I think I have a pretty big advantage considering I can do some pretty good parkour in Minecraft so I'm feeling really confident I want to win this challenge because I want to prove my friends that I can do something I'm athletic I'm fit I grew up playing paintball I grew up outside I actually grew up doing parkour so I feel really confident this feels like home to me my name is James and uh I'm ready to beat these young kids here I'm a 87 years old and I'm ready to weigh my strengths are my toe speed finger nail speed and my ankle strength imma win this course today working on my ankles but I'm watching you kid I'm just here to participate get bragging rights and everything you know there's a $10,000 prize though right ten thousand dollars mm-hmm Nia take this series oh gosh I need to get a new car James is about to go here the second he steps foot on that red carpet timer is started these are motors I have not seen he's climbing stuff oh he's great thanks he's quick all right he's moves on the rookies rule he's only using the gray bars not the small flat okay what do you think I don't think he's gonna make it run farther there's gonna try and grab the ring we're out 30 30 seconds we're at 30 seconds plot and it's got a good grip on the rope I think he's gonna make it fast but he's struggling I'll fall in that pit dude you're disqualified okay go he goes that's it this okay be the hard part to the Larabars really courts they really eat up your hands he's going he's looking rather good that was just easy for him there was struggle day not bad not bad into a wall to the first of all all right this is probably one of the most difficult parts policy we do oh and he makes it there is he's going he's grabbing the top level incredible stuff we have here alright now this slack line okay easy stuff easy stuff easy no problem who's this to do the whole bottle ladder are you feeling college is gonna make it this is our competition we have right here I feel like just gonna make it but I'll probably make it faster right wasn't it pretty wait a second one minute and forty seconds something at the point two seconds one forty eight - eight - hey feeling underestimated this course let upper body strength as you can see them all Lakes no upper body here kinda hit my chin on this warped wall have a bruise nearly equal here stretching really weird stretches kind of look like he's stretching his frog legs maybe he'll use his tongue on this is a very strange course today I gotta live a little bit nervous 1:48 though you can't beat that time I have money on betting that he falls in this run will you bet ten percent of your winnings if you went it will go to charity ten percent if I lose this challenge jammer starts he's not here goes he's going on the course so far so good oh my God he's really zooming by all right the gray bars news just like James in the previous run oh oh no Laura don't mimic this shoe no no it's fine he will survive I'll throw it in the middle of the course hopefully he'll find that shoe Bernie is that the course bars he's really hurt the hands it's probably the worst part about them mm-hmm no he's he's struggling like I read his faces oh he slipped up there first I can he almost lost jumps over the great thing enough to run up maybe that was a very surprising he took off his sock oh he took off of him less enough I assumed you did it for friction purposes sorry he's to the slackline he has a really good feet almost lost it there okay chooses the ladder there's a spider hollowing him right now yes this is the last bit so far he's at 123 and 125 point nine seven he officially beat James by an impressive time impressive I uh lost my shoe so I just took off my sock because I knew when I hit that wall my socks were gonna slip I feel pretty confident bout my time especially since I beat James but I know Gabe's quick look at home stretch suited up very acrobatic Wow Nathan incredible oh okay that's how the runs gonna go he'd lost the GoPro already all right so we got James all the time here right when you step foot on that red carpet okay here we go oh oh don't watch out don't touch thank you don't fall in that pit your dumb boy the cube won't get you it does bite you I think he's gonna go oh he slipped he slipped Center Nathan 25 seconds now and he's already made it to the monkey bars we call these the pyramid oh he's skipping bars oh never mind change his mind all right here yes coming up the first war boy he's looking tired really really tired he's happy right now he's coming across to the jump there it was very well at 50 seconds take that breath you're gonna need a voice okay people Oh nope he's still no it's good look at Mike's oh and he's going which path you gonna take so far meet James have both taking the ladder oh he's flipping on slackline Nathan oh he's taking the right path what times yet he's at 110 he's at 110 he's got about 15 seconds to be by climb below he that was close he's gone one outstanding my mind a beginner what was my one 25 23 seconds off homeless aw sit there on the grippy one thing that was an incredible run I can't believe I said that whole beginning part right there that was on very sounding rabbit I think that's what made him win honestly I'm feeling great shout out to my trashcan boat that's good upgraded because I'm about to win this competition if not already did you don't know if we're going it around you did you one bring me that money big boy we have money for game there it is you go No this trash can is about to be the best boy trash can ever bully there you are there actually is one I think what we should do gave obviously one super super proud of him but I want to do a competition for all three of us run on the course together we're not gonna do it for cash you've already won the contest I want it fair and square but I think we should do it for fun I'm gonna need some water my throat's really dry if you buy a lot of water now so don't know I'll tell you what I'll buy you guys some food yeah I'll go get it appreciate what it's the only one I'll get it for all of us just drop it I'll catch a

last Thursday the boys have the day off of school so we decided to I wanted to do with sweet tooth Thursday because he spotted a couple things 200 yen shop and I thought yeah that's pretty good so why not give it a try sure I came here with Nicole Kyle let me read them it's to Mon Q both of them to Mon few by Meiji oh there's more yeah she chose I chose Cheol monk you I don't know what that all means but it looks like they are very long gummies like a gummy string or some Cola and soda yeah well so it sounds pretty good grape and what was it Bingley Oh grape and Muscat so grape and green grape I think the grape one is probably gonna be good so let's do the cool one first I generally hate Cola it says 126 centimeters so I'm wondering I have like an F don't I think it is one long yep it is one long gummy string it's it's got a soda section and then a cooler section and then a soda section and then a cola section and you tie them together you can play jump rope let's try the cola first snip snip snip it's no longer 126 centimeters because it's in four pieces okay that works so quit nicely you everyone take one this go ahead those two are long I got the short [Music] hmm it's very firm it's not great as he loves it but if Cola flavours go what are you talking about candy it's not the worst I've ever had okay either the same we'll do it in two three four now take whatever one you want to go mmm the soda is much better all right good glass piece and three mmm as much nicer oh my recommendation to the major corporation is just make it soda forget the call of section or maybe mixes odor with something else like like a great so didn't great work cool so did Anita could work so to end like a ginger ale kind of flavor maybe maybe shall we try creeping my sketch yeah yeah great first and that works for me I like green grapes more than well I love grapes green I think is better than purple snick that into half okay that's the short when you guys need to take one of those they're the same length well there's no good that's a very fresh grape smell hmm hmm better than soda yeah no complaints at all it's a firm gummy but not ridiculously hard like the German hob Rio gummies oh god those things need a chisel eat okay time for my sketch muscat I don't what's called muscat they would know like where does the word Muscat come from no cuz they call it Muscat in Japanese let's go a green grape slightly milder flavor but yeah hey bear it's a nice fresh green grape flavor hmm I quit like that cold on soda and grape dog great then let's go yeah yeah like he reckons coal was number four right so it was number three grape was number two green here was number one the exact where do we eat it we just got lucky that was excellent major corporation okay fantastic yeah just just get rid of the cooler and put in some other flavor maybe orange soda how would we do put our coins look right nine oh thank you well in Mexico we'll ever just to eight then smell well it's gonna get mixed in because the the grape smoke group was fantastic and the soda smelled so so that brings down the overall score 5-5 I was gonna be a little nice just six we'll call it six and the taste I mean the grape will get a high taste for the soda gets a little bit cooler gets a lower taste so six eight six and six we put that at a twenty 20 out of 30 not bad not hugely fantastic if we had just had the grape only I bet it with a score to twenty four twenty five easily sorry Meiji but the cola dragged you down okay before guys there it's a big corporation it's not for guys I'm sure they're actually quite wealthy I was very happy to have sweet to Thursday with you guys today we just won't tell me now okay she might see this later it's a while those I am old well you

So let's go check out her hula hooping skills Wow, you're rocking it woo hoo! who is that? anna Anna? Parker is the only one that really enjoys playing with these and so we decided instead of keeping them in the garage We are going to move them into her room so she can enjoy them so we are cleaning them out and we're going to put them in her room Then you're going to take a nap Is that okay? No, we have been working hard today cleaning out the garage doing some yard work somebody woke up grumpy. Are you a little grumpy? Yeah Sometimes that happens, but to cheer her up Outside her door. I have all of the cool houses and all of the little people We got them washed. They're all clean and we are going to set them up on her bookshelf So you can have a bunch of fun toys in your room. Do you want to do that? Okay, high five let's get to work all right, so all of her houses are set up and then we have this big thing full of all of the people So much fun!  she's excited look All right, so our garage does look like a disaster, but things are actually coming together. I know that It seems like it wasn't that long ago that we were cleaning out this garage And I was so excited that I got all done, but when we redid our basement And we're really serious about it and actually started working on it more stuff came out here, and I was organizing bedrooms and I just needed to go through things and Get rid of a lot of things and for the time being I put them in the garage and now we are going through them We are getting rid of a lot of things.

This is our new activity Our new activity is trying to save [Pane's] hair From getting cut. If this was in Taylor's hair or Jordan's hair they'd be screaming this entire time Luckily it's you maybe it'll slide out I don't know how I'm gonna get your hair untangled, but I may be able to slide it out Yeah Mom's the Hero. Tragedy averted. Do not play with this net is going in the garbage Mom is not keeping this thing. It's gone. All right. So the kids are getting ready for bed We ended up not doing the activities that we had planned for today because a bunch of crazy things happened all at once [Pain] got something crazy stuck in her hair and We had to sit there and unwind it out And then Taylor guy in the face with the ball which was pretty funny and then parker almost cut her ponytail off so we were dealing With all of those things and so we didn't give it enough time to do our activity But we will be doing it soon. Maybe even tomorrow We'll see if we have enough time. I'm excited for it and the kids don't know what we're going to do, so It's going to be awesome.

calories you've done the intuitive eating you've done all this stuff and i know there's people out there who are like oh my gosh veganism like but i want to do what really works scientifically calories in calories out i'm not going to sit here and give weight loss advice or anything like that but you can figure out how many calories you need to lose weight but when i do my tdee says i can lose weight eating like 3 500 calories and i promise you i cannot lose weight eating that many calories 3 500 calories is a lot let's get it when you calculate your tdee it's gonna show you eat less calories than you normally eat i thoroughly believe that everyone's metabolic rate and everyone's metabolism is completely different and i feel like with people my size it's a little bit harder to figure out okay what's the most this person can eat while still losing weight if i literally sat here all day long i would burn 2 800 calories just automatically but the thing is i don't want to do that i want to stick to a pretty low calorie limit and i'm not going to use my fitness pal i'm not going to lose it i'm not going to use noon i'm not going to use any app i'm going to go back to old school pen and paper because it feels more real to me plus we all know i have plenty notebooks and journals that i can use how many calories do you plan on eating i'm going to try to aim for around 1800. i don't want to go over 1800 i already know it's going to cause me tons of anxiety i i'm going to want to order all the takeout in the world everything everything capital everything oh i'm triggered i'm just constantly overeating i'm not losing weight for vanity reasons although i'd rather not look like a big monster realistically i am 425 pounds overweight i'm short i'm supposed to only be 125 pounds will i ever be that weight no and i know with every pound i gain it's a step closer to my grave but more than anything i don't want to leave becky alone i don't want to leave my mom alone i don't want to leave my fur babies wondering where's my mom the very thing that's gonna save my life is simply just counting calories why is that so hard for me i really hope that these hundred days i will learn and teach myself how to cope without food i want to treat food as what it is there for it is there to give you energy and to make you survive it's not there for you to live for it what can i accomplish in a hundred days truly if you set your mind to something i feel like you can conquer your dreams in a hundred days i'm not sitting here and telling you that i'm going to lose 100 pounds i can possibly gain years of my life just because i decided to dedicate 100 days to empowering myself to focus on one thing me and i am so excited [Music] you", "E0UpVxTs9SM": "hi guys

going to be discussed here this is gonna be really good oh my god okay all you gorgeous people welcome back to my channel I'm Kelsey Fugate and today I'm going to be buying over a hundred candies in order to melt them all down into one giant Valentine's Day candy I'm going to go to Target I am going to buy all different types of variety of candies then I'm going to add over a hundred of those candies and melt them down and we'll see what happens I'm expecting it's gonna be very chocolatey but also there might be like a secret surprise because we're gonna put in those like conversation art see now also if you guys aren't ready make sure to click that subscribe button I upload every other week I guess let's go let's get ro me and TIG okay so I think I'm instead of like buying every single brand of candy I'm gonna go for like genres and then expand out so obviously you're gonna have to start with some conversation part will they actually melt we'll find out or they'll just be like it'll be like funfetti you like these Dove chocolate goodies gross I'm just realizing this to do a lot more other flavors I thought I'd be most in chokolate Twix this big old can Hershey's milk

gummy I kept hearing lightsaber lightsaber I kept saying like hey Bert is this fine I never go to stores and just go on one I'll just go food except for the one time I got the cereal oh my God look at this cart this is stupid so just got back from Target I think that I did a pretty good job I can buy absolutely every single candy because some of them are just exactly the same and I thought that the flavor would get overpowered which is like generic milk chocolate what we're gonna do is I got these all-purpose foil pans so I think we're gonna like MacGyver screw these into a firk shaped monstrosity and then I'm gonna use just a big pan on my stove heat everything up and see if it melts half this videos gonna be will it melt the answer will probably surprise us all it's like we're making one big conversation heart because this heart is gonna start a lot of conversation let's do it we're gonna make the hearts container accident wait okay wait we made it a really long heart

love frozen too I can hear you it should have been frozen a frozen part rice krispie treat they're not even a heart shape swedish fish hearts I kind of love it taste it to see if it's like the same

sorry oh my god I'm a heartbreaker Valentines dots which just look gross last but not least Twix minis now these are just Twix in a heart box that isn't even heart-shaped its box shaped with a heart but top it's like a facade I honestly think that we didn't put enough candy in there we have to double it [Music] it feels like it could be like 15 pounds oh yeah this is definitely more than 12 pounds and I have a 12 pound bowling ball and this is definitely heavier than that I'm sorry I know that all right melt it down to the pour it in and then we'll let it cool we'll let it cool this time I will learn well I need to butter this down so pops back out three I still have short me from the last time I did something like this I don't think this is really how you're supposed to do it great it's all buttered fired up so white chocolate I see dark chocolate and I see oh my god I'm gonna start small oh my god another Reese's there's like a lot less chocolate in this topic than I was anticipating so this will be interesting to see how it melts so white chocolate starting to melt wait a first second conversation hearts were browning but it's just chocolate I think this is weirder than the rice krispies treat it's very clumpy really the chocolates the only thing that's melting right now look at that this is like the thing that we can making fun of that looks like a turd now it looks even more like a turd don't you add something to chocolate sometimes when you're melting it I'm gonna put heavy whipping cream in you're gonna do the smell like a brownie I'm smelling like almost like a cherry this heavy whipping cream is really doing a good job of like kind of helping it dial back into a more smoother texture this looks like something that would be hiding under her bed ready to eat you coming this Valentine's Day season The Blob Magician conversation hearts still not melted whatsoever I feel like conversation hearts are the cockroach Oh candy it's gonna be here long after we all go this is getting weird the longer you melt it the more there's just like separating is nasty I bet it's like the corn syrup is separating from the chocolate you I feel like a witch oh

this you I only the bubbling that's really concerning I'm having a good time just seeing the more heat you put on it what happens it's now starting to actually look yummy again wonder how hot it is it only shouldn't take a bite of it hot like this no absolutely not oh my god the conversation parts are now fully getting melted down wait look at the powder that's a conversation heart can we get a F in the chat for that conversation art I almost wonder if it's ready to be put in there all right we're gonna pour [Music] that's a pretty good non-stick pan round two the pans already quite hot it didn't have to warm up so it might be a little different this time around ooh the chocolate starting to melt down this is like five because it's weird I'm gonna put a little bit of heavy whipping cream on this guy he's never going to be a horribly disgusting or it's gonna be weirdly good right now the smell is kind of nice I'm gonna get a tasting spoon it right now I kind of just tastes like chocolate I taste it into fruitiness I think it's more strawberry I don't think any of the stuff that's weird has melted yet oh my god I turned off the heat no wonder it's not melting I like that I know the phases now to expect so where's this face his awkward teen face no baseball oh babe you make my heart go giddy up what is that what is that maybe we'll make a chunky layer almost wants them

the handyman's even if you're been repeat your and welcome to the new viewers as well this may seem like a very simple topic today and it's a tip from the in the workshop but we all work with cords and hoses and items like that to run our power equipment and it's very difficult to work with something that's knots and tied up where this comes into play usually is if I have someone helped me in my workshop and they decide to help clean up they roll up my cords and I end up in evety re rolling them because most people don't know how to properly roll up a an extension cord so that it's nice and neat it can be hung F till your next use and when you take it down it's not a big pile of knots either work with the knots or you spend ten minutes taking the knot so I'm going to show you how to properly roll up a court this is my way of doing it and it's worked for years and it's very simple and I hope you get something out of it so we're going to roll up an extension cord first and show you how to do that property so you can hang it on your wall and it's ready to go when you need it okay we're finished our project we've been working on the trailer outside we got this cord laying out all right all over the place nice and neat there's no knots or kinks in it so we're going to roll it up so we can hang it up for use for the next time so here's our court and like I say a lot of people don't know how to do this property so here we go now take whichever end you want doesn't matter if it's a plug in end or the male or female end here's your cord and this is an exceptionally nice cord I mean it's it's flexible and I have to sympathize with people that buy cheap cords because you're just fighting that poor wire so if you're going to buy an extension cord buy a good one you know I put good ends on my court I actually buy cord by the foot and make up my own lens that way I know I get a good flexible cord as well as a good heavy-duty end that can beat up in the shop and it lasts for years okay and start off with try and lay your cord out like I've done here in the driveway so that you're not fighting kinks so er an you want decide on what size loop you want on a large cord this is about a 50 footer on a large cord you want to make yourself some large loops right on a smaller cord you can short you can reduce the size of the loops so here we go this is a very long cord so I'm gonna make a decent-sized loop first thing I like to do is leave whichever end I'm working with a little longer than my loop so here we are there is my first loop see that now you didn't see what I did there to make that loop nice and in a an oval there you take your cord you take your cord like this and as you're rolling it into a loop see this finger thumb you actually roll the cord see just a little bit right and that causes your cord to go into a loop so I'll show you again like this well I'm rolling in my fingers now I got my nice little loop now I can adjust the size of my loop here we are now that's what the loop I want to stay with next one roll my fingers roll my loop here we are get it the right length they don't have to be exact the close roll again see how nicely that's going together pull more cord in roll again see I'm rolling that finger like so and once you get used to this you can roll up a chord and next to nothing and it's going to look nice and neat not the king okay we're almost finished here okay okay we're right up to our last loop now this is the part that really works good watch what I do here so I've got this loop here or it's not in a loop yet but I've got this end and I don't want to get it all tangled in here and I want to hang the cord up so I take this roll it okay now I've got nothing to work with here so what I do is I drop that last loop all right lay my plug in like that doesn't matter what length and here's my last loop it's hanging right here I take this and I wrap it around grab it with my thumb I'm keeping this spot right here wrap it around now I'm pulling the cord tight you can see here pulling the cord tight like this wrap wrap till I'm happy and then pull the loop through and there we are I could take it over to my wall and hang it up now when I go to unlock but the loops to use the court I just simply pull this out let that drop off there's my end way go okay do that again bring it up here's my end here's my loop hang in here and I just wrap it around like so and pull or insert the loop through and there you go you can hang it in your truck if you're a contractor you can hang it on the wall you can drag it with you you've got a carrying handle and it's not going to get tied up and you can see this one here this is hanging below all of the loops so it's not going to get in here and you know tangled up and you get to the jobsite and oh my goodness 10 minutes wasted undoing the course there you go so you can also do this with a rope I'll show you how to do it with a rope okay we're going to work with some rope now and ropes they're a different category altogether ropes should be neat tidy ready to use not so much in the workshop for hauling stuff around but if you have work sorry if you have ropes like I have in my vehicle in my truck and you need a rope in an emergency to rescue someone they have to be neat tidy and ready to use so it's important that your ropes are tidy I used to sail and race sailboats large yachts and if you couldn't bring a rope in quickly and tie it up and get it neat for the next use you were off the boat simple as that and so it's important that you keep your ropes ropes neat just so you don't go crazy trying to take the knots out of them but sometimes that rope is going to be needed for an emergency situation and if you're a climber I mean if you've got a knotted rope and you're trying to rescue someone well it could be game over for that person anyway we'll show you what the ropes here now I'm working with and I think it's like a nylon it's okay the nice woven rope this is something you could probably see on a dock line for a boat or whatever but we'll wind this one up first rail I do it and you can do this with any kind of rope sometimes it's a little harder with some of the cheaper or the nylon ropes but you can still get it into a package that's really neat to haul okay same thing you got our tag end I'll leave it just a little bit longer than my loop so this is a short rope so I want to make small loops it's just going to hang in the back of my can't it be under my canopy in my pickup truck okay here take our first loop we're going to make a small one and again use that little trick rolling it and here we go and you make your loop whatever size you want what about this too long and my next one notice how with the rope I can pull the lens so that they're pretty well exact and here's my last one as I say it's quite a short roll now last one got a little loop here not quite enough to well I guess we'll try it we're going to do the same thing we're going to capture that capture that end so it's all together got my finger through here to keep my it's like the eye of a needle to keep it clean I can only go around once because I don't didn't leave enough room but there again slide it through the loop pull it you're here have a nice neat little package I can hang that in my pickup truck right by my back canopy and it's ready for use and to use it simply pull and there she is she's free so what we'll do that again we'll make a little bit smaller loops save more to work with at the end okay roll we are take this end here alright drop that last loop so I've got a fairly big one this time this is going to be ready to work with just going to bend it into a shape I want and wrap around once twice lots of this one this time three times and then through and it doesn't matter how long this particular loop is going to hang you have it okay we're going to try it with a nylon rope this is pretty rough kind of kinky but it'll still look at think we still do the job okay I'm going to hang our yeah hang our tag loop that very tag line and we're going to make our first loop and we are going to roll it always roll it away from you with your left handed or right handed roll it away from you to make your loop and here we go keep rolling eventually all your ropes and courts you get them all trained so they know what they're supposed to do roll again and again ok now we're right up to the end here you can see here's our and got nothing to work with so we're going to drop this last loop here grab this at the top and leave this down partially so that it's when you wrap you'll capture this in your and your wrap okay and I flatten this out wrap it around can see my I have my thumb forefinger attached in the back here so it keeps that that eye open and around and then put my bit through snug it up nice there we go there I have a a nice bundle to hang in my truck now here's a trick for you our viewers we carry large cords that are attached to the RV and we have to retract them back into a bin that's built into the RV and some people and the bigger rigs have an automatic roll it'll roll up that cord for you but most people with a trailer or a small RV are trying to stuff a 50 foot cord into a small bin through a small hole and I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about and we're going to use the exact same technique by rolling the cord into the RV bin we're going to do the little roll with our hand because what that does is rather than putting a big conglomerate of cords of sort of cord into our small compartment it's going to roll the court actually within the compartment so it's going to neatly roll in and neatly come back out again okay here we are outside of the trailer and this is the cord we're trying to roll up it's a pretty heavy-duty cord and you'll see me using the same technique by rolling the cord as I insert it into the compartment here's where it's gotta go notice the roll I'm rolling it doesn't goes in it's going in beautifully there you have it it's stored away neatly and it's it'll come out just as neat when I get the next campsite the next step is hoses as you can see this is a nice neat package I keep in my travel trailer so I'll show you how I keep it that way same technique and if you're using it for either your RV a hose or in your garden or on your lawn makes no difference you can keep them all nice and neat okay here I've got the hose all wound out laying out in my workshop here and just show you another little trick I use you can use this on any hose I particularly use this in my RV because inevitably I going to lose a twist tie or whatever so in order to finalize my hose and tie it up I put a piece of pretty not too bad it's a Skookum old piece of wire and I wrap it around the end here and it's always with me so I never lose it even I can hook it up and to my tap hit this a site or wherever and I've still got my twist tie here so there we go same idea take your hose now in this particular case I don't want this end hanging down like my my rope or my electrical cord I don't want it hanging dowling and incorporate it into the loop so I keep it nice and neat so I hold that right at the top there's my first loop and with hoses in an RV you kind of want to have a specific size you may have a place where you keep this hose in the storage box or a bin or even in a plastic container you want to keep it in so decide your loop size and stick with it so here we go you can see and you can use the same thing I did with the rope I pull the hose to keep it the loops even roll another one into place and another one and like I say with hoses they tend to have a bit of a memory so they'll roll up pretty well the same way every time look very little effort this one that's been trained well and nobody here is it's it's been a very easy roll up there okay and here's Mike final end here now this last loop here may not be exact because I want this these two ends these two ends here to be locked with my tie so I can wrap around once one way once the other way then twist my two wires together so and there you have a nice neat package I put in my RV and my little space where I have it and it's ready to go without kinks next time I can't pull into the site now I'm going to go out to the yard and show you how to roll up a garden hose same way and this one is a hundred footer I'm not going to roll up a whole hundred feet but you can see the technique works very well and keeps a hundred feet of holes nice and neat and tidy and ready for use if you look at my garden hose it actually has a white stripe down it and you can see by rolling it it's got a bit of a curve or candy-cane look just by accident it has a white stripe but anyway I'll show you how this works as well well remember and there you have it for some tips from the handyman's even hope you can use them come back and watch

I hope you're doing well. Today, I'm trying something quite different than the usual video. These are jellies! I mean to post this a while back when the challenge was on TikTok. But that's ok. This reminds me of apple. There's also grape, banana, and strawberry flavors. It's really hard to bit into the jelly containers. But doing so has a sweet reward! These jelly noodles are so cute! The grape flavor really stands out. That is the fun. With the sudden pop! Have you tried the TikTok Jelly challenge yet? The trick is also getting all the goodness out. It's not easy. I actually found all these at my local farmer's market. Do you like the chewy sounds of jelly? My son actually enjoys eating these as snacks sometime. He loves all the flavors! Just a couple more and we'll wrap it up. I'll try to film some more dessert videos for you guys in the coming weeks. Thanks to Liv Flute and Itz Meh for the request! See you next time!

um happy happy belated st patrick's day um you know i guess we didn't celebrate much this year it we celebrated more when my grandmother was alive because she was irish and it was her birthday and she was such a wild little fresh little sprite it was fun doing stuff with her on those special days but happy belated st patrick's day and if you didn't catch the tuesday episode i put out on ribbon candy hooking which is my site and also the facebook group rug cooking and punch needle club i put out two free patterns that you can download click on and download four irish stamps from i think 1962 they were just to let you know stamps in general if you're interested in designing and you love designs most stamps are that are pre 1971 are copyright free just to let you know that's just a tidbit you have to do a little research but just to make just to make uh sort of a frame around it but anyway i put two stamps up that are actually from ireland that i thought would so they're both kind of mythical one bird and one winged winged um cow i thought they might be good raw cooking designs or maybe something small for russian punch needle kind of thing or maybe something for regular sized oxford type punch needle but those are there for you still and those will remain for free because that was for fun for st patrick's day so sheila h hello in massachusetts good to see you jennifer

time that we can maybe start getting together again depending on how things are in your area so a couple of things that i want to get right into content i'm probably going to run over a little bit today bingo for those of you that don't know we played bingo once a month on this channel on friday night which is our cocktail night we don't do a live morning show on friday we do a live evening show and instead of being coffee time it's cocktail time midnight haze ralda right ralda good to see you and it was great to have you on the call yesterday can't wait to see your face next time so we do bingo once a month so just to let you know the theme for tomorrow i am sweating my somethings off the theme for tomorrow is funny calendar days you know how sometimes on the calendar it's like i always say this my birthday happens to be rare disease day but your birthday is probably something beautiful like wildflower day or or book day or something like that but i picked out 60 funny calendar days from mostly the u.s but some from other places and then rugs that sort of correspond to them so our bingo theme is is calendar days like salad days calendar days and you can get the bingo cards online now you can get them for three dollars each uh the link is in the description of this video you can see you can click right on that link and get the bingo cards for tomorrow night so you need to have them printed for tomorrow night i will i will remind you tomorrow that the game is blackout we don't do directional we do blackout and it takes about two hours we should be done in two hours if i'm doing it at my mom's i won't have the wheel and we'll have to think of a different invention but it'll be super fun and for those of you that win mathematically it should be one card that wins again so the odds should be one out of 12 which is quite good because if it means if you if you win you're going to win quite a bit and then you get to spend that money in the ribbon candy hooking store and whether you like my patterns or you need anything like that you could always get supplies hooks backing fabric plain door wool something like that transfer medium something like that i have the fiber tape the red dot i have everything you just need to ask so you can always use your money that way i don't keep any of it we just pull it all divided up by the winners and then you get a gift certificate or code for the shop to go shopping so that is always fun ruth great to see you in laurel maryland great to see you so that is bingo we'll be doing that tomorrow just make sure that your cards are printed you could buy as many cards as you can handle and we do some fun commentary in between quick preview to next monday so that's friday oh me too wendy oh that'll be it'll be fun so i got my box i got my box from nasa i wanted to show you this real quick because we're going to do this on monday i'm doing the punch needle review right now but i wanted to show you i got nace's box i showed this on zoom yesterday she did such a beautiful where is it packaging job it's crazy so this is a fast forward thing to all these beautiful natural dyes that she does she sent me a little gift too i'll show you that on monday so this is the book that i'm going to be reviewing on um because you know i'm we're going to be working together and i'm offering some of her needle felting designs as rug hooking and punch designs on a much larger scale uh in the ribbon candy hooking store so we're working on that together now but this is coming up on uh monday so look out for that all right that is a to be continued but for today we have got a fantastic book i wanna again i might go over a little bit we'll see how it goes i am looking at this book that just arrived oh walda says have you had a chance to ship your will no i'm shipping them today all of the new swatches are going out today so let me know if you need anything else tweaked in that order i had to put out all of the orders for the class which is uh there's two of classes next week so all of those had to go out and today the second wave of swatches went out because i had to die a second time for swatches i said initially when they're sold out they're sold out but i just couldn't stick with it because it it's it just seems too mean to do that so i took a second wave of order on the swatches those are dyed dried and those are going out today so let me know if you need anything else in that order because those will ship today so i got this great book when you belong to the rug hooking as in real cooking magazine book club it doesn't cost anything to join but they will send you um they will just so you know they charge your card and send you when the next book comes out so i i joined and i knew the next book that they would send would be this punch needle book and that's why i joined and so i got it immediately and i'm not seeing it yet but you want to look for it i'll remind you at the end of the episode you want to look for it on rug cooking magazine or i will give you the author's direct email if you're in canada you probably want to do that because she's in canada so let's take a look at this book you're just not going to believe this book this is called punch needle techniques and projects by simone voivodin i think i said that right she put the emphasis on the voi voj can you see that okay and this is a picture of her here it's always nice to know who we're talking about and to get her in focus come on camera she looks so nice um so this book i'm going to say it i'm going to say it is the best punched needle book i've seen i know that you know i know we've reviewed all the amy oxford books and other punch needle books for me this is the best punch needle book i have ever seen and to be honest i can't imagine that in the future there will be another punch needle book that will be as good as this one and i'm not i'm not kidding i'm not exaggerating i don't get anything for saying this as you know this is my opinion this is the best and we're gonna see why this is the best but i have to turn this heat down because i'm going to expire like i'm going to actually expire as in drop dead whoo got the heat blasting to dry off some of the yarn i dyed so the thing about this book is that we're going to i'm going to go through and tell you why it's so special and different it's it's very concise not meaning short meaning it's concise uh and it's very very very complete so i open this book it includes seven projects at the end so we're going to look at a couple of those at the end what i love about this book the organization the information is concise it's just an at your fingertips kind of a thing the tone again you know this is important to me when i look at a book is very conversational and forthcoming and helpful i don't get the feeling that she is keeping anything back or keeping any trade secrets i get the feeling that she's telling you the best of everything that she knows because she wants you to do well that's a good place to start so thank you so much for doing more do you have any hooking fabric with white grid lines um hazel i have my i have the monks cloth that's gritted um if you punch directly into wool i have a lot of like plaids and stuff like that um i think do you mean the monks cloth because if so i do have that gridded i also have rug warp and linen obviously not granite but the monks the monks cloth the monk's cloth i currently have a sears port and it's got just the one line actually not the grid unless you need a small amount then i have the other one um that was gridded so right now i have the one with just the parallel lines i hope that makes sense so we start out this book in chapter one with a punch needle a brief history now we've done this over many coffee times talked about the history of punch needle it's a concise history but it's very good it's in it's an in in a nutshell what you need to know she's showing you the evolution of the punch needle um starting with ebenezer ross and you remember that that name first came up for us on our first bingo night ebenezer ross is is credited from toledo ohio is credited with being the first person who sort of created the punch needle this is more of the shuttle needle kind of a thing and then she talks about the garretts and we love talking about the garretts don't we she talks a little bit about them she touches on george wells but it's like a two-page history which i think is a great amount for the history of punch needle and she talks about the important terms you know when you're approaching as a beginner you don't always understand the languages it's like another language people are speaking she really defines the terms really clearly what what things mean if you watch videos you hear other people talking she really she has the vocabulary down too and then the next part is like the bare necessities the frames the backing the needle itself she shows you just you know what you need to to start punching and then she goes into a lot more detail which is really helpful so she talks about foundation materials how do you know that you're choosing the right needle what she says about that ralda i would say i mean my favorite backing is for me monk's cloth it depends on what you're doing if you're using really thick strips if you like to hook primitive in like a number eight i would say linen is a little bit easier on your hands and on your wrist with the pulling it's a little bit looser monk's cloth is a little bit tighter and rug warp is even tighter so the one that if if you're hooking very wide i would stay away from rugwarp and monk's cloth might be a borderline one for you i hook eights into a monk's cloth all the time and i love monk's cloth it's my favorite but most people seem to prefer linen if you're punching you want monk's cloth if you're hooking real thin you could go amongst cloth or linen or rug warp really but let me know what project you're working on because that'll help determine what'll be best for you in terms of a backing the thing about linen is it's always very textured for me it's up with my three different strengths of glasses it's sometimes hard to see what i'm doing with great light i like the monks cloth because of the very bare white background i can see really well and i just prefer the way it feels but it can go either way and people can give their opinions too so simone says she shows something in this chapter on choosing your supplies that i've never seen before that is insanely helpful it's this thing here that i'm going to be referring to you see we've seen this kind of thing before for sure and i've seen it on facebook too she gives you a list of things like for example this is how how are you going to choose your needle what needle do you think you're going to need to use she says do you have a stash of thick chunky weight yarns that you want to use well choose a regular needle that's that's super helpful number two do you want to make a rug with wool strips or combine wool strips and yarn use a regular in either a 10 or a nine do you want to use both thick and thin yarns and she goes on like this with all these different points saying what are you envisioning making and if that's the thing that you're that you're going to try making next you should get that needle it's very specific it's much more helpful than seeing a picture of needles with the size of the loop she's actually telling you are you going to do this or are you going to do this and then you know it leads you to think okay well i think i think that sounds good i think i'm going to do that one and there's the needle for you so that's going to be extremely helpful she talks about working with different yarns and other fibers again incredibly helpful i have not seen anything like this before we talk about fancy fibers all the time because we hook with fancy fibers all the time and certainly the last kits that i've put out have been crazy amounts of fancy fibers and it is a lot of fun and i guess in the springtime and even over christmas i feel more like using them but it's hard to use them you have to use them in the right context you're not going to have a lot of success you might have a lot of grief and aggravation but simone gives a chart super super helpful that's breaks it down for you into red light yellow light green light in other words it's going to be great stop what you're doing it's not going to work or it's going to be borderline so maybe and it's super helpful so in the green light category she writes bullet points like any smooth evenly spun yarn non-lumpy bumpy loopy eyelash yarn t-shirt strips jerseys stripes patterns great wool strips denim polar fleece velour she goes right down with a bunch more things in the green light column and then in the yellow column she's like slightly fuzzy yarn or fabric thinner uneven yarns very specific description if you're looking at your yarn and you see a chiffon or georgette ooh in the yellow column tends to fray that might not be a great one to punch with so for example i'm going to be working with velvet soon and i keep talking with diane collins tobias who i love i love her velvet and she's saying are you going to experiment with punching with it which i haven't done yet looking at this first is going to help me figure out whether that's going to be good or not i'm going to try either way because it's stretch velvet it's probably going to be fine but i'm guessing because velour is in the yellow column that it it could go either way but i'm still going to try and find out it's just nice to know what to expect you know nobody likes a pig's breakfast when you're struggling with your uh supplies and then she gives you the red light fibers that you she i like how she says usually will not punch properly because it's so it's you know it's so nice to not have a hard no if you're in love with your fiber and you really want to give it a try it's so nice that she says usually will not punch well still give it a try right give it a try if you're in love extremely thick lumpy uneven yarn yarns with lots of holes in them you know the novelty ones that have lots of holes and sort of laciness to them uh boucle the big lumpy loopy yarns and stuff um of course when you are punching you can always turn the thing over if you are determined to use a fiber that you love and hook the you know bits with a hook uh on the other side to fill in spots that you want with the fiber you want if it's not going to go through the needle you can always do that so oh ralda you don't you don't have so much you're going to get into it just like this so fast the advantage of having a vintage adjustable needle to punch you can do all that heather that's a good point yep that's a that's a really good point so i want to also show you you know in amy oxford's book she shows you how to make the big frames that are like a card table cut out i love that information i also love this information how to make a carpet tack frame she tells you just how to do it i had a piece of carpet tag because i always do because this is how i hang my rugs around this is so easy to get and it's so cheap and simone's telling you how to make a frame out of carpet tag this is the kind of thing that somebody even like me can do who probably hammer my my face to my knee before i hammer the thing into the frame i think that even i could make a carpet tack frame so super super helpful useful information she talks about the edges like you know how you want to seal your edges whether you're taping them or serging them or zigzagging them and why you need to seal them to stop them from fraying she gives a page about copyright which is always good to have always good to refer to and i have to say when she gets into talking about color this is this is fantastic information this is a great book not just for people who punch but also for people who hook or people who like art there is so much information on every page on so many different subjects so when she talks about color um you know it looks like it's going to be standard color information and it's not she talks about hue value saturation all of those small pockets in the conversation of color that really affect decisions choices your taste my taste it's so interesting she talks about color temperature and it's for the lay man it's not for somebody who has a degree in art it's for the lay man it's again it's very conversational but she makes some excellent points about color so that you can say to yourself um that's why i like that color more than this color or this color is going to work better than that color i get it you know very very very simple and beautiful and then she shows pictures like this that are just over the top the same thing hooked with different colors right almost like a day scene in a night scene yeah heather it's so good it's so good to be open to punching and then flipping it over and hooking in the parts that didn't work for punching i that's that's just my way i love that way i tend to do the punching first and then turn it over and hook the small parts that that wouldn't go through the punch needle or that i wanted to do differently or a tiny tiny tiny scale that kind of thing so many options right so many options but she does so much with color and then she shows you this great photo of how she does her color planning look at that like the same image several times and she's got out the box of crayons and a little bit of paint and she's just feeling her way with color thinking about the things she talks about in this chapter warm cold day night you know basic choices like that but really good to bring to the front of your mind when you're planning she talks all about frames different kind of frames not just expensive frames frames you can make frames that are less expensive we tend to trip ourselves up with buying a lot of expensive stuff and you don't always need to do that you can make a frame out of carpet tag right and you're going to have a lot of success doing that so it's so nice that she's showing you other ways there's a whole chapter on just threading the punch needle right for true beginners and she's showing you some great photos of actually punching which is what you need to see when you're punching because you think well what do you do with the thing where are the loops going backwards forwards up down she's showing you a lot of pictures and there's a lot on gauge too because when we talk about the oxford punch we're always talking about fine versus regular she's showing you the stitch gauge throughout the book and also in her own patterns in the back she's showing you stitch gauge really close up super super informational i'm skipping lots of pages because i want you to get the book you're not going to be sorry that you got this book this is like a gem um and then she has a whole chapter on additional considerations like where should i start punching first directions uh making a dot as opposed to like a loop making a circular dot odd things that fall into that weird bag of tricks that once in a while you pull from but not always she addresses a lot of those kinds of things small design elements outer border edges you know things that you don't need until you come to them where you flip to this chapter and a bunch of your questions are answered right there this is a great piece that she did herself i know that this one was in celebration it's called who lives there designed and punched by the author check this out you know sometimes you see things that are punched and for me they're so heavy in terms of being directional that i find it distracting then you see things like this that are like are you kidding me like this is just and look at how she breaks the border it's just over the top yeah judith you need this book everybody needs this book this is so helpful so beautiful but you know my point is like when i'm looking at her work i don't think there's any difference in quality or heritage between punch needle and raw cook i think they are both equally noble crafts arts i don't think one is better or more anything than the other but the thing that i like more about rug hooking is in general is the way that the finished piece looks i will make a 100 exception when i see pieces that look like simone's pieces you don't for me you don't get a strong directional flow it looks like a picture without a lot of distraction in the surface and that i guess is the sign of a real artist um her work just looks so crazy over the top um even and um not in a traditional way like not even like uniform but like um colorful and variety like what am i trying to say it looks like it could equally be until i get on top of it punching or hooking i'm not seeing the sort of telltale things that sometimes look like punching i'm seeing what looks like an absolute color masterpiece and she's showing you how to do all these techniques this is all stuff that you can handle this whole chapter is on punching with wool strips because if you notice there are some strips here right these are definitely strips those are super wide she's showing you how to do that with a punch i struggle with this a lot i did a video on it i struggle with it a lot she's going to be way better at this than i am so she's telling you how to do this in this whole chapter punching with wool strips punching words right that's a big one too keeping them open and airy so you don't knot yourself up and make a mess out of it and then this book i'm going to go over a little bit this book sort of transcends um the the earth and the milky way and goes into a new place because she starts talking about using a punch needle to do sculptural work like walterboro style work yes so we're aware of it it happens but have you ever seen it look like this um what how crazy is that that is like luscious lush gorgeous pile so she's doing this with a punch needle and she's telling you how to do it with a punch needle i just find this amazing judith says okay so matthew says what would you say are the telltale signs of punch versus okay i wouldn't say that there are finite ones i would say for myself when i see something that has a kind of low pile and is all directional um that that's a telltale thing for me that it's punching i don't it's not that i necessarily like the higher pile punch like i've got an eight and that's not my favorite at all but i like to not see i like to not see a ton of direction for my own eye every person is going to be different but for my own eye i don't like a ton of i don't like directional lines to be the thing that draws me in i like the design and the color to be the thing that draws me in um so sometimes for me punch looks a little too channely like there's too many channels going on um that none of that occurs in this book none of that occurs in this book so she's number one a way better puncher than i will ever be and number two she's obviously mastered it so all of those sort of secrets are here again it's the channel look like the sort of low pile look or for the people who prefer the back of the punching like the wrong side because they like the channel look totally nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that but that will look distinctly punch versus um rug hooked because you know with raw coke you're always looking at loop a pile that's like loops you would never get that kind of channel effect with rug hooking and you can get it with punch and often it is what people want it is a desired effect so there are so many different ways um but for me i can usually tell the difference pretty quickly between a punch piece and a hooked piece and this book defies the idea in my head that i can because now i wonder if i can the pieces i'm seeing of hers close up for me it's pretty impossible to tell whether they're hooked or punched with yarn so i just think it's an extraordinary book youtube said i just bought an oxford punch needle eight and a half regular i think the punch is bigger than i want it's just beautiful okay then i went okay yeah i have the peacock i bought the peacock and i think in eight it's a very high pile but i can see using it here and there i used it for a piece i did in a video i'll probably go to it less because the pile is so high and of course that's using a lot more wool too but again that's a personal choice thing linda says the woolery has it for 28 rug cooking magazine book club has it for 22 thank you and i have the direct address of simone so you can get if you're in canada i would write to simone again because she's in canada her address i'm going to give it to you and then i'll put it into the description of the video is simone which is s-i-m-o-n-e at red maple ruggery.com simone redmapleruggery.com no problem matthew again it's my opinion channels versus not um i like things with a little bit of a higher pile so that's just me but there are everything everything is great um it's just a technique thing that's all that can be different so she's showing you this whole walderboro sort of punching high pile in sculpturing when when we're talking about sculpturing whether you're doing it with a punch needle or a rug hook what it means is you're like mr miyagi you know bringing it through and trimming it like a bonsai tree right you're getting a kind of pom-pom effect on it we've done episodes on walterboro but if that's not familiar it's going to look like where am i here you're put you're punching your let me get it in focus punching your strands through and you're trimming them for a desired effect this when you're doing it in rug hooking is called walderboro as in waldbro main it's a technique that was sort of evolved originates to that to that immediate area is quite popular it's considered fairly difficult in the world of hooking simone's showing you how to do it with a punched needle and i'm really eager to try it looks really really well done the the introduction to doing that sort of sculpturing with the punch needle i think it's over the top and then she shows you chapters like this with fancy stitches now this when i look at something like this i think am i looking at a book on cruel embroidery or punch because how can she get such fantastic lines and um sort of lengths stitches using a punch needle well she can and you can too i had never even thought of getting some of the effects that she's showing in these pictures with a punch needle it would not even occur to me to try doing it without a needle like a sewing needle like an embroidery needle she's got a whole chapter on more fancy stitches and loops so this is just it's just crazy and guess what else you can do with a punch needle you probably knew this but i would not have tried this without looking at this chapter you can do protein with a punched needle right she's showing you just how to do it super super super helpful you know in this for me more than anything i've seen before makes me feel a lot more interested in using the punch needle more often i use it sometimes i definitely favor hooking this book even for me who's pretty set in my ways um really makes me think yeah i need to get those needles out and i need to start fooling with them and then she has a whole chapter on finishing the rug and it's really good she talks about hemming the rug you know we always go to like whipping and doing uh really time-consuming finishes she shows you all those kinds of finishes but she also shows you just hemming the rug just simple finishes to get it done if you don't want to add anything to the composition i love to hem my rugs more than whip stitch but yet this picture makes me wonder what i like the most this is this is also by simone this is what i use for the thumbnail but take a look at this piece with the whip stitched border and look what she did right do you see how the whip stitching went right up to the horse's bridle i mean that's that's something that a genius does that's not something i would ever think of this is like genius brain at work and then she's got it coming down on the other side like a like a little end of a rope like a little tassel i mean isn't that something that is that is something so she shows you all kinds of finishes and this is probably the greatest chapter of all mistakes and troubleshooting you know when you do something wrong i don't know how many times a day on the page i see people on the facebook page say i was doing this with punch what happened and they show a close-up of something and everyone says oh i think you did this or i think you if you just look at this book on these pages anything that could happen with the punch needle that could fall into the category of a pig's breakfast is going to be addressed on these few pages it's very concise it's very good hey tad good to see you i've been thinking about you catching a proddy punch needle wowza right mom i know i know so clever it's super clever that's the thing about this book it's everything it's everything plus um walderborough punched needle and proddy punch needle that if i was going to review the book i would say it's everything plus those crazy things and then as if that wasn't enough then she starts the projects and she gives tons of projects that you can do with the designs of course but super helpful and what i like about her her projects a lot of them are smaller practical like this right this kind of thing but then i'm just going to stand for a second she walks you right through it it's not like okay good luck with that she walks you right through it she walks you right through doing the project and i'm not done yet i'm definitely going over sorry about that it's just too good it's too good to rush she walks right through the whole design you know so you're seeing pictures as she goes and you're looking at yours at the same time going yeah it looks pretty much like that so i must be doing okay so that's what's really helpful and different for me also with this book is she she sticks with you while you're doing it and she shows you great you know this is a great project too the be kind bag it's a zip up bag and hey if you don't need a zip up bag you still probably want to look at this chapter because she's showing you real useful things like you know for people that are always uh asking questions about how to finish pillows and closed seams she's showing you amazing close-up pictures like this that can be applied not just to like a like a zip up bag but a pillow if you're finishing something like that but she's showing you beautiful beautiful projects at the end that are just gorgeous and oh god i can't i just can't stop um two more things so at the end one of the projects is alternative fibers landscape so she's showing you punching this landscape which is insane but can you see that there's some crazy fibers in there it's a super gray day here but can you see she's got some different fibers she punched with so when you look at that refer back at the beginning of the book to the red light green light yellow light fibers because this looks like eyelash she managed to punch that beautifully she's got a bunch of fluffy duffy's all through this composition and again she's showing you from the beginning to the end what it's going to look like as you go this is one of her projects at the end which of course goes back to the 1800s it's punching with a punch needle i thought my stream just ended and oh hey anne good to see you oh and here's another one for your book list your husband's gonna be so upset with me but you know when you see um antique truly antique pieces from the 19th century where people have hooked oh simone came on i know it's you probably when there's someone else in the house in the computer it can be so hard simone came on so at the bottom of the thread this is simone's book that i've been reviewing all this time so she's down there if you want to say hi um but anyway so this feather tufting is when you are punching directly onto another backing and you're not finishing the entire piece you're leaving your backing fabric showing she's showing this in this example with the snuggle bunny and punching right onto wool now is this not something that you need to do in your life i mean have you i have not seen all the books we look at i've not seen anybody show us something like this a project like this i feel like this opens up the horizons into like a sci-fi fantasy vista uh endless so yeah this is a book that you need this is definitely a book that you need so again um in terms of recommending this i just can't recommend it highly enough patterns are in the back and they're already reversed for punch it's incredible so all the great feedback simone that you get you deserve and then a lot more so this book is available from rug cooking magazine if you go on their site you should probably join their book club right because it's free to join this this is going to be the first book that they're offering right now because this is the current very very new one but simone also can be reached at her email which i want to give you again and simone's in canada so simone s-i-m-o-n-e at red maple ruggery.com everybody needs this book i'm so happy that i have it because i'm going to be looking at the different chapters and projects all the time i'm going to be referring to it all the time it's absolutely gorgeous and so many good ideas simone you did such a good job showing us different things and we all appreciate that we tend to see the same things over and over and how to and this is right and this is wrong you showed us a lot of designs that are so and techniques that are so different that bring us over the top you know the proddy the punching directly onto the wool the sculpt the sculpting you know the walter bro using the punch needle these are things we just don't see that we're seeing all in one book and that is like that makes it really the definitive book for me on punch needle the definitive if i were going to pick one i would pick this one i think it has the most and the best info in it and for my taste the best designs i love the design projects that are in there too so congratulations on an amazing book um oh it's dot ca i'm so sorry simone of course it is canada not dot com dot c a for canada so if you're writing to simone simone at red maple ruggery.ca right for canada i'm so sorry that's me being a ding dong because i'm u.s centric and a ding dong so i hope you enjoy that i like to see all this great feedback because it's it's richly deserved super congrats on a wonderful book it is it is the best book that's come out and it is the best book that's come out in ages not just punch book it's the best book that's come out in ages um for technique projects and everything it's super super good hey everybody we ran over great to see you don't forget bingo is tomorrow night get your cards at ribboncandyhook.com the link to it is right here i'll put simone's email into this as soon as i hang up with you get your bingo cards and make sure you have them printed out by tomorrow night at 7 pm eastern standard time when we play our bingo game good luck to everybody before then make sure you get that done and what else i guess that's it we will look at needle felting and we will look at um naira naira russo's work on monday and in the meantime bingo tomorrow night at 7 pm yeah i think that's it simone thank you again and remember everybody canot.com simone you did a great book everybody's going to be all over it and everybody loves you already apparently so you should feel great about yourself happy friday happy friday everybody take up it's thursday happy thursday everybody i will see you on friday tomorrow for bingo night have a great day i'll see you then i'm going to ride this out for a minute so it doesn't get cut see you tomorrow you", "VHz9lqjm7YQ": "and we're all set all right um thank you everyone and uh welcome to this dmf webinar i really want to thank uh all of you for attending but as well i want to thank the dmf staff bob glenn aaron burke jared silva justin wilson story read and of course julia kaplan who's acting as meeting moderator tonight i'd like to say that we really do miss meeting with you folks in person it's been over a year since we've been able to attend the mla annual banquets where we do meet a lot of commercial fishermen not just mla members but others as well and this is a different reality but you know the upside of this zoom call is you'll have a very short ride home tonight after the meeting and we'll try to keep it as informative as possible the theme of this tonight is to really inform you about all that's going on and take questions and provide answers and we know from some of the uh the port meetings that we've been having with justin uh handing out some rope that you have a lot of questions and this is uh this is a great opportunity to get those questions out there and and to kind of talk to you all as a community at this time we have 77 attendees we've had almost twice that sign up so i'm sure there's more people that are going to be joining us i want to thank the mass lobsters association for giving this topic a lot of ink in their newsletters and also on their website and they've done a great job at getting the word out but this meeting tonight i think would be uh really uh especially effective because you'll get to ask questions directly to me and to bob glenn and aaron burke and uh and justin about what we're doing uh specifically the most substantive part of the meeting is really going to be later in the meeting where we talk about the contrivances and also our ideas about future buoy line marking schemes so i really want to make sure we have enough time to get to that so um so let's get into this what i want to do is i have about six slides of background um that i think are valuable for those folks who don't live and breathe this stuff like like bob and myself and of course beth cassoni and mla that because in a number of instances they've been defendants themselves uh in some of this litigation so let's go to the agenda and i'll just briefly show that so i've done the introductions uh the purpose of the meeting as i mentioned i want to get into some past action summaries like where we are i want to talk about future actions i want to talk about our outgoing ongoing outreach um and where we're getting the funds to do that um and how we're spending those funds i want to and then bob is going to talk about the weak contrivances which is really the most substantive part of this tonight and then our ideas on future bully line marking concepts so go to the next slide bob okay so um why are we still at this for after 25 years i asked that myself all the time it was it was 25 years ago that i got involved with the large whale take reduction team and we made a lot of progress in terms of population recovery as you can see in this in this diagram going from around 300 all the way up to almost 500 but we've had quite a setback in the last few years and and that's that's why we're back here um the population as of uh january 2019 it's a little bit dated now was just 366 animals they've been in decline since 2010 uh coinciding with what's been described as a regime shift in the in the oceanographic conditions which results in reduced calving rates and also the changing right wheel distribution um of course we believe that's added to this unusual mortality event uh with a whole bunch of mortalities including uh many mortalities up in canada especially in the gulf of st lawrence as well as some additional serious injuries likely resulting in death and the other thing to remember is um is a lot of the scientists believe that we're under counting the carcasses and and just counting carcasses is not a true reflection of the number of whales that are being lost and then finally uh of course entanglements and vessel strikes uh are still significant sources of mortality and injury throughout the species range the confounding issues for you all as massachusetts lobstermen is that even though you've a lot of regulations have been placed on your fishery over the last 25 years we still have entanglements going on somewhere in the range and because most entanglements are not cited and then most entanglements are simply uh recorded as unidentified rope it's it's a problem and it's a problem for for a lack of identification and that's why we're still here we did have an entanglement five years ago in cape cod bay it was a successful disentanglement it was a non-lethal take uh but a take is a take and that's one of the reasons we got dragged into court um and that's one of the reasons that we're dealing with it as we are um the picture that i show here of the of the right whale was seen just two weeks ago uh off of manomet in plymouth and it was a whale that had five-eighths inch uh line coming out of the mouth and it was very long it was over 300 feet so we're very confident that that was not massachusetts gear but there wasn't any kind of definitive marking on it but a rational person will conclude that that wasn't attributable to us for a whole suite of reasons including the fact that the area is closed but this is this sort of paints the picture of the challenges that we have and i believe that a lot of the regulations that we're we enacted and that we're going to be proposing the future will help exonerate the massachusetts fishery or clarify where some of these entanglements might be happening and i do want to say that most of the injuries and serious mortalities are in strong diameter ropes which is not typically fish in the ancient waters despite that population decline that i showed earlier we still see a ton of whales in cape cod bay and in other parts of mass waters seasonally just sunday we had a flight with 87 right whales seen in cape cod bay and the picture i show below uh shows the locations of those uh sightings uh peppered throughout the bay and um and that will change seasonally sometimes they'll shift to the west and sometimes they'll shift to the south in the north but they're feeding on abundant zooplankton it's a safe place for them uh there was in addition to these uh 87 whales not an addition but as part of the 87 there were also three mother calf pairs and i believe there's been 17 births this year which is a real jump from the previous two years whether i think one of those years had a zero count so we're we're there's reason for optimism um so anyway so so that's that's our reality is that despite the population declining we still get a lot of them right here in state waters so next slide bob so we have two challenges uh the take reduction team meets bob gwen is my proxy i started on the team back in 96. i handed it off to bob about five or six years ago he's done a great job for us that started in 2019 in april when they sat down and they addressed the so-called unusual mortality event and i can i can sum up the the plan which is part of the federal plan uh that that went to propose rule in our plan as well which is basically a strategy of uh weaken the rope reduce the buoy lines mark the lines and close some areas uh nymphs uh is expected to have their our rules implemented by may of of this of this year so they're still in in the midst of their rulemaking uh we're in frequent contact with them uh but that's that's the initiative that's being done by on the federal level uh and each state was expected to kind of contribute its conservation measures uh as part of the overall reduction of reducing risk by 60 to 80 percent however we were required to do a little bit more because of ongoing litigation that was filed by uh richard max strahan a couple years ago and the in april of 2020 a federal judge came out with a decision that was not favorable toward us the defendants and she pointed out that because of the take that i mentioned five years ago that does occur and the occasional weather backed turtles that that these takes that are taking place in state waters are basically unauthorized takes and what's meant by that is under the federal law the the takes that occur in federally permitted gear are covered by what's called an incidental take statement that the federal government puts out about its own fishery but there is no similar statement for the state waters fishery and because we have takes uh the judge has ordered us to come up with this or to apply for and receive an incidental take permit now the judge's order uh had us doing this in 90 days but it's not that easy and bob's going to speak to that in a few slides but we are very busy uh working on that application the regulations that we've uh that we've enacted and that we will propose on buoy marking or buoy line marking uh are the foundation of this right whale incidental take permit application and my last uh point is that uh june seventh or eighth i believe uh bob this um knows there's a multi-day trial and um we'll be uh we'll be on the stand probably the virtual stand uh but um there's been a lot of work done by a whole team of lawyers and and we're hoping that the judge will will see it see it our way allow our fishing to to continue uh and be satisfied with the progress that we'll be making on this incidental take permit application uh so nick slidebob yeah so uh the need to reduce risk i think i'm going to turn this over to bob at this time because he's uh on the uh he's leading our itp task force he's also leading us on the uh take reduction team um i'm gonna hand it over i'm here to answer any any questions on on any of the policy issues and and um so why don't you take it from here and i'll um i'll just assist so thanks yeah thanks dan uh can everybody hear me okay yep okay all right well good evening everybody thanks again for for tuning in we we appreciate this and we understand that this is a very difficult issue for for all of us especially the fishing industry to to tackle um so picking up where dan left off dan mentioned uh the order by a federal judge for the division marine fisheries to apply for and receive an incidental take permit so i'm going to talk a little bit about that process so in response to that uh dmf formed an incidental take permit task force uh that consists of myself uh aaron burke um jared silva dan mckernan um uh legal counsel from our department bev fuckson and tori lebate debate as well as um one of the dir the um excuse me the assistant director at mass wildlife who oversees their the natural heritage program who's in charge of the massachusetts endangered species program and so she's part of that task force as well um and what we learned early on from doing some research on incidental take permits is that national marine fisheries service and u.s fish and wildlife service publish a handbook that kind of outlines the process and gives a timeline of what's a reasonable time period for an incidental take permit application and in that handbook they outline a process that takes anywhere between two and four years and that's it's kind of an iterative process where we go back and forth with national fisheries service in in development of a habitat conservation plan um and and throughout this um we're also ordered by the court to continually show uh progress being made we have to file monthly progress reports to the court uh that shows progress that we're working on this to take permanent application um and part of that as dan mentioned was the foundation of this permit application is some of the rule making that we've already started to initiate and i'll go into more detail with that later part of an incidental take permit process is you're getting a take permit under the endangered species act for a take in an otherwise lawful activity in this case the lawful activity would be commercial fishing and so within the permit application we have to list all commercial fishing activity that has a reasonable likelihood to have an interaction with protected species such as large whales specifically right whales and also sea turtles and our most our species of most can turn concern for sea turtles in massachusetts is a leatherback sea turtle um and so right now we are literally working on trying to you know outline and describe each of these fisheries and then look at the potential risk that each of them pose to to the protected species and to their recovery and to receive an incidental take permit we need to mitigate for every single possible source of risk that that is um that we can determine uh and and through that process we go through a formal uh nepa review with dashween fishery service whereby uh they they have to make a determination of our fishery of of a negligible impact uh determination is what it's called and as a result of that you know we need to again not only identify but also account for every possible risk mitigate for it through management measures and then demonstrate that we can monitor that effectively and if we check off all those boxes we'd have an opportunity to hopefully get our incidental take permit and we're confident that we can one of the first major steps is is a list of fisheries categorization and so under the marine mammal protection act every single fishery in the united states is listed relative to its its threat uh level and basin they give it a category determination the category one is a fishery where frequent interactions with protected species or with marine mammals occur a category 3 would be a fishery where there are limited interactions or no interactions with protected species the massachusetts lobster fishery is currently part of the u.s lobster fishery which includes basically all lobster fishing in state and federal waters so it includes obviously all the state of maine one of the issues is massachusetts only comprises less than 10 percent of the entire fishery with 90 percent of the fishery occurring in the state of maine um and so as a result of that as currently listed is being part of the northeast lobster fishery uh it's impossible for massachusetts to really move the conservation needle through all of our efforts without being separately listed as our own unique fishery and that's the process that we've set out to do we've made a request to national marine fisheries service and have had several productive meetings with them relative to this request and we a lot of the measures that you see and and that we've already uh put into place as well as measures that we're going to be talking about relative to gear marking uh in addition to being designed to protect and conserve right whales and sea turtles they're also designed to distinguish the massachusetts lobster fishery from the rest of the united states lobster fishery and that's you know we view as a necessary first step so that well we can demonstrate that we can um move the conservation needle in this case and as a result of that uh hopefully receive our incidental take permit um and so we are currently in that process um and and moving along um so as i said the take process is a long one the take permit application process is is a long one right now we're focusing on some some efforts to characterize the gill net fishery part of the judge's order was to also include the gill net fishery in the take permanent application and so we're in the process of characterizing that and soon plan to provide national marine fisheries service with a a summary of that fishery and so they can give us an early consultation on on what we'll need to do and if and how we would need to incorporate that into a habitat conservation plan um we've also the rule-making process that we went out to public hearing on and ultimately approve through the marine fisheries commission we had asked national main fisheries service to to vet those regulations uh through the their the risk decision tool and that's a model that national marine fisheries service use uh as part of the take reduction team process uh rule rulemaking process to essentially assess the effects of different management measures and determine the relative risk reduction that can be achieved by each and as dan said at the beginning through the take reduction team process the goal put forward by national fisheries service was a 60 to 80 reduction and then so based on the regulations package which i'll go over in more detail that what has already been approved uh that you're aware of uh was that achieved an estimated 76.3 percent risk reduction which is substantially higher than the 60 percent required and hopefully will be sufficient so that um it distinguishes us and and makes it makes a good case to the service that we are in fact more conservative and that our fishery has a negligible impact on on the species um moving forward uh we'll also have to address and account for interactions and takes with with sea turtles um that will be addressed separately in the coming year um our hope is that that those won't be as difficult to achieve we but you know that remains to be seen uh that's something that we'll we'll we'll continue to work on and at a later date we'll reach out to the fishing industry and start to to deal with that um quickly just to go over the actions that we've taken so far to to achieve this and what's next so for this current season effective march 5th dmf has extended the trap gear closure through may 15th to the new hampshire border we're doing after may 1st we have the reserve the right to manage that in a dynamic fashion whereby if right whales are not cited in state waters during that time period we have the ability between may 1st and may 15th to open the closure early and we'll continue to monitor that situation and and we're in the process of enhancing um surveillance efforts in the in massachusetts bay and north shore areas too to be poised to be able to to monitor the whales and and lift the closures early if possible the other measure effective may first is a maximum 3 8 inch buoy line diameter for commercial traps um this is largely a rule put into place as an additional means to mark massachusetts gear and distinguish us as being unique we're the only jurisdiction who will uh prohibit rope greater than 3 8 blue line diameter and one of the one of the more current trends that we're seeing in if you look take look at the gear that's taken off of right whales from entanglements in the last 10 years it's changed pretty dramatically from what we saw in the 10 years prior to that so since 2010 what we've been seeing is a real preponderance of large diameter rope rope in excess of a half inch and often really long pieces of rope um and that that that comprises in excess of eighty percent uh of the of in those cases where gear is taken off a whale that large diameter rope is present in eighty percent of the cases the opposite when we looked at that data previous to 2010 it used to be the case that um the vast majority in excess of 70 of the rope prior to 2010 was of rope less than a half inch diameter and so i think this falls into line with what we have learned about the change in distribution of right whales they're increasingly using more offshore waters and also waters up in the gulf of st lawrence where larger gear types are more prevalent and this seems to be showing up and so this this is a definitive way for massachusetts to rule itself out in any case whereby we see a a bully line that comes off a whale in entanglement greater than 3 8 inch diameter we know that it's not from massachusetts uh also effective may first of this year is the requirement of the 1700 pound breaking strength brewery line for all commercial traps through the use of fully formed weak and or approved contrivances in this case the contrivance were you know also calling them inserts or different names for them but it'd be some device which i'll go into more or detail in a little bit that weakens the rope at pre to determine the root areas and the rule as it's currently written it requires that those weak insertions be placed um no less than every 60 feet in the top 75 of the buoy line um and so later if there's some specific questions about that or we can go through examples and i i could indicate uh how many buoy lines would be necessary um additional stuff that dmf is working on is uh we're currently we received a fairly large grant from the national fish and wildlife foundation um to kind of scope out um the the the technological operational and financial feasibility of ropeless fishing um our what would do this this effort we've contracted a uh nil oppenheim who is a researcher out of maine um who has an extensive experience um in with with fixed gear fisheries as well as protected species from previous work he's done out in california with a dungeness crab fishery and he's interviewed interviewing a wide range of both fishing industry members state and federal regulators gear technologists and developers as well as ngos and conservation organizations and essentially our job here is to provide the deliverables are to provide um the granting the grantor which is in this case national fisheries service with some research priorities moving forward so they can determine how best to spend money to deal with these issues and so there's more details to to come on that um later and certainly as this is that research uh moves along we're happy to host an another webinar like this and give more detail about that but for tonight the focus is really going to be focus on uh looking at weak contrivances and weak growth and so we'll talk more about that um what's next uh one of the most important things is going to be changing our gear marking requirements uh we're going to be proposing new gear marker requirements both to help make mass gear as uniquely identifiable and especially to help differentiate it from both other states but also gear set in federal waters and this is a kind of a key aspect of our incidental take permit because moving forward any entanglements that occur uh we have to be careful that we don't mistakenly have to accept responsibility for gear that was not deployed by massachusetts and so a unique gear markings is going to be a necessary part of that um and then next we'll move on to the next slide um so this is just a summary of those actions oh i did want to mention on that gear marking uh our plan is to to go into rule making this year and try to get those regulations codified and in the books by june or july of 2021 however um they would not be effective the new gear marking rules would not be required or or effective until february 1st of 2022 so there's no there's no need to rush and try to gear mark for this coming fishing year uh this will be something that we're work gonna work on get it into place and you'll have until next year uh to to get it in and so this is just here a table that shows the effective the action date when dmf took action and then the effective date when it's uh goes into place and as i said um march 5th is when the seasonal dynamic closure for the entire state waters from chatham north went into place max bowie line and contrivances are effective may 1st of this year other actions of note is the federal biological opinion we that's due to be the draft biological opinion was put out um in the late of or either early i believe it was late 2020 or early 2021 and it's the exact date escapes me now but in this winter it came out with a proposed biological opinion um and nymphs is uh on schedule and ordered by in a separate litigation case to have that out and published i believe by and this should say may 31st of 2021 is my understanding uh that's coming out and and then also nymphs has a several proposed rules that are part of the atlantic lodge will take reduction team those are from massachusetts are no different than what we've already put in place so we're a little bit ahead of the game the one difference is that they uh they will be in uh putting their uh gear marking requirements into place um and they're also um in the process of can scoping and considering how to allow ropeless fishing in closed areas and that'll hopefully be part of the rulemaking that'll be finalized later in the summer um just so everyone's aware this is a a picture or a map of the closed area the pink area is the traditional mass bay restricted area and the bright red area is in the newly added edition of massachusetts bay in the north shore up to the new hampshire border that was added this year um this is a whale sightings map reason we put this i put this in was there a folks are a lot of questions about whether or not we needed to extend the closure north and uh to throughout mass bay and up to the north shore uh because of whether or not there were actually whales present up there and while certainly the whales are not as dense as they are down in cape cod bay during that time period in the last four or five years we've seen an increasing trend especially late in the season uh in april and then in may of wales uh being up and around mass bay and um and off of cape ann uh and then that's you know given that risk it's something that we we felt we really needed to address because um of our need to you know for the incidental take permit to be able to identify and mitigate for all potential sources of significant risk and this is certainly one of them uh what's the status of ropeless fishing uh so massachusetts in in recent years has um provided letters of authorization for several fishermen working with nash marine fisheries service to test kind of the pop-up buoy mechanisms specifically during the the open fishing season uh nibs gear technologists are are working on this effort um putting in doing a lot of work on on testing the efficacy of the epi of the the callback buoy systems um which seem to work very well uh what one of the other aspects that still needs sufficient work is kind of the marking and location system and and the issues related to how all gear types including mobile gear and other fixed gear can you know see this unbooid gear and so research on that continues um to uh to go on and as i said dmf is currently researching this in a large scale grant that results will come out at the end of this year and then finally nibs uh proposed rule if and action actually transforms closures to pot trap to pots and traps to closures of persistent buoy lines so they're entertaining changing that to open the door to allow ropeless fishing in enclosed areas however my our understanding is that they still plan to use their exempted fisheries permit uh process to uh to vote to um permit that activity and that's likely to be required and moving forward dmf expects nymphs to use efps to develop to be used as primary as a mean to develop technologies and not simply to just allow uh the removable dually lines and and to allow grappling with gear all right so now i would like to get into kind of the meat of what i think some of the most important discussions are tonight and to talk a little bit about gear marking uh so in the national noaa's lobster gear marking proposal that came out with the proposed rules um national marine fisheries service uh suggested that the mass color would be red and that for state water fishermen there would be one three foot mark within the top 12 feet of buoy line followed by two one foot red marks in the bottom half and you see in the the little diagram on the right the state waters marks that look like that and then for federal waters what they proposed was just adding an additional six inch green mark and i think the logic behind what that was to for those boats who are especially who are dual permanent and seasonally fish in both state and federal waters to make the mark fairly simple so that it was easy for fishman to kind of add on the fly when they're moving at or take off on the fly when they're moving gear um and that you know that was the primary idea behind it unfortunately the problem is is that in in most entanglement cases that we see where gear is retrieved or we off a whale um very most often the surface system including the buoy and the top several feet of rope are not retained and so the result of that is um a gear marking scheme where if you remove that one six inch green mark looks just like the state waters gear marking scheme um and so it's our opinion and we provided comment to the service about this was that that the proposed gear marking scheme for federal waters wasn't sufficient to adequately distinguish state waters gear put it fished in massachusetts versus that of massachusetts boats fishing in federal waters and so we've we've asked you know we've mentioned this to nymphs we've asked them to reconsider and and change it um and it's for at the end of the day given the the current status of right whales pending litigation as well as the nymphs uh biological opinion in the draft environmental impact statement which clearly states that the incidental take statement only covers that fishing activities uh in federal waters and each state would be responsible for their own incidental take permit for those reasons we feel it's absolutely critical to uniquely identify massachusetts fishing gear and so because of that we have been working on some additional year marking uh proposals that we're likely to move forward on in in the coming weeks to um and here's what we're proposing and so we go we got some good feedback too from some folks at mla beth cassoni had a good point and this relates to the size of the marks and so what we see here is on the left is what's proposed under the nibs rule making and to the right is what dmf is is proposing we think for federal waters under so that would be the third one from the left dmf proposal for eez we're considering that requiring massachusetts boat baseball to fish in the easy z to put a green mark next to every red mark to clearly indicate that it's front of waters now i we understand that this is a lot of extra work and difficulty difficulty for for our fishermen especially those who go back and forth across that but unfortunately we just don't see a way around it and ultimately can't risk the potential for us getting um blamed for it entanglement that we didn't cause and then on the far right is what we're proposing for state waters and so it's a much higher frequency of marks that's to help distinguish us from all the other in just all the other states which is one of the things that we have been asked to to do by national and fisheries service if to get our list of fisheries distinction we need to uniquely mark our gear and so to to do that we're proposing both uh changing the number of marks as well as the size of the marks and so all the states right now are using 12 inch marks um we're thinking of proposing 24 inch or two foot marks instead of one foot marks uh to to make those those unique and then making the frequency uh greater um the other thing is we're trying to take advantage of the weak contrivance rules which require you to put a a weak contrivance in every 60 feet of the top 75 percent of the buoy line and so with that if you're using a short section of the red weak rope as a weak contrivance in this case it would also count uh as one of your marks in this string and so we're trying to take advantage of of that as well and so how the rule would be worded would be something on the order of one red mark within 12 feet of the buoy line followed by at least four red marks measuring at least one foot uh throughout the remainder of the buoy lounge with no more than 60 feet between any mark and so this is a little complicated uh at first but it's actually fairly simple so it's just basically saying that no buoy line can have less than four or five and and no buoy line can have a length of of of rope greater than 60 feet without a mark and if it checks off both of those boxes it would be compliant the objectives of doing this is to better differentiate between gear set and state waters versus the ez it enhances our itp application as mass gets state waters gear will be uniquely marked in a manner that is more conservative than is required in other jurisdictions and it also utilizes weak contrivances as a means of complying with gear and so that that's that's what we're looking at i'm likely to go to rule making um i can certainly later at the end of this presentation i'll uh we can take questions and comments about that too and then finally and i appreciate your patience there's a lot of material um weak roping contrivances and so this rule as i mentioned earlier was put into place effective may 1 of this year the goal that we we took moving into this was develop weakened drivences that are inexpensive easy to implement and break out of below 1700 pounds and the criteria that we set was that all contrivances must be identifiable repeatable and enforceable um and that's something that nationwide fisheries service is advising all jurisdictions that that's going to be a criteria that they put into their rules um and so we you know we're out ahead of that of their schedule uh but so we're taking that as part of our uh of our rulemaking and so we worked with commercial fishermen throughout the state to develop develop eight different contrivances that fishermen can use to comply with the new regulations it was actually really good i was getting we got a bunch of text emails phone calls from different fishermen from you know from the outer cape from gloucester from cape cod bay from buzzard's bay like all over uh guys coming up with different ideas for us to develop and have tested um and what was good is a lot of the options from different ports were similar guys had similar ideas uh and so we worked with them to develop um 10 samples of each of each option and then we ship those up to main to the rope breaking machine to be tested and so far the the results that have come back have been very encouraging the results show that most of the options that we tested broke at or below the required 1700 pounds um all these options were then the data was shared with national maine fisheries service um and nymphs has indicated that our our contrivances are consistent with a criteria for approval that they are creating right now and so while they can't say they can't use the approved word at this point because their rules are not finalized i that was a strong statement by them and we appreciate it saying that you know what what we've done so far is on the right track um and we continue to work with nymphs as well as maine dmr new hampshire fish and game and rhode island dm to develop workable options and certainly are open to additional options and i'm going to go over what we have approved so far um and then uh so our weak rope options use three different materials um two are weak rope and the other option is um is using a anova braid sleeve and so the two weak ropes the first is the fully formed red weak rope which is on the left made by rocky mount cordage company this has consistently been been tested and shown to break uh less than 1700 pounds usually around six you know right around mid like 1650 or close to 17 and the raw rope uh and also the rocky mountain quarters companies uh fully formed 17 pounds bonded candy calling a candy cane root that's a picture on the right uh that's the latest that's a version 2.0 uh the first version that they sent uh was was coming apart too easy and unwinding uh so they've added a bonding agent it makes it pretty stiff but uh it's workable for most for the most part and it's on my understanding that national main fishery service is also working with some other rope manufacturers including one in india who's currently has shipped an additional weak rope option we don't have it in hand yet hasn't been tested but there are additional options coming um here are the test results um and you can see this this is both the mean and the median breaking strength and what what i thought it was important to show here is a couple of things is uh while they all pass the the conservation test of 700 pounds with the exception of one which was using a butt splice on the bonded candy cane rope was consistently breaking over 1800 pounds so we're not going to approve that option at this time or it needs further development and testing but all the other options did break at or below 1700 pounds or within that tolerance um what's good about it though is is it while they broke at less than 17 they weren't super weak we didn't have any options that we tested that were breaking at like a thousand or less or or lower braking strengths that makes them not really um workable for commercial fishing operation and so this is you know these are the data um for the for those options and then here is some pictures of describing them so the one on the far left is is is a lazy splice using four tucks with the red rope uh that passed we tested it with three tucks of the red rope that also passed um then a a a idle loop splice where we were where the rope is tucked over um that passed and then on the far right a butt splice with the the red rope so these are the four options that are currently approved with using pieces a three foot section of the red minimum of a three foot piece of the red rope um intertwined into your normal buoy line uh would would be approved in this case and these are the different options um for candy cane rope that's a little bit different um so the four tuck lazy splice with bonded candy cane was approved the eye splice like his picture here on the right with the candy cane rope was approved um the three tuck lazy splice with bonded candy cane rope was not tested and the reason for that is the rope has a pretty hard leg it's pretty hard to work with um if fishermen are really interested in the three tuck uh i think we can we can develop that and test it but the four tuck works very well um and has been approved and then there's the one option the butt splice which i i showed here up in this figure the one highlighted in yellow which we did not approve because it's just consistently breaking too high and so that's not approved at this time additional contrivances are those that use the the nova braid or also called the cell short sleeve uh this photo here um just a little back story first is that last year for through our eventless trap survey dmf employed these on virtually all of our buoy lines from our eventless trap survey um in addition to that there's several cell shore fishermen who have been using these for up to five years and if installed correctly they work very well and their braking strength is on par with the weak rope options and so uh the picture on the left is a kind of a close-up of how the ends are tucked in and then the picture in the middle is just a regular raw cell short sleeve and then the option on the far right uh was an option that i believe a fisherman out of a plymouth sent to us and he he wanted to attach the uh the sleeve in a different way and so what he asked is if you could attach the two pieces with the sleeve hog ring the ends and then cover them with heat shrink tubing and so we had that tested as well just to make sure that adding the heat shrink tubing and didn't enhance the braking strength and as you can see from the test results here the one at the bottom number option eight south shore sleeve that had a mean breaking strength of 1650 which is you know right on par with all the other options tested so those options are uh are approved as well and so in in in total uh with those are the options that we have we have uh eight different contrivance configurations and and you and also the ability to fish fully formed rope um so we understand that you know this changeover is uh is difficult for folks and so we're doing our best to try to help out um dmf uh we received uh funds through an asmc grant and also directly from governor baker who set aside uh two hundred thousand dollars for us to to purchase uh rope and sell shore sleeves uh to date we've we've purchased 2500 coils of weak rope and seven thousand cell short sleeves and our goal is to provide every mass pot trap fisherman with up to two coils of weak rope and up to 20 sleeves uh and possibly more sleeves depending on how supplies last and we may be able to purchase some additional if there's interest based on feedback we've gotten from a few fishermen who who kind of work through the math with their gear we anticipate that this will give enough fishermen enough material to rig all of their buoy lines um and so it's our hope that um that that's the case we're hosting several rope distribution events throughout the state our new staff member justin wilson was hired specifically to help the industry with this rollout justin's been working to set up these weak rope distribution events throughout the state the first round occurred from march 15th through march 19th uh and we did events at new bedford sandwich gloucester uh scituate in chatham and we just already distributed over 500 coils of rope uh justin is currently working on setting up additional i know a lot of guys have reached out uh via our email conservation solutions um we will answer your email if you if you emailed us and we didn't get back to you right away last week it was because we're you know we're out in the at these distribution events um and or our supply of rope is is is was currently low we just last friday got another 500 coils of rope delivered um and justin's in the process of setting up a second round of distribution events this time we'll hit it says gloucester we may do another you know north shore port other than gloucester that's to be determined but we're working on that we're going to try to hit cardinal madeira's dock in boston uh some spot in plymouth another event martha's vineyard um a bigger event in in um i'm sorry a bigger event in martha's vineyard and then also in try to hit provincetown and then um we'll we'll do third and or fourth rounds if necessary and so we're we're trying to to move these out as fast as possible get this these rope and examples of these contrivances into the hands of guys and help with any questions that they have about rigging and so for more information about this you can go we created a dmf buoy line trap gear modification web page the link is here this presentation will be hosted on our uh will be posted on our youtube channel uh so you'll be able to get that also if you're interested in signing up for a rope traditional distribution event uh you can contact us at conservationsolutions mass.gov and as i said uh we will get get back to you and we will um you know make sure we we get your name set your rope aside and then tell you which event would be the most appropriate for you to go to depending on where you're at if you have additional ideas for we construct contrivances or you have another thing you'd like to see tested you can contact justin wilson and his email address is posted here just i want to remind everybody that contrivances though need to be safe they need to be identifiable repeatable and enforceable and if they meet these criterias we'll be happy to work with you and have them tested just so folks are aware things that are not identifiable or repeatable and that have been tested and do not show promise at that at this point are options like taking standard fishing uh 3 8 rope and just cutting one strand the problem with that is that all three eighths rope isn't created equal some start at 2500 breaking strength some most are around three to four thousand and there's even some that break in excess of 5000 pounds and so just cutting a strand in a piece a week and a piece of rope doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to break uh below the necessary strength and so that's not really an option that we're considering at this time so um i think with that um i can i'll hand it back to dan um and dan can uh go from there thanks bob um great job and and for all the fishermen you can hear in bob's voice how hard we're working on this and we've gotten a lot of positive feedback from the industry at these events that that bob had mentioned and with justin um you know out on the road one thing i did want to clarify in bob's presentation is that when bob talks about the the massachusetts proposed regulations having a net risk reduction of more than 70 percent i just want everybody to know that the national fisheries service credited us for the mass restricted area closure that was enacted in 2015 so they didn't take another bite out of us uh you know with this round of rule making and uh i want to credit bob for making it some very uh passionate arguments uh and why that was an appropriate thing to do so um so bob i i think it would be best to to stick with these these contrivances issues and and the gear marking and then if if there's more time and people have sort of general questions about sort of the the itp process and why do we even need to save right whales we can we can kind of get that later i i just think it's so critical to let the fisherman um ask questions and and talk to you about the the contrivances and gear marking first if what do you think of that i agree i think that makes the most sense okay so folks um the thing to do is to um is to raise your hand i can already see there's two hands eric lorenzen and garrett or pardo and julia is going to notify you one at a time and will unmute you so julia um take over the hosting uh so at this time if you have questions about the contrivances um there's a raised hand feature should be at the bottom of your screen in a toolbar you can press that i'm going to start with john redman because he had a question at the beginning [Music] john you can unmute yourself all right there i am can you hear me yep all right i just got a couple of simple questions i really fish more than 100 feet of line so do i start at the bitter end and count down 60 feet and put one of the contrivances in there and i'm good right you're muted bob hello sorry thanks i was muted um right so i'll go through that example so in a hundred foot line um the top 75 of that would be 75 feet and so you have to have one contrivance every 60 feet so you you would be batting from a bit of end starting from the top right starting from the top and then so what you can do it there's it only has to have one contrivance and it can be anywhere in that top 75 in that particular case you don't you're not you don't have to you don't have to start from the bitter end and measure down or from the bottom measuring up as long as you don't have a length of line greater than 60 feet that has a week without a weak contrivance you're all set okay how many markings do i need on that four four red markings so well right that's that's to be determined uh we don't have any officially approved uh gear marking regulations yet right now what we're proposing um there's two options we're looking at it's either a total of let me go back total the game marking is for next year okay okay i'll forget about forget about that though yeah i mean i i don't if i have to go to 160 feet which i really do that i'd need two weak links right because 120 feet is 75 percent that's 260s that's correct so uh so all i need is one and i can start a countdown 60 feet from the end and put one in there and i'm good right correct all right that's all i need to know i can tie a knot and i can i mean i can splice and you know what i mean i'll try to yeah i sell shoes first you know so all i need to know is where to put it that's my question i'm good i'm good to go john thank you thank you for your cooperation and your patience we know this is a pain and um so thank you well it's better than bouillas you know what i mean okay all right next we have eric laurentin eric you can unmute yourself hi hi uh my questions regarding uh buoyless fishing so we can wait you can skip over me and stay with the contrivances okay uh next we have garrett lepardo garrett you can unmute yourself can you guys hear me yep yep what's the the longest line for one of those contrivances the longest line from one of those contrivances well you have to do some quick math here it would be uh so yeah let's let me let me i don't want to shoot off the cuff just give me a couple of minutes and why don't we go to the next question and i'll answer that in a minute i got another one for you sure so like if esther pro 5 16 breaks at like over 2 000 and after a season it breaks under 1700 this red rope and this candy cane rope after a season is pretty much going to be throw away rope i mean anybody that fishes any sort of tide so is that something that was accounted for yeah i mean it it's i understand that certainly rope that normally starts out that 3 800 pounds is going to last a lot longer than rope that starts out at 17. um you know it's it's uh it's certainly it's a consideration but at the end of the day we we have to authorize rope that's that starts at 1700 based on research that's been done about serious injury mortality on whales and so uh to comply with uh both the federal measure that's coming forward st you know as of next year it won't be just massachusetts who has to fish 1700 pounds it's going to be the entire fishery um and so uh yeah understanding that it's certainly not ideal for normal fishing operations um it's it's a you know a necessary step unfortunately hey bob can i ask garrett why tide would weaken rope the tide doesn't weaken the rope just the rope being in the water i mean oh no you had said that because of the tides the rope was going to be weakened when you're in a heavy tide you got to have a more powerful haul or you got to have a heavier trap oh okay right i get it yep so uh another question which i'm sure a bunch of guys from my area are wondering right now in the gear marking proposal uh for a while now we've been distinguishing trawls and single traps uh where was uh distinguishing in the proposal between trials and single traps well there's no difference in the surface system the surface systems would be the same they they're a good question the single uh trap uh gear or buoy line marking scheme that we came up with six years ago is will be done away with right bob correct yeah so for the last six years we got permission through the take reduction team to allow you to continue to fish singles with a special singles uh marking scheme so that that'll be taken away correct yeah that that experiment came to an end what did that experiment show well in other words what we asked for was permission to go five years to see if this kind of line was going to come up on the backs of whales to determine if it if it caused a problem that was there was a need of solving and i think for the most part that answer was no so um we can move on and and now address kind of the more global issues so that was a temporary gear marking scheme in order for us to go into like a five-year trial period to get singles allowed and as you know we we entertain doing away with singles for vessels 29 feet and larger and we pulled that back uh you know with our commission because we just thought it wasn't um it wasn't going to accomplish the goal oh yeah i agreed so to answer your question about the the maximum length of rope that you could use with only one contrivance um the answer is 159 feet and i'll go through the math so if you take 160 foot buoy line the top 75 of that equals 120 feet at 120 feet to get 60 you cannot you can't have greater than 60 foot length without a buoy line i mean without a contrivance and so 120 feet would require two so therefore one foot less than that would you you would be able to set it up in such a way that you wouldn't have more than 60 feet without a contrivance the 119 bob 159 okay one five nine is the is the maximum length of a total buoy line got it that's really what a lot of us are most worried about because where are we fishing amongst all the trawls and we start getting hung down on all the trawls i mean we're gonna have to cut our buoy lines back from 180s that we typically fish to keep our gear up in the tide to not be parting our gear off left and right or hoping that whoever comes by on the trawl or hung on untangles it yeah the other the other option that folks are considering for deeper fishing is putting a longer piece of ground line between the first and the second trap so that um you're not suspending more than one trap in the water column when you're hauling up and then once you get to the ground line that can be any strength so well you know one of the considerations would be lengthening that first trap on the ground line just to make it uh put less strain on the buoy line while it's coming up well i don't really care at all about trolls i'm just worried about my 400 single traps that me and my wife have because when i set my single traps where all the trolls are you get pinned down a lot and i asked about the maximum buoy line because i'm trying to avoid putting a second contrivance in the rope because where i get in around the trawls i'm gonna lose a lot of gear getting hung down and trying to get my traps up a lot of guys are wondering that same question so okay thank you all right julia who's next okay next we have john todd um okay hang on how to promote him to a panelist he's on an older version of zoom john you can unmute yourself how you doing can hear me yeah great um i got a a couple of questions um so um one of them when when bob was talking about the candy cane rope uh or the sleeves uh it with the gear marking and and the possibility of using um or the possibility of using the red marking uh the red breaking rope as your red marks in your line when you're doing the gear marking in the future when you're changing the rules with that uh would the candy cane rope or the sleeves also count in that or because they're obviously the candy cane's not all red and the sleeves are orange would you still consider it as part of your marking yeah so in the case of the candy cane rope a three foot section of that inserted in would count because it would have the equivalent of would be similar to putting a red tracer in your line right right um and then similarly for the for the south shore sleeve if you look at the picture of the standard orange cell shore sleeve has a red tracer in it so those two already are compliant with the massachusetts color red okay okay that's good um and then the other thing that go in that picture you have on the right with the the lobstermen had suggested using the the heat shrink over the sleeve and you said that was tested and that that uh design right there is approved that design is approved it doesn't and just so everyone's aware it doesn't change the breaking strength it's the breaking strength between the two are basically exactly the same it just uh you know i think folks are interested in that it may provide some additional chafing or and or just reinforcement that's what i had heard that there was problems um with the sleeves getting caught in the knives as they wore and chafed um so that that's good to know that that was approved the um the other question i have is now i you know i'm fishing from anywhere um you know from 10 feet in early season some places uh upwards of 225 feet in late fall into the early winter so my buoy lines uh my standard buoy line because i have separate buoy lines from my ground line and i fish ten pot trolls so my my standard buoy lines are 12 fathom so we'll just say 70 feet because you're using you're losing a foot on each end when you're doing your connections to the buoy and the troll yep so um so in a 70-foot buoy line um i know this is a big question for a lot of guys is you know and i you kind of already answered a little bit with the first gentleman but as far as placement of the red marks um because as i go out deeper i have 40 foot extensions so typically at the most i'm gonna have is my buoy line in the middle with two float uh two sink extensions on the top and two float extensions down the bottom so i'm just trying to work out the math of the placement so that everything's compliant so the way i see it is if i were to put my red mark in my standard buoy line uh 40 feet down it would still be it would be 30 feet up so it would be in the top three quarters of the buoy line um which i believe would be 52 feet so that would be in compliance there and it's not more than 60 feet um and if i'm adding on extensions on top and i have two of them uh if i had a top one with no with no uh breaking sleeve the second one if i put it in the middle of it at 20 feet then that makes 60 feet down to the first breakaway and then from that breakaway down to the one i have 40 feet down on my buoy line would be 60 feet so that's compliant and then from that one down to my my next one in my first float extension on the bottom would actually be 50 feet so less is okay right as long as it's what not more than 50 if i mean more than 60 that that's correct so right so so yeah you could put more marks than than then you just can't have so the rule probably reads something like no fewer than than four or five marks and no no length of rope greater than 60 feet without as long as it complies with that the exact placement is is less important i'm sorry about i'm not talking about marks i'm talking about the weak links did i say marks i'm sorry yeah you said marsh but that's okay then the marking rule is just it has to be you know uh no more than six no length of boy line greater than 60 feet without a weak insertion okay all right so i just wanted to just make sure that we're i'm compliant with that uh the only other question i have regarding the line is um as i'm sure a lot of you are aware when we're fishing shallow water in the early part of the season um and you're in you know 15 20 feet of water sometimes and you have a 70 foot buoy line what do you do with the extra line you refit up on the top yep so in that case as long as the refill the reefed up line hanging near the top has the appropriate marks on it you would be okay so in other words so in the case of a whale happens to swim into shallow water and gets caught in that after they break free they're going to be trailing right that that line so it's just critical that that reefed up line complies yeah because i know i know that's been brought up in the past as far as marking if you're you know if you've got it reefed up is it you know is it technically the length of the line from the buoy to the trap regardless of whether there's a reef or not and where the marks go but i don't think that's really i don't think it's become an issue but now does it become an issue with if if you had that breakaway inside that reef which i won't because obviously if i'm putting it 40 feet down it should be good but yeah so and so any line that's reefed up at the top has to come would have to comply both with the weak insertion and the marking rule right but say like a like we'll just say for instance existence that example if i had the 70 foot buoy line and i have my my weak length say i put it 20 feet down instead from the top and you reefed up 30 feet of line now that weak link is inside the line right by the rule it's still you know it's in the right spot in the line oh i see what you're saying right now it's in the reef so technically it's ineffective because it's in the reef yeah so you know the rule doesn't speak to that so i just i don't want to i don't want to see anybody get in trouble by the epos for doing that because you know i just it hasn't been addressed so yeah no that's a great comment and something that we'll likely need to address we need to make sure that for the purposes of the weak contrivance that it's actually uh that the there's a weak link in the in the the floating or the unreefed up portion of the buoy line so that that's something we'll have to address okay um and that's all the questions i have for that section when we get the other stuff later have a couple so thank you sure all right thanks all right next we have uh john simons john you can unmute yourself thanks you actually got my name right that's good all right so uh my question is on the south shore sleeves um i have a few of them that i've rigged up with one fathom lines with an eye splice on either end um and my thought was like as john todd was talking about when i'm in shallow water i'm gonna need that in a different spot than where i need it in deep water and my thought was with an eye splice on either end i could just tie it in wherever i need it and move it up and down the buoy line and i just want to make sure that's legal yeah so we had i had a good discussion today with the with nymphs and some of their gear folks and other care folks from other states who are working on this issue and one thing that we came to consensus on is is that uh the critical feature of of one of these contrivance is the base material not necessarily how it's con connected so physics dictates that if the if the contrivance itself in this case the sleeve breaks at 1700 pounds or less that's no matter which way you connect it to a heavier rope it can't break at a tensile strength stronger than than its base so in other words it's always going to be some no matter how you connect it it's going to be less than its starting point and so to answer your question yes it would be approved it doesn't really particularly matter in this case if you're using a sleeve how you attach it it's a matter of putting it in in a manner that lasts for your own sake for longevity so that it doesn't you know wear out quickly okay so just to clarify um i can tie a double becket to the two eye splices six feet above and below the um the south shore sleeve and that will be legal well i i don't know what a double beck it is but um you know what it would be i i think what would be my my sense is yes uh but why don't you take a picture of of that and and email it to me and and uh i'll follow up with you okay yeah so the reason i'm asking that question is i'm confused if what you're saying about the sleeve is correct why does it matter how we tie the red rope in like you've got like to in my mind if the rope if red rope breaks at 1700 pounds and you tie it in however the hell you want and put it in the rope machine the red rope should still break is 1700 pounds i don't understand why there's such a like you gotta you know why it matters whether you're splicing it or or you know like what really confused me is that that i splice and then they do like this three pack you know there's an eye splice in the in the red rope and then they like wrap the rope around it and pass it through three or four times um why does that matter like why can't you just tie a double becket or or a square knot or whatever why does that change how the red rope breaks good question it doesn't change how it breaks but it adds a not to the profile and so one of the things that we're trying to do is avoid uh knots the extent possible because knots uh during an entanglement tend to get caught in whales baleen it acts kind of like a jam cleat um and so if you look at all the options that we're we've approved here they're all fairly streamlined you don't see any large overhand knots um that that was purposeful to try to keep the the profile of these inserts as streamlined as possible okay so does that cause a problem with my i you know i have a i have a lazy eye splice similar to what what that um that option number three is and then i would tie so if you know what a bowline looks like it's like a bowling with an extra an extra tuck through and it's still pretty low profile it's not like it's not like it's a fisherman's knot or an overhand knot you know like i said i just wanna i don't wanna i don't wanna i just spent all this money on these sleeves i don't want to rig them all up and then find out i can't use them no un understood and so like i said what if you if you take a picture of how you you're going to rig it up or what you're proposing um and i'll i'll pass it around to the gear folks at nymphs and see what they say and you know breaking strength wise i'm not concerned about it so and if that's if they give it the all clear um it's something we can add to the to the approved list it shouldn't be a problem okay thanks a lot yep okay next we have jay and susan machad jay and susan you can unmute yourself i'm unmuted uh i got a couple of of questions one uh the weak links that we've been using the plastic weak links uh they are no longer to be used uh we should uh discard them or keep them what what is the what should we do there great question jay um so currently uh there is in the national fisheries service proposed rules i believe their preferred alternative is is to remove the requirement to use those any longer um those are and correct me if i'm wrong dan we we did not address that in our rules yet because they're still currently part of the federal requirement and we can't do that we can't remove them until nationwide fisheries service does so for this year my my understanding is you still need to have them but moving forward there's a good chance that you will not okay uh when uh when the red rope uh is readily available we can start buying it direct uh if we run the uh the red uh we grow from the buoy to the uh uh the first trap and use it in the entire column does that satisfy the requirement and if it does how do we market excellent question again um so yes it it satisfies the weak rope the weak contrivance a rope requirement because it fully formed red week rope is approved um we're working on the gear marking rules right now obviously you doesn't make any sense to mark red rope with red twine or red paint or whatever so likely um for massachusetts for for those fishing red rope will likely propose an alternate color like white contrast thank you one more question oh oh one one one more thing uh i i really from the bottom of my heart i want to congratulate you of the division for all the hard work you've done being under the gun uh with the court systems and having to come up with uh something that hopefully will satisfy them you you've done a remarkable job what's happening with the with the with the people that just fish pleasure people thanks jay and we appreciate um all the cooperation we've gotten from the industry dan i i think i heard um sue ask a question about what's happening to the recreational fishing if i understand correctly as well we're we're we have a lot of of uh recreational fishermen in our area and lots and lots of them um so if they just use a line uh and it's not doesn't have a weak land canada or anything or or any of the rules they've already have that they don't have to have a v they can take a smaller v they can take a b notch if it's not large so are they exempt from this other they are not exempt from all the rules so i can quickly go over what um the recreational fishery so um we did several things first um we have a a pot trap or a seasonal uh haulout period or closure for the recreational fishery and that that period goes from november 15th through may 15th so where all their gear has to be removed from the water so we can't leave it out all year long any longer we're also requiring all recreational permit holders to fish no greater than 5 16 inch rope we did not go down the path of requiring contrivances with them um mainly because uh you know we just didn't think we could given that most of them are very inexperienced that we could get really good uh compliance with them and have the you know the ability to really uh figure out all the various options of tying different splices and knots um so with the 5 16 inch rope we know that that that starts at a much lower breaking strength um and and it's also a smaller amount of buoy lines than in the commercial so we have taken some steps there dan do you have anything to add yeah i think there's a misnomer that um every recreational fisherman fishes 10 traps and there's something like 8 000 of them therefore they fish 80 000 traps our records show that the average is uh is much less than that and many of them don't fish at all they scuba dive so i think our latest estimate on the number of vertical buoy lines attributable to the recreational sector was around 20 000. so it's fairly small and and like bob said it's in shallow water most in most all circumstances and and furthermore we put a closure on them so we hope that those rules contribute to sufficient risk reduction okay thank you thank you oh i did want to mention one other thing on on the previous question about um attaching uh a sleeve one important point um to consider is when you anytime you add a knot to a rope um going to reduce the braking strength and so if you're and so for example a fisherman's not um can tying that in can reduce the braking strength by as much as 40 percent and so if you're starting with a weak rope um you might not you know attaching it using some certain types of knots may reduce it um lower than what you anticipated whereas the type of splices that we used here in addition to being streamlined are also connections that are fairly efficient and that they they tend not to dramatically reduce uh the strength of of the uh the connection okay julia okay uh next we have lobster guy lobster guy you can unmute yourself a couple questions on that picture that's shown right now maybe it's just me and i'm seeing it wrong on my phone but it says four tuck lazy splice to me it looks like seven i don't know if it's on my phone or it's called something different but when i think of a four tuck i think it's only tucked four times the picture shows like seven times so in this case we're calling it a four tuck because there's there's four red tucks and four four tucks with the red rope and four tucks with the the white rope okay all right i see it now um have you guys tested uh 5 16 like spliced together because i know when you or when you say you tie it differently knot differently it reduces that strength line by x percent have you guys actually tried to use like pro flex line or any type of line 5 16 11 30 seconds or you tie it in differently and test that because it's not not to knock your red line stuff but these guys are making ropes forever obviously i would think it's a lot better quality than the stuff we're trying to build now have you guys tried using stuff that's been out because to help hold up better yeah no that's a great question and and it was actually part of discussion i had today with the group working on on rope from maine and also national moon fisheries services there is interest in that um one of the issues is one of the the cry 3 criteria is that all the contrivances have to be identifiable repeatable and enforceable and so one of the issues of just using a standard 5 16th rope and say splicing it um is that that's a possibility and you're right there's a good chance that that may break at a below uh 1700 pounds uh but feedback that we're getting is that we would need to ask the the rope manufacturers to put some type of marking within that rope that makes it identifiable so in this case the red rope of the candy cane rope is uniquely identifiable um the standard rope you were talking on 5 16 is not so if we could get the manufacturers to put some type of a colored tracer in it to uniquely identify that then those options would be doable we haven't tested them to date because you know standard 5 16 is is not uniquely identifiable and as you know it you can get 5 16 set break at 2200 pounds and you can get 5 16 set breaks at close to 3000 pounds so it's it's a yeah it's a matter of identifying specific type okay um another question is have you guys thought about knocking down the wreck guys from 10 traps to like six or seven would that help our case people who are out there trying to make a living than people who are just out there not making a living would that help our case with the the the whole percentage because you're saying there's what 20 000 direct lines out there if you knock it down knock everyone down 30 well now you're down to thirteen fourteen thousand yeah the commercial side at all then um well what i mentioned earlier even though there's a ten trap limit our surveys uh show that most fishermen don't fish the ten so um you know if you brought it down to say six or seven and everybody fished the six or seven you might actually have a slight increase so we we didn't um well we're not being obliged to to um to come up with uh comparable reductions in the recreational fishery but the proposal and the rules that we put in obviously do that between the the seasonal closure and the the thinner line as a mandate but i don't i don't think in terms of the of the overall take reduction plan and the risk reduction that the rec sector is included in those calculations am i right yeah that's correct and in fact it the under the marine mammal protection act um it doesn't technically doesn't apply to uh recreational fisheries and so in this case the steps we've taken like uh having a closed season for our wreck fishery um as well as a ban on rope raid and 5 16 were steps that we we've taken that are above and beyond what's required by the federal plan but we in the interest of equity and also in the interest of really trying to provide right whales with appropriate conservation we took those steps okay yeah because like obviously you know and i know wreck guys are not fishing in 120 feet of water they're fishing in 40 50 feet of water and a whale comes in hooks into one of those you and i both know the thing's not going to break the because they're using traps that are 20 pounds we're using traps at about 80. it's completely different fishery so i don't that's just my thought on it because they don't have to they can use heavier rope but obviously it's lower braking strength but it doesn't matter it's not going to break no matter what you do to it it's well unless they have to use the 1700 pounds me but they allow to use 5 16 it's not changing much considering it's not going to break anyways because the weight of their gear thank you um [Music] we will move on to j fleck jay you can unmute yourself hi um question going through the presentation those you know the reference to the word buoy line and i guess i'm just looking for a definition on buoy line in relation to ground line and if someone's fishing trawls and say they're using 7 16 everson um when they're making up their troll they might leave 10 fathoms of line before they get to the first trap and then they go through and then after the last trap there's another 10 fathoms and then they would tie in what they can you know what we all consider a normal buoy line they may go down at 3 8 or something like that so if for the purposes of the calculation i'm assuming that the buoy line is from the buoy to the trap and that 10 fathoms of line that you know people consider um is considered buoy line or are you saying now that everything from the buoy to the trap has to be 3 8 and then you could start with 7 16. it's a good question um so a question for you do you typically insert a piece of of float rope or chafing rope to to help get that that lower 25 up off the bottom um to be honest with you i've been part-time in the in the industry for a while so just kind of single so i'm looking to get back into it but historically when i was uh efficiently i i hadn't um you know either it was just kind of you know i'd count out ten fathoms get to the first trap tying a gangen make my you know 20 paw trawl and then another another 10 fathoms and then get into you know adding a 3 8 buoy line or something like that yeah i mean i i think for the purposes of our regulation and i'd have to talk to our regulations guy about this some more but i think it would be would have would apply to from the buoy to the trap i don't know how we would necessarily distinguish an extra 10 fathoms of rope that was uh part of the ground line and without um some type of um there's nothing to specifically differentiate the two so okay so i guess you're saying that so now everything from the buoy if you if we're calling that all buoy line everything from the buoy all the way to the first trap has to be three can't be any larger than three-eighths yes i believe that's accurate [Music] okay um thanks for the clarification okay next we'll go to christopher houghton chris you can unmute yourself yeah hey um you guys got me there yep yeah we can hear you yeah um i was just kind of confused on like the length um so it they're saying three feet so it's like three feet after like is that including the splice or the little contrivance there that you have the little tucks and all that is that three feet in between the end line or is that overall i'm gonna cut a three foot section of this red rope and that includes the splice that includes the tucks all that so pretty much in between your now cut end line you wouldn't either have a lot of line there or you'd have three feet yeah so it would be you would cut a a minimum of a three foot piece and then insert it do is what i will yeah okay so you know i i have i do moorings as well and i have a big scale because i build concrete blocks um so i hooked that to my truck and i've been trying to get a hold of a couple of people on this uh i hooked that to my truck and we tied it one end to that and then one into another truck and pulled the two trucks apart um i haven't reached 1400 pounds yet on any of these contrivances um not just that but especially on the um your so-called four tuck system um that red line pulled completely out without even question um i mean my buddy was backing his truck up so i mean i'd love to know how you know how these things even i mean have any of you seen any of these things work have you ever hauled the trap with these instead of just putting them on pulling machines because in my eyes none of this has worked well i can tell you that i mean based on first i mean the all these options shown here it wasn't just like one or two samples were broken a minimum of of 10 of each of these options was broken they all broke it around 1600 between 1600 and 1700 pounds um and so that i mean the data doesn't lie that's that's what it is relative to it hasn't been fished with the only option that's been fished with fairly extensively are the sleeves those have been you some guys have used those and we've also tested it for a complete season on our gear for eventless trap survey and so we've had uh success with those but uh these options here these are all new they're just brand new just approved now so they're not uh you know no one's had the opportunity to to fish with them yet right right so it's just based off a poundage system that you guys have it's not based on like a fishing system where you know you know you're hauling you know in a great day and you got the boat moving and everything else they have they don't have that thought of it as well you know no it doesn't account for like heave of the boat and extra strain put on but you know heavy conditions and hang downs things like that no straight tensile strength okay and then the other thought i mean i i was in and out on the meeting but i you know i don't know if maybe you've already said it but you know how come nothing was tried with knots like if you were to do like a square knot and then tuck back in that's essentially the same thing as these loop to loops um you know if you know what a square knot is it's pretty much just like an overhand um and it loops back on itself and it creates that that non knot system where if you tuck the ends back in it's that smooth condition because i caught the end of it there where you were saying it's like this continuation just like a splice would be a continuation and and also what you said whereas a knot it bro it drops down your ability to have that same tensile strength um so what would an overhand like a square knot would that be acceptable and like tucked in in into the red weak rope yup um so it's it's possible again i what i what i advise the last gentleman who commented on this was to do this so send me uh a picture of it and then i can uh forward it to the folks at who are doing the gear testing as well as national fisheries service and have them look at it uh just remember that again you add knots in it it uh it's going to reduce the breaking strength of the rope even lower and so um that's something to consider and then also we've made an effort would try to avoid kind of larger profile knots uh relative to them being more difficult to disentangle wells from but again if you if you send us you know send me a picture of what you're proposing um we can have we can have it looked at okay all right guys thank you yep take care you too would it actually make sense to have you send you a sample like delivered to one of our field stations or something or driving yeah that's i mean we're happy to we can we can you know meet up and grab a sample yeah we'd be happy to to to do that and then we can make some up and look at it i could drop it at the gloucester office if you want yep that's fine if you drop it at the glossary office we can make sure we get it and take a look at it yeah all right i'll do that thank you yep thank you okay next we have damien parkington damien you can unmute yourself thank you i have a couple questions um one may have been answered already i um didn't catch it but the first one i wanted to ask was the troll length increased to compensate for any extra ground line that we might use to give um less you know less weight on the buoy line increased so that we might lengthen the distance between the the end traps to lessen the the weight on the buoy line okay yeah i understand what you're saying um so i we i don't think we've addressed that in state waters dan correct but my understanding is that part of the proposed rule is looking at extending that to accommodate for the trolling up scenarios um but i i think that's something we could look into is that a fair characterization i i i'm trying to remember if the trial length by regulation is either 24 or 2500 feet um i don't know it was jared on jared silver um so i guess damian what length were you looking for um what i'm well it's been circulated now a couple times in conversation since i've been listening in but basically whether or not you use an anchor or whether or not you just wanted to extend the distance between your say your first and second or your second and third um trap um right now to extend that like i'm at 2000 feet i believe that's the regulation maybe it's a little bit more i remember 2000 but to extend that i'd be breaking i don't want to be breaking the law to extend that you know yeah no but that's a that's a good suggestion we we could go to rule making and and amend that for sure um but um we hadn't that hadn't been brought to our attention prior especially for this but your your current trials are up to 3000 i think we lost him hang on okay no but for everyone else on the call that's a good suggestion and that's something we could consider for the next round of rule making when we go when we we have to do gear marking rule making anyways maybe we can consider that dan yeah yeah absolutely yeah i think the outer cape guy's 10 official more distance between traps because of the featureless bottom and um so maybe it's more common for the outer cape guys who are fishing trawls to have longer draws than guys on on more you know broken bottom okay i'm not seeing him anymore so i'm gonna go to richard fisher richard you can unmute yourself hi good afternoon uh my question is in enforcement there's so many different variants to how this can be put up when it comes time to enforce this you know the gay ones come aboard they inspect it is there going to be fines levied are they going to be accustomed to this we is there going to be some kind of grace period because with so many different variants of how you're supposed to tie this in length and where you know there's just so much difference and every ward looks at it differently what's going to happen in that situation that's a good question we obviously will be working with the office of law enforcement the mass environmental police and and um sort of instruct them as to how these contrivances are you know what's been approved but what would be logical is you know if if a warden gets on your boat and and you've adopted one of these options you could just show them and you know i mean that that way you're out you're both on the same page because you know we have seven or eight that are approved now we might have twice that number by the end by the middle or end of the summer um you know it kind of reminds me of the the seafood dealers they call them hasset plans where fda has some some mandates but every every seafood dealer has his own plan and so you're going to have your own plan of how you know it's your your your favorite way to con to to set up these contrivances it's up to you so i'm not sure that it's going to be that confusing for them if if you get on the boat and you tell the officer hey i'm going with the three tuck lazy spice and here is the picture so yeah they're going to have photos of all these these contrivances so they'll they'll know okay and the other question i have i believe it was already asked as far as the breakaways on the buoys i believe somebody said that was still a federal mandate so we're still required to use the breakaways also on the week correct for this year yeah my understanding is that in the federal rule that's they're in the process of finalizing that that that requirement may be taken away so for next year you you likely will not have to use those okay and i got one more question and so myself in some place you know in the spring of the year i believe it was aspen i'm just clarification you know i'm fishing in 10 20 feet of water i'm still going to be required to have 60 feet of buoy line but i have to make sure this too far this can this contraption sorry i will not go for it uh has to be free of basically a a pile of rope that i have to hold up because i'm i'm not going to put 60 feet of water you know 60 feet of line in 20 feet of wall so you don't you don't have to have 60 feet of line you you just need to have a minimum of one contrivance and no length of line greater than 60 feet without a contrivance so if you have a 30 foot buoy line you can have one contrivance in it that's it you don't have to you don't have to fish extra rope right that's like i say where we fish you know some in the spring and the quality i mean the summer we're fishing in you know 20 feet of water i don't want 60 feet of bully line because all it does is cause habit for everybody else that makes it if i've only got 30 feet of buoy line i've got to con you know i've got this now when i go to deep water i can just add on to it but i don't have to add another contraption because that'll fish more than 80 feet of water and you're you'd be all set correct all right thank you very much yep okay um um the raised hands have already asked questions i see damian's back if he wants to finish his question oh yeah yep oh nope he just put his hand down oh there he is you can unmute yourself yeah thank you my phone powered off um my other question was i understand that knots are being discouraged but and right now are not um it's not a regulatory thing can we please get the rank could we get the breaking strength of each of these contraptions with um an overhand and a becket tied in so that at least fishermen know going into the season what what the reduction in tank so strength is because if we're going in and like oh all right well i can try it back and i'm gonna and a becket into a into a loop actually reduces it by 50 cents i mean by 50 we could start losing gear pretty quick yeah sure so to answer your question again i need to i need to see it and i need to pass it up to see if it's approved right now um these have been not only break tested but that you know they've been evaluated relative you know has told us it's consistent with their rules relative to what they plan on going forward what i'm not sure about um is whether or not other types of knots are going to be consistent with their rules and so i can approve that at this time but if again if folks get me samples or pictures of these things we will we will pass them along and if if everyone agrees that they're acceptable we'll have them strength tested and get the results out to folks as soon as possible roger that thank you hey bob yes isn't it safe to say that if somebody delivered to you ten replicas of these you'd be able to get them up to maine a lot faster than if they gave you a picture or one and we had to retie or tie nine more because you need replicates of ten yes but i also just wanted i wanna be cautious about that because i don't want folks to go through a lot of effort if if it's a non-starter in the first place like either there's the whole repeatable identifiable or forcible thing it's got to pass those metrics and i i want i want folks um up the chain and nibs to take a look at it first and say yeah that looks pretty good let's test it before i start taking samples because i don't want to make promises i can't keep okay thanks okay so we'll go to garrett garrett you can unmute yourself you guys hear me again yep yes we can so bob told that man earlier that asked about tying in his south shore sleeves it was fine uh as fisherman as long as we have that red rope it really shouldn't matter how we tie it in and then he said they shy away from knots but told that man it's okay to tie his sleeves in and here we are with these four piss-poor options i mean nobody's going to be doing number three i did 20 of those loops the other night kind of split between the evening in the morning my hands felt like they were going to fall off and that's coming off of building 200 traps this winter so they're kind of seasoned i mean that that's kind of ridiculous why can't we use our own discretion we don't care about what what you guys are testing as knots all we care is we have the 1700 pound rope which probably should have been produced through seaside or all right so let me let me respond so i think one thing that everyone needs to understand is that it it's it's it's critically important that we make this work because the alternative is terrible the alternative here is that we lose our authority to issue and allow folks to fish buoy lines in massachusetts state waters and so this is an option for us to uh comply with a federal mandate um from i'm sorry from a federal judge to to reduce risk and receive an incidental take permit if we're not successful for this with this the alternative is no buoy lines which pushes us in a pathway towards ropeless fishing which i think we can all agree at this point isn't ready for prime time and have serious consequences for the industry and so the options presented here are options that we've put together with materials available for us that that meet all the correct criteria uh that we're going to be have to abide by relative to the federal plan um and achieve that in a fairly short order and gets it and we're working to get this out in folks hands and so like i understand the front frustration and i understand that this rope isn't as seasoned and tested as all the commercially available rope we understand that uh but our hand is forced on this and we're doing everything that we can to get stuff and options in your hands so you guys can all continue to fish in in a manner that's similar to what you're doing right now and that's our goal and we're trying to do so and it's quicker time period and as little cost these options are have all been vetted and approved and and break tested these are what are approved right now we're willing to work with folks if they have other specific options that they would like to have vetted and tested and approved we're willing to do that uh but i i'm you know i'm pleading with you on this you know as a whole the industry needs to adopt this and make this work because the alternative is is not a good one i just i don't i don't really see how i mean you when you have the red rope there the red ropes there whether you need it once or twice whether you need one sleeve or two sleeves i mean all of us as fishermen understand about knots and which knots are good and which knots are bad we all use a becket to a loop like in the picture in number three i just i don't see how it's it's any different oh bob i i and garrett i think what bob's trying to point out is that by using some of these configurations you maintain braking strength and you told us earlier that you were concerned about the the need for a high sufficient braking strength um and if you if you know but by using these spices i think you maintain the higher level of braking strength am i right yes that's that's correct the these options here are very efficient they broke but they break very close to the original breaking strength of the material all right okay who's next next we have john todd he's rejoining as a panelist can you hear me yeah okay um a couple of things on garrett and what garrett was saying i think i think what garrett was driving it and maybe maybe i'm wrong but i think what he's trying to get at is and it's a question for a lot of us i guess is we understand the different ways and that's fine and everything's scientifically tested and you've got solid data on it and that's great but i think what he's getting at is if the line say the red line is designed to break at 1700 pounds i think the question is is what difference does it make how it's attached to the line uh i mean if that's if the line if the red lines decide to break it at 1700 i think that's the question is why isn't the line breaking at 1700 i mean where in the test where was it where was it failing was it failing at the splice or at the eyes or you know where the tucks were or was it breaking in the middle of the line somewhere because i guess that's the question is if the line's designed to break at 1700 then what what's the matter of how it's attached to the regular movie line if that line is supposed to break i think that's that's the question is i guess no i i i understand that and and so first understand that um dmf this isn't this isn't criteria that we're coming up with unilaterally we're we're having to comply with um rules that are going to be put in place for the entire in just lobster industry from you know from basically new york up to maine um and so the the final rules relative to how these options are put into place are not completely finalized um but we are we are our understanding is that they're identifiable enforceable um and repeatable and and that there are also considerations relative to the complexity of the gear and how it may interact with a whale in the in the event of an entanglement um and so we're largely rely on a lot of the feedback um from folks at national media fisheries service to relative to what's going to be approved and so i can't right now i if you give you approval for any specific option that involves other other knots then what's then or other connection types than what we've shown here tonight however i'm more than willing to if you have additional ideas that you would like to see tested i am more than willing to to work with you to get those tested and go through the approval process yes and i think that that's that's awesome and i'm sure like you said a lot of these things were ideas that lost a minute brought to you for testing and and obviously you're probably going to end up with a slew of them now because other guys are going to come up with other ideas that haven't been tested yet but i i guess that i mean that answers the question it's just obviously because it has to be a consistent reliable thing that's been that's tested but i i just that's the big question mark as well okay if the line's supposed to break at 1700 pounds then you know is the line breaking at 1700 pounds so you know i got you no i get it no and i understand your frustration but i'm not even frustrated i just i i just i mean it doesn't matter to me as long as it as long as it's gonna work and it's not gonna fail prematurely where it's not supposed to as long as that's good i'm i'm okay with whatever way i'm gonna do it which i haven't decided yet but i i think that's just a lot of guys question is well you know what does it matter but i get what you're saying too yeah i understood it you actually brought up another good point so none of the options here were developed by a dmf biologist or anybody at dmf these are every single option tested were options that commercial fishermen contacted us with with and said hey here's here's a way that i like to attach rope can you have this tested is this something we can do and that's what we did so the you know we'll continue to do that um but yeah so the these options you know in our opinion worked pretty well as far as breaking strength um and they were suggested by fishermen so we're we're hopeful okay and then i just had one other thing when you were speaking to jay fleck and he was asking about the buoy line length um and versus adding you know the section that was on the bottom of your or the end of your ground line um so i guess that that brought up a question for me it's it's not just he was bringing up the diameter of the rope you know three-eighths brewing line versus whatever you have for your ground line now i i use three-eighths so i'm not worried about that myself but i know a lot of guys use much thicker line for the ground line so if you've got a you know 10 pot troll 20 pot troll whatever my case may be as far as the diameter so now you're you're basically saying that you're going to have to have your ends from your pot to the end of your draw line be it two three ten whatever however many fathom you have on the end will have to still be three eighths and then the rest of your ground line can be whatever it is correct okay yeah we would have no way to otherwise distinguish buoy live bully line from ground line so right i mean i know like i myself my ground lines are separate from my buoy lines i have a becket on the end of my ground lines and i time my booby line to it um but the a lot of guys don't a lot of guys it's all one continuous line you know um so i get that that would be hard to determine the differentiation between the two but they're there in lies the other question is when it comes to considering uh the length of your buoy line for for contrivances i now i i usually have about two fathoms just you know but between my trap and the end of my becket at the end of my ground line so if are you going to be adding in the total length of your buoy line then is that two fathoms of that piece of ground line to that trap will be added to the length of the overall length of the buoy line then in trying to figure out how many uh you need i'm not sure if i understand um exact the exact convention that you're talking about but it but essentially we need to you know you you the way the rules written is that the buoy line uh can't be greater than 3 8 inch so that buoy line would be it needs to be distinguished from from the ground line uh that exact connection um you know i'm not sure uh but typically um a lot of our understanding is a lot of guys use uh you know the the first 25 percent can be some type of chafing gear can be floating ropes kind of get it up off the bottom um usually you know i would say wherever that chafing rope starts would be a good indicator where the break between the ground line the buoy line is and then the the the contrivance rule starts at the top 75 percent of the buoy line it doesn't include that that bottom 25. i understand that but then i'm kind of confused because we'll say like we'll go back to my regular buoy line as is 12 fathoms so we'll just say 70 feet now if you if you were to consider that extra two fathoms now you you know you're another 20 24 feet of line added to my overall length of my buoy line if if if you did that and but see my confusion is if you're gonna consider the the width of the line um in j flex example if you're going to be taking that extra length of line on the ground line to the trap from what would have been the end of your ground line as considering that part of the length of the buoy line as far as width i mean as far as the width of the line if you're going to consider that part of the buoy line for that wouldn't it also be considered as part of the buoy line length as far as contrivances and in which case you're adding whatever length you have at the end of your ground line to the trap if you have a if you have a separate buoy line you know what i'm saying i do and and so my advice to everybody on this would be um it's from it from an enforcement standpoint and or a conservation standpoint you're better off knowing putting uh accounting for that extra length and and marking and as well as putting contrivances in um to comply with the rule um instead of of you know going with a lesser amount of marking under contrivances um i don't think you want to get into a debate with well that's ground line versus this is buoy line uh if it's if it's coming up from the last trap on you should probably consider it as buoy light okay all right i guess that's all my questions for right now thank you thank you okay um i'm gonna go back to lobster guy question on picture number three um does it matter if you splice your regular buoy line and i splice the red line for easiness of changing out when needed or is that how it's tested and that's how it's going to have to be that's great great question and um another fisherman had already brought that to our attention um and the samples of that which you just mentioned bringing it kind of the opposite of the of the way it's pictured here which is permanent so correct yeah it's gonna it's gonna be what you just suggested is gonna be tested as well and i anticipate it'll be fine and we'll add that to the list and when you do that could you supply information on where it broke because i've heard this red line is slippery and it likes to pull out um if that red line pulls out before the 1700 that's that's the situation because if you're if if you're lazy splicing the red line and it pulls then that obviously isn't going to be a good option for us sure yep i can try to get feedback from the folks running the braking test about where and how it breaks and possibly maybe see if they can even get video of it yeah and then um another math question i'll ask you at the end you can come back on it um so if i were to use red rope on the top part of my buoy line which is 90 feet how much red rope can do i have to use before going into my regular rope like red rope directly to my regular rope what i have to need in order to get away from having my regular rope red rope back to regular rope sure um so in a 90-foot buoy line if you're using you'd have to have a minimum of three feet of red rope to comply with the roll three feet yes it would be one one three foot piece okay so in this case if you wanna if you want to attach say you know 40 feet of weak rope at the top that's fine okay so are you saying three feet at the top of 40 feet at the top i got two inches sorry no i'm saying as long as that 90-foot section of the rope has a has a minimum of one three-foot piece of weak rope you're you've complied with the rule okay so i can just put that red rope attach the red rope directly to my buoy three feet long and then splice in my regular buoy line and send it down to the trap yeah yep but you can't have any length of rope greater than 60 feet without a a weak a reach contrivance so if if it's more if from me from where that red rope where that red contrivance ends to your trap that's greater than 60 feet you wouldn't comply so you would need to put it down farther in that scenario like 40 feet down exactly 31 feet down exactly okay and then what company is building this red rope from india or the 1700 pound stuff from india that you have not received do you know though i will text someone right now and try to find out why we're on the phone and i'll announce it before this webinar is over yeah because there's a lot of companies out there i'm just curious which company is coming up with the 1700 uh it's i just got to tax it ship again okay okay okay um next we have sean leach yeah okay uh just a quick question um these are probably gonna float down to the federal level at some point you're gonna try to sample this um i just i just want to kind of understand if i'm fishing 300 foot buoy lines i just kind of want to know where i would put the contrivances just for down the road and i kind of want to try it the season before sure so where you would have to put them isn't specified what's specified is that in the top 75 percent of that 300 feet no length greater than 60 feet can have can be without an insert okay so all right so basically go from the top down and go every 60 feet until you hit the 25 which is your float line i guess you would call it yup exactly okay all right um and then one other thing so when we insert these red contract these red ropes um no less than three feet so you count those in the length of the rope right or length of the buoy line yeah they would add a few feet to your buoy line sure yep so just add that in so when you're getting you know just just to get a rough idea of you know what we're going to be doing so all right that's all right now thank you okay next we have tyler daly tyler you can unmute yourself tyler daly okay we will come back i have john um simons john you can unmute yourself all right uh two questions what email address should i send these pictures to you on that on that question i had earlier about the ice place send them to um send them to justin.wilsonmass.gov josten justin is our new gear guy and i will work directly with justin uh to distribute those develop them and have them tested if appropriate all right so justin.wilson at what at mass.gov so i have it up on the screen right now if you can see okay yeah i got that all right and then my other my other question is and i i i think this is what everyone's missing if you put red rope in in your buoy line anyways it you can't have more than 60 feet of regular rope until you get to your next red rope so the length of the red rope doesn't really matter is that is that correct that's correct you can't have any length of rope greater than 60 feet without a an insert a weak insert so if you've got a 50 foot piece of red rope you can have 50 feet on top of it and 50 feet on the bottom of it and and that would be good so you have 150 foot total in the middle of its 50 foot so you have 150 feet total you take the top 75 percent and you measure out and you can't have any length greater than 60 feet that that doesn't have a weak piece of rope in it so all right that's pushing the capabilities i'm doing math in my head right now so but all right so so to simplify you just you you've got to have either a piece of so the measurement starts at the end of the red rope or the end of the south shore sleeve yes okay that's all i need to know all right gotcha all right thanks a lot you're welcome all right we'll try tyler daily again tyler if you can unmute yourself yeah working this time yeah yep we hear you yeah with regard to uh putting in a three foot section of the red rope is that you can just cut a three foot section and splice it in tuck it in whichever way you want yep it can be it can be longer than three feet just can't be shorter than three feet and then you can the red rope itself um like but if you know when you is it is the gap does that matter between say splice the splice tuck to talk nope it's just that the the starting length of the piece of gears is three feet okay thank you all right i'm gonna go to we should wrap it up i think eric had a question that was uh not necessarily gear related and we should try to wrap it up pretty soon but go ahead eric hi uh my question is to the pop-up boys uh do you believe the biggest hurdle for that is going to be the affordability of the buoy yeah i think that's i think that's definitely one of them um could currently the you know gear pop-up buoy gear even without the ability to detect it is somewhere in the order of about forty five hundred dollars for the the interrogation unit on the boat and then three to four thousand dollars per pop-up buoy uh so cost is certainly going to be a hurdle the other one of the big issues that i think that folks haven't really started to tackle with is kind of interactions with with mobile gear and how mobile gear vessels are going to detect that so i think that's another major um obstacle that the technology needs to overcome and something that they'll need to work on moving forward i i believe in my lifetime they're gonna cover that hurdle but my concern is when they cover all these uh user group hurdles is what is the price that they're gonna say is affordable like nymphs for instance they'll come a day where they're like all right everybody knows where your gear is law enforcement can now find your gear and haul it up and other lobstermen aren't going to set over you but my issue is at that time if the price tag is too high it's just going to put people out of business with the pressure on nymphs from environmental groups to use this technology yeah i don't disagree with you eric i think it's a it's a really important point in one that uh is is a great concern it's certainly it i mean there's hope that the cost comes down over time but it would have to come down fairly substantially to to be something that rank and foul fishermen would be able to to use readily so uh yeah you have very valid concerns okay that's all i got we can all go home now thank you although i am home two more let's take two more questions and uh wrap it up john he's rejoining as a panelist okay yeah how you doing yeah i just had two things uh regarding other things uh so you would bob you had mentioned um you know so when the closure the dynamic portion of it from may 1st to may 15th uh when there's no uh right whales left yeah or when there's no whales left you can you can open it up now is that an absolute zero right whales no no right whales at all or three or less yeah we're looking at we're looking at three and then we're looking at um you know for example if we found three localized to a particular area we may just keep that particular area with some boundary around it um close and open up the rest um you know typically what we see in the right whale season is we have a ton of whales a ton of whales a ton of whales and then within about a three day period they all leave um and if they continue to do that that would be great because it makes it a lot easier to manage but yeah the our metric is is three yeah we're looking for three yeah we just have to give the whales our schedule and then they'll be all set that would be great and i guess the other one probably is more for dan um i know during the the regulatory stage where you guys were doing the proposal and everybody was doing the zoom meeting and making uh comments you had somebody asked you about um if you were open to you know in the future some kind of uh change or probably not so much getting rid of the closure uh necessarily but obviously that you know if that's an option but more more just adapting the closure changing it based on what the whales are doing the activity the distribution um it'd be really nice if eventually they can find a way to do long-term tagging of them somehow that would we could get better data on where these wheels really are all the time um versus having to do spotters but is that something that's still open to a possibility especially if we can um if we can more document better that massachusetts lobster gear isn't really the problem um as much as it is other places uh which i know is kind of the hope to differentiate ourselves from other places is there still a chance of having closure uh rolled back or changed or well i think the answer to that is um it has to do with the change of right whale behaviors and you know when we started this in the 90s i think the biggest uh you know flight we ever had was in the first few years was like a 44 count and now we're we're looking at hundreds so there's something going on in our local waters uh over time that these whales are attracted to in larger numbers on a seasonal basis i can't forecast you know if that's going to continue it may not but i if you look at the last few years as sort of a trend i wouldn't expect it to change in the next few years but i think any management system has to be you know flexible and adaptable if you look at even the occurrences of right whales in the bay of fundy during the summer they're no longer there in the numbers they used to be so if there was a a bay of fundy closure then the canadians are probably looking at lifting that at this point so yeah will will we act accordingly you know in the in the future if whales are changing and you know to be flexible with the changes of behavior and who knows where this where the rope was uh goes but but for now i i think it's a safe bet that given the recent behaviors over the last five or ten years and the fact that we have 87 here yesterday um that i i think it's it's here for for the medium term but we're open you know if if things change you know we have pretty good surveillance and we'll be responsible and and try to amend the rules accordingly okay yeah i just add to that dan is not only can we but we'll have to um so part of the incidental take permit is they they issue it for a three year period and it's it's subject to constantly re it's review every three years and so part of that would be if there's any changes in distribution of whales would be us having to account for that so that would include um you know if they move into areas that that aren't currently closed we would have to address that but also if they vacate areas we could have possibly open up that and so it's all it's data driven um and obviously that you know i we would as dan said we would you know use the most recent data um sightings trends over time and try to make informed decisions and adjust those as necessary excellent that's great yeah because i know that their distribution has changed a lot over the years with with the the the copiopods moving offshore a little more and they're trying to follow them and obviously the gulf of st lawrence has become a hotbed of activity and a lot of strikes so um yeah so that's great it's it's nice to know that you're at least looking at a with a dynamic eye in the future so that's good yeah okay last um how about the last comment from lobster guy love the guy have a name lobster guy you can unmute yourself and if you could give us a name that'd be great yeah it's jeff richardson okay good job thanks um the ropeless stuff has it been talk on it about dealing with spindles because if a guy fishes 400 singles and you're talking 4 500 a pop-up the guy's going to spend 1.8 million dollars on it yeah you know before i take your point that that's exactly the kind of um of conclusion that i we're hoping that the the study that we've that we've been tasked to do um you know i think uh it's a fair prediction that that um single trap fishing could really be um economically uh you know uh extinct if if it costs that much so i take your point and you know what um if you'd like you could volunteer to be uh among those interviewed um by the uh the uh the contractor noah oppenheim so i'd welcome you to lend him your opinions on some of those questions but i don't want to spend too much time on it tonight because tonight was really about trying to give fishermen the practical information and what you're talking about is is um it's a scary future i i i hear you on that and uh we're even troll guys it's 400 000 yeah i know we understand that and and that's why um the national fisheries service is is doing a very deliberate um you know go slow on this ropeless fishing like i said um even if they enact the rules as they've proposed each of those permit holders is going to have to get an exempted fisheries permit um again it's it's uh it's going to be it's going to be slow and deliberate that i'm sure that's especially what i want to point out thank you thank you thanks all right well folks um i really want to thank you for attending tonight uh great attendance great questions bob great job and and um doing your best at math and some of these complex uh complex uh calculations um i would urge anybody to give us more feedback to that email address the reason we created a unique email address this conservation solutions is we can have a team all opening that that email account as opposed to you emailing one person and if that person is away or if that person is out on the road giving out rope they're not going to be able to check it so that's why we created a single email address that many staffers could all team up to get you the answers that you need so send us some more comments and questions and we'd be happy to address them bob any final thoughts no i appreciate everybody's um patience with this we you know we we understand that this is this is difficult uh and and certainly there's a lot of uncertainty moving forward and uh you know we'll continue to work with you guys as best we can and and again you know feel free to reach out and contact us if you have an idea we're happy to work with you right with that i'll end the recording and thank you julia for all your efforts managing the", "h2LNI_dM8pQ": "you know I love me some candy and in the world is just not enough candy objects that you can use in everyday life because sometimes you're doing things and you get hungry and you want some candy so you just want to be able to use whatever it is you are doing to eat and there's not enough things in the world like that so today we are going to be building the world's largest candy rope we're gonna test it out with a bunch of different things we're gonna do jump rope with it we're gonna hang from it we're gonna slap Dustin in the face with it it's gonna be a really good time and in order to do this we've got a whole lot of extra-long quizzler so basically what we're gonna do is tie these all together make sure they're extra strong see how long we can make it we've got about a hundred feet worth of Twizzlers right here so it should be pretty long as long as everything goes smoothly but in order for things to go smoothly we need your help so guys please help me out smash that thumbs up on right now and let me know down below in the comment section if there's any other candy related objects you want to see me make now before we get started I gotta say a big shout out to my boy Justin on the camera I'm here in case you guys didn't know that when he said I'm gonna slap Dustin with it cuz if you came to my you came to my house just to slap me with that I'd be very upset just this slap you is just a perk that they'll get to see later on in the video I'll take a slap okay sounds good as always guys remember there's an Amazon gift card randomly placed somewhere in this video so if you want a chance to win that you got to make sure you watch from the very beginning until the very end to make sure you do not miss out on the code but without any further ado guys let's start opening up these packages tying these Twizzlers together and trying to create the world's largest candy rope alright doesn't come on over all right it just good no right I thought well do it you know were you do a joke in the zone you know you do a joke and then sometimes you're like you start to go within the person laughs and they stop you were serious yeah I thought we agreed on this later all right guys slash the thumbs up button if you want me to slap this unless one of these see they just did it we'll do it after right yeah yeah okay all right but for now before we slapped us I'm gonna show you guys how we're gonna tie these Twizzlers together so come real close as you guys can see this is kind of like a like something you can split apart there's a bunch of different strands of twizzler in here so what we're gonna do is split all of these apart it's like there's cheese string yeah it's like a cheese string that's already been separated so it makes the job a little bit easier for you so we're gonna separate all of these we're gonna do it on either end of two different Twizzlers and then we're gonna use these to tie them together do that with one set that to the side do it with another 12 seconds later alright so when you're done you should have these two Medusa looking Twizzlers on your hands and what you're gonna do is basically stick them again but do so ever do to you she'd do anything to me but I did a lot to my boy Prometheus no actually no I don't Prometheus usually good guy I guess a good guy anybody we're gonna tie these to Medusa heads together basically just like this and then we're gonna overlap all of these different strings to make it all just like one big gummy knot and then you just basically squish it all together and you've got a decent little knot so see we can spin it we can and it all stays together I think it'll stay together pretty good Oh how many goes gone oh you think it'll stay together if you really hang something off of it not not a lot of weight now but it's not bad it's a good so it could be better but I think there's something we have to do to make it a little bit better I'll be right back [Music] [Applause] alright ladies and gentlemen as you can see we got the blowtorch here and what we're gonna do is gently melt the candy in this area so that it all sticks together and when it hardens it's gonna be one giant rope so let's try this out Rock Malaya this is kind of what the entire video is based off of so hopefully it works it reacts really interestingly yeah hold on you hold it we'll be back we'll be back shortly imma let you know how it works alright guys so as you can see here we've melted it down a little bit squished it together because once you melt it it becomes a little more malleable and you can move things together and now it's really stuck together we're gonna let it cool start on the next side and it should be even harder by the time we're done but it's gonna take a little bit of time so we will see you guys when we've made some progress so in like one second video time yeah for you guys one second alright peace peace alright guys so we've been working hard at this for the past like hour and we've made a lot of progress while we were out at the beginning two hours okay it's been a long time it's been a while but as you can see here this is the first two Twizzlers that we connected what we did was we tied them together we burnt it and now it's all hardened and basically it's kind of blended them into one twizzler now so it's pretty strong but as we've gone along as continued with the process and we've been trying to figure out the best way to do it and the fastest way to do it because it's taking a really long time and we've got like a hundred Twizzlers that are footlong each to all connect together so basically we started out where we would like twist one twist on this one and now we've worked our way to the point where what I'll do is I untie them I care so basically I'll untie the tips like this anyways you get the point I untie all of the tips I do it on both sides and then I tie them together Dustin firms them up like basically make sure they're really tight rolls it up and then he lights it on fire with the blowtorch tightens it again one last time and voila no disclaimer do not try this at home there you go so as you can see we've made a lot of progress so far but we still got a long way to go we've got at least one more entire package to go we've got a few more other ones to go as well so I'm going to show you guys a little bit more of what we've got going on and then we will be done very shortly so let's get right into it [Music] [Music] all right ladies and gentlemen after hours of hard work we are finally done the world's largest Tandy's rope [Music] sorry guys there you have it the world's largest candy rope now that we're done we've completely built it it's time to take it outside and put it through some tests so let's go see what it can do all right guys we've moved into the garage first things first we got a test if we can even stretch this thing completely out so we're gonna put one man on one end another on the other and slowly stretch it out and see if it works all right guys we couldn't fully completely talk we lost a little bit but we still got the majority of the rope next time we're gonna try and play jump rope with this thing almost Bucci okay we need to try again with the it worked for a little bit it worked for a little bit yeah Dustin remember at the beginning the video we said we could slap no yo-yo all right dad's got an idea let's hear it alright I got a little lastly so someone's gonna be running we're gonna try and catch them whoo John Wayne style there you gotta spin it over your head a likkle you're smeared over your head a little you know what these come when someone runs my DJ just run what are those cold let me probably down below with those things okay yeah yeah I know you're talking about some next-level Australian like yeah yeah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] everyone did a great job but not the game I'm not the W wants to see if you can do it okay one round the trick shots everything takes a trick shot and then everyone tries to do it all right first one first trick shot dusting the sideways for 60 bad okay got it [Music] oh all right trick shot title back you already but if this jet do one two three poochie's ain't got on me Missa tee IC got a lot of change I think chance you mr. t alright he doesn't even have anything on me you look at it yeah yeah yeah we're talking exactly yeah yeah IceCube no that's good I see you uncultured come on stop he was on he's on bear shows yeah married to Coco yeah mister yeah borderline weird all right guys we're running out of ideas so I'm just gonna put myself in in danger for you guys as I always do gonna put this on and let the sand whip me in the face with the giant candy rock which is no longer very giant anymore but here we go thumbs up I'm good though one more [Applause] okay I'm on those about you all right ladies and gentlemen that is it for today's video as you saw we were able to build the world's largest candy row but wasn't exactly the world's strongest candy row but nonetheless we're still above it's the world's longest ha maybe no you're right it's only if the world and that's the only rope in the world that long then it is the strongest by default all of that length of that lace not strong yeah specifications yeah I think we'll just stick with the longest and well we'll let somebody else have the strongest cuz you know we don't want to be greedy here so the road wasn't that strong but we were still able to have some fun with it we were able to jump rope we were able to throw it at each other we were able to have like a little war and all that fun stuff so hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if you want to see a part two where we make another giant rope out of something else or anything like that be sure to let me know down below in the comment section now give a huge shout out to all the boys and specifically dustin for helping out with the video so we be sure to check down below in the description as always thank you guys so much for watching and I will catch you next time [Music]", "-45YP6_PgC4": "hey y'all and welcome to modder's market and thank you becky you did a wonderful job on your video today now stay tuned because when i show you my video i will be leaving you a link to hop on over to miss connie so that she can show you some more diys and you can continue the fun so today is all about he is risen easter hop you will have a chance somewhere along this video to win a hundred and fifty dollar gift card so stay tuned you must watch the whole entire video and you will be given direction somewhere in the video as to how to enter in this giveaway now the giveaway will be either 150 amazon or visa gift card it will be your choice as a winner as to how you receive that so several things are happening here we are going to be celebrating the resurrection of our lord and savior through our crafts we are going to be inspiring you how to decorate for easter and maybe go away with some of the bunnies and easter eggs and candy and things like that now we do celebrate like that in our family as i will mention a little bit later but that's not what this particular video is all about so sit back and enjoy and let's get started for diy number one i have this wreath now i am actually repurposing this wreath but i'm going to show you how i made it from the beginning i started out with this wood blend wreath that you can get from the dollar tree and i also am going to be using some white nautical rope now you can get this nautical rope from the dollar tree in white or you can also get it in the natural color and you can also paint it any color you want once your wreath is put together so the sky is a limit on the color and what you can do to make it and you can also use this wreath year-round if you want to remove the little thing that i'm going to add on there that makes it part of the he is risen [Music] theme for today so what i did is i just took two bundles of the nautical rope and i wrapped it around the wreath until i ran out of rope and i went probably every five or six rounds i would dab a little piece of hot glue down there and then i took this eucalyptus swag or garland that i got from the dollar tree i've never seen this before and i actually haven't seen it since i got these they only had two the day i got it and i grabbed both of them but i'm only going to be using one for this wreath so i just wrap wrap it around that little section that was missing the nautical rope and then i go through and i get these little dahlia flowers that i had and this is the flowers that i used the first time i did this wreath and i will be using these flowers again with some other flowers and i'm not going to be using the eggs that was just there when i did it the first time because i thought i might use it but i didn't end up using it at all so what i did is i took the flowers i'm sorry i took the beads that i and i will leave a link to everything down below too so if you're wondering where i got it from just check out my description box but i took 10 beads and put them on some jute twine to make my little hanger once i got all of my beads on my twine i simply tied it in like a little circle if you will with a little bit of the twine hanging or you know left over and then i just wrap that around the top of my wreath and tied it in a knot and tied it on there and that was it as far as making the hanger now you can also paint these beads any color you want you can make them natural wood color you know to stain them in the natural wood color you can paint them different colors to match the colors in your wreath i mean again the sky is the limit to what you can do with your hanger you also can use ribbon for your hanger or wire for your hanger there are several things that you can do and you don't have to do it with the beads like i did but i just happen to like the look that the beads add to it so once i got the hanger made then i took my wreath apart and started from scratch as far as the flower placement now the little pink or fuchsia whatever color flowers that you see there i have had those forever and some flowers that i got out of bouquets that i just recently took out of my bathroom now if you follow my channel and you've been here before i am in the middle of doing a series called a vintage lavender farmhouse series and these are some things that i took out of my bathroom when i was redecorating it for my new lavender theme so i took the flowers and added them to the wreath and then i took these little picks that i got from the dollar tree oh and this is the um the thing that i'm going to be adding but i took those white picks right there that i got from the dollar tree and just kind of stuck them in there to add a little bit more to it and then i just kind of played around with an idea where to put that little cross that says he has risen and i decided in the end to put it at the very bottom in the middle of the wreath once i got that done i just took a couple of pieces of ribbon in similar colors to the flowers and just made a little simple little bow and glued it down to the bottom of my wreath and then i was done that was it that was all there was to make in this and i love the way it turned out and i love the message behind the resurrection that is written on the cross now i got this cross i believe at walmart for like 98 it was pretty cheap and when i seen it i knew i had to get it to use in this collaboration today so leave me a comment and let me know what you think about how my repurposed wreath turned out and these colors that i'm using in this wreath will be my theme for today so again make sure you leave me a message let me know what you think about this definitely leave me a big thumbs up and if you are new to my channel i would love for you to become a subscriber if you're not already but this is how the wreath turned out again like i said i love the message behind he has risen because that truly is what easter is all about it's not about the bunnies and the eggs and the candy and i love all of that and we celebrate with all of that in our family but the true message and the true meaning is the fact that jesus not only died on the cross to save us of our sins but he rose again on that third day and that's where easter comes from now diy number two is probably my favorite of all of my diys that i'm doing today it was very simple and easy to make now i have seen these little blocks on a ton of people's diy videos but i've never been able to find them and i walked into the store just before my surgery the other day and found some and grabbed what was left in the box right here i'm just showing you the stains and the colors that i'm going to be using and i will link both of them down below in the description box along with all of the materials that i used that i actually or that you can actually buy you know some of them like the darker pink flowers i had on hand so you won't find a link to them but what i did is i took this stain and i just brushed all of these blocks until i got them good and stained and once i was finished with staining them the darker brown color then you'll see me go back in and sort of heavily whitewash it with the ivory chalk paint now once i start to whitewash it you're going to notice that i am horribly out of the camera shot you will also notice a bandage on my hand and possibly throughout the video some pretty good bruising on my arms and that is because i was recently out of surgery when i was doing this i had heart surgery last wednesday and was on some medication that had me not so focused so that's why i was out of focus on the camera because i really wasn't paying attention to the fact that i was filming i just kind of got in the zone of crafting and just went for it so i take my ivory chalk paint and like i said heavily white washed over the top of that darker color and once i had all of my blocks finished painting then i took my new cricket joy that i got for my birthday from my honey and i have been wanting that crooked joy since it came out and that was my surprise for my husband well along with dinner and some roses and he's oh my god he's just the most amazing man ever but anyway we're talking about this and not him because i could just go on and on and on about that man of mine but anyway i finished getting all of my blocks ready cut out my wording off my new cricut joy and it simply says he is risen again that is the theme for today and i made one letter for each block and you will see me adding them to the blocks in just a minute and i just want to reiterate the fact oh i do want to tell you first though about this little cross if you shop at the dollar tree like most of us crafters do then you see this in the crafter square section and i've actually seen this for quite a while long before easter came out so i got this one a while back because i knew i was going to use it for easter i did not at the time know that i was going to be blessed and honored enough to be a part of this collaboration today but i did know that i wanted to use it in one of my easter diys so i took that same vintage effects wash and painted it all over this cross and once you do that you take you well you can take you don't have to take a wash rag or something a rag and just kind of go back over it and wipe it all down and it just leaves the most gorgeous stain on your wood and i love love love it it was a recommendation from another crafter back a couple of months ago when i first started my channel and i honestly don't remember who turned me on to it but it's well worth the buy and again i will have a link down in my description section for everything that i'm using that you can still purchase so i took my cutouts and weeded everything and got it ready to put on my blocks and then i just started placing the letters one by one on the blocks until it reads he is risen and then i just started gluing my blocks together and i glued risen side by side obviously on the bottom and then on the top left i put he and then the space for my cross in the middle and then over to the right is and again because of the medication and being loop-de-loo i was not 100 in focus for this so i'm gonna apologize one more time for being out of the camera shot so then i just took this gorgeous bouquet that i got from walmart for three dollars and used it to pick a couple of the flowers off and add to this particular project now this bouquet was only three dollars like i said and i used it for every single project that i done for this video so not a bad deal not a bad deal at all but i just placed some flowers down there glued them in place and that's all i did to this i did add a little tiny rose bouquet to the cross right there in the middle and that came in a package from walmart i think there was like six of them in there for a 99 cent a dollar ninety-nine something like that it wasn't too much and you'll see me use it on this and my next project so let me know in the comments down below what you think about this and how it turned out and i'm gonna be telling you about that contest coming up really really soon if you're still with me drop me a pink tulip down below in the comments just to let me know that you're still here with me now this is diy number three and i love the way this turned out i found this wreath form at the dollar tree and was stunned at how big it was it's literally over two foot tall and i took some twine that i bought off of amazon and again i will link everything down below of the items that i'm using that you can still purchase but i took that twine and i just wrapped and wrapped and wrapped it around this cross until i covered almost the entire cross with the exception of the middle piece and the only reason i didn't cover the middle piece is because i couldn't really figure out a way to get it wrapped around it but it ended up working out just fine that i didn't cover the middle because once i put my flowers on it it covered that little bare spot up anyway perfectly and it gave my flowers a place to kind of set down into so it worked out perfect so i finished putting the twine on there took some more of the flowers from that gorgeous bouquet and just placed them in the middle of my cross and after i got the flowers placed i took some of that same ribbon that i used previously and just made a couple of little strands to hang from the cross i did not make an actual bow out of it and you'll see what i'm talking about here shortly but i did want some of the ribbon hanging from the cross and i'm glad i didn't use a bow because i think it would have taken away from the beauty of the flowers and everything that i was trying to do with this cross so that could not have been a simpler project super super easy the hardest thing was getting that twine wrapped around it and that really was not hard at all and that is all there was to making this cross and as we know the cross symbolizes that jesus died for us on a cross to save us over our sins i'm sorry i did not mean to get emotional but when i think about the sacrifice that he made for me and you it's hard not to get emotional and be so grateful and so thankful that he laid his life down for us and on that third day he was resurrected and rose again and that's what this whole entire video is about he is risen okay i'm so sorry about that but this is diy number four and this is the last project that i have for you and stay tuned because i am going to be telling you about the contest and how to enter it so what i did is i took this crate and this cross that you can get from the dollar tree and i gave it a coat of that ivory paint and got it ready to put together as like a little flower box sort of deal i don't even know what to call it honestly and i took the cross and i kind of heavily whitewashed it with or distressed it i call it whitewashed a lot of people call it distress it's all the same and then i went back with that vintage effects and sort of roughed up the planter once i got that done i took some foam place it down in the bottom of my little crate and i took my cross and added my saying which again going with the theme of the whole project if he is risen i placed the wording on the cross i also took one of those little flowers from walmart that i was telling you about that came six to a pack and placed it at the top just to cover that little hole where the hanger was hanging at and once i got all of that done i just started gluing it all into place and once again this could not have been an easier project i did make me a little bow to place on the top of my box too and then that was it that is as simple as it gets this was super easy cost me a little over two dollars to make and i just love the way it turned out i did add these little flowers wildflowers from the dollar tree along with the rest of my flowers there to kind of finish off that look and that was it that's all there was to it and this is how that turned out and then i am going to show you how everything else all came together and turned out and once i give you that little look then i'm going to tell you how to enter this contest so stay tuned so do [Applause] do do [Applause] and here is information

diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please

knives automatically reappear actually see the card magically balance look disappearing what's good welcome back to how to match there [Music] I am your host Evan Aaron today I'm showing you 10 simple magic tricks that you can do at home you can do it so if you ready hit the thumbs up button and unless go so I've got a cool trip to show you with this spoon spoon you can feel it right genuine metal verify that for everyone at home genuine metal spoon catch a little focus on that so they can see metal spoon watch all we do is take the spoon and if I dip it into the water you can kind of see this happen watch disappearing and that crazy-looking and drop the whole thing in that crazy the whole spoon just completely melts into the water one run outs up mm-hmm all right I'll teach you all right here's how it's done I'm about to reveal of us the secret to this Turk is extremely simple and I'll teach you how it's done right now this is really simple to set up yourself all you need is a spoon mold this is actually a mold to make candy spoons and the other thing you're going to need is this right here it's called Gally it's a special type of metal that actually melts at a really low temperature a liquid metal on the ball ah now once you have the gallium heated up to a certain temperature it will actually become liquid and you can pour it into the mold so you're just gonna fill the mold with the liquid gallium just like that then you want to place the spoon molds in the freezer so that they harden up so once your spoons have hardened into shape in the freezer you can remove them and handle them pretty openly then you want to take a cup of hot water as hot as you can get it you can then take the spoon tap it on the glass to show that it's real old tap it on the table and then all you have to do is take the spoon and dip it into the water and watch and just like that the entire spoon will melt into the cup of water looks like it just completely disappears or like the spoon is just somehow melting in water is crazy it looks like real magic and if you don't know the secret is probably one of the most amazing things you could ever see it looks like the spoon is really just melting or sometimes depending on the refraction of the glass it looks like it's just disappearing into nothing as you dip it into the water you can actually see all of the melted metal gallium in the bottom of the cup right there you can actually handle it it will melt in your hands the melting point is actually right around human body temperature you want to play with it so heavy it's crazy feeling feels so weird alright Who I am I feel weird metal stay tuned until the end of the video if you want to win some gallium so that you can perform this amazing illusion at home so a cool trick with a paper cup I also have three Ice Cube's here we have one Ice Cube goes right in the cup just like that second ice cube also in the cup and the third Ice Cube you guessed it in the cup just like that so the three ice cubes inside the cup you can hear them there watch all I do is wave my hand snap my fingers and the ice cubes completely disappear just like that now in order to make them come back all you have to do is turn this up this way give it a little shake and you can kind of hear it happen and I schematically reappear just like that all you need to pull this trick off at home is some ice and a paper cup you'll also need some scissors or a knife so if you're a kid you're gonna need an adult's help with this all you're going to do is cut a flap in the back of the cup so from the front the cup appears completely normal to the audience but on the back we have our hidden flap that we can secretly fold down with our thumb just like this the flap folds down and holds the ice inside the cup so that you can turn it upside down and make it look like it's completely disappeared you can then reverse the process by appending the cup like this and moving your thumb off the flap to let the ice fall out of the cup making it look like it just magically reappears at your command okay and a cool trick to show you with these tissues right here so I got a box of tissues let us take one of the tissues take a few of them like this and see I'll sit the Box out here I just take the tissues like this and I'm kind of ball them up here hold out your hands watch if I just kind of give it a little magic motion like this look then cool this magically appear from the tissues hmm the sweet trick okay here's how to do the magic candy from the tissues tricky that's going to take some tissues out of the box like this and then you can set the tissue box aside all you need is the tissues and if you just kind of candy is just magically produced super easy to do and we'll show you how it's done right now this is the secret before the trick starts you're going to bundle up some candy in a tissue just like this it's gonna bundle this up then hide it behind the top tissue of the box just like this so from the front this top tissue heights and when you grab it you pick up the entire thing just like this hiding the bundle of candy behind the tissue so that way you can show your hands empty at the beginning hold a couple more tissues I'll provide some cover and all you have to do is split the tissues open and it looks like you magically produce the candy from the tissues okay I have a really cool card trick to show you so I want everyone at home watching this video to think of a card the first card that pops in your mind lock it in your mind right now and keep it locked in your mind don't tell anyone don't say it out loud I have a full deck of cards here you can see they're all different keep your card locked in your mind though so think about all the different cards in the deck but keep your card locked in your mind so watch all I do is take the deck like this and if I squeeze it looks like all the cards disappear except for one card your card just like that now the question everyone always acts at this point is what happens to all the other cards well the pyramid the secret to the magic disappearing deck of cards is found right here in this box this is called a magic card fountain it's an electronic motorized remote-controlled card fountain that with the press of a button will shoot cards into the air just like that stay tuned until the end of the video for a special giveaway if you want to win the magic card back we'll take the money and make it rain so all you need to pull off this trick is a dollar bill a paper note of some kind actually came up with this trick this is one that I invented and the other thing you need is a little plastic tray actually cut this out of a piece of product packaging like this and then poke a bunch of holes in the tray just like this as you can see there are only holes on one side of the tray you have the plastic tray held on the back of the bill just like this and we're going to fill the tray with water obviously this is done before the performance from a backside view you can see this but from the front is completely hidden from the spectator then all you have to do to make it rain is simply tilt this back and the water will drain from the little holes in the plastic tray making it look like rain is just magically produced from the money watch take the card and stab the straw through it just like that and then watch pull it out there's no hole through the car here's how to do this trick this is what you need to pull it off you need a plastic drinking straw just like this you need a couple of magnets some playing cards and a hot glue gun your first step is to take some scissors and snip off the bottom end of the straw you want a piece about this long your next step is to glue each one of the magnets in these ends of the straw take some hot glue and put it in the end of the straw just like this and take one of your little magnets and just glue it right there into the end of the straw so now we have one of the magnets glued inside it's time to glue the other one so one magnet here the other magnet is going right here so just a little dab of glue here once you have both ends glued let them drop now that the glue is dried you should have a straw that will magically magnetized to itself so the two magnets will hold together you can hold the straw at the cut just like this show the card and the straw to the audience and then secretly hold the piece of straw to the back the car then when you bring this straw down the two magnets will magnetized together and it would look like you have skewered the card on the straw then once it sinks in with the audience that they're genuinely is a hole through the card you can take the straw slide it off and show that the card is magically restored with no hole whatsoever take the coin and turn it into a magic wand well the setup for this trick is really simple but if you're a kid you might need an adult's help with this part this is a hot glue gun you're gonna take a coin and you're gonna put a little bit of hot glue right in the middle of the coin you're then going to take your magic wand and a fix it to the hot glue and the coin now you want the wand to be straight up and down right in the middle of the coin so that when viewed from a front angle the wand is completely concealed by the coin so once the hot glue is set in place on the coin and the wand your next step is to practice the sleight of hand move you want to hold the coin so that it completely conceals the wand from a different perspective you can see the wand just there but if viewed from the proper angle it is a very convincing illusion that you're simply holding a coin in between your two fingers making the coin transform into the wand is as simple as making the quick movement of turning the one sideways while concealing the coin in your hand take the coin and turn it into a magic wall so you take the red apple and magically change it into a green your first step is to take a normal latex balloon and snip the top off with some scissors step 2 is to take a green apple just like this and you're going to stretch the red balloon around the front of your green apple once you have the balloon in place on the green apple it will look like a red apple from the front view so your last step in order to change it from a red apple to a green apple in performance is simply to slip the balloon off of the Apple as quickly as possible so the best way to do this when you bring your hand over is to simply peel that balloon like that and it will roll up on itself and quickly palm it into your hand so you take the red apple and magically change it into a green one okay trick with two playing cards here two normal cards are these six of clubs and the King of Hearts so pay attention to these six we're going to fold it in half just like this and the King is actually going to get sandwiched in the six just like so so the six is wrapped around the King just like that we're going to unfold them just like this now check this out this is really cool it's a really easy trick to you can do this one at home so all we have to do is fold the King just like this inside of the six and then we hold it like this at our fingertips and all you have to do you can actually see on both sides the king is folded with the back side out it's very close attention to that as we push the cart through just like this it looks like the car just magically turns the right way up just like that I'm going to reverse this process push back this way you can see the car back down one more time just like that aren't turns a SUP back this way bass town again open the cards just like this you can see the six it's completely normal face as well and the back of the team completely normal and the face completely normal as well just like that the only thing you need to pull off this trick at home is two playing cards and a pair of scissors your setup before the trick starts you're gonna crease both of the cards in the middle just like that then you're going to cut one of the cards just there in this case we're gonna make it the Cape so if you want to follow along and home cut your king just like this so you want to be careful not to flash the cut to your audience but the cut in the card is what makes this illusion possible when you place the cards face to face like this in the beginning of the trick and fold them up and then twist this card over as you fold it looks like you now have the King sandwiched between these six just like this with both of them but their backs facing out what's actually happening inside here is we have the flap of the King fold it over just like this so now when you push the card through it looks like it just inverts and magically turns over so that's like that you can show it on both side and then when you open up the cards want to be careful not to flash this you open this up and show the six on this side then you're just gonna secretly unfold that flap right there you can show both backs in both faces hi guys it is bonus trick time check it out okay quick card trick with the Queen of Hearts as you can see this hand is completely empty and my other hand is totally empty as well so I'm gonna take the Queen we're actually gonna sit it on the back of my hand just like this now watch and

"Sts_DMj4IGU": "what of your db2 saucy back at it with another one today we're gonna be my bad I just woke up cold sick that up yeah today we gonna we're gonna be doing a review on Stoney Pat's edibles if you see it say I don't know if it's gonna focus but they say extra strength 300 milligrams 350 milligrams just starting packs Oh sour patch kids 350 milligrams usually just the packaging got these from the homie he said I can go ahead and have him up the plug when I had shot me these when I was picking me it looked just like a regular shower packs kits - the sour stuff you don't

gonna go ahead and finish the recipes get back to y'all in like an hour let y'all know what it is if you did anything I have a high tolerance so sometimes edibles don't even do that honestly it's like 6:30 in the morning oh I'm talking low everybody's still sleep where these things are disgusting I'm gonna get back to you on the Alberto alright y'all so we back hour later and I feel nothing not high it was garbage wasting my time it tastes like we but no effects I don't know if my toddler and something cold but I feel nothing maybe my hair fell maybe my head feels heavy but I don't know

taco don't waste your money bro please don't that's it negative reviews for me buddy negative reviews from me better just smoke some trizzie something I do don't fit around that something right now I'll see what time it is trade time on the road some get faded so yeah like I said edibles it's not the boom don't I am my review I got to get an F I'm not any higher than I was never buy those again please don't waste your money", "JCwns5ieyVo": "and we take junk and random items and we turn them into home decor that we sell in our shop um online at jrvhome.com or use at our house which today we're kind of mix and matching we've got these new candlesticks that we sell at jamie rayvintage.com unfinished um and finished at jrvhome.com it's real confusing i know we'll kind of go over that here in a little bit um and then we've got an old half of the door that i bought on legit i bought this on ebay probably 13 years ago it's when we lived in arizona in the preschool valley house so it's been a hot minute um and i have used this decor forever in fact this used to be over the top of my fridge in the other house we're gonna be making a coffee table yeah it's been around for a long long time we did not cut it in half this is how it came this is a great way let's say you've got a door and the bottom half's busted or it's getting like old doors sometimes half of them are okay and half of them are all splintered and gross cut it down use it for something fun architectural salvage so we're going to show you how to make a coffee table using these what letter of candlesticks are these i should have looked beforehand i didn't even look yeah i'm going to look them up while they all have letter designations they all look the same size in the pictures on the website so make sure you're checking dimensions these are the biggest ones they're 13 and a half inches combined with an inch and a half top that puts you just about perfect for most couches most most chairs seats couches um are going to be right around 17 to 18 inches that's where most adults are comfortable sitting and then you want your coffee table to be a couple inches lower than that for comfort like let's say if you're going to like put stuff on there you want to reach out and grab uh your drink or you want to prop your feet up on their coffee tables make great footstools i've seen it are these a yes they're a so they're 13 and a half inches tall plus the height of your door so that would put us with 13 and a half plus an inch and a half door right at 15 inches which is where we want to be couple inches lower than the seat height that you're putting them by and the letter's the same on both websites so if you don't want to buy them unfinished you can buy them finished on jrv home and it's still a um the reason behind this just to kind of give you an idea of what we're doing on jamie rayvintage.com that's where we have all of our unfinished products and diy products so anything that comes that's a project situation it's going to be at jmurrayvintage.com we have a separate shipping team for that they do all the paint and everything and it just makes sense to have them there because if people buy unfinished candlesticks they're going to want to buy paint too so it's all in one place and then there's the people that don't want to finish their own stuff i get that so at jrbhome.com we carry the candlesticks and a great um rustic kind of they're going to be this color here yeah that just worked on them yesterday and we just got those up so that this is what they look like so this is this is about the color and the finish that they'll have and originally we designed these to fit with these rounds we have some big rounds that go on here you can also pick those up unfinished i don't know if they're finished on the website yet but they make great risers they there's a bigger one that fits a lot of uh cake plates like if you find the domes at the thrift store or whatever but that's the original design but jamie was like let's make a coffee table yeah so i was like i want to show you guys how to take candlesticks and make a coffee table you could do the same thing if you guys have like some porch posts you can use the same technique just cut those all down the correct levels and then you can make a coffee table with that i gotta get to doing stuff yeah we're going to get to going but i just want to explain that real quick so we've got this trim is going to go around the edge an old door and four of the a candle sticks yeah this is just leftover trim i had a bunch of odds and end sizes in the garage from trimming out various things in the house if you don't have leftover trim sitting around you know even like a square piece of uh like common board pine or whatever or or you could rip down a two by four it's just a little lip on here to kind of hide the transition where the coffee table meets and these are hand turned by beb's brother ty zeb and i are designing all of the woods products um and some of our retailers even carry um the woods products so if you go to jrbwholesale.com you might be able to find a reseller that's ordered some in um always check with the retailer um near you because not all of them carry all of our products because we have a lot of products yeah we have i think there's 38 woods products now well we have the woods we have the decoupage paper we have the stencils pretty soon we're going to have a skincare line coming um stencil brushes so there's lots of different things that we carry not we don't make our retailers carry all of it because you know there's just a lot of stuff okay so you could screw this on nail it on with a nail and hammer i am going to first use guess what i'm using my milwaukee nailer i know you're surprised we are not sponsored by them yeah you know i emailed them a while back i was like hey you know i use your tools all the time in my videos and they never email me back so apparently i'm two small potatoes over here which you know i get it it's fine so the nice thing about this uh this trim is it's kind of flexible this door was not cut perfect yeah i can see there's a little dippy doo we might have a slight gap up here in the top when it's all said and done um fill that in with some thick diy paint or we also may uh just do like um some air dry clay or something like that or we might leave the gap because we don't care and you never know what kind of mood we're going to be in for the day i needed a cool coffee table that wasn't like ginormous because my living room is not a big space and there's a lot going on so i didn't want something that was going to be large and in charge so this is going to be perfect for that the back door of the doors would you call that like a salmon color yes yeah salmon all right sam is an accurate description what can i do for you uh we need milk paint mixed up finishing those candle sticks first well first i'm going to paint them with dark and decrepit or do you want me to use weathered wood whatever you want to do that's that's on that's on you i'm building the table i don't know i'll just use dark and crappy okay this is the tricky part because the top of the door has a ton of detail so it doesn't lay flat against the table and also simultaneously trying to show you guys what i'm doing here so if you're new here make sure you hit that subscribe button we'd love to have you as subscribers hit the notification button because youtube doesn't always like to tell you when we're live so if you hit the notification i think you can click like notify all and then you know we're coming on so we're doing the trim on here just to hide the transition just a little bit on the coffee table i feel like it just makes it look more finished right like you could also use salvage i mean this is just like leftover from well actually it's not leftover trim that should be used in the house by mother's day right mother's day remember i told you that that's what i want for mother's day all my trim kids got to get with jack and redrick and odelia listen linda eliza they're they're the ones that you need to get hit up for mother's day gifts it's not going to happen with them so i'm asking you you can be the ringleader but you got to be in charge for centuries husbands have helped their children on mother's day well maybe not centuries but zeb has actually been really good in years past i have all these cute things with the kids footprints and their handprints that he's made me out of salvage we found some of those when we were moving because you know after a while you get like how many years harrington's gonna be 19 this year so you start getting a lot of things well and in years past when we were young and broke that was always resourceful so you just go to the garage and find whatever leftover salvage we happen to have and make something for mother's day which is always good i like that stuff best well we were harrington was moving some of this stuff he's like oh man look at my footprint they said you should never use a brad nailer towards somebody so don't shoot me i'm not gonna shoot sugar i've never had this brad dylan miss now it'll probably happen to me but i have shot my finger with it but that was my fault you know when you do fall she's got her safety glasses on if it gets in her you know a quick little uh plier action we'll pull that right out it'll be okay thanks for that one so when i put in about 4 000 pieces of shiplap in this house and i did shoot myself in the finger a few times i didn't cry i might have said words okay so the door over here is not even it does this so i'm gonna do my best here um gi joe it's not a cabinet door it's like the bottom fourth of a store so back in the day before i knew where to get salvage i knew i loved it and i think i always say that green chippy door in the corner with my first one but i actually think this was my first store um and so i went on ebay because back in those days that's the only place i knew to get stuff that i could locate and i bought this door thinking it was bigger than it was because i just wanted an old chippy door and so i've literally i said i thought it 13 years but i got at the preschool valley house so how long have we lived in utah since sanji was five and he's 18 and a half so i have a gap over here i might be 14 years old anyways i've had it for a long time so now i'm glad that it's turning into a coffee table well so you just gotta save your junk because you never know when you're gonna need it for a long long time it lived up above the kitchen um so your mom and dad are watching and they say hi hey mom and dad my mom just had her surgery she's just been through her first checkup and she is miserable sitting around the house because she can't walk on it yet she's a doer you know when they say when they tell people to be careful don't break a hip you know don't jump rope because you might have to right i have a hypocrisy okay so i had a big gap there and i didn't show you but i just got some paper clay you can use wood putty uh lightweight solution whatever you want we're gonna probably come back over this with some milk paint or something and this has a big gap along here so i'm not going to sweat it too much but my miter was just a hair off because this door does some windy bendies and so i'm just taking it and just filling in this top little gap and it'll be nice and paper close the new wood putty man i love it so much from the price it's really good because for have you guys ever bought plastic wood it's like those little teeny tiny tubes so it does come in handy and we always seem to have paper clay because it works it dries out quick and it's not structural but most putties aren't so speaking of parents have you seen mine this morning i left before they i knew they were awake to go work at the shop i have not usually your mom's out and around by now but all right okay my parents are 81 and 87 and they live with us so if you didn't know that now you do all right all right that's done now how much more painting do you have to do over there looks like a lot uh i just got started okay i'll grab a brush and help you you can start attaching legs though i mean i can i don't know why i did the top of that that was not very smart um you can start attaching legs though because probably have it yeah i can paint them once they're attached it doesn't matter okay so you see the top it's not it's it's got this fun trim detail on it oh julia's gonna check on him she's home today she has wednesdays off from school okay so the way you attach these same with this this is a dowel screw that's in there for attaching to the top of candlesticks let me show you close so you guys can read it i get these particular ones at home depot pretty much most hardware stores are going to have them um and it's called a dowel screw because literally dowels it's donna just pointed my two-sided screw we found out yesterday on our channel member live hey if you guys are channel members make sure you hit up the community tab because we had our second live of the month for channel members only up yesterday we showed you guys how to make mdf into chippy awesome corbles and we also did a fun little plaque situation we also have the printables up for the month of march both principles are up on community so if you are a channel member make sure you hit that up and download that printable even if you don't use it you can download it and use it later up to 100 times all right so got the end of the dowel screw in there you're not going to hurt it in the vice grips it'll still screw in just fine now the handy thing these have they're already like pre-punched from the tail stock on the lathe so yeah so they all come with a little hole in the top and that's just because so you can find center really easy i'm going to screw this down these are an inch and a half so i'm going to screw it down in there about three quarters um it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to use a little bit heftier dowel screw they make them all sizes 5 16s all kinds of stuff hey cindy she's going to the doctor and donna says if it was me i'd have the colored part on top then paint it white milk paint well that i like the white chippy that's on there but that well and the detail is more on the other side it's got the back of the door right here okay so i've just lined up the edges on here and i probably should pre-drill this with an eighth inch bit but i'm just gonna go for it oh dorian said no tattling she knows things too no tattling like that she jumped rope that's why she had to have a hammer please are we done screwing can i take my glasses off yeah i'm done with the nail gun okay did you put glue on that or are you just screwing i'm just screwing this in because you can uh screw them back out and like i said i may do a little bit larger dowel screw but i don't know i don't know if i need one that's how big does this wood start off this is six inches no these candlesticks to make them this big it's six by six by the time they're turned down it's it's somewhere in between five and a half and six it varies depending on like knots in the wood because they're hand made and stuff so we just go until we get them right um this one came out at five and three quarters of an inch diameter on the top somebody asked if ty and mariah were going to be on some videos with us we're hoping so they're all the same ty's using a copier so thai is very official once that made them he just did it by hand and although when zeb does stuff by eyeballing he's pretty good we know his eyeballs are good mine not so much we're actually in the process of designing a new dining table for the farmhouse because we've got a little bit more space here so i think we're going to take our existing dining table that you guys could have probably seen videos on way back when um and weatherproof it put a bunch of weather sealer on it and throw it out back and then build a new one a little bit bigger because eight people live in this house and when people come over for dinner like ty mariah and caitlin or zeb's cousins callie and lydia we need more space and so i want a dining room table for 12. it's still not going to fit everybody but it'll fit more people between that and this giant bar we're pretty good we're going to be working on our outdoor space here in a couple of months getting ready for the pool to come in we're pretty excited about that well now that we've got warmer weather coming in we probably should actually finish the front of the house we have the lumber sitting on the side of the house to build the awning that goes over the garage and the master bedroom windows on the front because right now it's just flat and it does have like a board and batten look at this one but we we you know i'm gonna be so sad when the farmhouse is done i was like listen there's gonna be videos forever because i want to add a cupola to the top of the edition and i'm thinking about putting a big barn quilt um on the inside of this corner that faces like the backyard because we've got like a big dead space where there's no windows because of the boys bunk room so we've got lots of plants and we got to build a little barn for our little sheep that are coming how long do we have them i think we're probably about four weeks out i need to message her because we're going out of town we're gonna be in round top next week and then in tight california the week after so as soon as we get back we've got to get on the uh fencing and sheep situation so yeah it's going to be going to be busy and we got to fence off the yard because uh sweep sweep sheep don't swim they also don't jump fences the ones that we have so some sheep jump fences the ones we get are getting traditionally don't challenge the fence so well it's like impossible because they're so they're not like a goat that's gonna eat the fence and we're gonna have a hard like mechanical cover with a pin code that you could literally walk on it so unless we're outside in the pool it's not going to be open well didn't you want to do like a greenhouse situation so that we can heat it and use it in the winter leslie wants to know what a barn quilt is so leslie if you go on pinterest type in barn quilt there are these big painted quilts that people put up on their barns and there's all kinds of old patterns we actually have farm quilt stencils in our stencil line but they're smaller and i want to make a big one think like four feet by four feet that we put on that big wall there because the addition really does kind of look like a barn so i think in cupola with a weather vane on the front and then a big barn quilt on the side yeah it's got that big gable end in the front well when we designed the house they put a hip roof on the addition to match the and there's still a hip on the back but to match the old house and i didn't know how to explain it i was like listen i don't like that roofline i want one like this and zeb's like you mean a gable i'm like that is what i mean all right here you go here's the last one are you almost done with that one so no sheep yoga probably not oh yeah you just attach that one and i'll do it um on here talking okay i'm not painting as fast that's all right darken your crepit is thin so you can't really fling it or else you'll get it everywhere because it's it will flop like it's like a sealer almost yeah it has a sealer and a stain all in one so you don't want to be flinging that if i was outside i'd paint it faster and i don't care if it's perfect coverage because this is going to get paint over it those legs don't look the same one looks smaller they're all the same yeah they're all the same height could just be the angle in which they are sitting like there's no way for them to not be the same because he's using a copier and it won't allow him to cut them differently yeah it's still a lot of effort to use the copier though he has to stand there the whole time and turn them down they also look different once you put the dark under crop it on they look smaller because they're darker it's an optical illusion sorry mine oh i don't know why you this this one here i mean the angle of the camera something going on but five and three quarters five and three quarters boom i don't know all right is that one almost ready sorry i'm working on it we're gonna flip it over here and then we're gonna make it all come together with paint that's the awesome thing about paint if you've got a bunch of different like salvage type pieces that don't necessarily match you can really bring them together with paint job you can bring anything together with paint people junk home decor it works the same for like mismatched nightstands you paint them the same color and suddenly they're matching yeah we have two antique dressers as nightstands and they're not the same but i painted them the same and they look great together all right so i was thinking i was going to need a bigger dow school screw but these uh inch and a half these quarter inch inch and a half dowel screws are holding these on there nice and tight we're leaving for a few weeks so we're going to have a bunch of extra boys in our house because ty and mariah are going to be here with our kids when we go to round top and then we're taking our kids to california and caitlin will be here with her boys so we'll let you know how the dowel screws uh hold up that's like the true test is this going to be is this coffee table going in the by the fireplace yeah this is in the living room okay it's technically supposed to be the formal living room where you only go to be formal and calm but that doesn't always happen just wipe what's also right where like it's all one big room with the dining room in the kitchen so meal times you know there's a lot of people in here that i'm excited to have a coffee table over there we don't have any coffee tables and i have nowhere to put my feet well when we moved we left at our coffee tables for ty and mariah because they fit that house perfectly and i knew i was going to need different setups so yeah we haven't had them but it takes me a while like i don't always know what i want i think that's i think that's actually the reverse problem you do know what you want and you must have a very hard time finding just the perfect piece well that's probably true and what i want isn't something that you can buy in a store it always has to be like found custom made i'm hoping to find something big and square that opens up for storage when we're in round top because that's what i would like for the family room so we can put blankets in it what color do you want to go on these legs are we going so let's do some salt wash with some pantry door okay and salt wash them and then i will mix up the milk paint the white milk paint to go over the top of it um see how that goes oops i'm missing a whole lot of stuff here okay so jamie likes to put her powder in first and then water i go the other way i do water first and then powder because i find that because i actually measure yeah i don't measure um but i also find that when you do the powder first sometimes you get clumpies on the bottom that you can't stir out yesterday we did it your way and there were clumpies no i know there's if you're not if you're not going to use an immersion blender prepare for clumpies brace yourself but we're putting saltwatch in it so who cares if there's pumping we're adding clumpies intentionally there's an intentional clumpy situation happening all right that's a little thin so normally we'd probably like spray it with lacquer to make it chippy so i don't know what we're going to do here oh it'll probably chip off just fine well if you're mixing it with salt wash it's not going to chip no i mean the white stuff so we'll see what we'll see what we do when we get to that point i don't know i'm just mixing until it feels like the right thickness if you mix up a lot of milk paint you know you can go if you haven't done a lot of milk paint one part milk paint one part water is the correct ratio and it'll mix it up nice and thick and paint really well like that darker decrepit is the bomb if you guys have not seen odelia's room video we used it on a um on a what vanity and one of my tricks guys when we were finishing odelia's vanity we got to the bottom of the dark and decrepit and it was just kind of chunky like what was left over so i mixed in some big top and stirred it all up so it had more sealer in it and that's what i put over the top and it has held up great so pro tip if you want to you can mix this with big top to get a little bit more of a durable finish all right i'm making so far it's working great i'm mixing salt wash in here to thicken this up and give us that good clumpy getting it all over the place all right i'm gonna need a little bit more the problem is you use the cup it has measurements so [Music] i can't i can't i'm finding quite a bit of humor in it we are running low on real paint so we're using snow white milk paint um which is flower sack this is the old fashioned milk paint which is the same as sweet pickens and flower sack would be the color you'd order online if you go in the shop we can't smell sweet pickets because there's another retailer close by but you can buy snow white in old fashion it's the same thing all right just a hair more i'm almost there with my salt wash if you're like jamie and you measure it's probably faster i just go by feel everything's by feel eyeball it you know who needs a measuring tape all right that's nice and thick now we have like three of these left on the website on jrvhome.com so if you've been waiting get your order in i did order more but again we never know how long things are going to take these dosatori measuring cups are bomb i use it all the time for everything i know you never know what's going to be popular all right i may have added too much water see what happens when i don't measure let me see if we have any more white jennifer hat yeah large ottoman works really well especially if you've got rough and tumble kids we don't have any toddlers anymore right now right now you know maybe when harrington or julia started having kids so we're like we're like a few years out from adding toddlers um so hopefully no one like falls and hits any corners it hasn't ever really been an issue at any of i i we've not i've never evaporated yeah we our kids have always just walked around them and used them like uh handrails i'm not the mom that puts like those things on the edges because their kid's going to crack their head yeah i probably should be but all right i'm ready to flip this over or are we going to paint it upside down so here's the situation do you know where any more milk oh you know i'm going to check that out i bet you there's a lot in that other buffet that's in the other room all right we could paint this upside down but i find if i paint things upside down my randomness goes the other way all right let me give you a good view of that from back behind it's not painted let's see let's step back a little bit you guys kind of see what that's going to be once we paint it i feel like it'll be really cohesive [Music] i promise this is no paint not i won't say the word because i don't want to get a flag on youtube but when back in the day before we could get gallons like this this is how gallons arrived from sasha careful not to cut the bag i know that's always an issue because retailers we've always been able to buy gallons but we didn't have them marked for resale all right i need like them okay so this salt wash nice and thick you want it to kind of hang and slowly drop down just like that's like perfect so we used farmhouse finishes on the floor and we had like bags and bags of stuff hanging around the shop i actually think we still have quite a bit because we were gonna do all the floors painted and then we wound up just using white oil x so we did this technique the other day on waste not wednesday within no was it wasted on wednesday what no it was the mirror the tremolo mirror does dark and decrepit work good over a surface that had a sealer on it already um i yes so i just like to if it's super shiny i sand it to take away some of the shine so it appears better just know that the more shiny surface you put it on the more likely it will not wear as well because if you think about it like in this application it's soaking down into the wood right but if you're just putting it on top of something then it's just sitting on top of the finish and so the bond is going to be differently if you guys watched us do our nightstands in our master bedroom i just put it on top although most of the finish was worn off because they were kind of old and i put green sacks over the top to protect them while they're cured we actually just haven't moved the grain sacks off because we eat a lot in bed but you do want to if you're putting it over a surface that's existing sand it a little bit just to give it something to stick to and then you know just give it a good 30 days before you use it and no heavy scrubbing do you want me to carry the salt wash up over onto the edge of this new trim sure yeah let's make this oh and you need to yeah i have a couple nails somebody dude all those i'll get them i saw them yeah just hammer them down put some salt wash over them no okay all right i need more so the salt wash gives you that old like it has 20 layers of paint on it immediately instead of actually having to put 20 layers of paint on look if you guys watched our video that we did on the tremolo mirror that one turned out fun we're trying to do more paint technique videos because that's what people been asking for and now that we're not like building a house full time just just part-time building now part-time you know this saltwatch is actually really filling in the little gaps and cracks pretty well too all right i think i got this good oops i'm trying to be random but i realize i just did these two corners over here so brandon is dr forte i know i'll close my um yeah go ahead and finish doing that i'm going to go get some pliers to get those nails that you're you did not make this uh super thick it's pretty thick if you you it does it gives you a good peak if you pounce it with that brush i'm going to bring it up on the top of the table because you want to kind of make it a cohesive look the tables the old door part is kind of dirty we're going to leave that it adds texture and awesomeness you did not mix this up good there's like powder flying a good thing he's cute so if you're just tuning in and you want to get the products that we're using you can pick them up at jamierayvintage.com including the candlesticks come unfinished there we go we gotta sell lots of candlesticks and cutting boards and rolling pins because zeb's brother moved up here to manufacture the woods line for us so so what jamie's talking about if you guys can't see it there's some nails that went kind of crooked when i nailed them in they must have hit some hard wood in this old door and shot up through the top of this so i'm just twisting the nail off until it's flush and then i'll just get a little hammer down so it's not sharp it only happened to three of them sorry my button's probably in the way yeah i know you guys tell me it looks better when my hair is down but i haven't washed it in like three days so this is what you get well and also there's also the uh the factor of it gets in all the paint yes that is true all right i'm going to start with the heat gun going so normally you know you just like we say you just let this dry if you want but we're going to heat gun it so we can go to the next step and show you on the video do we have more than one heat down here enough no but it's going pretty quick i'm gonna kind of put salt wash where there's holes from your nailing okay like almost like a filler okay nobody got time to fill all these nail holes just hot wash that's the other thing too like we've got a little bit of a gap here between the trim and you can just well like the door is it's not even flat this way like it's a really old door that had a hard life before we ever put it on the wall well and in this case i wanted to look like different pieces of salvage pulled together so i'm okay that there's a gap because i wanted to i want it to look like an old door with chunky salvage legs and trim so we did a coffee table we no longer sell it because that didn't have time to build it it was called the it was called the dabber coffee table we might bring it back once ty gets caught up but it'll be a while yeah we've got a video on how we made it and we used all new wood and made it look like salvage and it was a table kind of designed after one that was done for joanna gaines that she had at her house it was made out of the original table was made out of old porch posts yeah it was made out of salvage and i actually the original maker of that table contacted me i think her name is lorraine duncan hill if i remember correctly she lives in waco and she's like that table turned out awesome like she could tell that we did a good enough job that it was done to mimic that table i think she found us anyways it's just kind of a fun little story it's my like what's like being seven people to star wars like my connection to uh joanna games i think your nephew zach is the only one i know that can actually do that zachary is good at connecting with star wars he would do bit on trivia shows all right because i'm heat gunning this and this is made with milk paint it's getting a little bit of crackle in the salt wash all right i'm just you could probably start mixing up your second are we going to cover all of this with the white did you already mix that up i already did mix it up okay these legs over here are probably pretty close to ready i'll do that first and then i'll move down to the left you actually need to scoot it back because we're going to be dripping onto the floor yeah they're sharing stories and comments about wild times with children somebody said to put a glass so that way you can set up you know a cup down on it this is going in the living room so we will not be setting any pups down on it the rug in there is pretty white so we don't drink in there i need a do you know where the green step stool went up uh usually in there in the pantry so that the kids can get your high treats that you put up there or maybe that's for you a pantry video can you read comments for a second well someone when the lr said a glass top would be best as you will have to be made be careful where you position your wine glass and coffee mug due to the mostly i only drink water and milk and occasionally orange juice so i think it'll be okay yeah let me have that but yeah if you wanted to have like a nice flat surface glass or even like plexi on top would be good it's blowing off some of the cobwebs all right i think the top is good you can keep drying the legs okay i need to come over to this side okay so i did that with a desk we had an old table that we or an old door that we used for a desk and i just put plexi on the top of that and that worked out really well this had dark and decrepit that one is clean over there i'm trying to find a clean brush do you have any idea when the crockery stamps will be back in stock they're out of stock with iod so iod is out so when they get more we'll get more so i don't know caitlyn might know but i don't know that she knows all right careful over that salt wash it's still not 100 dried you're gonna get a fun mix well i just do you need a different brush that brush looks really stiff there you go get that old paint out of it's it i don't really care if i get full coverage i'm just kind of going over this kind of unify the piece gingersnap i have an oath antique hope chest for a coffee table great storage for pillows and blankets that's awesome because that's dual purpose right there yeah i think like a big chest would be good we might do something like that in the family room to hold like blankets and pillows and stuff we have the world so because jamie doesn't have a shortage of blankets and pillows but we do have a shortage of places to store them we uh we have the world's largest sectional it's 15 feet long by 10 feet deep on each side i'm having a white slip cover made for it which you might think is weird but i like it because i can wash it and bleach it and it just fits my style better and uh my the gal that's making my slip cover for me instead of the biggest sectional she's ever slip covered so we're excited for that i'm like sorry we have a lot of people that sit here we have one square of the couch for every person that lives here which maybe some families don't mind like touching each other but my kids are like she's touching me all right i think that's enough heat gun i'm gonna go get another brush so that i can where's the we might have to take them outside because i don't want to sand this in the house oh yeah it'll be okay i'm not standing in the house i'm going to wet distress it but i think it's well we just have to factor in where will the wi-fi reach on the back porch maybe not we've done lines up there we can try it um i'm looking for another brush check the brush drawer guys we're not going for full coverage on these legs here i don't actually if you want to just dry the top while i paint the legs that would probably be yeah because i like to dry it with a heat gun because that especially when you don't have any resist really on there it like helps it crackle and chip okay resist being is in like a shiny sealer or lacquer projects like these are not made to do in an hour but we like to test the uh the water so to speak yeah these legs are cool they're they're essentially designed to be candle pillars big ones that we couldn't find anywhere we actually looked for a long time trying to that's kind of why the wood product line was born because we just want some stuff and to offer things to you guys that you just can't find very many places i mean you could probably find something like this in the that's hand turned or something maybe in a high-end furniture store but doubtful and we're trying to create the look of salvage so if somebody is new to our channel like why does that look all chunky and gross that's because that's what salvage looks like and you think why not just use salvage salvage can actually be pretty darn expensive i did not mix up enough light you need to make some more paint yeah well these these uh legs are raw so they're gonna suck it up yeah look well it does it's not too bad because of the dark and decrepit if they were totally raw yeah so i missed your name on that last question but yes you absolutely can use milk paint over diy paint we've mixed the two quite a bit yeah if you watch our our video we just did the other day we did the diy now here's the thing if you don't have any resist meaning something shiny over the diy paint it's not gonna chip and crackle the way you might want it so definitely check out our videos that show us like spraying lacquer and things because that does help create a resist because essentially if there's like a shine on the piece it makes it so the milk paint has something to not adhere to and it chips we're pretty good at making it do what we want uh chippy wise but you can force it with the heat gun yeah wet distressing heat gun all those things kind of force it to chip but i mean not everybody wants to do that so if you spray lacquer on a piece and then before the lacquer is all the way dry then you can put milk paint over and it will chip or spray paint lacquer i like because then you can use any color of paint you want underneath it and the lacquer is clear so do you want to when we go outside do you want to just hit this with like a orbital i don't know if we can do the legs um yeah let me finish mixing this we might go a little bit over we still have 15 more minutes until yeah the live is officially scheduled to be over but i don't need that much more well we've been doing shorts on monday have you guys liking the shorts they're uh they're just like small compilations this last one was the house build in 60 seconds and it doesn't have every detail in it obviously you know each clip is like just a little bit over a second long so it's hard to get all that we did in a year and a half in 60 seconds but it's a fun video i liked it it was fun it was fun to edit that video an edited video where we actually talk about the house and what went on because there's a lot to happen especially at the end and we just weren't able to film because we were in a time crunch because it's real life and not the the home and garden channel where they do it in 30 minutes or an hour all right i'm gonna move over to this other side yeah it'll probably play more like a uh television show it might be long not that one or we might have to break it through two or three we go outside you're gonna hear our rooster he likes us to know that he's around he's he's an all-day thrower and sometimes in the middle of the night jan says happy birthday jrb so yesterday was the one year anniversary of jrv home which is our online home decor antique found uh website we started it when covid hit because we did not know what was going to happen in the world if stores were gonna open back up or what even when they did it still has been slow um in the shop so we opened the website so we could reach more people and it's been crazy awesome you guys are awesome you've been shopping your little hearts out and we we really appreciate that and i didn't know that it was the one year anniversary until my website app told me it's been one year it's kind of crazy when it started we were insanely busy and i did not caitlin was already doing the other website i was in the middle of like framing the house like i just ordered the wood yeah the lumber for it so katelyn kind of helped me get it started and then i loaded everything up on the website and did all the shopping i did a lot of the shipping while we were figuring things out um and then obviously i have the gals in the shop that we're helping and whatnot but i didn't have a full-time person on it like i do now with christy and uh yeah it was crazy but sometimes you have to do crazy things to stay afloat as a business owner [Applause] i'll give you guys a close-up here in a little bit we'll come flying over here um it's really starting to come together and be pretty cohesive with this paint oh we got a little paint on this one i don't know if i'm gonna wait like why is that flinging everywhere i still don't know if you're gonna if i think if you hit this with an orbital you're just gonna mush all of the salt wash and mix it we're just gonna do it a little bit just trust me just just a little hand sanding we can move it right to the center of the drop cloth i feel like we need the orbitals remember the other day when we tried to do that with uh no and i was right i mean i'm not always right most of the time sometimes depends on the subject matter there's things when it comes to painting and getting it to be chippy you're usually right all right i'm gonna come show you guys close so you can see kind of where we're at in the progress we're gonna do a little flying fair warning oh these are looking good i'll take it off the tripod so i can show you these legs close let's see if i can get it off of here it's stuck pretty good maybe nope it's not worth it here we'll just back her down a little bit there you go you can see that leg pretty good now wet paint and it's okay if there's drips because you guys have you ever seen old stuff it's always trippy if you paint stuff perfectly it's not gonna look old gotta be imperfect you have ocd it's a hard exercise so this is not a huge coffee table it's 22 inches wide and 35 long so that's going to fit our space really well yeah you want to show where it's going well i finished painting this um yeah i mean it's mostly clean there's only a couple candy wrappers over here i told you we don't eat in there but yeah life happens all right so this is where this coffee table is going to live right there on the rug you can see there's a lot and that's stuff i have to finish for the website and i'm like is there ever going to be a time in our life where our work is not living in the living room with us i don't know probably not it doesn't it doesn't look good it's not it's not we thought that we'd never wash paint brushes in here but the slop sink has not been plumbed so i mean it's it's plumbed i just have to actually hook the sink in like the drain and the water's out to it oh yeah but i haven't like put the faucet and actually you know what we need to add that to our list i need to measure it so then when we're at round top i can look for an old faucet we have a big mamma jamma metal sink that's old in our garage that's going to be our schlopsy and i'd like to get a cool fossil for it [Applause] i don't know if i'm gonna get this dry and you just keep adding paint well i keep finding spots that i need to address luckily the build went together pretty fast because yeah it was really easy to build i mean it took me probably five minutes to cut the trim and then uh you know put the dowel screws in nail it on and you're done yeah probably the hardest part to make look old is the uh trim because it's not actual wood it's like mdx you kinda so you had to brush the whole side yeah i'll get back to comments in a minute i got my focus space going on chris just ordered some salt wash can't wait to try it i have a project i started a few years ago nice i have projects like that when i moved i was like hey when did i start that project i don't know you know the salt wash is probably one of the funnest supporting products we have it just makes everything it gives it like that really fun aged texture like it's you know been out in the weather and painted for years and years and years but it's instant like within an hour i guess not instant it takes an hour okay i got all right put the paint brush down okay i'll put the paintbrush down i will pick up comments your phone's way over there ginger says you need two uh two weekends one for each man i know we have two ones here one's at the shop uh zeb designed these legs but they were turned by his brother ty yeah i turn so what we do is i design them up i turn one it's basically the template and then ty is making the rest of them that's why they moved up here so that they could basically manufacturing plant for all the woods products is that a real plant in my crock pot next to my stove that is that's a fiddle fig uh it's a little fig i'll show you while zeb's doing this our grand experiment here so when they bought the fiddle fig it had like little offshoots and so i put them in water because i read that you can make is the garage still clean and tidy no um and it you can see can you guys see it's starting to get roots and then i had one that the roots were pretty good so i planted it so these are the babies to that mama plant and i've never done anything like this before but i read that it's not uh too hard can debt go over the height of the table to the height of the sofa again so you want your coffee table to be about two inches less than the height of your sofa or your chair or whatever you're putting it by um that's just kind of standard it's pleasing to the eye and if you're going to put your legs on it it's easy to prop your legs up on there our most chair height is about 17 to 18 inches um so this sits right at 15 inches high because these are 13 and a half inches and then we have an inch and a half of the old door so it gets us up to that 15 inch height so it's just about perfect for our couches um if you needed it to be higher let's say you have a really high couch or chair you could always add like a little piece of wood here and just do thicker trim to hide that and then you know there you have your your height i'm going to get it i'm going to release i'm going to get this right here okay because you can't get it i was going to move around i got to get the whole leg you were talking i burned it on purpose it wasn't drying you kept putting paint on there i'm going to start sanding with the hand sander all right and see what we get hand sand where it's dry [Applause] [Music] you guys be super careful uh when you're sanding stuff especially old salvage check it you can buy kits to make sure that it's not lead-based paint if it is then you got to do all kinds of stuff that i'm not legally at i can't tell you exactly the process but just test it be safe all right we're going to bring some of that salt wash back through this is 100 grit because we're running low on 220 and i can't this was all used up so it is really hard not to burn it so keep it moving i just noticed that he was starting to slow down with the movement as he was talking i'll try to get you nice and close so you can see the textured yummy i hope i needed more heat gun here what here do these front legs so we can show them what do you need you got a half a gallon of paint on there well the salt wash especially takes a while okay let's move them because there's like a puddle of there we go it was like puddles down on the bottom so what i'm doing with this paper this uh your tools right under here what i'm doing with this sandpaper is i'm just anywhere it looks like it's like a little splotchy i'm just kind of blending it in well and knocking down some of the texture yeah some of the texture is a little tall i'm gonna make it look it doesn't look old or worn so you just knock off the loose stuff and we are getting some chippiness over here from the heat gun again if you were doing this at home you obviously wouldn't be doing this quick holy yeah if you have drips this also fixes the drips or if you burn it with your heat gun also fixes that just come back through and sand it did you get this front leg enough maybe no i'm not promising anything jennifer stewart will we wax over this we're probably going to seal it with big top just because it's an old door lock everything in there oh my gosh but it could get some wax we're not we're not decided on that yet we waxed our other table our coffee table that was it was it in the basement the basement one or the one upstairs no it had well those had stage tops so those guys oh no neither of us are in shot that's okay my hands are in here side of my face is in i have paint all over me i do work at arm's length it's just kind of a habit from being on video all the time so that people can see what we're doing so i don't get i don't belly up to my project very often and get it all over my shirt sometimes but not often i'm short so you guys see this green starting to come back through now and in bits and pieces with the chippy and then you do have some dark that's underneath here too and it will probably let distress it too so that does sometimes enhance the chippy situation i'm just kind of hitting the high spots where it would have some natural weather you can see the salt wash is not quite dry it's getting on my it's getting on my sandpaper here there's some should be oh i guess i can try this you want to bring them in close so they can see where the paint has chipped up yeah i will i can't currently get the base off the tripod before i need to release it won't release well it's fallen over a few times so i've had to do some things to make it sturdy and it's kind of more of a permanent fix rather than a pop to try the camera off the tripod fast fix probably due for a new tripod well i'm pretty sure it was used when we got it yeah i got that down in arizona when we went to the plant bar uh from the habitat for humanity had it did we go to habitat or was it goodwill i don't have that we also went to goodwill i remember going to habitat but i guess we did yeah we went all over me to like four or five thrift stores finding stuff i'm done no more heat gunning for you yeah i have still no paint everywhere successfully did he get on the floor well i mean it's fine good thing it's this floor is already white but it got all over here we don't have uh drawers underneath this island the drawers aren't built yet it's just like a random curtain to hide all the pots and pans so candace we used uh old-fashioned milk paint on these floors and then we sealed them with a floor sealer we have a whole video on it if you look up jamie ray vintage farmhouse floor it'll bring up the whole diy video on how we did it and what we used it held up okay the floor is not level so it has cracked along the edges because the floor is not level so that the boards are always moving which i love the look so and it's been a work zone in here so it's more oh that's good all right so we're live so you have to go around the side door not open sideways open all right i'm going to use this some water to wet distress it a little on the top the back side of his leg wasn't dry all right i'm going to see if i can get the camera off or shorten up the tripod show you guys this close-up the back legs will match this i don't think we're going to be able to put it in place no we're not because it's wet and i don't want that on the rug so we'll you'll have to watch community for a picture of what it looks like but so if you watched from the beginning of the video these were raw wood a little bit of dark and decrepit a little bit of salt wash a little bit of milk paint and now they look like they've been on someone's front porch and we use them as salvage so we'll probably let this dry for a few hours let that salt wash get super super dry and then we might hit it with an orbital just to flatten it in a few areas but you can see you can show them right here it like chipped up the milk paint on the heat gun so we got some loose stuff we'll sand this off and continue working with that off camera but you just kind of keep going until it's right where you want it just stand a little if you get too much sanding done you just add a little more salt wash add a little more milk paint and you could have like if we wanted to we could have done dark and decrepid on the um trim that was that mdf newer looking shiny trim because the more you layer stuff sorry for the crazy angle guys i'm trying to get this back on it there we go yep definitely time for a new tripod and if you're just tuning in these are candlesticks that we turn uh that we sell in our hand turned here by exactly what are you doing with the paint that was perfect sorry there was a light spot that's okay you just work with it i just i put the paint brush down well we're done right the video's done so i'm just you could be here all day i probably will be all right guys go make some coffee tables if you don't have access to the legs on our website if you're in england or europe right now some countries we're not able to ship to but you know you can always find some old salvage old table legs you know cut them down put a door on top of them so um somebody asked if diy paint would do the same thing with just salt wash so here the reason why we use milk paint is because milk paint chips and cracks on its own so you could get a similar look but you're not gonna get the exact look because um diy paint is clay based so it's not made to chip off the way that mill paint is so it's just different type of paint you can with a heat gun get it to crackle um it just doesn't do the same thing and so kind of depends on the look you're going for all right all right guys that's all we've got we've been on for like an hour and five minutes yep be sure to go to jamie rayvintage.com for the paint products candlestick a here um and it would help us out a ton if you guys would share this video it's one of the best things that you can do to help support our channel is to share the video out either on facebook or email however you contact people and be sure to give

people do not to make sure it can handle any abuse you guys throw at it thank you most people can't it is a beast on stairs and the quad truck design adds additional braking while carving down hills thank you we will not be seeing any hills today ambulance is coming it knows that i'm gonna skate the vert ramp allowing you to maintain control on extremely steep hills no i hope you guys enjoy the board as much as my family and i do may the odds be ever in your favor what movie is that from pop quiz um yoda p.s i call the kit trophy trucks as a play on words for the long travel suspension similar to the baja 500 trucks okay aussie dan has just likened jd to a cat when you get in a toy and it plays with the box hit the vert ramp jd [Music] hey you ready yeah move that board oh you want to jump him [Music] he rocked the face [Music] fatherhood ricky had to slow him down okay let's see this thing peep this check this check the suspension look look right there look get a good shot of that you have to have a really big riser he means 360 this way this is like the most concaved board i've ever seen it's like super dip and then a hump in the middle and then super dip again mega ramp board and let's count the plies here for a second one two three four five six seven eight nine plies there's a whole lot going on with this beast lanyards why it needs extra plies gives you the more grip is that why so we're gonna take this down the stairs and according to uzi maybe a little three block that is was that bad maybe the three block was that better he talks a little more emo you know what do you mean maybe the three blocks yeah yeah that's good all right go ahead let it rip yeah he says the board is an absolute unit you know i'm really loving these videos when i'm not risking my life limbs oh no look what put it in a two wheel you need to go slower oh no again we said slower oozy not faster maybe we might need to fix these trucks put some risers on there no right away no he said these are set for stairs get the three get the five get the three block then we'll riser it up no three blocks i mean three stairs get a slow one like d d d d you know we want a slim of the threes there no five star luckily today professional phantom operator darren here somewhere and we're gonna get some epic slow-mo you wanna see this slumbo it's amazing yeah phantom operator that's what he is is that what this is rock crawling rock crawl yeah please every try all right that was epic we need to go to like a 500 stair and just roll down i have one that we can go to in san francisco let's go to san francisco meanwhile in san francisco yeah drop in please do you want me to get some tricks on this yeah yeah that's true yeah i am sponsored by skater i like skate it only goes so much we're gonna do tricks on this who's got a kickflip get these poser boards out of my way it's like the mad max of skateboarding aaron you should take it down the five no uzi come take it down to five oh yeah all three yeah first try i got an idea down to five that i think we gotta do though look at that all terrain yellow off real quick huh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he missed his test uzi do the five stair first like let's take it nice and gentle oh beautiful i mean if you're on there you'll be fine oh i think we might need the risers or if we cut out the part that it's hitting no the risers oozy that one let's get a slow-mo of that i would just can't wait can't wait to see what this looks like down the five yeah i love when uzi says things like i forgot how fast to

this is boss mode skateboarding [Applause] three blocks i don't know if it'll do it it or you [Music] yeah you got that bend those knees mr walker the samurai tee looks dope yeah go slow and don't give it your all go fast and commit go slow and what's the opposite of commit go slow and bail out he was totally fine what happened coming up it's all like heavy parallax run your create some slumbers in this that's what got you man 540 the penny board human bowl and of course gabe is not filming [Applause] you crazy kid these rip stickers these days let's go mr jacuzzi that's even better wow look at this social media guy just got social media oh what what what all right let's make him spin wait this one's sick it's like that way we pass like that moment right between the braille and the people reveal oh that's cool yeah like a snake or centipede or a rover one of those pigs all terrain what the heck should we call this thing uh uh i don't know either so fun little tip about filming like skateboarding when you're doing like a big gap like this but you want to make it look like really really dynamic i use the people as a foreground to kind of make the look a lot faster it's an effect called parallax or stuff that's further away looks like it's moving like slower than stuff that's closer to you so if you want to make a look at the environments like really dynamic put some stuff in the foreground and everything looks way faster in the camera movements that's why i look so crazy in the slow motions because everybody's there and it looks easy and slower all right we're shredding one of these nights meow it's like wow what is this the sun what is the sun i haven't seen the sun in months all terrain all right let's get it [Music] all right that was a hill where do we go now we actually need the bungie i need a pole like pulled me on the rope train dodge this is the sketchiest thing i've ever seen if you fall you fall into like carbonic acid i have a feeling

i'm so happy you're here now let's get to crafting for this dollar tree diy we're going to be using two of those basketball hoop baskets two small stove covers some ring phone holders two metal brackets and some nautical rope and so the first thing i'm gonna do is pull off the handles from my baskets and i'm gonna save those for a future project because i'm sure i could use those and then i'm to take some big wire cutters and pull off those little knobbies at the ends of my baskets so now i'm going to take my sanding sponge and give these a pretty good sanding anytime you paint plastic it's always best to give it a sanding so that it doesn't chip or crack and then i'm going to take my cell phone rings and place those on the top of those and then i'll take them outside and spray them with my krylon matte black spray paint and you'll see a little later on i'm not going to end up using those rings after all but now i'm going to take my sanding sponge and sand down my stove covers kind of the same deal with the metal when you're painting it with chalk paint and then i'm going to take some multi-purpose cement from the dollar tree as well as some hot glue and i'm gonna put those stove covers together and i have this hook from another diy that you'll see a little bit later and then once i get them all put together it doesn't matter how messy i get with my hot glue i'm just going to sandwich that hook in between the two stove covers and then take my hot glue and just gob it on there that'll get covered up later then i'm going to take my white chalk paint and paint my entire piece and this is going to become a pulley so i want it to look like wood and in order to get that wood look i'm going to first paint it white with my chalk paint and then i'll go back with my waverly wax in antique so when i'm trying to get a wood look i'm just going to get the wax on there kind of in thinner layers and then i'll just keep layering on top of it but i'm always going to go in the same direction just like you would see the grain of wood going and then i'll do the same thing on the sides and then on the back and once you get it done you can choose which side looks better and then you can decide which will be the front and which will be the back so now i'm going to take my nautical rope and i'm going to hot glue that to the top part of my pulley and i'm only going to go down to about the 3 o'clock and the 9 o'clock position so that those ropes can just hang and then i'm going to take my brackets that i painted in my waverly chalk paint in ink and i'm going to hot glue that at the parts where it touches which is just the tips and then the two sides where it touches the rope so that's where i'll put my hot glue so in my original design i had planned to make these pendant lights and once i attached my ropes to my baskets i staggered them and it was okay but i didn't love it and i'll show you what it looks like here and so i decided to change it up and i just didn't think they were high-end looking at all so i detached them from the rope and then just decided to unravel that rope and get those three strands i turned the baskets over and then attached them right side up so that they became actual baskets and i think it's way cuter this way there could have been a good way to pull that out but i really wanted to keep this all dollar tree so i just opted for this so to attach my rope i just fed it through one of the holes and then just took some wire twine and wrapped it around there to keep it secure so then i took some poster stickers in the numbers and the letters and then some rub on letters and i'm just going to make the abbreviation for the word number by doing the capital n and then the tiny o with the line under it and i was just going to put 5 for the number of people in my family but it was a little too small so i decided to make it longer and put 54 which is the age i will be this year and here it is all finished and i just added some greenery into the bottom and put some black felt down below so that would lift it up because these aren't the right size but that's okay i think it turned out super cute if you had this in your kitchen you could actually put some fruits in there it really is very sturdy so i love how it turned out and i hope you guys like it too [Music] today's video is in collaboration with my sweetest friend ever nicole at the week's nest and we tried to come up with a diy using that basketball net basket and some rope in at least one project and thankfully my job is now done but not only is she my sister in christ she is super talented and i hope you'll show her some white sparrow love as soon as you're done here and if you're coming from nicole's channel and you like what you see welcome and i hope you'll stay a while and here's a little sneak peek of her projects and i will have that video linked in the description box [Music] below so dollar tree carries two different sizes of these round mirrors and i had gotten 11 of these scarecrow brooms from back in the fall so that would work perfectly for the smaller mirror but because i used the larger mirror i had to kind of adjust because i didn't have enough to go all the way around so the first thing i'm going to do is pull my mirror out and this is kind of a hard plastic so i ended up breaking those little tabs on the back which ended up working out better anyway and then to give myself a kind of a flat area to attach my brooms to i took some tumbling tower blocks and just hot glued those inside that opening on the back part of my frame and then i took some scissors and started cutting my brooms apart and then i flattened them out and added hot glue and then attached them to the back of the frame and i just did that all the way around as far as i could go and then once i ran out i just took the handles and cut the jute twine off of them spread them out and just kind of layered them it was going to end up being a little bit smaller than i originally wanted but if you get the right number of brooms you can do it all the way around and it'll be nice and big and for the little gaps where a jingle block wouldn't fit i just took a popsicle stick and cut it down and then hot glued that onto the jenga pieces so that it would be flat all the way across [Music] so then to get it even all the way around i just gave it a haircut and just used my scissors and this was so messy when i was doing this but anyway i got it all even and then i took some hot glue and just to give it some more security i just gobbed it on all along the back side and then i'm going to take it out to spray paint it so first i masked it off with some painters tape and just went around the edges and then covered it up with some paper and got it all nice and covered and then went out to my painting station and i first painted the back side just in case there was anything that would show through from the front so i'm using my krylon flat white spray paint and then once i got the back side painted i turned it over and hung it up and painted the whole thing white and then once it was dry i'm going to take it back inside and we'll do a little tape reveal and then using some more of that nautical rope i'm just going to hot glue that all the way around the outside of my frame and then i'll replace the mirror and it's all done now you don't have to paint yours white it's totally personal preference but this had a little bit of green in it so i decided to just go ahead and go with the white and it's also going to match the rest of our vignette [Music] and here it is all finished and i love how this turned out i can't wait for you to see it with everything else even after cutting it down it's still two feet across so it's huge and the ones that are kind of like this online are anywhere from eighty to over a hundred dollars but i really love how this turned out and i hope you guys like it too [Music] for our next diy i'm going to be using two plunger handles a square sign and then two of these super cutie patootie little frames that are in the gold color so the first thing i did was took the tags off of my plunger handles and i just used my heat tool to get those off super easily but then the little heart was being kind of stubborn and took off some of that top wood on my sign i tried sanding it out but it never came completely smooth so i'll fix that in a second so then i'm gonna also sand the sides so that none of those hearts stick out once i paint it so to fix the top i'm just gonna use a square plank from the dollar tree and it fit perfectly on top and even gave it a cute little lip so that worked out great now i'm going to take a drill and just put two holes on the sides and i went kind of towards the top because i'm going to be placing my plunger handles on each side and secure it with some jute twine so i want it to be as high as it can so that it has a better hold that'll make much more sense in just a second so now i'm just going to paint everything with my waverly chalk paint in ink and i'm going to give everything two coats just to make sure nothing's peeking out and then once everything's dry i'm going to take some jute twine and wrap the very bottoms of my plunger handles where the threads are and then that'll give my other jute twine something to hold onto when i feed it through the bottom of my base so to attach my plungers to each side of my base i just took a shorter piece of jute twine and fed it through that hole to make a loop and then i'll place my plunger inside of it and then pull it really tight and then i'll make a knot in there and then add some hot glue to keep it in place this would have been easier if i had a second set of hands but i didn't so i just had to make do [Music] so this is how these adorable frames sit but i decided to pull up that stand and that's going to be our hanger instead from the top and then i'm going to measure on the side of my plunger handles to see where i need to make those holes and since you guys know to do as i say and not as i do these holes should have been drilled before i put this piece together and really what had happened is my engineering skills had escaped me and i had forgotten that i needed something to keep these dowels apart so i had to add those in and then i'm going to paint those black and then i'll hang my frames from each of those dowels [Music] and here it is all finished and i think this is so pretty and i just printed out some words and stuck it in between the two glasses i have a little bit of a wonkiness situation because i didn't drill on a flat surface but you can learn from my mistakes and make yours perfectly straight but i love how this turned out and i hope you like it too [Music] so i thought i would throw this little thrift flip into this video that's still so hard to say but i found this at the goodwill for three dollars and i wasn't in love with the silver color but i loved how original and interesting it was so i thought it would go perfectly with our modern farmhouse decor i guess you could almost say this is scandinavian too but anyway i don't know my styles so i just took it outside and painted it completely black using my matte black spray paint and then i took some dollar tree cork sheet and just replaced the bottom and then in another thrifting trip i found some super skinny candles that i thought were so pretty and i picked those up and it happened to be that they worked perfectly for this and as i always say it's not hoarding if you use it [Music] for our next dollar tree diy i've got a plastic bowl a candle holder and a vase and then i have a thrifted vase that's a little bit larger for two dollars from the goodwill and so you can get these you know if you've gotten flowers or something from somebody i've been dying to try this paint effect and this is the perfect time to use your old chalk paint that's all dried up and crusty at the bottom of the bottle so i just took some black chalk paint and put it into a bowl and then i went outside and got some dirt and i'm just going to add a little bit to that originally i had spray painted my items with my black matte spray paint but it started to rain again so i had to finish it up with my chalk paint and i think it turns out even better i wanted to give it some texture on this glass because it was really flat so i thought adding the dirt would make that nice and textured and give it some touchy goodness and then after i get the vases painted i'm going to take some more of that dirt and rub it on there to give it that old pottery weathered look and i think it turns out so pretty i didn't use the dirt mixture on my bowl because it was already textured enough but i did add some more chalk paint because it didn't get completely spray painted before the reins came and then i'm going to do the same thing on the candle holder because that's going to be the base of our bowl so this was the super fun part and i left some of that paint still wet so that when i rub the dirt in it would have a different dimension and just give it all kinds of layers and just added interest and i think this turns out so pretty i've seen a lot of diyers do this in different ways with the spray paint and they all turn out so pretty so pretty much this is the perfect project that you cannot mess up [Music] so for the bowl because i had part of it painted in chalk paint and part in the spray paint you could see my lines so i did have to go back and give it some more chalk paint so that those lines would go away and then i did the same thing on the candle holder to give them the same finish and then i'm going to take some multi-purpose cement and my hot glue and attach my candle holder to the bottom of my bowl and then i still had some more paint left over with the dirt in it so i just found this frosted candle holder from the dollar tree and just added it to the bottom of that and then i couldn't stop myself i had to do some white also so i just added some more dirt into some white chalk paint and then added that towards the top and then my paintbrush kind of dragged through the black and made it a pretty gray so i just blended that in and oh it's so pretty [Music] and here's the vases all done and i love how these turned out so much i have some pompous grass that is actually my daughter's and then some dollar tree succulents and some walmart eucalyptus and i just popped those right in there now i'm no lone fox or xo mckenna or justin ray but i think these really turned out so so pretty it's a totally different look that i'm used to doing but as soon as my daughter saw it all she wants everything but i love how it turned out and i hope you like it too [Music] for our next dollar tree diy i'm going to be using three of these boards some cables and then some beads these are from walmart at christmas time and i didn't have to paint them so that's why i'm using these so the first thing i'm going to do is cut one of my boards in half and these are 18 inches long so i cut it down to 9 inches and i'm just using my miter saw outside and i'll give that a whack and then since i didn't get a perfect cut i'm going to take both of them and stack them on top of each other and cut them at the same time so that they're exactly the same length so i'm going to be using some screws from the dollar tree to put this together and some multi-purpose cement and this is kind of replacing the e6000 it's not as messy and it sticks just as well i sure could have used a second set of hands and what do you know sweet michael j happens to walk by my hero and look how cute his hands are so i'm just going to attach them using the longest ones at the top and the bottom so the smaller ones will go in between and because i'm going to be painting this piece black i didn't sand any of my wood but i did make sure to put the letters on the inside just in case it peeks through that black paint i'm also not going to be distressing it this time around i know shocker but because we're doing the modern farmhouse i thought i would just leave it solid but if you wanted to distress it you should sand it first so that when you do distress it that pretty brown wood will show through so now i'm gonna drill some holes along the side and i went every inch and a half after i got the middle hole so i'll have a total of five holes on each side and then i'll sand those holes down and then i'll paint it completely black [Music] do [Music] so this cabling is where i got the hook for our pulley in our first diy but this cable was no joke and it became more trouble than it was really worth i had to end up getting michael j to help me to connect the two pieces because one package wasn't enough for this project so if you were to do this i would recommend that you either use twine or string or something just not this it was alien space technology and it was super hard to cut and work with so again learn from my mistakes it still looks so pretty though anyway now i'm going to take those walmart beads and cut them apart and then i'll start stringing them through what's going to become our rosary abacus of course you don't have to make yours a rosary but when i was researching what an abacus looked like online they were separated in groups of ten for the most part so i just added some hail mary's at the end but you can do this in whatever colors or beads you want you could use the amazon beads or the dollar tree beads i was just not really excited about painting beads in this quantity and a sweet viewer had recommended getting the beaded garland at walmart during christmas and i think these were like four or five dollars for this entire string of beads so that was a really good deal and you don't have to paint them and then once i got to the end i just fed a final bead on there and then fed it back through that hole and then i wasn't about cutting it again so i just fed it up through the hole above it and here it is all finished and oh my goodness i love this so so much i added a wooden cross from the dollar tree to that hook and i don't know why it looks so dirty it's not dirty in real life i went back and looked to see and i don't know why it just shows on camera but anyway i absolutely love how this turned out and i hope you guys like it too i hope you enjoyed all of these projects and if you did don't forget to give them a thumbs up comment let me know what you think don't forget to hit that subscribe

budget now in today's home dupes video we're going to be focusing on dining room [Music] chairs so the first chair by the way i'm looking at my computer so i can see what's going on and that is the holland chair from west elm now it is 2.99 and of course prices and stock can vary by date oftentimes there are sales so you can get these even cheaper but for this chair you're getting solid wood dark mineral finish and it is sort of this woven seat material on amazon for 279 you can get two chairs for that is an amazing deal now these ones right here that's the paper rope weave seats and you're getting solid beach wood honestly they're very similar to the other ones i think this is like a no-brainer the next chair is also from west elm and that is the modern upholstered chair it is 559 now for this chair you're getting solid wood walnut frame and i believe it is a black velvet fabric now you can get similar chair on wayfair for 267 for two chairs that's incredible they're very

this and i use this as an office chair and these are the faith dining room chairs they're basically the wishbone chairs this specific one is the stained beechwood in black and it has that natural brush sheet now these ones from amazon are black metal frames so you're not getting the solid wood um and the seat is the natural paper twine i think for 155 i think that's a really good deal but that metal is something to keep in mind the next chair is from west elm these chairs are really nice the petal upholsterers are 309 each and in this specific one you're getting the antique bronze metal legs stone white linen seat and back you can get a similar dupe at amazon for 180 dollars for four chairs that's a whole table right there these wasps and chairs are the black metal legs they have a linen blend upholstery honestly i think these are pretty comparable let me know down below which one you think is nicer this next chair is from rh we've seen this everywhere the beloved ellison track chair this one is a skirted and of course prices can vary depending on fabric and if you get the caster option and things like that but this base price is 592 for the member price members i think they pay a hundred dollars per year um this one is the higher resiliency foam seat hardwood frame and of course has the caster option this one from world market is called the atlanta linen armchair 230 wood frame linen fabric and the metal casters are included so that means you can easily push these chairs in and out with those metal legs on them now this next chair is from west elm and i feel like i've seen this everywhere but this specific one is called the slope leather chairs now it's 758 for the set you're getting real leather um they're not saddle leather finish i believe and you're getting a charcoal metal leg pretty cool chairs i feel like these are very versatile on amazon you can get a set similar to this for a hundred and sixty nine dollars now with the amazon one you are getting faux leather in a whiskey brown finish and you're getting black metal legs something to think about but overall i think pretty good now this next chair i love this chair it's beautiful but it's been replicated so many times it comes from the bauhaus era and this specific one is called the no seska armless chair now you're getting hardwood beach plus cane for the backing um black seat fabric and a steel frame i really like this detail of how it's like candy levered really beautiful on amazon you can find two chairs for 236 dollars i think this is a really great deal now these chairs on amazon called the adole finch chairs 236 for the set really great deal for the backing you're getting elm wood plus pretend and the seat fabric is olive velvet beautiful i think that all of it is a really nice color honestly and of course the steel frame the next chair is from mcginco and we love mcgee and co around here and this one is called the kate chair and it's 634 dollars beautiful honey brown rattan chair and has the black metal legs i think overall this chair is just beautiful i'm not 100 sure if it's safe for outdoors but indoors perfect on target you can find a kind of similar chair this one has a bit of a different detail for the seat but for 120 i think that's a pretty good deal this lynette chair from target is 120 dollars you're getting the rattance letter design powder coated metal legs in black very minimal i can definitely see this in like in a boho dining room another chair from meginko is the emerson chair for 645 it's a beautiful chair it has a black stained mahogany and really simple silhouette i feel like this is a timeless piece we're seeing it everywhere kind of more farmhouse style for 180 you can buy two chairs from target now these chairs are a little bit more traditional in my opinion um these hassle chairs you get the hardwood black armless very similar i think these are really great now this next chair is beautiful mid-century's chair that we've seen everywhere for the last probably a couple of years it's a timeless chair the annette came chair from crane barrel is 699 mid-century international style it has a black finish oak frame and a natural tone for the fabric and of course the cane backing from anthropology you can find a similar chair for 398 dollars i kind of like the anthropology chair better myself because of the seat it doesn't have the fabric but you're getting reclaimed acacia wood mortise and tenon joinery and overall just a timeless chair beautiful um not bad for 3.98 now this next chair is from lulu and georgia i think this eat a chair is beautiful it's 5.99 but you're getting teak wood and sort of this mid-century inspired vibe i feel like this can go with a lot of design styles now this chip from wayfair is called the moose and chair it's 290 for a set so you're getting two i feel like with a lot of these um cheaper ones they're like sold in sets and you get more for less money which is i think it's a really great deal now for this one you're getting a combination of solid and manufactured wood um it comes in three finishes it comes in a cocoa which is shown here there's a natural finish and i believe there's a black finish as well and this one has like more of like a wishbone inspired chair so it's a little bit i feel like in my opinion more modern than the other one if i had to choose i think i would probably get the other one i feel like the other one just feels a little bit more natural and smooth and i don't know there's something about the other one but i still think this one is a pretty good comp last but not least we're back at mcginco and we have the rhine chair this chair is 400 we have polyester fabric and solid oak legs i think it's a really nice chair can work with a lot of different styles uh kind of gives me mid-century vibes um contemporary and things like that now this chair from target is called the kingston chair it's 85 polyester fabric i believe it's a plywood uh frame not 100 sure on that i couldn't find information but nonetheless beautiful um and honestly like a fraction of that price you can buy like three or four of these chairs all right so that was today's video i want to thank you so much for watching let me know down in the comments below which one was your favorite also if you have other furniture pieces or decor items that you want me to focus on let me know i want to thank you so much for watching and i will catch y'all next time [Music] bye you", "GNqYWkiBHHw": "\u266a (ONE, TWO,

tips and tools for creating beautiful home decor on a budget so if you like home decor budget videos i hope you'll consider sticking around by hitting that subscribe button today i have 12 spring decor diys that you can make in five minutes or less here we go [Music] the first six projects i'm going to show you are great for a spring tiered tray but can be made on a larger scale this is using tumbling tower blocks craft sticks the jute carrots and some moss so the first thing i'm doing is i'm taking 16 of the tumbling tower blocks and i am gluing them together with my wood glue in sets of four so we're going to do that and then once those dry we will take two of the sets and glue them together side by side this is going to be the bottom of our little wooden crate that we're making and then the other two sets are going to be the ends of our crate so here i'm gluing on the left end and then we'll glue on the right end then to make the slats of our crate on the sides i'm taking these large craft sticks they're not the jumbo but they're bigger than regular sized craft sticks and i'm going to cut off the rounded end and then measure where the other side needs to be cut and i'm going to make four of these of this same length now i'm going to take my antique wax i wanted to give this whole crate a dark stained wood look so i love using this because it does not smell at all like regular stain and it cleans up really easily so wipe it on or brush it on and then wipe off the excess and you have a gorgeous dark wood stained look so we're going to also do that on the four craft sticks on both sides of the craft sticks as well once everything is dry we will finish assembling our little crate by just hot gluing the pieces of the craft sticks on so like i said this is for a tiered tray but you could do this on a larger scale maybe instead of craft sticks using paint sticks to make a larger crate maybe we'll do that in a future video so here's our cute little wooden crate and all i'm gonna do now is add some of this excelsior grass and the four twine carrots from dollar tree just setting there in the grass and then with our little chalkboard clip we're going to just um make a little sign but first i got to show you guys this little ladybug vacuum i've had this for a while and i never show it in my videos but it's awesome for cleaning up things especially like that so here on the little clip chalkboard i'm just gonna write bunny food five cents with my paint marker and then once that's dry clip it to the side of our crate and here is our first tiered tray diy all finished this next project is seriously so easy i'm using the lid from a coffee container some of the spanish moss and these foam eggs mine are from dollar general but i know they have them at dollar tree as well all i'm doing here is pulling out a chunk of the spanish moss and then with my hands i'm just forming it into the shape of a bird's nest and i'm using the coffee lid just to help me give it a base and keep it kind of contained so putting a bunch of hot glue down there then i'm going to set the moss there and continued to form it and then i decided to pull three of the white foam eggs out of the bag gently hot glue those together just so they don't all fall out a little bit of hot glue on the bottom and this tiered tray diy is complete and again i have to show off the little ladybug again because it does a great job of cleaning up little tiny pieces of craft supplies so here is our little bird's nest for your tiered tray our third project is using more tumbling tower blocks some of the green moss and this wood happy easter bunny sign from dollar tree now this is from last year i did not see these this year at my dollar trees anyway but if you don't have this you could easily google search a bunny outline image print it out trace it onto something thick like maybe a recycled cereal box or something like that now i'm also making a stand for this project again using tumbling tower blocks i'm using four this time gluing pairs together end to end and then once those are dry we will attach them to our finished project now all i'm doing here is i'm just using some hot glue and then i'm going to be gluing on some of this green moss this is a very simple project that just gives kind of an earthy and natural look to some of your spring decor i love that you can flip it over and use the outline of the image to trim away the excess and then you actually do see the bunny shape with the moss now that my pairs of tumbling tower blocks are dry i'm going to hot glue those to the front and back of the base of my bunny add a little more moss there at the bottom and then this project is going to be ready to go and i love that it can stand up on its own in our tiered tray i did decide to add one of our little foam eggs to the project just at the bottom there just to bring in a little bit more color feel free to choose whichever color you like and i love our little moss covered bunny our next tear tray project again tumbling tower blocks some foam eggs some blue and yellow chalk paint and some sticker letters so what i'm doing here is i'm creating a base now using eight tumbling tower blocks gluing them together in pairs four pairs and we'll let those dry while we work on our eggs [Music] now these are blank foam eggs that i got at my local dollar store but you could definitely use the ones that dollar tree has i put them on skewers just so that they're easier to paint and i'm going to use pool blue and the maize yellow i'm going to paint three of them with the light blue and then the other three with the yellow [Music] now coming back to our blocks i'm going to glue the pairs together to make a little base or platform for the eggs that we're going to glue them to once we're done making them sometimes with these tumbling tower blocks you just have to kind of turn them around and see how they best fit together but then just let those eight blocks dry now that our eggs are dry i'm using some of these sticker letters that i've had forever since i was a creative memories consultant and i'm going to spell the word spring if i would have had enough i would have on the back side spelled easter so that this could have been a two-sided project go ahead and put a layer of mod podge over your sticker letters just to make sure they don't peel off then starting with our middle two eggs we're just going to put a dot of hot glue at the bottom and start gluing our eggs to the base that we made out of tumbling tower [Music] blocks you could definitely leave it like this but i decided to fill in some of that blank space and cover up some of the hot glue with a little bit more of this green moss i love this stuff it just screams spring and then just trim away the excess and here's another tiered tray decor you could make this larger as a home decor as well our next tear tray project i'm using one of these wood crates some smaller sticker letters three colors of chalk paint and some ribbon we are going to use this crate to make a mini book stack so book stacks are very popular and you can make a small one using one of these wood crates so using some painters tape to block off where i want to paint i'm making my bottom book be this light blue color called pool then using some tape again we will tape off the top and bottom so that we can just paint the middle section with our yellow chalk paint called maze for our middle book and then once that's dry we will tape off just leaving the top section so that we can paint our third and top book using the light green color called celery now once our books are all dry we're going to use a black sharpie marker and a ruler to mark off the edges that separate our three books in our stack and on the front and back there's kind of a grooves just kind of run your marker or whatever you have in the groove just to make that black line then using these small black sticker letters and starting on the right we're going to make the words plant grow and bloom there are so many different ways you can do book stacks different words you can put on them but i thought this was really great for spring now i thought it looked a little too perfect so i'm going to take my white chalk paint and just a little bit distress the edges and the sides and then i'm also going to kind of pinch the bristles together to get right in that space between the books and just give this a little bit more distressed of a look and then taking some jute twine we're going to tie a knot there at the bottom we're going to wrap the jute twine a few times and then be ready to finish up this super cute fake book stack for our spring tiered tray and i decided just to take a little piece of white grosgrain ribbon and double knot a little piece here and cut it off just for a little bit more of a decorative touch to our book stack and here it is our finished project what would you put for spring book stack our next and last tiered tray project i'm again using tumbling tower blocks you can see i'm going to glue them together in the sets i have shown we'll also use some white chalk paint and some florals so here i'm gluing together a set of five this is going to be the front of our little mini flower stand that we're making then the four will be the base of the stand each of the sets of three will be the sides and then the eight there together will be the back of the stand so that it's a little bit taller so once those sets of four are dry we'll glue them together in eight and then we'll start assembling our blo our box i'm so glad you guys are here i hope you will also follow me on facebook and instagram and also if you enjoy budget home decor diys please make sure to give this video a big thumbs up all right so we're almost done assembling our mini flower stand here you can see i did add two more um single blocks there to the top this is going to help hold our little sign that we're going to make but first i'm just dry brushing white all over our flower stand now using this larger chalkboard clothes pin i'm going around the design with my white paint marker just to make it stand out more and then just writing flowers 25 cents we will then hot glue this at the top there to be the little sign for our flower stand next we'll cut a small little piece of floral foam to hot glue inside our market flower market stand and put a little bit of moss there and then i'm taking some of these lilac bushes a couple of the dark purple a couple of the white and a couple of the light purple and just poking those into the floral foam and this is so super cute i absolutely love this and it's so cute and mini for your tiered tray the last thing i am going to add to it is i'm going to go around one time with the black and white gingham ribbon and then a jute bow here's one more look at the six diys we've done so far these are great mini versions of tiered tray decor that would be so fun and easy to make with few supplies and very quick to make each of them were about five minutes or less moving on to our other six diys these are again like i said five minute or less spring diys using one of these wood charger plates a page or image from a calendar and some mod podge i'm also going to use some nautical rope and some greenery so here i'm just trying to figure out how big i need to cut out this image and then i decided just to roughly cut around the greenery wreath there on the image and then once we place it down here we can kind of with our uh thumb kind of score it and then cut it closer to where it needs to be and now that we have it the right size we're going to go ahead and put a layer of mod podge on our charger plate and spritz a little bit of water on our image and then lay that down on the center of our plate here this is something you can do with any of the charger plates from dollar tree as well as the pizza pans now i'm going to take some nautical rope and i'm going to go around that edge between where the plate dips down and my cut image and i felt like i cut away so much of the greenery in the calendar image that i really wanted to add some in and give a three-dimensional look to the project so i had some of this greenery that was very similar to the image and i took little pieces and i'm just going to one at a time hot glue them around the circumference of the nautical rope just to fill it in and just keep going until i feel like it's as full as i want it and here's what our finished project looks like i love to know what you guys think of this i just think it's so simple and farmhouse and is really an easy project to do and i think these would make great gifts as well our next diy is using one of the circular mirrors from dollar tree i'm using some black and white gingham scrapbook paper a white foam board and this bunny that was from a garland that i used in an earlier diy now my mirror broke so i'm having to create a back for my mirror well the frame anyway so i'm using a piece of foam board from dollar tree you saw me just trace around the frame you'll also notice that my frame is not pure black anymore i had distressed it with some white chalk paint for a previous diy so that's why it looks like it does now you could use scrapbook paper on this contact paper i decided just to dry brush some of my mineral chalk paint to continue to go with kind of the neutral color scheme of this project with the black and white gingham and while that's drying i'm going to trace this felt bunny on the back of the black and white gingham scrapbook paper this was one of eight bunnies that came in this garland i used four on a previous project so i decided to use this one as a template then we'll go ahead and cut out the bunny and because it is so thin and i need it to be a little thicker i'm going to use some mod podge and glue it to this thin piece of cardboard that came in some packaging so this will make it a little more sturdy and we'll just let that dry and then we will cut it out as well taking a sharpie i'm just going around the edges of my bunny just to make it stand out a little bit more from the background and we're going to take that pom pom tail from the teal colored one and add that to our black and white gingham bunny now i am taking my uh background that i made for my mirror frame here and i'm just going to hot glue it to my frame so that we can finish up this project and now we're taking our bunny that's on the cardboard and we're just gluing it at a few little spots to the frame so it is going to stand out it's kind of more of a three-dimensional project and then is our finished project you can hang a hanger on here if you'd like um i didn't like how you could see that foam board so i did decide to take this dollar tree gingham ribbon and i'm going to wrap it all the way around my frame just to give it more of a finished look and here's our black and white gingham bunny what do you guys think this is again another project that is super simple anybody can make it and it looks super cute and farmhouse our next project is using three of these pots from dollar tree i have two saucers i got at walmart you could use the glass circular candle dishes if you'd like or the little round trinket trays but i decided to use some saucers now i'm going to paint all three of my pots with the light green color called celery and then just let that dry we're just doing one coat on each of the pots my saucers i'm going to do with one coat of our white chalk paint and then once that's all dry we will start assembling our candlesticks i'm going to use e6000 and first i'm going to take some around the bottom of this pot and then i'm going to glue another pot there as well just to make this candle stick a little bit taller than the other one now this one is just going to be glued upside down on the bottom of the saucer to make our shorter of the two candlesticks and once the two pots are dried together we'll go ahead and glue the other saucer on the top of this taller candlestick to give our candlesticks more of a farmhouse look we're going to dry brush some truffle is a dark brown chalk paint all around our candlesticks and also on the saucers themselves again just to give them more of a rustic look i did take now this is not jute twine this is nautical rope unraveled so this is one of the three strands of the nautical rope so it's a little bit thicker than the jute twine but not as thick as a full piece of the nautical rope so i'm gluing that around where the saucer and the pot meet and then also around that lip or that raised edge of the pot [Music] for a finishing touch i decided just to add a small black and white gingham bow to the center of the tall candlestick and at the base of the shorter one then i'm just taking some moss and putting a little bit of a layer of it and then any glass that you have any glass jar or votive you can put on top i added a little bit of pebbles and just a battery powered tea light there are so many different ways you can make these candlesticks and i just thought this set was super fun for spring and using items that you can find at the dollar tree [Music] so for our next project i'm using a paddle cutting board from dollar tree and some free printables from online now i find wood cutting boards all the time at thrift stores but i wanted to show you how you could do this using dollar tree supplies so these cutting boards are a great size but they are plastic so sometimes the paint does not want to stick i go ahead and do just a thin layer of matte finish mod podge on top first and let that dry before we start painting our cutting board [Music] now i wanted to try to make this look like a wood cutting board so i'm using this caramel colored chalk paint by waverly it's actually called hazelnut and i'm giving it a base coat a pretty solid base coat here of this color and then we'll let that dry completely before we continue on once that is dry i am going to take that truffle again and very lightly dry brush this on just to try and make this look like it has a wood grain effect and then let that dry as well and then i did give it a quick spray with a clear matte spray now here's the front back is still white if you search free spring printables online you will find so many i thought this one was so cheerful and cute i just um printed it so it would fit the size of the cutting board there trim around it with my trimmer and then we're just going to apply a thin layer of mod podge and smooth it down on the front of the cutting board getting out as as many air bubbles as we can and here it is completely dry you can see i added just a simple burlap bow at the top and wrapped it with red to bring out the red in the image i will go ahead and link this image in the description box below my next project is very simple again using one of these easter tag signs another wood crate some floral foam and some greenery this is just a very simple planter you can make using one of these tall tag signs we're just going to flip it over and paint the tag sign and the crate with our white chalk paint it's okay if you don't paint it solidly you can leave a little bit of the brown showing that just adds more of the farmhouse effect to the project you guessed it we're gonna dry brush some of our truffle chalk paint to again make our project look worn and rustic for our farmhouse decor this is just such a simple thing you can do just to really add a lot of dimension and character to any project that you make if you feel like you got too much of the brown you can just go ahead and sand it lightly with the sanding sponge and it blends it in beautifully and then go ahead and dry brush your crate as well and now with a combination of wood glue and hot glue we're going to just glue this crate at the bottom of the tag sign and this will allow it to stand up on a shelf or a table so this is kind of a bigger version of the flower stand we made for our tiered tray we're just going to put some floral foam here in the crate and then cover that up with a little bit of the moss for this one i just decided to use some eucalyptus greenery i believe this is from walmart maybe hobby lobby but just poking it in arranging a few pieces in here and it's super simple and fun to do and looks so great using some of the black and white wired gingham ribbon from dollar tree i made a simple bow that i hot glued right over that hole that the hanging string was on and then i'm just wrapping some jute twine around my hand and then tying it in the middle just to make a cute little jute bow as well to glue on top to add dimension and a little bit more texture so this is a very neutral version of this you could always add whatever colors you want to match your decor but i just think this is so sweet and again would make a great gift now this last diy is so simple that it's almost hard to call it a diy but i have always wanted to try wrapping eggs with different types of materials so i have this set these are a little bit larger plastic eggs and i'm going to wrap them with some of this mop head string and then the microfiber and also i was going to do nautical rope but it was way too thick um the first thing you need to do though unless you want those colors to come through is to just give your eggs a little coat of white chalk paint and then with lots of patience just start with a little dab of hot glue and then you're just going to go around until you get all the way to the bottom of your egg i really like this microfiber mop head it's very soft and i just love the gray and white together and here's the one using the regular mop head strings now the microfiber is one continuous piece these are different lengths so once you finish one you will have to start another piece and just put them right up next to each other so what other dollar tree items do you think would be good to wrap around easter eggs i would really love to know what you guys think here i'm using these two different types of mop heads and then the third one i am going to end up using some dollar tree ribbon for the third one so this farmhouse ribbon here i kind of measured out six lengths going all the way around and i'm going to hot glue them kind of um around i don't know start at the top go around the bottom and i hot glued it there at the bottom and then we're going to use six pieces all together to completely wrap the egg so i needed something to put my eggs in and i had this wood bowl it was very shiny so i decided to mute it down a little bit using some mineral chalk paint and then once it was dry i did sand most of it away just so it looked really old and worn added some spanish moss and our three eggs that we covered using dollar tree textiles so thanks again so much for joining me today you guys i really hope you enjoyed

of your upper arm hamstring curls right here [Music] a couple more singles now get ready double two more march it out [Music] shift it lift those heels wake up those ankles maybe add a bigger stretches telling your body it's time to activate marching left standing so tall as you get warm pump your arms more pick those feet up just a little more left forward and back like i want to go there no i don't or i'm going out of the house whoops i forgot something back in however you'd like to think about it add the arms reach and pull reach pull strong arms really important to wake up our bodies before we hit those intervals march it step it out hamstring curls push down [Music] a few more get ready double think one and two last two march left shift it out how are you feeling warm ready to go take a big breath into that belly and then exhale two more big breath in exhale one more march it right okay we're gonna start off with just 30 second intervals meaning you're gonna raise that intensity for 30 seconds and then we're going to bring it back down right here in this march okay i've got my trusty timer all you're going to do is lift your knees higher lift don't worry about the music get going you've got 30 seconds low impact but very very strong stand tall you're alternating those knee lifts letting go of that music maybe even going a tiny bit faster we got four three two and one easy march bring it on damn you gotta do that two more times chill it out for about ten more seconds and we're gonna go for round two make sure you allow yourself to come down a bit are you ready let's go lift chest is tall belly's in come on working at lifting those legs punching your arms maintaining that wonderful posture keep going we have 10 seconds candy top remember you should be able to say a few words four three two and one easy march here's the good news one more that's it just one more i know you've got this intervals feel like a roller coaster we go up and we come back down we've got five seconds and we're getting back in on your market set high knees 30 seconds focus 30 seconds you felt it you know it now halfway can you lift that chest a bit more five four three two and one step it together all right chill it out yes we have another interval coming now we just went to the front you may feel your legs a little bit right from lifting up with that power we're gonna do the same kind of drill but it's gonna be with those hamstring curls watch option one is going to be pressing down option two is going to be reaching up hold on we're going to get going in five seconds again it's just 30 seconds strong hamstrings go down up and again you can pick it up a little bit if you'd like or even slow it down make it bigger both ways add intensity feel that breath increase keep going whoo reaching it up 30 second intervals halfway finishing in five four three two and one step it bring it on down 30 seconds down and we're gonna go up two more times [Music] notice that breath and hopefully you're feeling a little push right and that push up helps raise our foundational cardiovascular level get ready 30 seconds go everything is strong focus on in [Music] keep breathing man things are heating up out here my backyard in arizona we've got five seconds four three two and chill just one more so we're going to move on 20 second rest okay you've got one more in you i know it these small ones are tough get ready we are going in four three two last set hamstring 30 seconds come on just working it out keep it moving over halfway working it four three two and one jump rope okay 30 second intervals are done we're gonna be moving on march it on your left let's build into our next pattern set our next intervals one minute a little more complex [Music] let's build it two steps together and march step it march step march step and march now step it calf raise step step lift step step heels up making that basket two more now when we hit the minute interval if you want you'll be taking these step togethers lower and then getting higher on the basketball just march okay we're gonna have one minute and again you can pick it up a little bit don't worry about the beat of the music worry about control and finding your interval get going two and one go chester's up blow it up high oh yes those legs fire up feeling those calves too looking good you are halfway 30 more seconds oh yes it feels long i know i'm starting to breathe heavier we have 15 seconds left stay strong [Music] three two and one jump rope did that leave you a little breathless it did me okay we're gonna build into our next one minute interval it's a fun one right now take the time to chill out with this jump rope so on intervals we want to be working higher you should want this rest right here if you're like i could have kept going try to strengthen a little bit march it right now i'm gonna angle as i show you we've got quite a few options on this next one we're marching stay with the march watch and then join step tap tap [Music] now it could be a knee or a kick try a couple march it out that's our interval one minute you can slow it down that's probably fast enough one minute let's go now notice you can also lean forward take that other leg behind you pump those arms strong halfway folks burning low calories today 100 leveling it up you have 20 seconds embrace that minute four three two jump rope bring it down now we gotta get that on our leg again we'll build in no worries just relax for a few more seconds let everything come down notice that level change back to light or moderate march on your left now we're going to angle a little let's practice all the options before we go into the interval remember your interval could be a mix of these options step tap fret and back arms help this one maybe it's a knee or even a kick now just march so think strong arms pumping forward and back it will help your momentum we have 15 seconds and then we're getting into our one minute i call these charleston [Music] remember your case no one else's in four three two your minutes on let's go extra ump up back think about those strong arms strong belly and of course a strong mind determined you can make it through halfway feel that energy that heat you are creating no you get a break after this it's coming five four three two and one march it right [Music] step it together easy bring it down okay we have one more one minute interval it'll be our double step with the calf raise right now double step march double step march you could also pick this as your interval keep it light for a second in 25 seconds we're going to get going with our last one minute interval just focus in on this last part two more easy one more now go for it one minute low and high come on use that brush are you making a basket that's what i'm imagining right there you've got it halfway all the cool down's gonna feel so good you will feel so accomplished at the end 20 more seconds bring it five four three two and one whoo easy step together oh my okay we've got that interval over with now we got another of course right this one's going to be fast feet 45 seconds so right in the middle of our 30 and our one minute march it right march now you stay right there i'm just gonna turn to the side take this forward and back you remember from the warm-up now when we hit the interval you can do this faster with the arms or you can move into fast feet so marge we got 45 seconds starting three two one right leaves forward back i'm coming back to you light on those feet nice 30 seconds a little agility and yes you probably feel the calves a bit five four three two march left okay take it down let's practice left forward and back i want to go there i changed my mind i'm coming back in bringing it down so we can bring it up again getting ready march four three two five feet i'm coming back georgia left right left right bringing it to the end this is our last interval you have about 20 seconds i'm still smiling i'm always smiling if i'm not smiling watch out five four three two and one easy march that's it intervals are done we still have a little bit more to do but intervals are done double high five grab a drink now bringing it down let's just tap it side to side thinking about those legs a little bit as we cool it down wiping off my sweat now one tap one side leg stay tall eight more four more just half pump it out now you can watch and join tap lift other leg think about posture engaging your midsection and feeling your medial glute as you lift your leg so good last four easy tabs bringing it down yet still working keep going easy taps stay right there i'm just going to turn to the side keep tapping watch first step squeeze and release alternate you may want to reach forward for counterbalance just feel that glute breath is returning to normal a little balance stabilization to cool down four more alternating and release shake it out oh how good does that feel slow it down out of reach stretch lift the ribcage more bodies nice and warm time to open it back up and release open your chest big inhale exhale give a hug open and give that hug one more time and release hands to your thighs one toe comes up hinging from the hip take your bow toe pulls into the knee open up the whole back side of your leg breathe hopefully you are telling yourself awesome job wherever you were today you showed up and you made the decision to move your body come up and switch congratulate yourself for that hinge toe pulls into your knee i could stay here a long long time come on up heel to your bum nice and slow i'm gonna take the feet a little wider than hip width bend the knees circle out your hips and then go the opposite direction for really active classes like this a good compliment is yoga or tai chi [Music] like yin and yang energy and rest and restore and release take a big breath in exhale feet come together and one last big breath and get expansive reach so tall exhale down shake it out and remember if first you don't succeed if you don't have a ponytail just replace the word fix your ponytail

are here at the gym it's a little bit late than usual uh the time moving forward kind of messed me up i feel like i just haven't done anything and uh it's not that i don't like coming to the gym late it's just it gets so crowded so it's about five o'clock it's gonna be peak hours so you know how things goes people coming out of the school gym um not gym school work so it is what it is but we have shoulders a little bit of a upper body gonna be a good one today we are going to take some cherry candy from fitness culture i'm sorry from culture not fitness culture fitness culture is the program and culture is just the supplements but this is good um we already have some bcaas in there ghost cup two supplement brands two different ones all i gotta say is support the brands that work for you the ones that you like the ones that work best for you it doesn't matter what other people say or think these two work for me i love these two so that's what it is take stick one scoop of this and

to be this close so you guys can listen to me that first first set of exercises kill me seven sets of ten shoulder bones shoulder press with a dumbbell row it's supposed to be a cable rope but the gym is insanely flat i can't i had to save that area so remember you do your first set rest a minute and go to the next one you guys stay on the clock on a minute by the time you get by like the fifth sixth set you might not get 10 and it's okay again like i said in the last video don't get discouraged because of that and don't go too heavy especially now we're working with temple like i said german volume is supposed to be ten sets of ten this one is seven of ten because we're working with temple three second tempo so yeah now we're doing some dumbbells i'm sorry we're doing front raises cable front raises and double pump chinos okay [Music] is him [Music] oh [Music] two three [Music] away [Music] so [Music] we finished that workout brutal brutal brew those 45-minute beginnings man those are things that will test you mentally because you're like why do why do i do this why i just want to throw that away give up but stay stick with it mentally this is it weak that's what i called

syrup by tapping the trees and in this video i'm going to show you all of the steps that i took to complete this process this was like i said the first time i've done this process and when i was researching to do this i actually had a really hard time finding a video that covered all the steps there were some videos and things out there but most of them only covered part of the process so we're going to go through eight steps step by step of what you need to do to make your own small batch maple syrup i just made about a quart a couple pint-sized jugs like this of maple syrup and it turned out really great it tastes good i'll drink some of it and uh yeah so that's what we're gonna get into this video so we'll start right now so the first thing you need to do to make your own small batch maple syrup is you need to identify the tree right and so sugar maple trees are the main trees that people use for tapping to make maple maple syrup and there's three main ways that you can identify the trees first of all just for reference this is a sugar maple tree and one way that you can tell that it's a maple tree is by the dark tight bark and so if you kind of have a good eye for identifying bark you can do it that way probably the easiest way to identify a sugar maple tree is going by the leaf that's how a lot of people do it but that only works if you can identify it in the summer and then mark it and then come back and find it the previous year so if you're able to do that then i encourage you to use the guide that's in the link that i'll leave down the in the description it's a document from the ohio state university extension office they put out a great hobby maple syrup production guide and you can find a maple tree leaf identifica identification guide in that paper and there's also some ideas and facts throughout this video that i'll reference that originally comes from that guide so if you want just a written text version of a guide of how to do this then read through the link that i'll put down in the description that's a great one and then the third way that you can identify maple trees is using uh the twig so you can use the twigs and the bud and that's probably the most scientific approach to get a really precise answer and i did a whole another video about how to do that it basically comes down to identifying maple trees versus other trees in the forest and then distinguishing between the different types of maples so rather than going through that all again here i'm just gonna put a little card up at the top of this video so that you can go and watch that to make sure you're using a sugar maple tree from the beginning so that's the first thing that you need to do and one additional note once you find a sugar maple tree or you know where sugar maple tree is it's also important to remember that it needs to be a certain size so you don't want to tap a maple tree that is under 10 inches in diameter so an easy test that you can do is to get a 33 inch rope and wrap it around the tree and if the ends do not meet then that means the tree is big enough right so hopefully that makes sense if it's 33 inch rope and it does not wrap all the way around that means that the tree is large enough and you can tap it step number two that you need to take is to actually tap the maple tree okay and so there's a couple things that you need in order to do this the first thing you need is you need a drill and you need that drill to have a 5 16 size drill bit because that's the the diameter of the hole that you're going to put in your tree there are different sizes but i think that the main size that most people use is a 5 16 size and then you're going to need what is called a spile which is just another word for the tap that is also 5 16 size and you're going to tap that spile into the tree into the hole that you drill also when you're drilling the hole just keep in mind that you don't want to go really really deep you only want to go about an inch and a half to two inches deep with the hole that you drill and so keep that in mind while you're doing this step and then also just a note about when to actually do this so there is a distinct maple syrup season and that comes in in my area so i'm in ohio and this applies i think to kind of the midwest region and then looking like north and to the east it will differ depending on where you are what your elevation is probably how cold the temperatures have gotten but generally you're looking at least in ohio around mid february on the the early end to mid april on the late end okay and so that's something to keep in mind and that's the maple syrup season is pretty short so you really need to be prepared when the season comes and the temperatures that you're going to have to meet in order to get a good sap flow so you can make syrup falls between um it is it it happens when the temperatures go below freezing are below freezing at night and then during the day the temperatures get up to about 40 degrees fahrenheit okay so that's kind of the nice perfect temperature from maple sap flow is less than freezing at night and then around 40 degrees fahrenheit during the day that's ideal and then once you have your tap in the tree just uh kind of the final thing that you have to do is either hang a bag or a food grade bucket of some kind on to the the spile so that you can start collecting your sap so that's kind of the last thing for tapping the tree hanging your bucket and all that jazz step number three is then to reap the the fruits of your labor basically and to gather the sap so for that what i did was to gather the sap about once a day and so kind of at the end of the day after i was done with work i would come out into the woods i would get my bucket take my sap and i would i would collect it so there's a few different options you have also for storing that sap because you probably don't want to boil it down every day if you aren't getting a lot of sap so i've only tapped a few trees and so i wasn't getting a ton of sap every day and so what i would do is i would take the sap and i would put it in like a pitcher or a like a tupperware a big tupperware container in the fridge is one way you can store it or if it's cold enough at night you can just like leave a bucket or a tank outside if it's going to be like sort of below the temperature of your refrigerator anyway that's another thing that you can do and once you get enough sap then you can start like boiling it down to concentrate it and then go on to the next steps if you don't have enough space to put all your sap in the fridge and you don't want to store it outside what you can do is boil it down part way to sort of get concentrated sap and then to package it and store it in like a pitcher before doing the finishing process which is a little bit more complex but that at least can save you some storage room okay so step number four is to boil it down you have all the sap gathered and you're ready to boil it down and see if you can get some syrup so there are a variety of ways to do that you've probably seen some like videos or things of bigger producers that have boilers that are specifically designed for boiling down sap but since i've just done a few trees and i've kind of just done a small batch of maple syrup then i've used my kitchen basically and so i tried three different methods of doing this i tried just doing it on my normal kitchen stove i tried doing it on an instant pot and i tried doing it in a crock pot the crock pot didn't really work very well so i wouldn't suggest trying to boil down sap in a crock pot but both the instant pot and the stove worked pretty well and the stove probably was the fastest method so you can do that you might have some concerns like you might have heard this online in forums or something that it will like make your walls sticky and i did oh you know probably about two to three pints worth of maple syrup so small batch and i haven't had any problems with that my understanding is that you get into that sort of an issue when you do like really large quantities of sap so since i'm only doing you know small batch i haven't had problems with that so that's something that might be helpful for you to know and when you do boil it down uh just a couple things that you need to know um it helps if you can turn on like a ventilator fan if you have one on your kitchen and i also like had a rag nearby that i'd use to like wipe off the the ceiling above my stove to kind of wipe down steam because it does steam and that's how it gets concentrated so that can be a helpful thing to keep in mind the last two things that i'll mention before you can kind of start boiling things down is number one i did a pre-filter where i took my sap that i had from outside and i put it into the container where i was going to boil it and i just pre-filtered it to get like some bark and twigs and things out of the sap so to be nice and clean when i boil it so that's something you might want to do as well and when i boiled it i put it on medium to high heat which was about six or seven on my stove and then the second and last thing that i'll mention about this is the amount of sap that you need to produce syrup is in a about a 40 to 1 ratio so it takes about 40 gallons of sap to produce one gallon of syrup so if you're just trying to do like a quart then that means that it will take about 10 gallons of a sap to make one quart of syrup so just keep that in mind so you know how much sap you need to actually get a decent amount of syrup step number five is to go through the finishing process with the syrup this is one of the most difficult and kind of tricky parts because you have to be pretty precise with how you do this so once you've got your sat boiled down and it's starting to sort of get brown and thicker then you need to finish it get it to the finishing point of syrup and you can measure that using temperature so for this step you're going to need a candy thermometer of some kind and what you're going to do is first of all you should measure the boiling point of water with that thermometer to make sure you know the exact boiling point of water at your location and elevation it should be around 212 degrees fahrenheit and then what you're going to do is you're going to monitor the temperature of your sap and when the temperature of your sap reaches 7 degrees fahrenheit above the boiling point of water then technically at that point it will be finished okay so for example if the boiling pot of water with your thermometer where you are is 212 degrees fahrenheit when the temperature reaches 219 degrees fahrenheit you're gonna have finished syrup so that's the way that you do it and once you get about three degrees above the boiling temperature of water then you are going to need to start watching it really closely because if you kind of let it go and don't pay attention to it it can boil over really quickly once it gets above three degrees fahrenheit over the boiling point and just as a side note the reason the temperature increases is because the viscosity of the syrup increases and so the boiling point goes up as the syrup gets thicker hopefully that makes sense in my experience just talking about this thermometer measurement in my experience the thermometer wasn't 100 on point so it wasn't 100 accurate that might just be because of my conditions and my thermometer that i was using um but that was my experience that it wasn't like 100 precise and judging my finished syrup and so i actually used an additional tool that you can use if you want to be really precise and make sure that you get your syrup to the right consistency and that tool is called a hydrometer okay and basically how this works is you take the hydrometer and you fill up a little jug with syrup and then you drop the hydrometer into it and it has two marks on it it has a hot syrup mark and it has a cold syrup mark and depending on if your syrup is hot or cold there's a different line because it will kind of suspend and so i did this test with hot syrup i dropped the hydrometer in and i want to make sure that my my little line on there meets where the syrup is and if it's not quite there then i need to keep boiling it down okay so a hydrometer is another thing that you can use and if you want to learn more about how that hydrometer works that link that i put in the description can help you figure that out a little bit more in detail as well so keep that in mind and when you do this when you're measuring this viscosity here's why it's important to get the perfect range of density for your syrup you need to be at what's called 66 degrees to 68 degrees brix which is a measure of the density or viscosity of the syrup and the reason this is important is because if you don't if your syrup is too liquidy if it's not dense enough it can get moldy or go bad once you've packaged it and if you kind of go overboard and you make it too dense then it can form like chunks of sugar on the bottom and so you want to be right in that happy medium of where your serve is going to be the perfect consistency and personally from my perspective i sort of aired on the side of being too thick because i would rather it kind of get some sugar crystals in it or some sugar chunks rather than having it mold and go bad so that's kind of the the technique that i used personally okay the sixth step that you need to take is to filter the sap or filter the syrup rather and the way that you do this is by using two filters there's what's called a pre-filter or a paper filter and then there is a thicker uh final filter that you use and you put these two filters together you get them a little bit damp in some like hot water or some hot sap and then you can begin filtering your finished syrup through it into a container of some kind and so the reason this is done is basically to improve the clarity and improve even the flavor of your syrup because it filters out the sugar sand which is kind of the silty material that's formed during the boiling process so this is a step that it is important to get like ideal syrup i kind of only did this for half of the syrup i did if i wanted to package it up and get it real nice but you could theoretically just if you're gonna use the syrup and put it in the fridge right away and you don't mind it being a little silty theoretically you could just not filter it at this final stage but you didn't hear that from me i think the general recommendation is just to go ahead and do the final filter now the seventh step is to bottle your syrup so if you've got some bottles like i have and you've done the filtering process which can take a long time so you'll have to be patient with that is to bottle the syrup and you want to bottle the syrup when it's hot so it needs to be at least 185 degrees fahrenheit ideally when you're bottling it and what you do is you just pour the syrup into your bottle and then once you've put the cap on and you put the syrup in there make sure you tip the bottle upside down because you want that hot syrup to touch all of the surface inside and then once you've done that and sealed the cap you're good to go you've finished the bottling process and you can pat yourself on the back then step number eight it's the best of all is to enjoy your syrup put it over some pancakes and enjoy the fruits of your labor so i hope you found this

time this week so it might be throw people a little bit off depending on whether or not people switch especially people from other countries because they don't switch on the same schedule as us but we're excited to be here and this has been at our shop for quite a while it didn't sell so we're going to make it into a display did you say that we could use it for blankets yeah okay so if you remember from way long ago i think it was a waste not wednesday originally and we just had it for sale at the shop and we ended up draping a bunch of like blankets and purses and jackets and stuff on it and hanging stuff from the knob and it never really sold but we did this with one of our stencils in chalk with a chalk pencil so it is it still wipes off but we're probably just going to paint right over the top of that today and this is some copper pipe this is half inch copper tubing um we're going to use this to display the papers on it and these were five dollars for a five foot section i cut them down into two 30 inch sections with my miter saw so now we have 16 of these instead of eight and i have no idea how he's putting this together because it is not my design so i hope you're going to be just as surprised as me as it like pulls together you're gonna tell them all about milk paint while i get the doorknob off all right well we're gonna use that we've got sweet pickings in pantry door it's a really great like vintagey looking green i've got my mixing cup oops i gotta dump out some water from it we kind of use the same mixing cup over and over again and get the paint out of the bottom of the cup so on these old door knobs and hinges and stuff i like to have a chisel handy and i keep a special one that i use just for this it's kind of all messed up but i basically just really quickly cut i'll show you up close in a second cut the old paint right out of this slot on the screw how many hours now i can use a regular screwdriver to get this knob off of here so i like these cups because they have measurements on the side and you're going to mix one part milk paint to one part warm water i like to mix a little bit less and make my paint a little bit thicker because i'm lazy and i don't like do a lot of coats so this doorknob has been painted a ton and this is the tiny little screw you can let's see if i can get it to focus on it but there was a ton of paint all on here it was sitting down in there and i just scraped it out with that chisel and then the screwdriver worked real good if you guys saw these last week they sold out on our thursday stay at home shopping network but i ordered 30 more so we'll let you know when they come back in stock but i do love this because it's got the ounces on the side so it makes it easier for measuring i'm sure some people will use it for baking or mixing drinks but i use it for milk paint so same on this flange with the screws the chisel works really good to just kind of gouge that paint out and then i can fit an actual screwdriver down in there i'm just using a little shorty handle one if you're new here and you want to know where to get this milk paint you can pick it up at jamierayvintage.com all of our home decor and items like this you can pick up at jrvhome.com and we actually are having a ginormous palette delivered right now so tomorrow should be a really good got a couple pallets this week yeah so make sure you set your alarms you're not going to want to miss the stay-at-home shopping network tomorrow some of it's new some of it's old for my pickers we do that at four four o'clock mountain time on thursdays all right it's getting a little loud [Music] so you cannot use a fork if you want to or a whisk i picked up this immersion blender at my thrift store for five bucks the tag's still on it and this is the first time i've used it so i wasn't i tested it right before we went right sometimes oh go ahead so i actually got a couple of these i got one for here and one for the shop but if i find any more we'll put them on our thrift hauls so that way if you guys want one you can because normally they're like 20 or 30 bucks on it christina has a question she says need help i painted a shelf with diy paint and waxed and buffed but it is still splotchy blotchy how long ago did you do that with the wax because you can taste it sorry i got it and then i'll tell you i think i got it it mixes pretty fast you don't want to like move it around a lot because then you get a lot of bubbles sorry all right so wax can take up to 30 days to cure usually the splotchiness will go away after two or three days if it's still splotchy and it's dry to the touch like it doesn't feel tacky when you touch it you need more wax there was a plastic measuring cup must have been in this i thought it sounded weird so if you get i think there's a chunk missing about that big so if that comes out we'll know what it was so i'm just using the chisel on these because they're so painted and someone's kind of wallowed them out with a screwdriver would you open up the garbage can yes uh someone's watered them out with you got toes i got toes yeah all right now this is ready to come off of here there's a flange on the other side i don't know if we're gonna get to painting that because this is gonna be a one-sided display i am going to leave the hinges on the door i'm probably we have enough to do the papers here um we may need to do a two-sided so that we can actually put enough space in between so you can see them good and see what the design is um because this is for our shop and we're gonna display papers on there same concept with like blankets or grain sacks or whatever your displaying if you've got like really cool towels or something i don't know um but i'm going to leave it so that it hinges on the wall the way i mount it on the wall at the shop so you can look at either side of the display and it's dual purpose instead of just taking up all the real estate and just having one display i'm gonna move this out of our way okay there's enough paint on here i'm gonna chisel that off really quickly up close i love that outdoors because you always find like this shade of blue at some point in most doors and i love how like chippy and layered this knob is okay so this is just two and a half i think maybe it's three inch by three eighths inch trim just flat trim and ours got a little water damaged and sat out in the rain for a minute but we're to paint over that and i forgot my nail gun so i will go grab that in a second but i'm going to answer hazel we do ship to canada at januaryvintage.com on jrvhome.com also ignore that i'm going to sew it today i promise i forgot to fluff it at jrbhome.com because we sell a lot of odd shaped things we don't have international shipping set up however if you email info jamie rayvintagehome.com um iv if you could drop that email in the comments that'd be good um if if you email us what you want then we'll get you shipping on it but we have to do it that way because international shipping is can vary and if we don't calculate it correctly it could way over calculate it or wait under calculate it so we usually just do order by order um and if we can ever figure out a great way to calculate these odd-shaped things than we will we ship we have shipped to australia canada all over the place so gorilla heavy duty construction adhesive we've tried a bunch this is our favorite similar to stuff like liquid nails things like that but i feel like this sticks better to more surfaces especially like glass and things like that so lolly lolly says coming from ireland it was always weird seeing how americans celebrate saint patty's day we celebrated by my kids wore green i bought the lucky charms that turned your milk green like the special ones with only green charms and that's it normally my mom will make corned beef and um cabbage but she's had a rough week this week and so i don't think we're having any corned beef and cabbage maybe if i get to the grocery store okay so the reason i'm putting these on here i'm going to layer another one on just to double it up is to hold that out away from the door so that i can actually slide the paper back behind i gotta go get my nail gun so i'll be right back all right i'll just be here hanging out as soon as i get the sign on though you can start painting kai i do have my green sweater on and my green shirt we actually thought we were irish for a long time my grandpa used to say if i had the drop of an english man in my blood well turns out we're actually not irish we are english we did some family history and genealogy and uh yeah no irish hair our herring just others my main name is harrington h a i guess is the english spelling and h e is the irish i don't know but anyways we are english harringtons there might be irish somewhere in there all those countries are very close so i'm sure there was some border crossing leah says they're always after me lucky charms hopefully you don't mess your hair up that's what i could find quick thanks you know what i thought i saw some regular ones i know i'm not going to mess my hair up we don't have to worry about that all right okay so i've got inch and 5 8 18 gauge nails in here i'm just going to put them every so often because we don't the glue's good it's going to really make this sturdy and hold that on but if we start hanging heavy blankets on these copper rods the the tubing might not hold up over time so queen bee has a good question what do we use to cover up the tips of glue to keep them from drying out so you could put a screw in that's a really good option um but we just put out we just squeeze a a little we call it leaving a booger so you see that little we pick it off that little bead of glue right there i'll let that dry and then when you come back to using you just pop that off this one someone had cut it flush and i had to most of your uh cloaking guns will will have this on there so you can stab the dry spot out and no biggie renee says she has some green nails i used to get my nails done but it was a moot point we're almost ready to start painting almost i should zigzag this but i'm not super it's not it's not super heavy weight on these papers so i'm not going to sweat it it's not going to be a big deal the clothes till they come crashing down nothing's going to crash down nothing arlene says my green today is soft house sugar cookie with green frosting that sounds delicious i'm thinking i'm gonna go buy lehigh bakery and see if i have any more green donuts that sounds like a good way to celebrate oh yeah their donuts are good no matter what color they are they have square donuts okay so can you guys see that on camera i don't know jennifer just joined what are you making we are making a display for our decode podge paper but it could also easily be easily be used as a display for blankets because i know a lot of people can collect like antique blankets or grain sacks and so it's fun to have something that you can drape them over and display them all right so i'm going to do the same thing to the other side and then i have some little brackets that are going to hold the copper bars on here um but you won't be able to see me do this side because i'm going to let jamie start painting and leave the camera where it's at all right i gotta put my well i'm gonna wait till you put this down so that way i'm not adding your stuff okay just set it over yeah just hand it right here all right it's always good if you let your milk paint sit up a little bit it'll thicken and if you don't like the consistency of your milk paint guys feel free to add or water or more milk paint whatever i'm not super good at measuring i just kind of estimate sometimes i win sometimes i lose this is a little runnier than i wanted but it'll work and my brush is wet so that's going to make it thinner all our brushes were dirty actually you know what i'm going to do i'm going to dry my brush out we have a fun um edited video coming up this friday if you guys go to my instagram stories you'll see us working on a very large tremendous hello i can't say right mirror that works i feel like i feel like you nailed it i got it from my home girl marlene and it's pretty cool all right only a few more staples and then we'll be done making noise hey milk paint sticks super good to fabric so yeah it ain't coming out the good news is that it's green and it's st patrick's day so nobody can pinch our door i didn't even plan it i didn't think about the fact that the screen won't take contrast i like to use milk paint for this kind of an application because it will crack and chip and then my won't look like i painted it to look brand new because part of the gloriousness of old doors is the old chippy paint here i'll bring it down for just a second so right here just doing the same thing to the other side this is really just to give me some room between the door and the bracket um i don't like this is not a door from this house here that i know i think this came from we've got a hall from we've had this door for quite a while this is before we even bought the house okay yeah i've been a door hoarder for a long time most of my doors that i have in the other house like for decor and stuff have all been used here i always said you never know when you're going to need an old door and i always seem to need them if you guys follow debbie from diy paint she has been using old doors to spruce up her shop getting ready for boot camp we're going to be there in a few weeks to teach at that so we're super excited about that um and we are also going to be let me give you a date because i'm horrible at doing that we're going to be in bernie texas and it's not an april fool's joke but it will be on april fool's day april 1st um at the sanctuary and we will drop an event link for that once we get that we're going to do a meet and greet there we're going to texas for antiques week and while we're there i'm going to my friend's shop and we will be doing a meet and greet so we're super excited about that hanging out with sarah the cool thing is you guys um while we are headed to antiques week we're going to junk on our way and so this saturday will be just our regular thrift haul but the next saturday will be from our um what's that called our airbnb in new mexico and then the following saturday we'll be back home but we'll be with our haul from antiques week in round top so we have some fun things coming up are we painting the black in the middle are you just gonna leave that um let's paint it we can always like distress it back or whatever okay this door has quite a bit of chippy paint there's probably four or five layers here of color it's kind of hard to see because mostly it looks like they went white or cream you want to move the camera over here yeah see that yeah so you can see like down here some of these chips i'll try to bring you close so oh we don't have this all the way over i'm gonna go down the counter there it is and the rapper jack left in the this morning hey we got kids man i'm gonna put paper towels but yeah it's chipping a little bit here which is fine we're putting milk paint on it you didn't add any extra bun did you so a lot of this might just chip off anyway robin we are actually purchasing a trailer down in texas so we only have to drive one way with it so we're gonna buy it down there i've checked pricing is about the same um as it is here in utah so we're just going to get one there and then we'll haul it back home hopefully all the way full um can you lift that up sorry our drop cloth isn't quite big enough and i want to keep it off the counter okay well i wasn't going to paint the very bottom of the door well i got to paint this oh yeah did you need to paint that yeah we don't need to paint the bottom but yeah we're going to have a trailer and hopefully uh make it worth our time to go down there it's going to be a fun trip but we're also working and finding stuff for the shop and the websites and all that that's what we like to call workation which is basically our life so when we go to deputies we're taking the kids because we're just going to be there teaching in class for a few hours we might show up for other stuff who knows because we're going to be staying really close to boot camp but it's spring break so we're like well let's just take the kids while we're at it we'll teach a class we'll do a little beaching a little social distancing on the beach all right let me pull up the live chat yeah i finally learned how to say bernie to i was calling it born because it's spelled b-o-r-n-e all right you got to talk loud because i've got the camera way back so that they can see the whole door all right and i did not sand this door first um i am always really careful with old doors if you're gonna sand them you need to be wearing a mask you should probably be outside you need to test your doors always be safe so you want to pull that out before i paint or pull it out that nail oh a nail no i'll knock it out from the other side in a minute here all right well i'm just gonna paint around it yeah that's fine if you notice in like all our videos this week that i have this star wars shirt on i haven't been showering or changing so you know there's that it's been a busy week and it's only tuesday or wednesday look at that i can't even keep the day straight it's wednesday well we just launched our second line of products for the jrb woods line to our retailers we'll get those up for you guys to buy here pretty quickly we just got to finish a bunch of them so hopefully by the end of the week we'll have that up super excited about that we've got some cool new portables new cutouts new candlesticks coming all the things and we finally finished all the packaging for the new skincare line that's coming out so hopefully we'll have that maybe next week we'll see lots of fun things going on around here and while we paint in the very next room my friend shelly if you see stories you'll get to see it she runs a business called slipcovers by shelley and she is in there uh working on the slipcover for our ginormous couch it's gonna look like those ikea couches we used to have that are white it's getting all white slip covers she's getting a new dress my couch when i say ginormous it's 15 feet long by 10 foot deep on each side and she told me she's never done a couch that big before but we have a big family just living here there's eight of us because i can't live with us but then i have my son and his girlfriend over here often ty and mariah and their boys so we just have to have a big couch somewhere we can all hang out and vicky that is a huge double what seven foot double that someone was selling on facebook for fifty dollars what that's worth like four or five hundred dollars they said it was from round top that's awesome we're excited kai that's not too much information i just haven't been showering i've showered my hair's done it's kind of a busy week too like ojillia has cheer tryouts next week which is kind of a big deal there were a hundred and fifty girls at the meeting and i thought they're gonna be able to hear you talking away from sorry there's 150 girls that were at the cheer meeting last night and they only have spots for like 50 or 60. so they the head coach always tries to like not scare them but let them know exactly how involved cheerleading is and be like listen if you can't make the commitment don't show up to try out so usually about 30 30 don't actually show up after they hear all the things that are required and then next week is cheer tryouts which even though she's been on the team for two years she was the cheer captain this year it doesn't assure that she has a spot so we're all a little well the crazy thing is i played football basketball and baseball in high school because the seasons didn't overlap and she probably puts in way more time and effort than i ever did for those three sports just doing chairs so it's like a huge time commitment for these kids yeah and she actually um she's doing she's working on her tumbling because she's not a natural tumbler she doesn't like going backwards i don't blame her um so she's taking private lessons right now to work on that and get ready but yeah they're two times state champions so i think that people have come over from maybe other schools because words got out that lehigh has a great cheer program their cheer coach is amazing their head coach i've known since odelia was like two she lived on the as us for a long time yeah from the neighborhood we just moved from so amber said they could hear me okay good are we flying to houston no we're driving um we're gonna our my suv can pull a trailer so we're gonna drive out there grab a trailer and then um we contemplated taking the truck but it's loud it's lifted it doesn't ride super smooth it's lifted yeah zeb's truck is cool but my car is more comfortable i mean we have we've driven to albuquerque in it before we're like yeah maybe we'll take this suburban next time you know yeah but our kids are not coming so deb and i will just be there working um in the car we've got wi-fi so i have a lot of things that i need to be working on and we'll just have fun it's when we when we take these road trips we usually hash out like what we're gonna do for the next like six months but yeah time never goes to waste it's always a lot of like life planning and goals and stuff and it's about nine hours to albuquerque i think and then another 11 hours to bernie and then the next day we have a couple hours to get to round top we'll stand around top for three days come back to bernie do the meet and greet and then we'll have to travel start traveling home the next friday because we have to be here by saturday night a for our thrift haul and b because sunday's easter so we got to be home with our kids for that all right so the milk paints on there i actually need to start putting brackets on i think i can do that with the milk paint on there without messing it up too much we might need to touch it up a little bit let me grab the heat gun so shabby patty said did we paint this green for st patrick's day actually no it just worked out jamie paints everything this color i don't know if you know look at the look at look at her uh my buffet her buffet over here the next the friday's video they've if they've seen instagram they've seen the whole thing there's a benefit to following me on instagram you get the answers okay so we have 15 paper designs and we're probably going to be adding more soon-ish in the next month or two this is 79 inches what's that let's do 10 per side so that'd be about 8 inches in between each now to figure out the math on that so a heat gun can make it incredible and chips sweetie can you just do these top ones yeah because that's where i have to screw stuff in yeah i'll have to do one side then plug it into the other because of course not that that's okay oh did you we're not gonna paint this side yeah this is gonna be like a blanket ladder we're gonna use it for a display for our decoupage paper my half bathroom door is painted this color on the inside it's kind of fun hang on i need a pencil or something with marker um yeah and that junk drawer to the far right is there a pen in there yeah there's lemons pens you never know what you're going to find in our junk drawer sample stencil brushes yeah so really more of this this piece right here that needs to be dry all right so i'm going to go four inches off the top it's peeling a little well because i needed like latex underneath is latex and other things and then also we didn't put any bond in there so we're gonna get some chippy and crackling on this door for sure it's all right okay so these are half inch two hole straps i picked these up in the electrical aisle they're used for exterior conduit or sometimes interior too if you've got a long span you've got to run conduit on but anyway they just look like this and i'm going to use these to put the poles in i don't have end caps for the copper they make little caps that you can buy they're like 50 cents each they didn't have enough of them when i was buying this so i got to go back and see if they have them or i might just go somewhere else and grab them so they're all matching because sometimes the caps are a little bit different so you can get a cap to put on here but i would do that after you screw your your uh piece in but so i couldn't i was looking for like a copper colored one of these we might i don't know i haven't discussed it with jamie we might just put some pennies from heaven over the top of these we might just leave them kind of an industrial silver look uh yeah we could we'd have to paint them white first and then do paint or we could paint them like orange and then do pennies from heaven we'll see the other morning on my buffet that was showing you i don't know it's like 6 a.m i decided to white wax it and have pennies from heaven on the handles i'm kind of a weird i get a i get a weird decor mood and i start painting things okay so these are just going centered over my mark i did not dry that that's okay oops i have to use two hands probably shorter screws would be better it's going to be industrial i'm just using screws i had in the garage i think all kinds these are an inch and five eights probably three quarters inch one inch screw would be overkill like you it would work great so we actually bought a display for our paper and then i'm not very good at measuring but subsequently neither is them and the paper doesn't fit but it's the perfect jogger display oh kai i'm glad you mentioned that video so youtube is doing a new thing where we can upload short videos um and there they have to be under a minute long so i put one up yesterday not too many people have seen it because i don't know that youtube's pushing them out it's still in beta testing so um but anyway i put a short up yesterday of me doing some wood turning on some of the templates for the new woods line for jrv home so if you want to check that out it's just a quick little one we'll probably do a couple of those a week maybe just do like quick tips or time lapses of what we've got going on this week so watch for those because they're fun it's just a quick little 60 second clip and of woodturning yesterday but i think we can have a lot of fun with those so keep an eye out on all right you want to go do the other side molly saw the short emma's on it that is her name right ivy said she saw it on tick tock oh yeah we also put it on tick tock it wasn't quite one minute so i couldn't put it on you know everybody doesn't want a brave tick tock so we're also going to put them on youtube yeah so we're going to actually take because they're vertically shot videos sorry i'll use them on instagram too but we got to make them exactly one minute at least to be on instagram all right hang on also if you guys want to go i'll wait till deb's done spring i only have one more school okay if you guys want to go over to uh community tab check it out um our friend mara had a cyber uh attack or whatever on her facebook page and so she had to start a new page and so we're trying to get people over to her page her old page is still there she just no longer has access to it and she's trying to get with facebook and regain access to it but anybody's ever had an interaction with like that it's very difficult to get it back if ever so we're trying to help her out this is an old strip of latex paint [Laughter] wally says she can't handle tick tock which is totally fine so we're gonna be putting them up on youtube too yeah um so you can see right here i don't have the caps to go on there once we put the caps on i think it'll help keep them from falling out and if they're a real problem i can crimp this a little bit if they want to slide out of here and then that'll that'll hold them right in place because this half inch is for a little bit larger conduit the copper pipe is technically half inch interior dimension i believe maybe it's exterior but that's cool but that's what that's going to look like and you get that fun copper effect with the green it's almost like a verdigris like we did it on purpose yeah i don't really know how you're going to fit enough papers on here because we don't want to cover up the designs no i'm going to do them about eight inches apart and do 10 down this side and 10 down the other what okay it's the master plan 10 down one side you mean like fold them in half no 10 on this side 10 on the other side oh on this side so here for example all right let's pretend let's pretend here let's pretend that this is a two by four on the wall i'm gonna mount a two by four on the wall we can paint it whatever color i'm gonna screw the hinges on the door onto this two by four and you can move it to see both sides we're gonna have to find a new place to display it that won't fit in the hallway it'll be too tight well we'll see i would probably redo the stencil stuff and and do that all right we're picking up what you're throwing down now but otherwise we have to have two doors i feel like that would be better two doors we have a lot of space in that hallway let's just do one side of this and then put it in there we'll need to get another door yeah okay you guys think that we talk ahead sometimes about things but this is our live discussion right here so um you'll get to see in the shop tomorrow i'll have these mounted up so you get to see where these are going in the shop with the paper on them so um deb wants to know how you're going to keep the paper from sliding off the slick tubes so we once you fold them in half they don't really move around though yeah we're going to have multiple they'll be draped over so we'll find out that's what he's saying all right so do you want me to try to paint this with cup pennies from heaven yeah you can try if not i have a bunch and these packets are like a dollar for five of these take the tube out yeah these packets are like a dollar for five of these brackets so if we gotta get more i'm not gonna really worry about it it's less than a candy bar is for those [Music] okay so i'm just going off my other measurement here i'm gonna put about eight inches between them so that i can fit ten on the side and i'm i've got a little water my pennies are cutting and i'm putting the middle of the arch on this bracket on my mark this is my original jar of pennies from heaven let me measure this for when it was released almost a year ago it's really going the distance i'm gonna go try to find some shorter screws real quick i'm going to bring the camera in close too so they can kind of see i'm just going to stir in my water well i stay close closer closer bring them in close so you guys can see the floor where jamie sanded it in a frid of uh crafting rage two o'clock in the morning just don't ask okay all right there you go going for a new look we might do the whole floor and leave it all rustic like that or it'll just get rustic on its own oh you can hang copper pots from this that would be cool all right so i'm just using this is pennies from heaven you can also get this at jamie rayvintage.com and like i said this one is so old like i've had this since the release last september it's the like original one and it got a little chunky so i added some water in it to get all the paint off the side off the lid it's a little bit of spendy so you don't want to waste any of it so i'm just gonna i'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here yeah do you want to paint them beforehand yeah that would be better then i just have to paint i do like the way that looks i found some shorter screws that's all right these are number six three-quarter inch long so these are going to work great so we'll see how that holds up let me heat them up okay i'm gonna here we need to paint a bunch of them real quick then so i can screw them up no go ahead and screw them on i'll just paint them and then i'll stand around them it's fine okay i like that plan because then we can actually get the project done yeah i'll make it look intentional i'll add some pennies from heaven elsewhere ain't nobody got time to paint them individually so hopefully this will get dry enough we'll show you with a couple papers draping over it before we're done or like a blanket or something yeah this middle part we can probably heat gun and get it dry enough so i'm taking two coats of the pennies from heaven to really cover this and it has a built-in top coat so i'm not gonna bother to put anything else on it [Music] yeah the shorter screws are a lot better and they match instead of being black there you go they're the same silver color boom just paint y'all nailed it so this is something i've been needing to do for like a month and a half when did we come out with the papers january end of january it's been a long time our locals are like when are you gonna get in your shirt we haven't had them in our shop well we sold so many to our retailers that we couldn't uh carry them in the shop and we finally got our last uh because we ordered a bunch all at once and we got our last shipment of the big initial order so now we have enough for us all right that's better see just touch up the edges done like it never happened the branded drill we use milwaukee yeah and that's our impact drill so my brother got me some milwaukee grills so probably three four years ago now and this is the battery system i have so all my tools are like this because kind of once you get the the tool you're committed to the batteries because the batteries are almost as expensive as the drill it's hard to tell because it's covered in paint it's been used i built this whole house with these tools it's been used real hard yeah so we will put rubber caps on the or copper caps on the ends of these but they didn't have enough at the store and zeb wanted to make sure that we had them all matching yep i'll just i gotta go find them at a different hardware store did you measure that out are you just eyeballing it no i'm measured these are eight inches apart and hopefully we can fit ten it might end up being nine because the whole door is 80 and i went four inches so this is four inches from the top and then i measured eight inches down from there well you don't want to the paper to drag the ground no that would be counterproductive so we might have to just do like six and then do another doorway i know they're doing like three doors it's all right i have a hallway that i'm gonna put them in so it's fine they just have to be flat or else you can't really get past it i'm finding it it's easier if i just tab it like that you guys soon there we go i don't get as much on the door let's see so also a fun thing about this drill is it's an impact drill so as long as your screw doesn't break like it'll drive the screw right through like a two by four it'll just keep running it i love it because it makes it really easy and you're less likely to split your wood too i think it's gonna look good yeah the copper is really the copper color is really looking cool on here yeah all right i gotta start hustling now yeah you're getting ahead of me it's all right my job is slightly less difficult if you have time in between you can start a heat gun in the middle so yeah but i don't want to get in your way once you get further down the way then i'll heat gun the top well we need to see how long a paper is going to be folded and that's worse all of them is marked for twisters over the next 24 hours per day uh-oh we will definitely my mom is having hip surgery right now she's having her second hip they're doing a full replacement on it they did the other one and then she was at my brother's house and she wanted to show the kids she got him some jump ropes and she wanted to show him how to do a certain jump rope move and so you know she's just had hip replacement about six months ago on one hip and she decided that she was gonna do some jump roping and like a week later now she's replacing that other one because it's hurting her so bad she broke up the calcium deposits that were in the joint and it's like shredding it so so we are praying for alabama because twisters and hip surgery at the same time no fun yeah no that's is it is it she's in the columbiana area kai says people are canceling new home builds because lumber is so expensive yeah um and lucky us we decided to start a woods line we've been having to get real creative with stuff yeah so but we're making it work we found a good a couple good sources that are local here so we're getting so a lot of our wood products the lumber for them is getting cut here in utah in the uinta mountain range and it's it's uh dead standing they're really re they're doing a lot of responsible uh forestry and logging and it's some of it's blue stain like it's got that fun blue stain through it so fun fact sometimes doors aren't exactly level so you might want to just double check well so i did it off of so that door is white it's longer by about a quarter inch on that side no it'll be fine i mean if your eye sees it then you're twitchier than i am okay just saying i just don't want that once we get papers on here it's not going to be a thing kind of like odelia's door um so julia's door i knew about and just ran because i needed to get it done for the inspection the bottom of her door is perfect so instead of cutting it off and framing it being square he framed it and it's crooked on the bottom so the only way for us to figure it out i put the crooked side down and it's about an inch different from one side to the other can't really tell until she turns her light on and then you see this like down at the end of the hall so we'll have to like put a piece on the bottom like screw it together bondo it sand it and paint it so like in 2029 we'll fix that but it's charming and it makes the old new part of the house match the old parts i might just do one of those uh door seals that screw to the front of it on there and then it can just like you won't it'll trigger your eye you won't you won't see it does anyone know about tutorial with white decrepit dust i don't think we've used it but we've used the dark decrepit dust i imagine it would be the same give you kind of like a uh aged white washed kind of faded look yeah like a kind of eyes look kind of like white wax because the decrepit dust looks like dark wax a lot but it does it's it's like it's like a little grittier it's like gets you the good aged look sits down in the cracks we can try to put that on our list of things to do i would use it with like a black velvet would be really pretty with the crepit dust or weathered wood any of those darker colors would be super pretty with that so i'll run it by you guys um i was wanting to do because we get we're getting a lot of questions right now about like paint finishes and i'm worried our older videos aren't coming up and we've got we've got a little bit more experience on some different products that we're using now would you guys be interested in seeing i probably when we get back from california mid-april but i wanted to do a series on like kind of like back to basics on just painting in general like with the the stuff that we use every day would you be interested in watching that and rehashing some of those older videos [Music] otherwise i can just repost the old videos and we can watch those again you can probably take some of the footage for them and show them how we've kind of changed over the years because there are new things that we pick up along the way all right can you i'm going to go do this i'm going to put this one in and then i'm going to do that joe says i'll watch whatever you guys put out we'll be new and fun from the farmhouse right what did you want me to do um so after you get i'm gonna put this one in you can paint that then i'm gonna go put those in but i need this heat gun so i can get a piece of paper out over here without getting paint on it and see i mean essentially it'll probably be 15 inches from the top but i just wanted to see how it's going to drape i got you so if i was doing a blanket ladder i would not put them this close together yeah i'd probably put them a little farther together or a little farther apart i probably do like 12 inches well and most people aren't going to have 15 blankets that they want to display on one door and if you wanted it to be like less kitschy you know not the green and the copper you could totally get um do they make these in different colors what you're using do they have black ones these brackets no they're just conduit for electrical but you could paint them i mean you could do black yeah you could easily paint these with black the the little black dress sticks to metal really well like a black and white color scheme or whatever like this is a little bright but i wanted it to be fun because it's a display for the decoupage paper but you could totally just change the colors and do something a little bit more neutral if you wanted to [Applause] because i know for blanket display i kind of like things a little bit more neutral because my blankets are very colorful because we have some in our room okay well we appreciate you sharing our videos out there we try i mean we've got hundreds of tutorial videos but sometimes we're coming up on a thousand videos we'll probably pass that this year at some point and sometimes our like even when you search it the video doesn't come up because it's like buried in the archives of youtube sometimes i can't even find them we try to make playlists those help a lot well and some of those videos are four and five years old now so you know there's new stuff happening there's new products there's new techniques that we've learned i got new hair i don't wear glasses anymore they've got new teeth it's funny people will find us on the older videos and they'll be like well you know it's kind of like when you're going through the pictures your old family pictures and you're looking at like all your different haircuts and hairstyles over the years and glasses you wore and clothes you were wearing and then when you watch it on video you're just like oh i can't believe i wore that molly says jamie looks younger now yeah she's working on it she's fighting she's fighting old i'm not fighting right on off [Laughter] noah we were broke as a joke and if you guys think we're busy now we were way busy then and sometimes when you take a little better care of yourself you just look a little younger mama was tired but sometimes you gotta hustle i'm so glad for that time that we have that we did all those things because i feel like i pull from that quite often every now and then you gotta pull an all-nighter well and also it's like we were we were decent at painting furniture and doing things and crafting but when we started i had used the lathe on one project in wood shop when i was 17. so i was hoping we're like we're adequate diyers um well a lot of times we're doing things for the first time while we're live or while we're making a video we'll like google it before we do it i think sometimes diy just goes down to confidence and the more that you do it's kind of like a muscle the more you work your diy skills the better you are even if it's not something you've done before just because you're confident in it and you're not worried about messing up well my sister barbara has one of my old legs because i had one that the motor was getting tired on it and i gave it to my dad and she snagged it from him and she's not doing like big production with it all the time so she if it runs a little slower she's okay um she doesn't bother her like me i'm like i mean i need to turn it at full speed so we got a new one um but she's been getting into woodworking and using her lathe and she's making some cool stuff yeah my kids like to turn woods that sometimes get out in the garage with them i haven't turned a whole lot jack jack gets frustrated because he's like dad can you come watch me on the lathe right now and i i can't watch him as much as he wants to do stuff because i don't let jack run it by himself well yeah he's sick or redrick either rhedrick's knight jack is actually more cautious with stuff yeah rhetoric just kind of goes for stuff jack when rodrick paints he paints with his whole body jack is a little bit neater he did get paint on him yesterday but not much he was helping us with the product we're working on big kids big kids went to the mall and aunt mariah and jack had to stay behind so he got to work with us all right in just a sec here i'll put these rods in so you can kind of see what they're going to look like across i think the copper i just i'm loving the way it looks with this is this this is pantry door or sweetie jane um this is pantry door okay sometimes i mix pantry doors i know and it really throws me off because now i don't know which color is which anita we're working on a display for our new decoupage paper but it can also be used for blankets because we know not everybody's going to display decoupage paper or like a grain sack collection really any fabric that you want to drape over so this is an old door we've got some electrical uh what are these called they're they're just brackets they're used for conduit to put electrical flat right here and then we've got some copper pipes it's about to come together we think yeah we're almost we're almost there i gotta move my tools and these are silver colored and so because we have the copper piping i've been using our copper patina which is pennies from heaven to match them so it's a pretty good match well and you could if let's say you just wanted like a fun towel rack i think this would like you could take this same concept with like an old piece of salvage wood and make like a fun towel rack in your bathroom or your kitchen or like even inside your cupboard door for like a bunk house where you have a bunch of people like a cabin or whatever this would be way fun for towel storage because you always need room for especially when you've got family yeah you don't have to do like the whole thing you could just you know put a couple towels on it or whatever um i'm trying to see where we're gonna end up okay so i think one more i'm done no i don't want to make people squat down so if i do one more here and then one more here it'll be it'll be up at like right there as well that's how many that'll be one two three four five six seven eight that we got on one side okay so two doors we'll do all the papers we'll do all the designs we have right now it's all right we got a long wall okay so let me get those on then we can start getting the bars in here lolly says that you could add your yarn cord paint brushes craft display you can do just about whatever you want on on here that needs that needs hung up spring break's coming is anybody going on any fun trips i always love hearing about what people have going on i know we never go anywhere our kids are just excited that we're taking them with us they're like they don't even care that disneyland's closed unless you're local to california they're like you have to be a california resident with a license if you're an adult i'm like debbie you want to take all the kids disneyland seven i'll go to the beach for the day you take the kids to disneyland she didn't respond i don't know why that's weird come on debbie she loves my kids and they love her so but you know there's sometimes just getting out of the house getting in a new place and going to some new restaurants is just all the fun you need yeah and we'll probably do thrifting and stuff and find some cool things maybe go to a swap meet or something while we're there the kids love that yeah the kids love well they love like the girls love it and the boys always somehow find like a bunch of stuffed animals and toys that i'm like you already have 500 of these yeah i don't know what the schedule's like we'll have to go live that saturday from there so we'll either be in debbie's shop i don't know where her schedule's like or the airbnb so we'll have to find some junk while we're there i don't know how we're going to get it home no would you have to drive too slow with the trailer yeah you do need to do a long drive if you pull a trailer in california they like really limit um 55 is your max speed limit on your trailer that adds like two hours to our trip we'll just have to jump like we did when we were in the ground so whatever fits in your suitcases that's what you get to take home okay so i've got two over there that are ready all right that one's ready for you to paint we just downsized um the side we used to have a bigger suv and so might actually be smaller now so not as much room for junk but it tows more so you know you win some you lose higher trolling capacity because less less cargo space in the actual vehicle can you guys even see what we're doing here oh yeah there we go all right we're almost there guys thanks for hanging out and and watching this thing come together it should be cool it's going to look really good on the wall with the paper on it does that dry enough up there maybe you didn't go live this week debbie they went live on facebook so you'll have to check it out there i think she's going to start doing her weekly lives on facebook the algorithm has been kind of weird i'm noticing that our live videos aren't getting pushed out as much like they used to be so she might be changing it because yeah we might also have to go to more edited videos just so you guys get the notifications on them and things youtube's trying to compete with like platforms like tick tock and instagram so they're they're doing they're pushing the shorts right now and all that stuff drop the junk to the top of the car we are going to get a car we need a cargo carrier but that's going to store our luggage and our car like the two-thirds of the top of the car is a sun roof so you can't really put junk on that or you probably shouldn't no you can get a rack that goes over the top of that racks are good i love racks i think they make vehicles look tough we're gonna look like the beverly hillbillies okay i think we're ready paint that one uh i'm gonna get rid of this nail down here so capes and cottages this is pantry door by sweet pickens um it's one of the colors that only comes in sweet pigeons not also in uh our house finishes and it was actually made because sasha had an antique pantry door that she wanted to mimic the color and so this is that color and it's really the perfect vintagey green and i use it on doors all the time in fact it's really close to earlier i showed you guys the doorknob that came from this um it's super close to the original green color sorry i'm dropping stuff so here's the original green that the door was at one time painted see how close that is see how close that is to pantry doors so this is going to look great on there a lot of times i'll mix pantry door with salt wash to do a base coat so then when i paint white over the top it gets chippy or apothecary is fairly close to this so i know not everybody loves milk paint because it's a little unpredictable so you can also use apothecary it's fairly similar so if you're just tuning in we're going to get caps for these they make the cats i think they're like 50 cents a piece all in on this we're probably we usually buy these doors for about 20 25 bucks somewhere in there free sometimes we get them for free um and then i'm about thirty dollars on the copper tubing and then probably about three dollars on these brackets and screws so you know it's about a fifty dollar project to do all of this but man that's looking cool that's the next level next level is what we say when we're like would that turn out good or when stuff turns out bad we say that and then i uh seven or eight dollars in caps to buy they don't make knobs like that anymore you can find reproduction knobs they are really expensive yeah and they on your it's you're right though they just don't look quite the same we have a whole bunch of knobs um in the house that are either antique or really good reproductions or doors without knobs because we're waiting on that i told that before we leave we've got to get knobs on my parents room so they can lock their room because not only will my kids be here while we're in texas but ty and mariah are staying here and watching our kids in the house and the old people and my parents in case they need something they're pretty good occasionally we have issues like we did monday where we've got low blood sugar or breathing issues so it's always good to have somebody here with them all right i'm just running this off their kids are all gonna be here yeah we're gonna have a house full while we're gone it's gonna be great okay so i'm gonna pull this off in just a second and then uh i just gotta dry this and then we'll put a couple papers on here do you wanna try this a couple more papers over there that way we can start getting ready to display them i think this is mostly dry we got a little bonus copper down here i'm really you know i've never seen the pennies from heaven up against other actual copper it's such a close match oh yeah they did good i'll i will come back and we'll pull all these out and i'll kind of touch up some of the coffee it might need sanded too where just a couple places where the paint's loose i'm just gonna leave it okay all right let's pull the camera back all right i'm gonna move this i don't want to dunk any paint anywhere we don't need any paint accidents today no [Music] yeah i was just going to save it here can you grab that end over there give me a second this is heavy solid door so i was going to grab it in the middle then we'll just slide it down all right so there's the whole thing i think it turned out good you're done good we kind of we kind of so debbie has a display similar to this i think i used the copper is a little different than what she used but basically same concept in old door she cut out so she cut out the middle and put strips in it oh okay so instead of going above it she put strips in between it i mostly just want to see oh i guess i should have put it where they could actually yeah i'll just we're going to see how the paper hangs you want to go see if you got an old blanket to see what that looks like on here too real quick they'll get the point well and you know maybe we can just take a punch some stuff around so they can no um so sue hendricks dropped off some canvases as i was going to take apart those and put them on the wall so you can still see the basic design of the paper like really well that's good i think that's really pretty and i'm glad that we went with this color it's like like we the walls are white in the shop so this is going to really pop would be a fun display i don't know weigh in what do you guys think do you like it i feel like it's going to work out really well i'm always trying to find ways to use this copper pipe we used it in our lamp could you guys see i'll show you guys um so right there that lamp we did a video on that and that's just copper piping there's that bent it you had to re-bend it off camera because it wasn't quite it was the first time for that i've actually seen jewelry displays made with this copper piping that's been on my list of things to do it's well it's for what it is and how it looks it's really inexpensive yeah for for five it's basically a dollar a foot which is cheaper than lumber right now that's why our new uh racks at the shop are not wood yeah patricia you could also hang something from above like on an island or like with pots or something on it that would be cool way fun okay so we're gonna take this paper off if you guys are just tuning in you can pick up the pennies from heaven the pantry door milk paint and the decoupage paper at jamierayvintage.com we actually also have retailers so if you go to jrbwholesale.com you can go to our review yeah the links in this video you can check out our retailer map but i do suggest because we carry a ton of products not every retailer carries all of them so contact that retailer first and make sure they have the decoupage paper the woods product or stencil that you're looking for so this is going to need to be but we'll drop the links when we're no longer lives that will drop the links specifically i'm just going to fold it in half again so this blanket if you guys saw my instagram post this is the one that jack was covered in the other day it was my secure it to your wall i don't quote me on this but i believe it came from my aunt bessie to my grandma i got it from my aunt willie and now it's mine and it's really tattered and old but whoops gotta get those caps on there i'm just there we go there we go so you can do a similar thing with blankets that would look awesome i would probably space the blankets like jamie said earlier out farther yeah i would not join this close together i'd actually like maybe put like inches maybe put like three or four blankets on there um and we are going to hang this to the wall with a french cleat you can find them at your local hardware store or on amazon and it will secure it um what it does is we have a video showing how to hang old windows but you screw it to the wall then you screw it to the back of your piece and then you slide it on and it'll secure it because this is really heavy and so just like a little like hook or whatever would not be sufficient to making this safe all right guys um is there anything else you tell them no did you tell them where to find the paper at yeah jamie rayvintage.com for the paint products we used jrvhome.com if you're interested in a home decor or clothing be sure to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to jamie ray vintage for more diy love you guys thanks for joining us have a good one", "jIOMEC_El0Y": "it's affecting everybody these days [Music] no in today's video we're going to be testing out tick tock hacks and to see if they actually work [Music] guys we've got multilingual make sure you check out their new tkor channel that's all in spanish grace it looks like we're going to be cooking we are going to be cooking we are going to be making things this we're going to be cooking and it was grace's idea this seems like something i can actually do though pancakes are one of my favorite thing in the whole entire world i have come to love tik tok also it's one of those things that you either love it hate it or you just embrace it here's the basic idea we're going to test out which tick tock viral videos are camera trickery and which ones are actually real pancakes are my favorite food in the whole entire world partly because it's the easiest thing to make and it's really hard to mess up so we're going to see if the viral video of cooking a pancake in a rice cooker can actually be done so i think you showed this to me and it's just pancake batter you add it to the rice cooker and let it cook slowly for how long i don't know but it's supposed to it's supposed to just turn into like one really thick pancake that's cooked nicely all the way through it's exciting so we need to coat the thing with oil so you coat the rice cooker with even though it's a non-stick coat olive oil i don't know what are you supposed to use not olive oil i guess if that's how you like your pancakes you could do that but sure can't imagine it's the best okay so from the tik tok video which mark thankfully reminded me about that one cycle of cooking the rice was enough so he dumped it into the rice cooker i don't want to do that i want to mix it here first because i don't trust myself mixing everything in the rice cooker plus we've got a whisk and that way we avoid the nonstick surface that we've already put in there you literally just take like a pancake mix the whole thing yeah how about like one batch two cups of this stuff one cup milk and two eggs two cups of this one cup of milk [Music] two eggs [Music] that's supposed to yield 14 pancakes but we're making one big one we're going to try and make one pancake that's worth 14. this one's cool it involves toilet paper a fan and tape the idea is that it just kind of stays out in front of it as a twisting shape right yeah but it would need the blowing air to stay out so does she like hold it until it starts going yeah all right let go [Music] wow maybe turn it up [Music] ah it has shredded itself okay so that one didn't work super well okay it did look like it kind of wanted to work but where i was holding it it had twisted itself up gotcha i'm just gonna go to high yeah it's kind of working a little bit it is kind of working it does seem like it's mostly just that it's wrinkled still at the end why is ours look like this i don't know high five it's really good at high well it's more like a high one once we get five of them on it might be like a high five oh you broke it grace so this tick tock video hack trick thing i declare as maybe if you have the right equipment since we're not using the exact same fan we have a hard time telling if it would work so we got the swirlies and then you know like hers just was very very tall and i don't know why different shape of fan blades different size holding them out more hers was bigger i think than this and i think like our fan blades are very flimsy and like we saw when we took the toilet paper off this sped up so i think any time it has interference it gets a little unhappy when i first told nate we were making piranha solution he said what and so here we are so i am following princeton's rules for piranha solution we're going to use an acid which is sulfuric acid and then we're going to use hydrogen peroxide this is incredibly aggressive this is incredibly aggressive it's a 35 solution of hydrogen peroxide the stuff you get at the brown bottles at the store is a three percent solution so it's a lot stronger piranha solution is able to dissolve anything so that's what this guy did on tick-tock is he dissolved a piece of toilet paper or paper towel in the solution and it literally like instantly piranha solution can exceed temperatures of 100 degrees when you mix these two chemicals together which is pretty crazy that's a pretty aggressive exothermic reaction that's why we've got pyrex for the glass it's microwave safe and everything can take a decent amount of heat yep so hopefully all of our reaction will happen in that okay so here's the sulfuric acid the piranha solution is a mixture of a three to one ratio so we're using three of the sulfuric acid so that's going to be 120 milliliters and then the hydrogen peroxide we're going to use 40 milliliters princeton told us to put the sulfuric acid in first and then we're going to use a different one oh look at it [Music] ready when you are i guess okay ready [Music] hey it went there's not really any brown gucky stuff left though it's gone [Music] oh there's the brown gucci stuff you were talking about oh and now the brown gucci stuff is breaking down too that's so crazy to be honest this deserves a yeehaw because i was so scared it wasn't gonna work [Music] this is honestly the coolest thing that i've done yet toilet paper highly processed plywood less processed i'm not going to just drop it in i'm just going to dip part of it in oh my gosh it's also reacting with any of the like glue that makes up the wood that's nice and crazy and then let's yeah you can see it's just kind of eating away in itself clearly clearing it all away that's so cool look at this layer it's created to simulate what would happen if we stuck a finger in it i have a hot dog i'm just gonna cause it's very finger like it doesn't react as fast as the toilet paper but it's fizzing i feel like it's because this is so much denser well it's incredibly processed yeah it's not a perfect analog for humans you know what that's enough i don't i don't want to have the stuff in here anymore even with all our doors open tick tock trend 10 out of 10 should you try this at home absolutely not you guys don't need to make this the fumes were incredible and like we are all a little bit itchy from this we handled it properly we were like protection super cool video super cool what happened here but do not try this at home don't do it in other news you can make a pancake at home let's look at our pancake yeah all right so we are we're about four cycles right yeah four cycles of our rice cooker because after the first one's like the top middle especially was still just liquid like completely liquid look at that that looks like uh a cake it's not a pancake it's a cake i think we could have done one last cycle i think you might be right yeah we're just learning obviously but it's so crispy on top a little bit of crispiness that looks pretty evenly cooked all the way through i gotta say this looks so good [Music] always so delicious all right i'm gonna give this a try take a bite right out of the middle here it's got lots of syrup on it the bottom is i think a little too crispy i like my pancakes crispy so i like it it adds a very subtle crunch there's a lot of syrup in there now i would say that this is a very valid option for a whole bread like if you're cooking breakfast for multiple people obviously not for like 20 people unless you have a whole lot of rice cookers but this is great you give each person like a quarter or six of this as part of a breakfast that's pretty good you just go yeah just put butter on syrup on it like it's a pancake it's just shaped like cake cake all right mark hop in here and get something that's sharp it was so rich it rise but i didn't rise yeah it grew some but not a ton i recommend everyone try this at home so we're gonna head outside and do this last one i saw this and sent it to mark because it looked so epic so basically it's this flowers and smoke bomb i want to know if this works or if this was completely fake so the idea is that it will dye the flowers yes pieces of me think this is fake and not real and they like spray painted them maybe um i have dyed flowers using the capillary action where you put them in the food coloring they soak up come through the flowers it's not like a perfectly even color when you do it like that right right so in this tik tok which i haven't seen yet does it it just turns like completely the color it's just like kind of splotchy smoke bomby kind of flower looking but we're gonna stick these in here and see if we can get some smoke bomb okay so our first test is going to be this um it's pain-free water-soluble and non-toxic which is good so i'm going to launch this into there i don't know what color this is going to be because it's a gender reveal it probably was labeled on the wrapper but that's been removed but here we are so we're gonna find out the gender of our flowers all right nate ready kind of i don't know what's gonna happen this might be terrible like line that up like here okay ready [Music] do we do we wanna do another one not into this container so we know if this is gonna be like dangerous it's a girl pretty powerful three two one also pink oh it's a girl again guess we got a pink pack how long do we let it the guy just kind of like close the container and then carried it somewhere to his girlfriend and then made her wear like some gloves while she handled the flowers probably just whatever it is now is where it's going well they are pink also we got the lid from the container all right so that is very pink at the moment it doesn't stick a ton wow i'm actually like shocked that this worked i don't know why i guess just because it just didn't look like it was going to work on tik tok but this is actually kind of cool so here's how this one works we just light that so it's blue put the cover on maybe and then whatever color smoke comes up out of it and we see if it stains everything [Music] yay blue flowers that's really letting out all the blue when you keep it concentrated yeah when it's in the air it dissipates but all in a container it's pretty concentrated it's gonna be really blue i bet we definitely have a nice blue circle on the ground oh yeah boy i've got some very pink shoes now well we've got some very blue glass so that i would say is stained it got the stem a lot too obviously whether you want that or not uh but like yeah it's color stays on this works way better honestly because the pink has my it's all over my fingers but with this smoke bomb like you said like it's not shaking off at all plus if you want your flowers to smell like fireworks then it really you're into that i like how like it has that really cool effect of like some of it's very colored in others it's just like a hint so all in all i'd say our tik tok trend video even the fan one that may have just been our equipment yeah i don't think it was faked or anything i think it was real it's just you have to have the right kind of fan it was a great day hey guys if you like this kind of content make sure you check out that

we grow 400 different kinds of crops worth over 50 billion dollars before they even get to the first point of processing we do everything we have very very small farms and we have big farms and we have all the processing that goes along with it we ship products up and down the state of california we sell them at farmers markets and we ship them across the country and around the globe california agriculture is exciting it's about food feed fuel flowers forest products and fun and that's what you're going to have today i want to thank all of the volunteers who helped put this together to the

them every day we have veterinarians we have technicians we have writers and public affairs people it's a great place to work supporting our number one industry california agriculture have fun learning about what we're all about in california farming thank you enjoy the day thanks karen there is no bigger ambassador for agriculture than karen ross so today is all about having fun and learning about the top 10 commodities here in california so i hope you all have your workbook here we are going to be following along i am too and we're going to start with the number 10th commodity here in california which is tomatoes did you know there are more than 2 750 different varieties of tomatoes out there crazy right and that 96 of processed tomatoes eaten in california start right in the nation start right here in california and i know one man who knows this it's alec watson from tomato wellness you have a great presentation here with all of these products that come from tomatoes here in california correct all right well i will let you take it away sir hi well yes alec watson i'm with the tomato products wellness council we represent the entire usa tomato products industry and so tomato products are any tomato that comes in cans jars even the boxes all the different forms you can have and that represents canned tomatoes salsas soups um pasta sauce pizza sauce all of our favorite things uh generally start with tomatoes and so we are here in california because this is where as tracy just said 96 of all of the tomatoes that are used for these type of products come from here in the central valley of california and this is really the greatest growing region for tomatoes in the entire world we actually represent almost a third of all the processed tomatoes come from here in california in the entire world and so you can see all these different products our job we love being here because what we want to do is show people where their food comes from we love ag in the classroom we love that you guys are are teaching children at an early age where their food comes from so where where we are right now in the process growing these tomatoes is a year-round process right now we're in uh the late winter right now they're planting seeds in trays where they're actually growing them in greenhouses this is to protect them to get them strong and build them up so that they'll grow about six or eight inches tall in the next week or so they're going to transplant them out of those greenhouses into the tomato fields so all through the spring they'll enjoy you know some nice gentle showers here in california in the summertime when that heat comes on that's that mediterranean climate that california is known for and why we have such great agriculture that's what really turns these tomatoes into these red ripe beautiful delicious tomatoes at the end of the summer is when all of the tomato plants are gonna all start ripening at the same time and that's when they come in with giant harvesters these giant tractors that will go up and down the tomato fields and they'll actually pull the entire plant out of the ground this harvester actually separates the plant from the tomatoes and actually on that harvester it even has a little laser that can actually see as the tomatoes are going through it has little mechanical fingers that kick out the tomatoes that aren't red and ripe like if any um are have any blemishes or are still yellow haven't quite ripened all the way this will actually kick them out back into the field to turn into fertilizer for next year so all those tomatoes are then loaded onto a truck as the harvester goes it puts him in this giant truck right beside it those trucks are what you see if you guys live or anywhere around the central valley you'll see those trucks 24 hours a day running up and down the roads and everywhere around tomato country full of these tomatoes and we see those giant trucks with two giant gondolas full of tomatoes piling out the top that's almost 300 000 tomatoes in each of those trucks and they're just running non-stop and they run them to usually right nearby about 15-20 miles away is where the cannery is as soon as it gets to the cannery they're dumped into a water flume they're taken inside they're cleaned they're diced they're turned into ketchup or salsa or soup or whatever they're making it into and then within three to six hours those tomatoes that were just in the field are now sealed inside one of these cans or jars or in the boxes any of these ways and that locks it in and that really is the secret to why these are so great because as soon as you pick a fruit or anything off of a vine it starts losing its nutrients it starts losing some of its flavor the whole idea is you either want to eat it right away or you want to seal it in cans or you want to freeze it like if it's broccoli or spinach and then you can use these all year long so once it's um out of the cannery they seal them up into those cans they then go to your favorite restaurants or to your grocery store so you have cans all year long and really the whole idea here is that and you in california probably know this but uh seasonality is really important these these fruits and vegetables all have a time of year when they're grown and that when they're gonna taste the best and so we really take pride in harvesting those those summer tomatoes at their red ripe peak when they're the most flavorful the most delicious and then packing it into cans and jars and making sure you know and it's just something to keep in mind when you're cooking year round if it's not tomato season you're going to want to use canned jars for the best flavor because it's locking in the flavor and nutrients of summer all year long so today we're going to give you guys a little bit of a treat i have an assistant today clover watson is going to help me do a little cooking demo today we're going to show you how you can make english muffin pizzas so you want to grab your apron you guys at home can do this i recommend that you guys have parent supervision because there is a part where you'll actually have uh to either use an oven or a microwave you can't eat them cold but it's uh it's up to you some people like them cold um but our first step is that we take an english muffin i'll open and we're gonna open it up we're going so first we get this english muffin and what we want to do is you just want to pop it open sometimes they're harder than others beautiful and then we're gonna make a little concoction of uh some california olive oil and garlic powder and oregano and so this is our base to get our our pizza nice and flavorful there you go nicely done nicely done now you use a little brush brush these down nicely done now what you would want to do is now actually pop these in the oven for about five minutes just get them nice and crispy get like a nice little base again this is kind of a voluntary step you know this is how i have to and then we'll use the magic of television to imagine we just did that and now we're going to add our tomato sauce a pizza is crust cheese and sauce anything else you do beyond that it's up to you but of those three things the most flavor is going to come from those tomatoes so you really want to make sure you get really nice oh yeah that's some good saucing right there and then we're going to go ahead and we're going to add our cheese make it good you like the cheese she's a lot of times cheese is our favorite part cheese is also a lot of fun we want to sprinkle on some nice cheese and then it's up to you what kind of pizza would you like to make pineapple okay we can go pineapple you can go olives you can go mushrooms you can go onions you can and then i like pepperonis i like to throw in a couple pepperonis so then you just put this together you could always top it off with even a little bit more cheese to kind of hold the toppings on that's a little secret and then you just gotta put these back in the oven and you can put them in for about five minutes you can actually even use the microwave um basically you just want to melt the cheese and then as soon as it pops out and you can add a little bit of fresh basil you can always just top it off with just a little bit of basil a little bit of olive oil on top is always really nice and then you can actually freeze these pop them in the freezer and put them in little ziploc bags these are actually a great way to um have like an easy lunch snack you can actually put this in your in your lunch box take it to school if you come home after school and you're just looking for a little snack these are real easy i mean we could do so many different recipes i mean you guys know you can easily put together some noodles just mix in some diced tomatoes or a marinara sauce just mix it all together put in whatever you want on top of that there's so many great things that all start with a can or a jar of tomato products and you can just make so much so we again we're just really happy to be here we hope you guys try this recipe let us know what you think and uh and thank you for supporting agriculture thanks for being here alec i love it i love that you put pineapple on pizza that sometimes is very controversial if i could say i'm not sure why this is controversial because i don't know any other food that anybody says like oh you can't have a bologna on your sandwich or you can't have you know it's like hey i think if you like pineapple i think you can you can do whatever you want i don't think that there's anything wrong with however anybody wants their pizzas we like that we like that about you and the sun is coming out which is a very crucial part of tomatoes that's why tomatoes grow so well here in the central valley right yeah yeah this is i mean it just this is the perfect place i mean like i said this is the number one region in the entire world for tomatoes we've grown better and than anywhere else in the world and and that comes up sometimes too people ask like oh do i need to buy expensive tomatoes imported from across the entire globe no no and and i think we have videos on our website that show some blind taste tests that really almost always in a blind taste test you're going to choose california tomatoes over something that's twice as much that's been shipped all the way around the globe so it's always great we actually recommend almost all these products you'll see when you look at it it'll say made in the usa it's a great thing to look for because not only are you supporting california farmers but you're supporting the local economy you're supporting the families that grow these tomatoes the truck drivers that go up and down the road um we we just really want people to be aware of you know looking for you know usa on their on their products well thank you for being here no one knows tomatoes more than this guy alec watson from tomato wellness thank you for being here and thank you for being here this is my assistant yeah a wonderful assistant i love the way you make pizza i love pineapple and olives on my pizza too well we're going to keep things moving we're going from the 10th to the ninth commodity here which is floriculture in california now the floor culture is here's a fun fact for you the main expense in cut flower production is labor cost it requires up to 12 workers per acre which makes sense when you think about it because all the flowers out there and plants have to be uh hand cut by folks out there so that is a big expense and also did you know that 75 of cut flowers grown in the united states come from california that's outstanding and part of that reason is because of the climate here the sun the mediterranean climate that is what flowers and greens and all kinds of things love and thrive on so we are going to get ready here and talk about cut flowers greenhouses all those good things in california and here to join me in just a moment is marty espy from florafresh he has a b what do you guys see this this is a beautiful table worth of flowers that i can't wait to uh get my hands on here this is a beautiful beautiful hey marty hey how are you getting my over here yeah i love you have one of the best tables look at this i get to have fun everybody you know there's ag industries all across california but i i get to work with the probably the most beautiful part of agriculture out of california uh well i will take it away i i this these are one of my favorite the protea i love protea but i will let you take it away sir thank you uh we actually had kind of tying in with the with the state fair i saw his um his um kitchen smock we did a big display over the over the last five years at the california state fair and we'd bring in these big banksia proteas they're not in season right now and everything else was beautiful but people would stop and automatically go to those because they'd never seen them before but i wanted to welcome you all to the california flower booth similar to tomatoes california is one of the best places on the planet to grow flowers both in greenhouse and out in the fields it's a very diverse industry depending on what part of the state you're coming from so they grow flowers all the way from way up here at the oregon border sun valley's got some big ranches up there all down the coast all the way down to the mexican porter in san diego and they actually have fields now down in baja california so when the weather is not all that fabulous here it's beautiful in baja and they can ship up the snaps the larkspur the stock out of baja so our first our first stop kind of on our tour what i'm going to do is show you what commodities come out of what part of the state sun valley floral up in arcata california has the absolute perfect climate to grow bulb flowers so they do the irises the tulips the lilies the freesia this is actually from a local source but you can see this is what the tulips would look like they grow them in crates with the the soil they plant the bulbs i don't have a time frame but i think it's about eight weeks for them to develop into where they where they cut the the tulips and they don't actually cut them out of the trays they pull them out and then cut off the bulbs before they ship them to the wholesaler they would come to us in a 10 stem bunch they are sleeved and just so you know when you go either to your florist or if you go into the mass market always look on these sleeves is going to be an american grown tag and that way you know it comes from america what's happened over the years is california grown has sort of blended with american grown everybody's trying to take care of the the field the vase movement has gone nationwide and everybody's looking out for each other so we all try to work together and promote buying american grown flowers uh they if we move down the coast sorry i'm going to move around a little bit go down here into watsonville salinas this is a huge growing area been a place for oh almost 100 years there's both greenhouse and field grown flowers in that area because of the climate so they grow inside the greenhouse they'll grow their roses they do the gerbera daisies they put these little sleeves on them to protect them when they're shipping to the wholesalers or to the mass market so they don't get damaged and then out in the fields they grow all sorts of fun stuff like this is the crespedia they also call them billy balls uh this is becoming really really popular in our industry the anemones moss landing right over there on the coast right by the ocean is the most beautiful place in the world to grow calla lilies so we get lots and lots of calla lilies from that area and kind of the beginning of of where i was going to start is where do these flowers come from but you've had experiences with them so your mom has probably received the beautiful bouquet from a florist of of mixed flowers for mother's day last year was kind of a strange year in the wedding industry but you know your sister got married and she had this beautiful bridal bouquet in the backyard for the wedding and then of course there's always the dozen roses at valentine's day that makes everybody smile so you know where do these flowers come from they all come from california as we move down one of the biggest producers of california the single biggest producer out of california is down in the carpenteria oxnard santa barbara area they grow not only greenhouse flowers but they do a tremendous amount of field flowers as well and that's where you're going to find sorry i keep moving all of these different varieties of flowers plus many many more so your sunflowers your delphiniums larkspur beautiful dahlias there's fields and fields of dahlias there's a story that goes i don't know if it's true but the owner of nordstrom's bought a mansion up on the hill overlooking the valley that grew all the stock in larkspur so they could see all the beautiful flowers off their deck when they were sitting out having their california wine that night so and there's also like different varieties of individual flowers so this is your typical ranunculus that you would see this is a spin-off that's called a butterfly binocular so this is really really popular in weddings right now as well and as we continue down the state we get down to the san diego and mountain ranges in the south and that's where she was talking about the fabulous protease most of these varieties are actually native of africa and they bring the plants and they've hybridized them and growing them in california there's many many many different varieties of tortillas this is a pin cushion they also grow lots of field greens down in the south because the weather conditions are perfect so your myrtles your eucalyptuses your agonists all of those are are grown in the fields just because of the the good growing conditions several years ago there was an influx from europe especially from holland of growers that developed greenhouses most of them in the santa barbara area that brought technologies that had never been used in the california or in the united states so they brought these high-tech greenhouses built them and they grow a lot of their most of their products are grown hydroponically now we're used to growing flowers in the soil they did that in the fields and in the greenhouses years ago the dutch brought in the hydroponic system which runs water through a growing medium that the plants are in they computerize the fertilizer that goes into these plants but then they reclaim all the water that wasn't used filter it clean it re-fertilize it and use it again so it's a amazing way to save water and we all need to save water in california even though it's raining there's never enough water to go around so they're trying to share with other ag commodities something else that's really interesting quick question does anybody like ladybugs who likes ladybugs everybody likes ladybugs and i'll tell you why the california growers buy millions and millions of ladybugs every year and they release them in the greenhouses and in the fields now why would they do that because ladybugs are a good good insect ladybugs eat the bad insects so it saves the plants from having to be sprayed with chemicals and it keeps them healthy so it's a great great way organically to keep flowers from having any disease or pest problems so that's a huge a huge thing for the industry i think i may have reached my gambit of the tour so like i said there's production all the way from sun valley all the way down to the mexican border next time like i said when you're in go to your florist or you go to the mass market ask them for california grown flowers they'll always have them in stock and they'll be able to make whatever your arrangement you're looking for whether it's a special occasion or a bridal bouquet they could do in a lot of california flowers well thanks marty i love it so this is my fruit flower protea what's your favorite flower i actually am a bulb person i like all the varieties of tulips that are out there i only brought one sampling there are hundreds and hundreds of varieties of tulips the big tall french tulips there's parrot tulips that are green and red ruffled eggs oh greens yeah there's just many many many different varieties and that's one of the things too that the growers do they're constantly coming up with new varieties to get people interested in seeing and buying the flowers because it's something new yeah i know we always want something new with the flowers but these are and all these flowers are grown right here in california that's unbelievable i love it and the most important point that you pointed out was that to look for flowers with that big california grown or american grown sticker on it that's so important to our growers out there it's been a huge movement in california they've spent a number of years getting all of that set up so when it goes out into the especially the mass market world that it'll say california or american ground fabulous thank you for being here marty great job all right kids we are going to move to the eighth top commodity in california which is walnut so we're going to move over to walnuts here and did you know that uh walnuts are primarily grown in the central valley from reading to bakersfield now once planted it takes about four years for a tree to produce its first major crop but then get this a healthy walnut tree can produce crops for up to a hundred years that's almost a century of producing crops is that crazy and it's a super healthy snack you can tell your parents four grams of protein two grams of fiber per serving which is very good and did you know that here in california two-thirds of the world's walnuts are produced right here in california by our farmers unbelievable right everybody out there is that crazy so we are going to be talking to brooke bachmann from henderson farms about walnuts and i can see she's got a very healthy snack for us as well i'm very excited brooke trail mix of a good wanted trail mix so i will let you take it away thank you tracy yeah making me happy good thank you so represent the much my name is brooke bachman i live in northern california and work for a company called henderson farms in henderson holland we grow and manage both almonds and walnuts both ours and a lot of other growers in addition to a walnut hauler uh so we're pretty diversified but today i'm here to talk about the walnut part of what we do um a little bit about myself i am a first generation farmer so that means i am the first person in my family to go into farming i actually come from a military family my dad was in the navy so we grew up moving around all the time to different places all over the country and i ended up going into the navy reserve myself the first time i got exposed to agriculture and farming really for the first time was in college i went to cal poly and i actually studied science and math and went on to study weather but met a whole bunch of friends close friends even to this day that studied agriculture and farming and i was just hooked and fascinated on everything they studied and the fields that they went into so fast forward many years later and changing of life events and i ended up farming and going into ag myself so i tell you guys that just so you know you don't have to come from a long line of farmers and generations of farmers and agriculture to go into this industry um you don't even have to study in school as long as you have a willingness to learn and work hard you can get into this agriculture industry and farming some of the things i love about farming which might interest you guys is one just being outdoors and outside i love being in nature you get to see the crops and the trees grow the beautiful blooms of so many of the crops in addition to of course the nutrients and water that goes into growing these trees the pollination of the bees for me my background is weather so just how weather and the environment is so intimately involved and the effects of the crop and what you what you get is truly fascinating and of course who doesn't love the yummy food let's just face it here especially in california to get to enjoy all the fresh crops and food is just one of the highlights i come from a family who we gather around food all the time so that part's pretty important to me as well but let's start talking about walnuts and why they're unique so some fun facts about walnuts they are actually recognized as the oldest known tree food which is pretty fascinating and also one of the only handful of plants that you can find in both the western and the eastern hemispheres that means if you're in the atlantic ocean and decide to sail west or east no matter what direction you're going to end up somewhere that probably has walnuts so that's pretty fascinating so now on to the many uses of walnuts you might not know that there's more you can do with a walnut than just eat it so a lot of you are probably familiar with walnuts that in this state so this is called the meat of the walnut this is what you find on the very inside but in case you didn't know this is not how it grows on the tree so before you even get to the meat the delicious beautiful part that you eat there's actually another layer on the outside called the shell so some of you guys might be used to seeing these if you have a nutcracker you can crack the shell and then you find the beautiful meat inside but there's also different uses for the shell you can burn the shell to generate heat and power you can also grind it up really fine to use in sandblasting materials um and also in peddler believe it or not and then also in some countries they use it they grind it up and put it in snow tires to use attraction um for on the road so really interesting but this is not where it stops there's yet another layer to the walnut now the walnut trees are dormant right now so i can't go out and find this layer but this is a picture of the hole it's a green leathery hole of the walnut not um not what you not what you see a lot this is you can only find it on the tree during harvest time um so the hole also has many uses with the main one being primarily for animal bedding so you can see from the hole to the shell to the meat every part of the nut is used and consumed or used in some way which is also a really great thing to be a part of okay now let's get on to the wonderful reasons why we love to eat the walnuts um first they're super nutritious for you um in just one ounce of walnuts you find a lot of nutritional nutrition and nutrients that are optimal for great health especially for young growing kids like you so in one ounce you find two and a half grams of the omega-3 fatty acids which we all know are so good for you and an acid called ala and it's actually the walnut is the tree nut that has the most ala out of all the tree nut crops in addition to ala and omega-3 fatty acids also stocked full of antioxidants fiber and protein so this is a not just a delicious snack it's a super healthy one also okay so what we're going to do today um we're going to talk about the different ways we can put walnuts into our diet and one of my favorites is through a trail mix kind of like a granola trail mix so involved in that we have simple ingredients i've honed this down to five ingredients for you to make it easily at home but like all granolas and trail mixes you can easily add to this recipe and make it what you want i'm sure chocolate chips come to mind for a lot of you kids out there but the five basic ingredients are up here so you're gonna have four cups of oats then you're gonna have a cup of a half of your beautiful walnuts and then you're gonna have half cup each of your honey and olive oil and then a half tablespoon of cinnamon half teaspoon excuse me so i've already got some oats in here we're gonna add one more cup to make four cups just to show you how simple it is we're going to do a half cup of olive oil some people in it for the honey like to use maple syrup you can swap that out too i think the the honey and the walnuts have such a great uh flavor combination that i typically use to typically use honey for this so get a half cup of olive oil we're gonna kind of just approximate a half teaspoon of cinnamon and then about a half cup of honey other things you can add to this are coconut dried fruits anything of that nature that you wish so we're going to employ the magic of television again in this a little bit you're going to mix that all together really easy pop it in the oven on a baking dish for about 21 to 24 minutes at 3 350 and then you get a product that's beautiful nice and crisp granola trail mix since it does involve an oven make sure to have an adult around to assist or help you because it does get hot and keep watch of it so you don't burn that in your in your oven so this is one way you can incorporate walnuts into your diet another other ways that i love to walnuts and honey are a great combination in yogurt you can sprinkle them on salads in the evening or ice cream at night and one of my other favorite ways is just dipped in chocolate or with chocolate throughout the day so i hope you enjoyed learning about walnuts today and if you haven't had them i hope it inspires you to get out there and taste them would you like to sample tracy i would love your opinion this is walmart at least um tell me about the huller did you talk about the follower not too much oh tell me a little bit about that because that is fascinating it's a pretty cool thing yes so um we have a ammon hauler and a walnut huller the walnut hauler is actually pretty simple um but with walnuts um time is of the essence so as soon as they get off the tree into the truck you've got to get into the huller through it and out but it involves a lot of water and drying so it's pretty fascinating yes and as you mentioned there's a lot of careers that are involved with this ton of careers from the farming side to the the spraying and nutrient side to the management even at the huller you have a full-time crew during harvest 24 7 to make it happen 24 7. wow yeah and you know i don't know if folks know that our kids know but there is a specific time of year that walnuts are harvested you know and they they have seasonality too yes so typically in your october time frame is when walnuts start um and maybe for us it's about three or four weeks with the ones we manage and it overlaps a lot of times with ammons so it gets to be a busiest time of year oh yeah it's a busy time because you both like you said yes oh that is a busy time all right well thanks brooke hope you guys enjoyed that about walnuts thank you very much my friend we're going to keep it moving we're going to go to the seventh commodity which is lettuce now you probably know lettuce from your salads or your sandwiches you've had out there but did you know i didn't know this i did not know this this is a fun fact for me that lettuce is actually a member of the sunflower family that's crazy i had no idea also americans consume about 30 pounds of lettuce per person per year per year that's a lot of lettuce and have you guys heard of the salad bowl of the world that's monterey county well that is the top producing county of lettuce and lettuce is easy to grow but kind of like me it doesn't do well and cold and freezes easily so mild weather is best for lettuce just like with this girl right here so here to tell us more about lettuce is janelle seebeck from tamarind ansel thanks for joining us yes i'm excited to be here a lovely display of lettuce here so i will let you take it away thank you hi guys i'm so excited to be here on farm day i remember going to my farm day when i was in third grade and i was just telling them that i was interviewed on tv when i went to my farm day isn't that kind of crazy i remember that last night so anyway i'm here to talk to you about our number seven commodity in california which is lettuce i work for a grower harvester and shipper of lettuce and many other vegetables called tamar and nano in the salinas valley which you've already heard about the salinas valley from our flowers right so we don't only grow vegetables there there's so many other crops that we grow there just because it's the right temperature the soil is amazing being close to the ocean and having that valley there so tamamura and animal grows broccoli cauliflower we do red onions and you can see that there are so many different varieties of lettuce every variety has different taste texture color sizes i'm sure that you recognize several of these already we have romaine which many of you have probably had with caesar salad you've got your boston lettuce red leaf green leaf you've got red and green gem lettuces which are a lot smaller you've got your romaine hearts which is basically a rope the inside of a romaine they peel off the outer leaves you can also buy bagged salads at the grocery store which is fabulous you've got your iceberg lettuce spring mix and then those are some packaged already hydroponically grown boston lettuce which we heard about hydroponic in our flowers so it's kind of cool ag shares a lot of the same growing ways and regions so you're probably thinking what is so exciting about lettuce there's a lot of things that are pretty cool about lettuce and i am here to tell them about you tell them to you about it um we ship lettuce all the world yeah all over the country we go into canada into mexico we even ship some lettuce into taiwan so you guys know how long it takes to get to taiwan 18 days so we load it on a ship and it travels for 18 days all the way to taiwan they go all the way across the pacific ocean so we're so lucky to live in california where our lettuce is grown and we get our lettuce typically within two to three days of harvest so they harvest it out in the field put it in a carton in the field drive it to a cooler cool it down and then it gets loaded onto trucks and taken to your schools to your grocery stores to restaurants all over so that you can have your salad or any lettuce that you'd like to enjoy so now you see semis taking your lettuce to where it needs to go they're refrigerated semi trucks about 80 years ago iceberg lettuce which was the main type of lettuce that was eaten and grown what it what would they do is they would pack it into a carton a rail road carton put it on a train fill that big metal container full of ice and they'd ship it across the country so it'd go to new york it go to chicago and by the time they got there it was like one big iceberg just packed full of lettuce and ice and so that is why this is called iceberg lettuce because they would say the icebergs are here the icebergs are here when those trains would arrive with this lettuce so little fun fact that's how it got its name nowadays we don't do that anymore we have those trucks that you see on the freeway so you think how much lettuce do we really grow can you say california's number seven what does that mean so as an industry we ship one million one million of these boxes of lettuce a week you guys a week that's a ton do you know how many heads that is that's 24 million heads of just iceberg lettuce just this lettuce that doesn't include any of these other types of lettuce once you add those in it's over 80 million heads of lettuce think of how many salads that can make that's a ton so that's why it's so important that we take care of our farmland preserve it and appreciate how much california produces so you're wondering okay so obviously that's a lot of lettuce how do we grow all that takes about 85 days as of now to grow a romaine you know it's ready a lot of variables are how you know it's ready but it's each romaine right here 30 leaves on it when it's ready to harvest these leaves there's about 30 of them a little less but that's just a little fun fact for you um there each acre of lettuce has about 36 000 heads in it that could make 36 000 salads that's a ton an acre is about the size of a football field so obviously it takes thousands and thousands of acres to grow all of this lettuce for everyone in the country and other countries so it's really really fascinating um let's see what else do i have to tell you lots of time and patience and hard work goes into growing all these vegetables for you so what are ways that you enjoy your lettuce besides a salad who likes hamburgers i like hamburgers you probably put lettuce on your hamburgers what about salads you probably put lettuce on your salads and your sandwiches what about tacos you put lettuce on your tacos what if next time you're in and out you order your burger protein style so you wrap your lettuce your instead of a bun they use iceberg lettuce it is so yummy and that's how i personally order my burger so you should try it next time another thing you can do is next time you have tacos ditch the tortilla i know it might be hard to do that but ditch the tortilla and use a romaine leaf as a boat it's so yummy it's so crunchy you just put your meat in there your cheese your salsa it's delicious so you should try it or you could just go buy a bag salad and have it already ready for you that's perfectly fine too as long as you eat your lettuce that's what most important what are other ways that we use our lettuce well we could feed it to our pets if you have any ducks or chickens or rabbits they love it so when your mom or your grandma or your aunt or your cousin or your dad whoever when they're making their salad and you're gonna have let's say caesar salad when they're making it instead of throwing away the bottom of your romaine you can give it to your animals or i'm going to show you something else that's kind of cool that you can do with it we are going to do some art and who would have ever thought you could use lettuce to do art but i love art and so we're going to make it happen so something you're going to need before they throw this what you're going to do is you're going to get a piece of paper and we are going to make some flowers so you're going to take the bottom of the lettuce your romaine romaine heart gonna we're going to stamp it see this let's see let me put this down and i might need a little bit more paint but it looks like roses and i know valentine's day just passed but i'm sure your parents would still love a little art from you so you can use this and draw some stalks on it probably not as pretty as the flowers you just saw but it's abstract art okay and i think that looks pretty good for flowers coming from um some leftover romaine let it dry and you can hang it up in your house or give it to your grandma or anyone that you would like so i just want to say there's lots of varieties of lettuce i hope you learned about about them all enjoyed it and um eat your lettuce that is so cool it's kind of fun right oh my gosh did you come up with that that is so cool um the internet came up with it i love the idea i'm going to give to janelle janelle actually came up with that idea that is so cool and another little thing i like to do as you were saying um is to use these as a little vessel i make a little greek salad in there with little feta little tomatoes little olives and that and then use that as a little vessel to try it yeah so that's yes i mean well i can't compete with your art art there but that's just my little tip about lettuce but thank you so much you are so awesome love it so we're going to mix things up a little bit we're going to go to the fifth top commodity here in california which is one of my favorites strawberries so they are the fifth top commodity in california here and strawberries thrive climate for strawberry production seeds who knew that another fun fact about strawberries are they are harvested by hand and they don't continue to ripen after harvesting they're perennial plants but they're uh it can be planted annually for production as well and we harvest get this kids more than 2 billion pounds that is so crazy that's just to keep up with demand in my household because i love them that much here to talk to us about strawberries is mary bader she is a phd plant biology student at uc davis and you have a very cool very cool experiment you're going to show us yeah with strawberries so i will let you take it away i'm very interested by this thank you hi everyone i hope you are having as much fun as i am i think this is amazing i'm very excited to be here as she said my name is mary madera and i am a graduate student at uc davis but i work with the strawberry breeding program and so what we do with the breeding program is what farmers up and down the state do as well but we work with strawberries to try and make them healthier we want to make them more naturally resistant to diseases that make them yucky and not able to be harvested we try and understand how to make their yields better how to get more strawberries how to get bigger strawberries and i'm very excited because i work on flavor i study these guys to try and figure out how to make them taste even better than they already do so you can see i have lots of strawberry products here of course we have just our normal strawberries which i like to eat plain or i like to put them on salads or i like to do pretty much anything that we do with walnuts chocolate granola yogurt milkshakes all those good things you can do with strawberries and they're also super healthy think about oranges and lemons citrus they're really high in vitamin c well so are strawberries so if you're getting a little sick of your oranges or if they aren't really ripe and you're really needing an immunity boost grab a pack of strawberries really good in vitamin c of course they also you can drink them which is good i like i said strawberry milkshakes are my favorite if you want to be a little indulgent with your strawberries this is a frozen pack of strawberries so if the strawberries in the store don't look very good buy them fresh frozen that's a great alternative and again very good for smoothies and milkshakes this here is some strawberry jam that i myself made it's very easy very fun if you have parent or guardian supervision to help you out you can make your own jams and then this is fun these are freeze-dried so they're a little crunchier than your normal strawberry but still they're giving you that vitamin c and all that fiber that we love in strawberries i also make these at home i didn't make these but you can put these in the oven on a really low oven and they come out like a healthy alternative to candy so who doesn't love candy strawberries nature's candy but apart from strawberries and what we do at the breeding program i'm here to show you how you can extract strawberry dna yourself so if you don't know dna deoxyribonucleic acid is basically the instruction manual for all living things i have dna the dna in my cells tells me to be me the dna in your cells follows you to you and the dna in these strawberries tells the strawberry to be a strawberry so let's extract them it's very easy there should be a link on the screen that you can go to if you want the instructions and more strawberry fun facts and fun links later on so click that link if you want to do this at home but i'm going to show you how right now so i like to put them in a baggie we want to mash these up into basically a pulp a blender works too so we're going to mash these up i like using baggies especially with little kids keeps it clean and it makes my life easier so i don't have to clean up after a bunch of little kids so you want to mash these up and just like the other people food network style i have some pre-mashed it's a really nice kind of soup consistency so now what i'm going to do is something a little weird i'm going to add soap so don't eat this it has soap in it so this fun green liquid is just normal green dish soap and a lot of salt and some water and this is what i call the extraction liquid so this soapy salty water i'm going to mix with the strawberry pulp and this is going to break open all those little strawberry cells to release that dna so you want to give this a really good mix and again don't worry there's a video on that link if you can't see what i'm doing so we're going to mix that up and now this is another one of my favorite parts if you're familiar with the baking soda vinegar volcano we're going to do a miniature version so this is just [Music] i'm gonna and it's gonna start to fizz in that acid and that's gonna help us get more dna so it's turning kind of a weird purpley color it's getting nice and foamy again you can see this on the video on the link really really well and now what we're going to do that this is nice and mixed and nice and neutralized like that volcano i'm going to strain it because what this is doing this is doing several things first off it's getting out the chunks that i didn't blend up it's also getting out those pesky seeds so if you didn't know this strawberry seeds aren't actually seeds there's something called a keens and they're known as true fruits and that's just uh in um opposition to like an orange or an apple where the seeds are on the inside strawberries have all these little seedy aquine structures on the outside fun fact there are about two to three hundred on this strawberry alone and if you don't believe me i challenge you to go home get a strawberry pick them off one by one and count them and then let me know how many were actually on this guy it'll blow your mind but we want to get rid of these so we've strained it through and now you just need a tall glass i'm using a salt shaker because that's what i had at home it's nice and clear we're going to dump this in here so you can see again this is purple it's super salty it's gonna taste like the ocean it's soapy it's not good don't eat it it smells really nice but trust me it'll make you sick so this is a step that's good to have parent or guardian supervision this is 91 alcohol rubbing alcohol we're all familiar with it for sanitizing so this is ice cold the colder and the higher the percentage the better this will work but you can also use 70 if that's what you have if i can get this guy open there we go so now what you want to do this is the fun part is everybody ready are you paying attention we're going to slowly pour this cold alcohol into this jar we're going to give it a little bit of time the dna is a little shy and what we're going to see is it's going to float to the top literally the dna the instructions for life it's in every living organism it's in all the foods you eat except things like salt and water even sugar which i made that jam with came from a plant it had dna so i don't know if you can see this again if you can't don't fret go to that link but what i see are all these stringy snotty strands of bubbles floating to the top of this clear layer and what that is is dna surrounded by some proteins which basically are like the librarians helping us read the dna and so then what you can do again it's a little shy you can take a toothpick or paperclip works really well and all that snotty goodness is dna so it doesn't look like much but this again tells the strawberry to be a strawberry it tells me to be me it tells your dog to be a dog it's an every living thing and again if this was cold or alcohol there'd be a whole lot of us at the top and the reason this works so well is strawberry is called an octoploid that means it has eight copies of all of its dna whereas you and i as humans only have two so even though it's this tiny little plant and you might not think much of it and it doesn't talk and it doesn't go to school it has four times the copies of dna that you and i have and that's why there's so much of this goopy snotty dna coming out of just that one very cool easy to do at home very important in my lab i have a way to get this really clean and really pure and i also have a way to read it so again that's how we determine if this strawberry is going to be susceptible to a disease that's really hard for farmers it might tell me how sweet it might be what it might taste like and together we can put all that together to make better strawberries for farmers and tastier strawberries for consumers so i'm a big fan grab some strawberries right they're great they're nature's candies and there's how many varieties of strawberries oh so many varieties that's what i mean right people think there's just one there's hundreds right of different ones just like apples all kinds all kinds all kinds so you're a plant biology student tell kids out there kind of different careers that they could go into maybe from that from getting a degree so many in fact i don't even know i could become a teacher i could become a full-time researcher like i do now i could work with farmers which again strawberries are hand-picked which is astounding and [Music] career for me i could go on policy i could work in sacramento which is really local all sorts of things to do with an upper degree or just continue doing outreach like this i love it i love i love strawberries you you're good great mary all right again we're gonna switch it up we're going to the sixth commodity which is pistachios another one of my favorites actually uh now pistachios are again the sixth top commodity here in california they are native to the middle east uh because the climate kind of like california here pistachios need long dry summers and moderately cold winters to grow well now here's a fun fact about pistachios again i don't know this they actually resemble grapes while they are growing on a tree pistachios are also alternate bearing which means that one year is going to be heavier and then the next year's going to be lighter and then back and forth back and forth kern county leads the state in production and get this california produces 99 percent of the u.s pistachio crop which means that like all of the pistachios in the country come from right here in california which is pretty cool and here to tell us a little bit more about it is lee smith from liberty pistachios thank you for having like the world's easiest name by the way lee uh pistachios you can't eat just one no absolutely not good for you that's job security for you but you can't eat just one pistachio they are addictive so i will let you take it away sir tell us about pistachios yeah great all right well good morning everybody uh my name is lee smith i am a pistachio farmer in the woodland california area um we're here today to talk about california's sixth most valuable crop the pistachio for those you who are not familiar with the pistachio maybe some of your younger kids pistachio is a nut uh it does grow on a tree and we do grow it in very large orchard orchards typically the nut is this uh this little guy here uh it has a shell around the outside of it that we peel off and when we peel that shell off there is the kernel inside which is what we eat and we've got a big handful of kernels here is what we we typically like to eat my company liberty pistachio uh farms about 1 100 acres of pistachios uh in the sacramento valley uh just to put that in perspective that's about a 150 000 individual trees that we take care of on that farm so a lot of fun some history about uh california pistachios we've had pistachios in california now for over a hundred years so they've been around a long time today there's about 523 000 acres planted in the state at any one time that's a lot of pistachios and for kids that aren't sure what 523 000 acres looks like that's basically the size of los angeles city times two is how much of the state that actually covers up so a lot of pistachios out there um pistachios are a very valuable crop to california's economy um the industry just marked it's uh kind of a big deal this year that they went over a billion pounds harvested in 2020 so really kind of a neat thing that we saw happen for some perspective what that does for california's economy that billion pounds of pistachios is valued somewhere about three billion dollars so really really a big part of california's ag economy um on my farm here in woodland we've got four full-time employees and i've also got groups of seasonal workers that'll come help me out from time to time um the big thing i really want to point out there though is this industry is very important to california's economy because it brings in roughly 40 000 jobs by itself and that is huge for both the state and for the california ag economy um we usually buy pistachios in little bags like this or or uh and usually in this in-shell variety um one of these bags these are a little bit smaller bag one sixteen one ounce uh or 16 ounce one pound bag of pistachios will have roughly 780 nuts in it so it's a lot of nuts in a little bag and another fun fact if you uh if you laid all those nuts that we produce that billion pounds of nuts end to end we can go to the moon we can go to the moon and back and we can do it 20 times so there's lots and lots of pistachios that come right here in california about 25 percent of those pistachios one fourth of them end up getting consumed in america so we're producing here in california a large chunk of it just to feed ourselves which is a really a really great thing um let's see so every american if you break that down into the numbers every american then is consuming about 500 individual pistachios every year so i want to make sure you kids are eating your 500 pistachios every year right some of you may have never seen a pistachio but that's how many americans are eating it's really a fun fact so as americans we do love a pistachio um as we mentioned earlier uh pistachios are native to the middle east they come from countries originally like iran afghanistan turkey syria um our uh pistachios are a very old crop they've been cultivated for what some archaeologists say over 10 000 years or people have been consuming pistachios for over 10 000 years they were even mentioned in the bible they they really go way back they're really a basic food uh that a lot of people have eaten for many many many years um they're also there's a reason for that they're healthy so pistachios are very very healthy they're high in fiber they're high in protein high in potassium uh they're a lot of the good things that are are there for you to help grow a healthy body and healthy bones so you got to make sure your kids are eating your pistachios one of the main reasons we grow in california is because they're well adapted to our climate pistachios are a drought-tolerant tree they're a sort of a desert plant themselves so they adapt well to the the hot dry summers that we have in our california central valley so that's one of the really the main drivers for the success of the industry is the climate that we have here in california we're going to talk a little bit more about that in a second um over 50 percent of the world's pistachios are grown in the u.s and yeah 98 99 of those are do come from california new mexico and arizona also contribute heavily to uh the california to the the crop that's grown here in the u.s so um some couple of folks are helping me out here today i've got uh the american um american pistachio uh apg american potassium growers association who's helping us uh provide some some things to look at here today and set in pistachio who is the the processor that i grow all of our our trees and nuts and send our nuts to so we're going to do a little activity here that shows something kind of interesting about pistachios and where they're grown in the world and why we grow them here in california why that's important so i'm going to shift over the other side and we're going to look at the geography of pistachios so pistachios are grown in just really a handful of places in the world which is which is kind of interesting so we're going to start here and just do a little quick geography lesson for you kids um you all know where california is so we're going to start right there with the with a pin uh the second leading place that we grow pistachios is going to be iran so we're going to go back over in the middle east which i mentioned earlier we're going to put a pin there it's kind of a small map sorry you have to see it there we go the next place is going to be turkey so we're going to follow here in the black sea and put one on turkey then we're going to be followed by syria which is just above it here next we have we're going to go into the southern hemisphere and go into australia which is an up and coming industry for them the next is going to be afghanistan followed by italy then we go back to the southern hemisphere and go into argentina back up to spain and then way over here into china and so what's really interesting about this is that a lot of the world's consumers are the traditional places where these uh these nuts come from so uh the middle east is one of the largest uh places where we ship california pistachios to and they do consume a lot of china being probably one of our largest export partners but what is really fun to show you is a a little uh lesson about latitude here right so pistachios are really only grown in very specific parts of the world and you can see how you can draw a line across the world at a certain latitude here in the northern hemisphere and then we repeat that in the southern hemisphere and you get a straight line and that's a very important thing to know because we only have the ability to grow pistachios in a very small part of the world because of our hot dry climate with nice cool winters so pistachios are are very picky trees they only like to be in very specific spots so that's my presentation for the day the statues are like me we don't i don't like the cold either so i totally get it nice and hot me too so but explain how statues look on the tree they don't look like that no they grow in what's called a rakus which is a kind of a big cluster it almost looks like a gray cluster almost like a great bunch right yeah they grow in this big kind of really pinkish purplish really pretty like rose gold almost exactly yeah they're really stunning on the tree and how many do you eat a day how many pistachios do you eat a day no i've got a bag in my pickup at all times i don't know how i have them you're my kind of guy lee i love it me too yeah kenny just won kenny just what well thank you so much i love pistachios good to learn all about it in the geography of them too all right we're going to keep things moving we are going to the fourth top commodity here in california which is cattle and calves there are more than 600 000 beef cattle on about 11 000 ranches in california who knew that and another fun fact 98 of beef cattle is used with less than half being eaten as beef crazy right now this probably is not a fun fact for anybody out there but the most popular form of beef served is ground beef of course all those hamburgers that we love and each of us get this adults eat about 80 pounds of beef per person per year is that crazy kids how many do you eat out there well to tell us more about it is jill schofield from the california beef council one of my good friends joe good to see you good to see you too thank you so much for having us thank you for being here so let's talk about cattle and cats what should the kids out there know i'll let you take it away yes so i'm with the california beef council which means we get to work with the farmers and ranchers throughout california who raise beef cattle some of you may see cows along the side of the highway or the road when you're going to and from school if you're in school right now and you might see them kind of nibbling on grass or pasture and the interesting thing about cows is that because of their four-chambered stomach they can actually eat things that humans can't so grass alfalfa hay that sort of thing so when they're out there eating and digesting that kind of food product for them it's it's something that you and i would not be able to eat cows and calves start their life on a ranch typically where calves are born some of those cattle move on then to a feedlot where they're fed a very nutritionally balanced ration of food you know how it's important for you to eat a mixture of protein whole grains fruits and vegetables cattle have the same kind of dietary needs so when they're on a feedlot they're being fed a nutritionally balanced ration to make sure they're getting all of that that need met as they're being fed now of course a lot of you are probably thinking of the things that come from cows and the primary thing as tracy mentioned is beef you can think about the products that you like you know maybe it's a steak if you eat these ground beef is the number one type of beef product consumed or even beef jerky that's a very high protein snack that i like to have on hand because that protein provides energy and just keeps you going and which is very important as you as you're growing especially beef also contains some other really important nutrients zinc and iron being two of those so protein zinc and iron are the top three nutrients you can get from beef and you can remember that by remembering the initials zip zinc iron protein but the other interesting thing about cows and cattle is the other products that they provide so certainly that nutritional protein filled product that we eat is important but think about the things in your daily lives where you might have something from a cow a baseball for example a lot of balls for a variety of sports come from the hide and leather of cattle football would be another one they call it a pig skin but that's really kind of misleading because it actually comes from the height of cattle think about the things that you wear too if you have leather shoes or belts those are the kinds of things that come from cattle as well other by-products are used for a variety of other things that we use in our daily lives everything from medicines and vaccinations that are given to other things that you might find whether it be cosmetics or those kinds of things so one interesting activity or or thought to have after this presentation is to maybe look into what other kinds of things you can find or that you use every day that actually come from a cow besides just the beef that we eat so when it comes to eating beef i know that's something i enjoy and my favorite thing to eat i don't know if you are all with me on this but i love a good hamburger and one activity we want to do right now this is kind of just thinking through the process if you have some paper and pencils and want to draw through this that's great too but i want you to think about the perfect hamburger for you for me i've kind of drawn it out here and i had my sons who are in third and sixth grade help me with this as well of course it comes on a bun you have the beef patty here i always like cheese on mine so cheeseburger is really good lettuce tomatoes onions and of course you can add other things but the interesting thing about this is that it it contains a variety of agricultural products that come from california right so just think a little bit about what you put on your hamburger your cheeseburger and what products are grown in california that you put on them some of them you're hearing about today so of course you have cheese representing the dairy industry and you'll hear a little bit more about that you have lettuce which you've heard about as well onions can be grown in california even the wheat that's used in the bread for the buns is grown in california so just think through all of the things you're consuming through just one meal that's grown right here in california the other thing to think about you know sometimes we think about when we're eating food what nutritional value are you getting think about the top nutrients you can get just from that that beef patty again i mentioned the zinc iron and protein so one exercise to do and we don't have a lot of time for it today is to just look into why those are important to you why is protein important to you especially as you're growing why is zinc important to you and your body and the same with iron and those are things to think about as you're you know consuming anything is what value is it bringing to you as you're growing and learning the other interesting thing about cattle and calves is not just that it's such a large commodity here in california but california is actually one of the top 10 states in the country when it comes to the cattle industry so you know it's something that's very important to both california and the country i'm not just providing a nutritious product as well as a product that creates a lot of other things we use every day but also you know contributes to the environmental sustainability of our state when you see those cattle out there grazing what they're doing is really helping sustain that land and enrich the soil to ensure that it can continue to provide agricultural products into the future so that's something that's very important that we have that kind of balance in our ecosystem and cattle really contribute to that so that's that's what i have to say about cows today i love it i love the four stomach part too i always find that really interesting about kettle and calves and the other thing is too they're very sustainable amp because they take a lot of byproducts from some of the quantities that we've learned today pistachios exactly exactly and you'll probably hear a little bit more about that from from the dairy side of things too but cattle that are fed that ration i mentioned earlier either on a feedlot or in a dairy they're taking things that would otherwise go into a landfill that are grown on other farms in california almond tools you mentioned even orange peels are used and they can eat and digest that and it creates a nutritious product for them and if they didn't utilize it it would be going to a landfill and you know contributing to some negative issues so that's a really important thing too i love it i love it thanks jill for being here good information we're gonna keep it moving hope you guys are having fun out there we're almost done we've got three more we're gonna head over to the third commodity here in california which is grapes another one of my favorite uh now grapes have been an important part of agriculture for more than 300 years they are not only consumed as fresh grapes but you might also see them as i don't know raisins or grape juice or for the parents out there maybe wine hello uh growers harvest grapes they're fully ripe now california producers get this more than two billion pounds of table grapes a year that's a lot of greats and there are actually 85 varieties of them crazy right well here to tell us more about it is date ogilvy from wilson vineyards good to see you at fellow ginger i like it i like it dude what's your favorite grape can i just ask you really oh my favorite grapes are uh actually any grape that is fresh and tasty with the right bricks to acid ratio and so we're going to talk about that okay that's a tease okay i like it okay i'll let you take it away sir all right well thank you uh very much tracy i'm so excited uh to be here today my name is david ogilvy i'm a fourth generation farmer here in in clarksburg california and my family's been growing grapes since the 70s uh grapes are the number three commodity as as was mentioned so uh there's it was also mentioned that grapes have such a significant history in california grapes were originally brought to california by the spanish friars who came up through mexico and into california and they made all these missions around and maybe you fourth and fifth graders have done your california mission project and and talked about that and and so in the late 1700s great for first brought to california the mission grape and and then in the 1800s during the gold rush california actually told a lot of these prospectors that came out said you know you're gonna if you invest into growing grapes you're gonna make more money than trying to pan for gold and so a lot of those guys did that and uh we've just had have a booming grape market now in california california produces 99 of the grapes grown uh in in the united states and sold in the united states and of all the grapes are grown in california 30 to 40 are actually shipped around the world uh to to canada mexico a bunch of asian countries so grapes are just so important to our economy so i was also mentioned we grow 2 billion 2 billion pounds of grapes that's like six six pounds per person uh it's just a such a a great commodity so i wanted to i am a great grower i wanted to talk about uh how grapes are actually grown it takes a it's a year around endeavor we we grow uh grapes uh from little uh vines that are grown in the ground we plant them you can actually take a cane that grows off of a grape vine and you just cut the end and you can plant it in the ground and it'll start growing that's one of the most amazing things about wine grapes are so resilient and some people say that wine grapes uh are actually a weed if you don't trellis it properly so we we grow uh the vines out of the ground and you see all these little buds on there and those buds produce one year and then the following year they actually grow into the cane like this and grow little clusters so this year uh this past january we we cut the we pruned grape vines and we pruned some material off and what we left were the canes that we wanted to leave and the buds that were produced last year so if i cut into this bud what is really interesting this butter is produced last year but inside there are the grapes the little tiny tiny clusters of grapes that we're going to harvest this year so it's like a two year process to grow one cluster of grapes i just always find that so interesting and what else can we say about this right now right now we've got what we call bud break so after we prune what we leave is a cane here with all these buds on it and then we this time of year when it starts warming up the the vine wakes up it comes out of dormancy and starts shooting off the the little buds these buds open up and these are the shoots that will grow up to be next year's canes but on these shoots you're gonna have two or three different separate clusters and uh and again those clusters are already there in these tiny little buds fascinating right i just love all this stuff about grapes so um what else can we say i want to talk about uh grapes being healthy so i love to eat grapes uh grapes are so healthy because they have a lot of vitamin k uh there's no fat or cholesterol in there and we just uh they're so tasty and then one of the really neat things is about the uh the skins on the outside of the grape there's all sorts of uh fascinating compounds in there one of them is polyphenols and polyphenols uh help your heart and help it uh pump and have more elasticity so uh in the 70s and 80s there is a whole movement to eat more grapes and learning that grapes were really healthy for your heart and so i encourage everyone out there to eat as many grapes as you can to keep your heart healthy and not just you know eating them off the cluster like this this is great i mean it's a great way to eat grapes so tasty but also there's all these other forms of grapes you have your raisins a couple different types of raisins grape juice is so tasty and um you can add these to your yogurt your cereal in the morning so many different ways to enjoy enjoy grapes so back to the vineyard we grow these grapes on a trellis system so if this is a very rudimentary trellis system right here this this has a stake that goes into the ground and the vine gets brought up that stake and then train out on on one wire like this and then as the canes come up off of this then we have more wires up here that hold everything together and what that does is it allows for sunlight to get into the canopy into that fruiting zone and that sunlight is so important to bring flavor to the grapes into the juice and the skins where all that flavor is and you really you open up the the canopy so that it gets a lot of sunlight on the leaves too and then the leaves are like little solar panels so they take all that sunlight and they turn it into carbohydrates and sugars and where the sugars go the sugars go right into the cluster into the grapes and so you want to get as many leaves facing that sun as possible to get more sugar into the grapes and then the question is when do you pick the grapes it kind of depends on where you're using it for but for grapes like this the best way to take to to tell if a grape is ready to eat is by eating them right you just kind of eat them does it taste good does it taste ready well if you enjoy eating them then they're probably ready for you and it is a subjective uh way some people like them really sweet and some people like them just a little bit sweet but in general in general we pick grapes for eating when they're about 19 to 20 bricks and bricks is a is a measurement of soluble solids so the solids in the grape is sugars so i want to do a little exercise here we're going to test with this machine this little apparatus here is called a refractometer and it measures the soluble solids in graves or in any juice i use it to test the bricks reading in grapes so the way i do that i walk through the vineyard i grab different class different grapes from a cluster so we'll just grab a we'll stick to all the same here i've got a few different varieties here there all the grapes are grown in california are kind of classified into three different classifications green uh red and black and the black ones aren't so black they're just really dark purple and then the green ones are like these and uh and i've got some red ones here as well but so i put them in a ziploc bag and i'll often get a big huge ziploc bag and uh uh-oh my ziploc bag broke let's try this again real quick let's see let's try let's try the red grapes here take a few and here we go we want to mush them up and release all the juice what's really interesting with red grapes you see this juice here this juice was actually clear when when it the grapes are crushed and then they will let the juice sit on the skins and that's where it gets its color so grapes juice the pulp in the in the grape is clear but then it will get color from skins and that's from is stored so then i've got a little juice down there and i do it the very scientific way of doing that and squeezing some drops onto our refractometer and then we close the lid and then we look and this is about 19 bricks and what the other important thing is the acidity so they call it the brix to acid ratio and if you've ever had something that's really sweet but doesn't have any acidity it it's kind of like a a bland lollipop right but then if you have some acid to go with it it kind of creates this really nice balance of flavors and for for you kids out there if you've ever had a sour patch kid uh those things are just my kids love them because it's sweet and sour together sweet is the the sugar the bricks and then the the acid uh in titratable acidity that was great just such a wonderful balance of sweetness of sugar and and acid so i think that's uh that's all i have for for us today um but thanks for joining us it was a pleasure to share some knowledge about growing grapes and get out there and try as many grapes as you can we california having those 80 different varieties of grapes there's so many to choose from and one of the cool things about having so many different varieties of grapes is you can buy them from california grapes from may all the way to january and that's just uh such a great way to try all these different grapes at different times of the year um and then when we don't have them in california like right now we import them from other the other side of the hemisphere uh in in places like chile and i think that's where these came from but i encourage you to try them as well now this time of year because we just want to get in the habit of eating some wonderful grapes thank you thank you david you did great that was awesome so as a winemaker how often are you using your refractometer out there in the vineyards to to test the grapes yeah so as a winemaker i do make wine and and i i go out there uh with every block um i'll start testing grapes in uh july and all the way into november when we're or mid-october when we're finishing harvest and we'll test you know multiple times a week wow a lot of science a lot of science behind the the great world and in agriculture in general yeah so if you like science yeah this might be your field yeah all right well thank you so much i learned a lot i learned a lot about grapes here from you and very excited about it i like the excitement he's excited about grapes did you get that out there kids he loves grapes okay we're gonna keep things moving hopefully you're following along in your workbook i'm still following along in mine we're gonna go to the top the second top commodity here in california we're almost done here and that is almonds another one of my favorites now fun fact david likes them too fun fact there are more than 40 different varieties of almonds commercially grown and they come from california there are uh they can be used as california as we learned earlier from jill and actually it's in cattle beds they're great for that so they're very sustainable products here in california and the central valley is where most of our almonds come from because of the hot dry summers and cool wet winters that they enjoy and did you know that a handful one ounce about 23 almonds has the same amount of calcium as a quarter cup of milk who knew well this gal knows rebecca bailey she knows all about it because she is from the almond board of california and she's going to tell us a little bit more about almonds how many almonds a day do you eat oh 23 first exactly gotta get at least 23 right the perfect serving but and then they're all these different products too which kind of take us through but i will let you go ahead rebecca well thank you as she said my name is rebecca bailey i'm excited to talk to you today about almonds and i work for the almond board of california and at the almond board of california we really represent the nearly 7 600 almond growers and 100 almond processors throughout the state of california and i will say it's pretty impressive that of those 7 600 almond growers they are growing roughly 80 of the world's almonds yes i said world it's it's pretty impressive when you really think about it that 80 percent of the world's almond supply is grown throughout the central valley here in california now there is a reason that we grow so many almonds throughout the central valley number one is because of our climate we have a mediterranean climate here in the central valley which means we have hot dry summers and cool wet winters which almonds thrive in that environment we also have some of the best soil in the entire world so that combination just makes california's central valley the perfect place to grow almonds and that really is within a 500 mile span if you look up north to the chico area and down south to bakersfield that's where 80 percent of the world's almonds are grown so our almond growers and processors work extremely hard day in and day out to make sure they're growing a safe nutritious and wholesome product for you to enjoy as a consumer but i will say it doesn't just happen overnight it is a year-long process so the almond life cycle kind of starts with different seasons similar to what we have with our spring winter fall summer and they start out with a winter dormancy so winter dormancy typically happens in the beginning of november and those pretty almond trees will lose all of their leaves and they'll look like this and sometimes people think they're dead but they're not dead they are just in winter dormancy and this is very similar to what bears do in the wintertime right they hibernate and almond trees do something similar with their winter dormancy season now they start to wake up from winter dormancy right around the middle of february so right around valentine's day we started to see these beautiful light and pink flowers popping popping up all over the almond orchard it looks like snow in the orchards and it truly is a beautiful site and you can see here there's a hut so honeybees are extremely important almond growers will work with a beekeeper to bring in hives of honeybees and they'll come out during the day when it's nice and sunny and they'll fly from flower to flower and they carry that pollen from those flowers back and forth and that's how we're able to have almonds if we did not have honeybees we would not have almonds isn't that crazy to think about and not only for the almond industry in california but the entire ag industry because honeybees are used to pollinate dozens of crops throughout california so once those pretty petals fall because that only lasts a number of weeks it is pretty short-lived the honeybees will fly on to a new crop to pollinate and then before you know it we start to see almonds sprouting where those flowers were now this is actually a branch that i took from a pre free one of our orchards this morning and you can see here there used to be little flowers in these spots and now there's a little baby almond growing where those flowers were so if you were to go out into an orchard today you would see this you'd see lots of green leaves and little baby almonds you would have to get up really close to see them but they are there but within a number of months they'll start to look like this so they'll continue to grow on the tree and they'll look like this so this doesn't look like the almond that you would buy from a store obviously because when it's on the tree they have this green fuzzy coating we call that the hole and that's spelled h and then within the hole there's also an almond shell and those both help to protect the almond from the elements or different pests that might be out in the orchard while that almond is growing on the tree so they'll continue to grow for a number of months and then when we get into our hot summer months probably about the time that you all are going back to school that hole that pretty green hole will start to dry out and it'll kind of turn this brown greenish color it's not as pretty but it's so hot and so dry out that that hole will open up and it looks just like this and it exposes the shell inside that the almond is inside of and we call this whole split so that hole is splitting open and this is really a sign to the grower that it's time to harvest so when it comes to harvest which is also a fun season of the year we bring in three really cool pieces of equipment into the orchard the first one is called the shaker and this is a shaker right here and it's a short little tractor with two long arms and it will literally clamp on to the trunk of each tree and it shakes the trunk of the tree for a number of seconds and of course while this is happening almonds are falling from the tree it's like it's raining almonds in the orchard and before you know it there is a mess of almonds all over the orchard floor so we have to clean that mess up which means we bring in our second piece of equipment that we call the sweeper right that's how you clean up a mess you sweep it up so this is another short little tractor and it will go and it'll actually sweep all of those almonds into perfect rows between the trees and they'll continue to dry out while they're on the ground and then we bring in our third and final piece of equipment which is called the harvester or the pickup machine and that literally does what it's called the pickup machine it will drive over those perfectly swept rows and it will pick all those almonds up from the ground into the back of a big truck where they're taken off to be processed now when they go to the processor you have to remember that they still have the almond hole on there and the almond shell so that's the first thing that has to happen we need to remove that hole and shell so they go through special equipment one that will remove all of the holes and before you know it you're left with a bunch of holes that look like this in one pile and then they go through another piece of equipment that removes all the shells and then before you know it you have your holes you have your shells and then you have your perfect california almonds that obviously we all want to consume while this is the main thing that we want we don't just throw these holes and shells away we do use them as was mentioned earlier the almond holes can be a really good source of nutrition for dairy cattle and shells can often be ground up and used as you know for dust control on roads or livestock bedding so we don't throw anything away in the process of growing the almonds and then they're further sorted out at the processor they're boxed up and they're shipped all throughout the world now i mentioned earlier that we grow roughly 80 percent of the world's almond supply here in california so that means we ship to a lot of countries so we ship california almonds grown right here in the central valley to more than 90 different countries around the world so what that means is they are eating california grown almonds in places like china india south korea japan all throughout europe canada mexico all over the world so we truly are creat growing a product that really does feed the world especially since we have the unique opportunity to do that in the central valley now when you see the further processing that can happen with almonds it's pretty cool because almonds are extremely unique they're extremely versatile and can be used in so many different ways and put in so many different forms for example these are some of my favorite products to get from the grocery store and you can see there's a really good variety you can see there's a lot of chocolate products up here we have our hershey bar we have some eminem some almond roca chocolate and almonds pair extremely well together so it's very common to see that that kind of combination at the grocery store of course if almonds are ground down really finely you can make it into an almond flour as and this works as a flour alternative some folks prefer having an almond type of beverage rather than milk or something along those lines so that's also an opportunity for folks who choose that it's very common to see almonds and cereals and granola bars and granola and then of course the snacking almonds that we like to have every day so i really challenge you next time that you go to the grocery store go down those dials and see what different products you can find and we mentioned this at the beginning but in closing i will say that the perfect serving of almonds is a handful typically 23 almonds fits in an adult sized hand and that is a perfect serving so make sure you have your serving of almonds a day and thank you so much for your time i hope you were able to take something away um and just know how much we we care about the food that we're growing thank you thank you rebecca i love it so 23 we shouldn't be eating at least 23 almonds a day yeah and i like that it pairs nicely with chocolate because that goes with our next and our last top commodity here thank you so much for joining us rebecca good to see you so okay kids we have we've reached the end here this is the top commodity in california the number one commodity which is dairy and dairy products now dairy is a huge industry here yeah approximately 1.78 million dairy cows produce on approximately 1300 1300 dairies throughout the state of california now here's a fun fact it takes 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of cheese and dairy cows produce about eight gallons of milk each day so that makes it pretty much a full-time job pretty much a 24-7 job for farmers out there because cows have to be milked twice a day so here to tell us more about it is from the dairy council of california you have a very yummy very yummy table i see here i'm getting towards snack time here and you have a lot of scrumptious snacks i see so i will let you tell us more about dairy here in california the number one education commodity we're funded by the california dairy industry we've been around since 1919 and our mission is really to elevate the health of children and families to the pursuit of the lifelong healthy eating habits and some of the work that we do we work with schools teachers and the community to provide nutrition education materials to teach about you know the importance of good nutrition and really how milk and dairy foods play a part in a healthy eating pattern to support lifelong health so the other thing that we do offer dairy council which some of you may have experienced is our mobile dairy classroom program and that program goes around to different schools to talk about you know dairy education and really bring you know the cow and that experience and the dairy farm to you so if you have checked us out that is us if you haven't feel free to check us out at healthyeating.org to learn more so as we kind of count down dairy is the number one agricultural commodity in california also california is the nation's leading dairy state since 1993 and in california we have 1200 dairy farms across the state that's home to 1.5 million cows and collectively all those cows and all those dairy farms produce 40 billion pounds of milk that's right billion not million with a b and when you start to think about wow well how much milk really is that you can actually fill 176 olympic sized swimming pools with all that milk and you know let's kind of talk a little bit about just you know the dairy industry and these cows so 99 of our dairy farms in california are family owned and operated and it's an incredible and extraordinary to know that there's been several generations of family members that have worked on these dairy farms and we know the valley and the contribution that it brings to a local agriculture our health continue our local dairy farmers board um you'll get a chance stick the dairy sticks in california are holstein and he trails ahead and the reason why she trails ahead is because well a couple of reasons once she's the largest of her breed she's coming in weighing about 1500 pounds and you know she can really adapt to various different climates and environments and because of her size she really produces a lot of milk so she's an excellent milk producer she actually produces much more than the jersey however the jersey her milk is really rich and creamy so think about things like yogurt and ice cream delicious however let's share some additional fun facts about our dairy cattle did you know that the holstein their spots are really like fingerprints so there's no two cows that have the same kind of pattern the black and white spots kind of cool the other fun fact about it is that when we start to think about the things that they can eat they have a very unique body that really allows them to be kind of these natural recyclers they things that just us as humans simply won't eat or can't eat and we kind of throw in the trash and ends up in the landfill so 82 of you know the california feed that we freed our dairy cattle are coming from food and crop by-products so we do have things like um cottonseed yep so the socks that you're wearing that little tiny seed that started all that cotton that's exactly what they're eating some dried flake corn some soybean meal however they also like things like banana peels watermelon rind and even pineapple stems and much more so it's kind of cool and their kind of complex sort of you know system and body and their anatomy really allows them to really chow down so cows will eat about a hundred pounds of food a day um which is crazy i know you think 100 pounds what does that mean that's if you were eating 600 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches i don't think we'd want to eat 600 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but they eat other things besides this as well as some of us learned our you know our second uh commodity that was featured almonds the dairy farmers they want to make sure they can recycle that and just about a hundred percent of those almond holes are really recycled and reused in the dairy farm as feet or sometimes it's you know grounded up um and used as kind of bedding to you know to comfort the cows um the other fun facts is that cows right they're kind of their anatomy is very unique they have one stomach and four compartments and they do choose their food twice and that's called chewing their cud and they need a lot of saliva to kind of eat all that food and work it down their body so they produce about 125 pounds of saliva that's a lot you thought your dog drooled no way um dogs cows definitely have just a lot of saliva right they're big animals they need to make sure they can get it down but because they also you know [Music] give or take gallons a week um and the other kind of process of right producing dairy all those nutrients and all that energy from the feed that they're getting it goes straight down to the utters they get about they get milked about two to three times a day at um what we call kind of a milking parlor and thankfully with the advancements of technology that process is really quick it takes about you know five to ten minutes for a cow to get milked and if you were to do it by hand it could take you anywhere between 40 minutes to an hour so it would take you some time especially if your newcomer would take you a little bit longer but that milk when it hits the grocery store shelves or it hits your school your school cafeteria it is farm fresh it takes about two days and sometimes depending on where you know the um the dairy farm and the processing plant is it could take up to a day so it is farm fresh kids i'm not sure if you guys ever noticed the um real you know um real california milk seal on some of your favorite you know dairy brand products and this seal this basically is just kind of you know the stamp to let us know that we are supporting our local dairy farmers here in california so feel free to kind of check this out next time you're at the grocery store or check out what you have at home to see if you have that california seal and out of the all the milk that we produce in california we really love our cheese check this out 46 of that milk is turned into cheese oh my goodness and you know talk about what dairy is one of our five food groups and um it's loaded with essential nutrients that are really good for our bodies to keep us healthy strong and continue growing you know in milk cheese and yogurt cottage cheese there's great nutrients like calcium and that calcium is good for your strong bones and your teeth we have protein it helps you build your muscles you also have vitamin d and that vitamin d not only make sure that bones right especially as we're growing and we're staying physically active we definitely don't want to have fractured bones or break our bones um potassium it's great for our health our heart health and there's so much more that things like yogurt they could be a great breakfast option even snack option as well you can throw in some almonds as we talked about some of our you know commodities here even grapes um you know some strawberries you name it it's a healthy balanced breakfast but also snack choice as well and we talked about cheese a little bit earlier cheese oh my goodness it is so delicious and it's so versatile you can really include it as part of you know your your meal or your snack choices as well so you can have a sandwich and a hamburger pizza you name it but you could even pair it with simple things like crackers and maybe some of our other commodities that we shared like grapes strawberries and tomatoes as well so it makes a yummy delicious snack option as well and we can't forget to kind of wash down our meal or maybe include some milk in our um you know in our breakfast the cereal or have that as part of our day as well but the last thing i want to share with you we've talked a lot about milk and now i want to share with you how to make homemade butter i'm not sure if many of you guys have ever made butter before but it's a really simple process and it's actually a fun science experiment so all you need is heavy cream and a jar like a mason jar or you can use a simple thing like a peanut butter jar anything that you have at home that you can use and all you do is put some heavy cream in there and you just shake away so it'll take some time after about 10 minutes you might start to see some cream form and you're thinking why use heavy cream and not butter well when we really have um i should probably say when fresh milk is kind of sitting out and hanging out that heavy cream rises to the top and that's what we're using so that's kind of scraped off don't worry you are not consuming that where you're drinking milk that's why we have different types of milk like you know fat free one percent two percent um and three percent you know which is our whole milk so there's different types of dairy products so don't worry you're not consuming that but that heavy cream that's the magic to make butter so you kind of shake away and after about maybe 15-20 minutes it'll start to kind of lump up and there will be some kind of liquid that you'll notice in your jar and don't worry that liquid basically what happens when you churn butter that's the excess part of it and that's called buttermilk so you can definitely strain that out you can clip it whatever you'd like and you can enjoy your butter gardening or your bagel um or however you'd like to enjoy it but thank you for joining us today and if you'd like to learn more about dairy council of california visit us at healthyeating.org thank you so much butter look at you so how long does that take you it takes some time and you got to shake it the whole time you have to shake it i think if you leave it at room temperature that heavy cream it's a little bit of quicker process i didn't i just straight from the refrigerator to the jar it took about 20 minutes so you know as it starts to thicken you really have to work your muscles which is why it's so important to you know build your mouth build your muscles your dairy or other you know products like almonds etc that give us that protein so but it's really cool and it'll last about three to five days okay um you know if you leave it at room temperature cover or in the um refrigerator about seven to ten days but it's a fun activity that's a great great activity for parents and kids exactly and you can work out too while you're doing it multitask children multitask okay thank you you're welcome thank you so much for having us well that is it we want to thank all of our presenters today we hope you had a good time out there and learned a few fun facts about california agriculture and how it affects all of our lives in one way or another if teachers parents or kids out there want more resources you can always go to learnaboutag.org for more and be sure to finish your workbook out there kids this is great we will see you again next year

friday um it varies when i take care of my plants but usually on my days off it's a day that i do a lot a lot of extras sometimes repotting sometimes fertilizing plants definitely checking what plants need water making sure there's no pests um so let me just take you along and see what happens today okay i know some hoyas need some tender loving care so i'll share that with you guys some prayer plants overall some living room plants and see which ones need some some more care today um i hope you enjoy i hope you learned something and i hope this is just beautiful plant eye candy i love seeing you guys as plants and learning tips on how you take care of plant your plants in and just sharing this plant world with each other it's always fun and i'm relaxing hopefully so come along with me and let's take care of my pets what's taking shade underneath this beautiful regal shield let's check it out oh the hoyas are having a spa day aren't they okay guys let me show you what i have going on here so i always love these little plastics they come in so handy you can pick them up um lows but i think i know my nursery local nursery has a better price for them this one's a really really big one um and deep two well and it helps for the water there um i am butter watering these plants and these are yes as you can see and they're getting a little extra treatment and let me explain how and why they the water actually as you can tell um it's a little murky looking ha oh no um it um has some fish emotion and um i'm gonna give them a little bit more of fertilizing and watering normally when i water them they dry off really really fast and this is a prime example um you can see how dry it looks and i watered it probably a week ago i'm working on this one and i'll work on it right now um but anyhow um so the what this kind of soil composition that it's in it has a lot of pearlite and it has orchid bark and it has the regular soil but i wanted to make sure it was nice while draining obviously you can tell this is a hoya carry eye and it's the green hearts but it's growing a big long shoot one way so it's unbalancing the plant i'm gonna have to work on this in just a moment and um so because these soils dry off so quickly i have felt that this hindu rope crinkles pretty quickly and i have not seen any growth in it well there's a little little little bit of growth but um i i wanted to give it a little boost look now let's just see a little bit of growth there yay so what i'm doing is i'm just gonna i'm sitting it on here and it's been maybe here for 15 minutes and i was thinking of waiting for about an hour i just want to make sure it soaks in very well with this water and fertilizer so it can not dry off too quickly and be fed this fish emotion fertilizer somebody gave this recommendation and i wanted to go ahead and try it and see if this helps these are my variegated hindi ropes i don't know if you can see there's a little bit of white on the edges here and they have not done much that one i really don't see any new growth points and i've had this for maybe three four three months and yes it was winter but still i feel like i need to do a little more sorry some water feel on it so i am going to see if this little fertilizer treatment is going to help it grow a little faster they're supposed to be already rooted so now this is my hoya obobata which is known for its round leaves and this one does have i ordered this one online off of etsy and i have seen new growth i want to say at least two or three leaves since i've had it and there's a new little shoot coming out so i'm very happy to see that there's some roots there this one has been sitting in my ikea greenhouse this one has been my ikea greenhouse and now back here i have a variegated hoya carrier which is the one that has the variegated hearts with the white in it let's take this off so you won't get mixed well actually this is a nice comparison you see the one is not very grated has green leaves and this one the variegated one has white since i've had it i've gone through a little drama with it at the beginning i lost like three or four leaves immediately when i brought it home i put it in um my plant room and i actually repotted it maybe that was a mistake and uh it it it started getting like some kind of fungus and it lost like four leaves with this little mushy dark areas i was so so scared uh but i've left it alone and look this sleeve here is new since i've had it so at least it's stopped doing what i was doing and now i've got a new leaf so let us work with this little this little plant that's having little issues off balance and i'll talk to you more about it okay guys so i'm back i have put a bamboo stick on this hoya carrier as you can see here i've actually added a little bit more soil to it and i'm i put some water from the top but i'm going to leave leave it here for a bit so it can really soak up that water and um what i wanted to tell you about this one is that when i bought it which is a good i don't know eight months ago it already came with this big stem out of it but it was not it didn't have this heart this heart just appeared maybe um in the last three weeks which i'm very excited about again it was kind of like frozen in time and i was getting kind of regretting buying it because i like plants that have growth because that's i feel like one of the most exciting parts and now it gave me this so i don't know if there's going to be little leaves coming out of that or it's going to be a peduncle not sure but there's life happening of course it is getting closer to spring so i guess that's why there's more happening and uh so yeah so that's what's going on with my little ho yes and yeah part of planet care is making a mess so after planning care comes house chores which is not that fun but it's gotta get done okay so right next to this i we have just watered these pepperonis i don't know if you guys remember seeing these from a video that i went shopping to gunther's greenhouse and i can go ahead and give you a little update on how they're doing this is the pumpkin pepperoni and this other pepperoni remember the name is rugosa and what happened is that when i got these home they uh maybe a week later this is one of those plant stories that after you get them home you they they end up showing other signs of pests so maybe a week later they were like full of mealy bugs so what was crazy about it is that where the leaf new leaf is coming out like inside of like there when it was more closed up it was full of mealy bugs babies so it was so much that and i was doing the q-tip with alcohol and removing it but it was so much that i ended up just spraying it also with alcohol and i went at 100 on call and between that and maybe the mealybugs there was some leaf damage as you can tell that was probably one of the leaves that was forming like a baby when all that happened so it was eaten up and it was damaged um i feel like it's now controlled this has been a few months and you see all that little growth coming out so i think this one usually gives a lot of growth but it was winter and it was recovering from all of that but here it goes we'll see how it goes i'm learning how to take care of it and basically i want to say it's a typical pepperoni care it does not want to dry out completely so i feel like this one here shows a lot more leaf damage immediately if i let it dry out versus this one this one is see staying a little more impeccable and this paper whatever goes that is gorgeous but the new growth is not doing that great so i think it's from that damage from the intensive spraying of alcohol that i did for several times um i there is little white little spots but that's part of the neem oil spray that i sprayed at some point that dried up that way so i don't think it has any more mealy bugs but i always have to be watching these and yeah usually i don't let it touch other plants but yeah these these are getting some butter water butter bottom watering okay so another plant that i have right here might not seem like a big deal but there's so much happening here that i'm so so excited about um this is the varicosum some of you guys wanted to have an update of what was going on with it this is the one that came from hawaii and it was basically dried up and and broken um so this is what's happening a new growth point isn't that exciting so i just kept it in the pot and the soil came in and i put it in my ikea greenhouse and i have bottom water it when when it's getting too dry and look that's happening but not only that do you see here the soil there's another growth point coming out i am thrilled and then right right here there's another green little spot there's another little growth point happening so this is a varicose um that means wow this spring and summer there might be a lot going on by the way guys these are the little yellow stickies that uh some of you guys that are newer into plant care um have asked about what to do about the nets and nasty nets well these little butterfly yellow stickers usually are in my description are great i got them from amazon and usually they're full of nets this is a fresh new one in here but that really has helped capture them so that's what's going on this one got watered already this program got watered already so we're good here i do have a fiddle leaf getting watered this one i just took it out measured it i always measure it so i can see if it needs water does not need water this one's good that one's good let's go check out some more plants this is kalithia um i think it's the silver something this one needs some water and like i tell you guys is what i do yes i i grab it like right now it it's a little heavy so in my thinking i would think ha i think it's medium it's not dry and it's not wet that's what i would think just with my judgment of holding it and yeah you stick it in here first two inches are dry um so usually an akalithia you wanna water it or a prayer plant but i always use this i go ahead and kind of double check and see it's measuring dry one two three means red and that means dry so yes this baby needs water this one is getting dry very quickly so i'm realizing that it needs water um easily once a week and then i have my trio star which i watered both of these the same day last week but i'm just gonna stick this in here and check it really quickly and see what's going on here and look this one is at five six so i go all the way down that's a seven in the middle it's about four five the top is a three so this one obviously has more water in it than that one um but i think i might just go ahead and bottom water it let it soak up whatever water it wants for today just because it is a prayer plant they do want more water you want to stay moist a little more than other plants so yeah let's give these babies some water so i'm gonna go get some plastics um to put underneath and they can get bottom water i got the little plastics underneath i'm actually not gonna just bottom water it i'm gonna put water from the top um but i'm gonna let it sit here for a bit so that way it can um soak up that water thoroughly and usually these like um to get filtered water that's what i do um and filtered water give it just a second and um i did put some fish fertilizer on this one this time because i don't think i've fertilized these in a long time i don't keep an actual um calendar i guess where when i fertilize my plants i started to do it but then i stopped writing on it so i kind of just especially because i'm using fish for fertilizer emulsion i know it says it won't burn plants so i just do very minimal like i do like one teaspoon in this pitcher and it's like two quarts so so far so good my pants have been happy so then that way i don't i don't stress about i do it like once every it depends right in winter i wasn't doing it very often like i haven't done it i haven't given them any fertilizer the whole winter so it's getting ready to be spring but even though guys this trio store has not stopped putting out new growth it's been so happy and i know this trio star doesn't normally want to get wet it's leaves wet so i kind of just get the soil wet um some of the damage i think it already came with some damage when we bought it i haven't seen it grow a lot but i'm gonna trim this up maybe so so look even prettier but yeah there's some water bottom water in the bottom and you want it to soak up and that way you'll know it's going to get enough water so i'll come back and check it thinking to put more water in this one but i'll come back and check him in about 30 minutes to an hour and then whatever water stuff though we're going to dump it and if it soaked up all the water it means it really needed some watery i'm gonna get some more water now that i'm at my prayer plants i'm gonna check this medallion over here let me get my little thing to measure the water and let's see this one's been kind of frozen in time at least during winter let's check it out it's always a good time to make sure that there's no pests okay um because they are kalithias they're more known they can get spider mites so what i'm gonna do here is take a look i always check really quickly to make sure there's no spider webs anywhere i don't see any spider webs it's always good to check in this little area right here where the leaf joins the stem that's where you tend to see the spider webs when there's spider mites and usually guys and i just wanted to share with you guys spider mites have very compact webbing okay and then you see little dots moving around it's different than a normal spider web of a regular spider you know i kind of had i was freaking out every time i saw any webbing but sometimes it could be a regular spider in your plant so as you can see i've cut some of the leaves off the past few months because they got a little ugly but it's actually i'm happy because it's almost the end of winter and look at it it's still more for the most part the leaves are there and they're complete and they're not browning so not too much damage so now we're gonna check okay so yes it needs water because that's a four five and that needs a water okay so let's measure because this is like prayer uh galithia it also doesn't wanna go to the dry side you wanna keep it moist so now i'm gonna water this one this one um is in a catch pot and this is a little plastic pot so i can actually water here as long as i don't over water it it shouldn't spill over so i'm gonna do this again i have my filtered water in here i'm just going to do something like that that should be good and again later on i'm going to come in and throw away all the excess water but i'm going to let it sit here so it can really saturate the soil i already checked my prayer plant over my never never plant here um and i'm amazed that it's made it through the winter because when i got it and maybe it was fall and all the new growth was coming out a little bit of brownish and i have a friend that bought one and hers kind of died so i don't keep this i've had this in my living room and i did not have a humidifier going the whole winter so the air was dry this is a new leaf it came out nice and i just saw it the other day i was giving these new leaves and they were coming out great normal color so that was happy about that so this one made it um so i don't think this one's so picky and i will tell you this i have not changed the soil it came in from lowe's and i've just measured it and it usually stays on the wet side for two or three two or three weeks and i've water i water it like once every three weeks but it stays wet for a good amount of time and i did not repot it because i was afraid uh my cousin that also got one she repotted hers quickly because that's what she was advised by the guy at lowe's and hers shriveled up so i was thinking i'm not going to touch it whatever happens happens and uh it survived and it's it's pretty good so i guys i recommend these are pretty aren't they i think they're stunners and they're not very expensive so i've been happy with that one my crocodile fern is still looking pretty good and it is a fern you know these can dry off kind of quickly but this one um it's been doing good and uh i just measured it earlier and it is i've watered not too long ago so that one's good um this is my fiddle uh fiddle philodendron or i like to call it a horsehead philadelphia um this one's doing good and this one has also got some watering right before you i started this video so both of these are sitting in a little bit of excess water that i have to dump out in a moment this is my mykins this is trailing up look how beautiful that looks and this is my philodendron frantianum and look at that it's been doing good no problems that i know of so i'm happy with it um yes the new leaves come in small i hear some people complain about that but i think if you let it it just starts growing in and getting bigger with time so i don't pay that too much attention and let's see what else who else needs some tender loving care and let's go around and check him out okay guys and i also wanted to share with you something that just arrived in the mail um just yesterday when i came home this had arrived there was a package so it's a humidifier and i wanted to try it um and then like homes reached out to me and let me try one um so i could review it for you guys so i'm happy to do that um they even let me choose the one i wanted so i did want another humidifier because i currently already have one at the lee boat i think and it's in my um plant room but after having bought that one i've realized what maybe i wanted for my second humidifier and um they allowed me to choose like i mentioned so i chose a big one because i think it's good not to be have to refill the humidifier because it's just you know it's a hassle at work so this one it says here it's 6.5 so it's a large capacity and it can go up to 800 i'm square feet of humidifying and another requirement that i had for the one next one that i chose i wanted one that would be top fill because the other one is bottom fill so it's a little more complicated to fill it and you know we get let me see it and someone didn't have a lot of time so um just unpackaged it yesterday and i'm playing with it i'm learning about it and i wanted to share with you guys okay so this is the model and to turn it on oh first to fill it up with water you just pull this off and the tank is right here and you can just put some water bring it in a little container and i'm using filtered water just because i don't want you know it has less calcium and minerals so just pop it like that there is a control if you wanted to use the control but i'm going to press the on button and look at that mist so pretty simple pretty simple to use and and then in the house you can do uh max or minimum so let's see how that changes okay you see here the lines are changing so i guess that's max oh no that's even more and that's less see the little lines um i think normally i would keep it on a lower mode because i want the water to last longer no reason to blast it i guess right now we are in spring the humidity in my house is not very bad i want to say it's staying in the 60s um but especially in winter humidifiers come in very handy if you turn on the heat in your house and your air gets drier and then humidity loving plants like the ones that i just put around here um might suffer a little bit so i'm happy to know i have this back up in my living room so i can always pop it when i want to make my whole living room be an ikea greenhouse why won't we um humidity does great with ones it helps them push out more leaves for them to come out better um even bigger and i can see that from ikea greenhouse how great humidity has been for plants so if you can add it um it's always a plus um let's see what else it seems like you can do heating so if you wanted the mist to be warm you can do that um so pretty simple pretty simple and easy to fill and i think that's what i was looking for easy to fill in a big tank so um yeah um that's it in the end so i just want to share with you guys and i will put a link in the description you guys you know shop around um but look in the link and look at their models they have look at the prices maybe they'll have some sales going on and it might be a unit that you'd be interested into so i just want to show that so let's continue with our plank here okay so here in my living room i also have this hydan sony eye and um i'm always you know concerned about this one because if i let it dry out one day the leaves turn yellow like this like this i've heard a lot of people complain about that too and i'm a little sad because this plant came with huge leaves at the beginning and now i have more medium-sized sleeves but it still keeps putting on new growth like you see here so i guess it's not the end of the world and it's still gorgeous but i have to check it constantly so again yes i could stick my finger in there but i like doing this okay so this one's measuring six so still on the moist side um seven that's all the way down bringing it up a little bit more for four and a half so just knowing that this one's a little picky like i mentioned i'm gonna go ahead and give it some water and um some of you guys mentioned how do you keep the moss pull wet well i don't keep it wet it's dry right now but i need to do better so one thing i can do right now very quickly is spray with water and i think that's what i'm going to do and then i want to give it a squirt of water down here um this catches the water no actually it has a drainage hole so if it was a nice warm day i would take this outside and maybe hose it so it could get you know the leaves could get washed and that moss pill could get wet but i'm just gonna put another plastic little pot here on the side and i'm gonna water it let's do it guys i got my water and i have all my little outside plants that i keep on my porch inside because it got cold on us yesterday and today so they're here in the entrance of the house but i normally don't have them there so yeah um i did put some fish emotion in the water like i mentioned earlier just because like i said it's getting to be springtime and yeah this is a good time to remove dead leaves okay and my video my normal got my normal guy that helps me record this it's not available right now so i'm having little issues i guess i guess i could use a tripod but i'm just doing this okay and i have like a balls on top it doesn't mean it's in actually you know like i just put it on top i don't know it was crazy one day and i thought it would look cute so i put like a bolt on top but no not that i suggested because i don't think it makes a difference i don't think it makes it i don't know i'm thinking like will they help prevent nuts but i didn't even have that in this plant but i just popped them on there i might need them for a plant later on but see like i mentioned look at this leaf look how big it is look at those big holes but like i mentioned it's very sensitive and it yellows pretty quickly but i mean i think compared in relation to the leaves that i'm getting i'm doing okay um one day it's going to fill up this moss pool so yeah overall looks pretty healthy doesn't it okay i guess that's it i went around my living room and checked my plans in my living room so that's where i'm gonna leave this video at just my living room and now i'm gonna clean up my living room okay so that is all that i'm gonna do today in my living room plants i think they're all doing pretty good it's always good to go around check them my ikea plants are doing pretty good um check those about a couple of days ago um so i basically go around my house and i'll choose maybe a room or a type of plant like if i'm doing hoyas i go ahead and check around my house all my oh yes if i'm doing my prayer plans i usually go and check around all my around my house all my prayer plans usually um it's not always the same 100 but i try to keep a mental order of when i've done what plans um sometimes i plant well in my kitchen i'll do it one day i'll do all of them so that way i don't lose track of one one plant here or there i mean it happens from time to time but normally not but um i hope you guys got some tips it helped i just wanted to share because you guys did for me to share so hopefully um you guys enjoyed seeing some of my little plants in my plant care okay thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed this kind of video thanks bye", "B7J12J-wXaI": "hello hello hello everyone good morning afternoon or evening it is kate richberg with beanshop.com and it is time for free tip friday on this friday march 19 uh 20 2021 alrighty well let me know everybody if you can hear me okay and we're gonna get started on this little

bracing drink of coffee and i also see drea pop up which is great you know um back when uh the shelter in place started which was about a year ago now um and i want to say look at how far we've come we're still uh not out of the woods yet but uh science has given us a vaccine which is amazing um and i have already had my first shot right here no effects i can't wait for my second one so uh so that's great i'm uh i'm very very grateful for that um back in the beginning when we were doing the kate's creative connections uh back at the beginning you know right in march when things were closing down and we had no idea what was going to happen right we didn't know and so i did the best i could by jumping in and making a connection with you guys right through this screen um and it was a comfort i think to a lot of people including me um and including uh all of the staff here i think at bead shop and i've heard from many of you a comfort to you so um that was a real gift that was one of the gifts i think that came out of this pandemic if we have to look at the bright side so um today we're gonna celebrate isn't quite the right word but we're gonna mark the um occasion i suppose by doing a knot um and on kate's creative connections we did a lot of knotting to keep our hands busy i knotted a whole bunch of you know pearl knotting knotting with the weather knots all those kind of things there's a special um knot section on our website right on the beadshop.com website under the learning uh section you'll see uh kate's knots and so this is a new one to add to the fold so like we did back in the pandemic when drea kate um kate that's me karen remember karen our webmaster karen would make this blank page and drea would jump on and she'd add the products as i'm using them so um drea is going to do that again today so there will be a materials list for you and then i'll send karen a photo and then it'll be up and it'll be ready to go so um so let's jump in and get started i'm going to move this camera around and uh let's take a look let me add uh this here to the stream and i want to show you guys kind of what one of my inspirations were you know you know how i love books right i'm going to move this to the side for just a second and let me clean up get some of this out of the way here so it's a little clearer for you so back in the day when uh you know i'm always looking for books right and so back in the day um when i owned my own bead store in san francisco called badissimo we were in the mission district okay and i promise this ties in with what we're doing today with knotts um and we were next to our our store on valencia avenue was next to aquarius records which was the hippest record store in san francisco thank goodness uh we were we got to we got a lot of our music that we played in the store at badisimo from them and a lot of the staff came in and got jewelry made for them so it was cool so what aquarius records has to do with this book is it's written by actually the former owner of aquarius wendy chin wendy um sold her um aquarius uh when we were still on valencia street and um got um went to a new position um went into kind of the corporate world um and then was looking for permission to leave that corporate world and so out of her year-long journey on her instagram she tied a knot a day every day and i found this book through my buddy larry um larry owns uh paloma which is a wonderful little store and you can look it up his instagram paloma sf on insta and he and wendy i don't know they were cooking up something or doing something so i i went over to her insta and i saw that she had written this book and i hopped on um amazon and bought it right away and it has touched me in an amazing uh just in a really great creative way she has she's done projects all with this interesting this rope really easy knots to understand and she talks about her creative journey throughout um and so i wanted to flash this really cool picture of her there's wendy right there um wearing some jewelry and doing her nodding which was really amazing and she talks a lot about um things that we talk about here at bead shop a lot right which is finding your creative self right um and it's really um it's a really cool read so not only does it have uh thoughts about her life and her creative life it has all about her nodding journey right and so i was i thought that this would be a perfect one to do for um for this uh kind of commemoration of marking kind of a year of kate's creative connections and i opened the book and i was chatting with dree about it and right away i saw this piece this multiple figure eight um necklace that she had made and the cool thing she does all of these knots and i'll just show you visually the book is um just incredible and her directions are super clear and she uses um this really cool white rope to um to uh you know demo all of these so i really um i really recommend it it's an amazing read as well as a creative inspiration so i took this piece that wendy made and i gave it the kate richberg spin okay um and so uh what i did was i interpreted it in a bead shop fashion with two millimeter leather and what i had at home uh we had this from bagging up uh it's a lot of leather right from home and uh so this is the two millimeter in distressed gray and then i've also been making new kits for sisterhood so i had which more will be about that later yes you heard right new kids for the sisterhood project but i had some of the coil spacers at home okay so i just sat down and worked with what i had and this is what i came up with and so drea and i chatted a little bit about it and so today i'm going to give it a little bit more of a spin and a little bit more of a finished necklace look to it okay so thank you to wendy and to her um wonderful inspiration and her beautiful book i'm going to drop her a line later she doesn't even know that i'm doing this but um but it was uh wonderful to be your neighbor in san francisco to such a wonderful record store and it was wonderful to read about your creative journey so thank you um for such a fantastic book um so i wanted to wanted to show that but let's get into what we're going to do then i'm going to show you how i knock this so we're going to need a macrame board we're going to do this a little bit you know with that kate richberg's bin here so we're going to use the macrame board and the product that i pulled you know we carry a lot of different cords here at bead shop this would be really appropriate for kimono cord um it would make it a little bit of a more kind of a chunky kind of a piece and it would also i think be appropriate you can play around with it the point eight millimeter um uh chinese knotting cord or even that 1.5 surfer cord that we carry surf record is a great alternative to leather if you're not so into using leather like i know some of you are surf record is um a great uh substitute for it so what i've got today i just went through like i do and i waltzed through our fulfillment area and i pulled a palette like i would to start any project really okay so here are the ingredients and i'm doing this also for drea so she can kind of make sure she's got everything too as well as she's adding things in so let me go over what we're using okay so you can uh so you can see this uh i've got the sixth sense um uh spacer and it's the little spacer bead let me frame up out of this thing here um and what you're looking for essentially in the bead is something that has a large hole so something like this something like the coiled spacers that we have any of our you know we've got a lot of large hole kind of metal beads things like that anyone any one of those would work then i went over and i saw these drops these carnelian faceted drops and we haven't used these in a while and i thought you know the shine of these faceted drops and we just got these champagne large hole pearls back in i thought that all of this shine made a great foil for the leather kind of the matte finish and this is the two millimeter um distressed mahogany leather and it comes in a four yard bundle um and i used about half of that but i'll talk about the lengths and stuff and then i thought you know when i was making this piece i was kind of as i like to do when i make my sample i like to kind of cast my brain in the future right to see what else i might create with this so start designing right away in my mind and i thought well i like this cord but i don't know if i want this cord to go all the way to the back of a necklace it may look a little thin so i grabbed some paper clip chain this is our large paper clip i think it's going to give a little more heft to this piece i'm not sure how i'm going to use it but we'll figure it out okay um and then of course i thought well this matte satin finish jumbo swivel um is gorgeous and i thought we could perhaps use that maybe not in the back but make it part of the focal of the front so we'll see okay and then of course you need the correct head pins for these drops and that is the vermeil or silver or gunmetal the small dot the thin dot head pins not our regular dot head pins okay so uh they won't uh the larger dot in 24 gauge or 22 gauge won't fit through so you need the small ones there okay um so let's get to naked let me i'm going to clear this and i haven't practiced this since yesterday so bear with me if i have a false start but i'm not afraid we're just going to jump in so i'm going to um undo this unfurl this sucker and i'm going to cut two of the four yards of this cord okay so that means i need to find my tape measure which i think is over here so i'm going to do that and let's because i want a lot and you know chord leather chord isn't that dear um and so i want to make sure that i have enough because not if you have done any knots with me you know knots take up um a lot of cord because you know we weave them back and forth we do all of that so i want to make sure that i have enough so i'm going to cut this okay so here is this is going to be we're going to talk about the left and the right of this knot and i'm going to go here right i'm going to i'm going to leave about 10 inches on the left hand side that's about 10. then i'm going to at that 10 mark i'm just going to pinch it there at that 10 inch mark i'm going to kind of go 10 inches here and weave it back or double it back on itself here okay so i have a this is what i have i have a 10 inch tail and around a 20 inch loop okay and i'm going to let me pin this down i've used a t-pin over here and i'm going to use one of our clampers over there okay whoops let me get these beads out of the way for a second all right so that's what i've got and i actually just want to clamp one leg of the loop and do i have another clamper here i do i want to kind of not lose this length let me lift this a little and i want to clamp this down because i don't want to lose this length either okay so what i have left is all of this and this is what i'm going to be knotting with and this is going to be the other half of the necklace so just to see where you are in relationship to this sample this length is this side right here this section right here is this looped section this leg are the knots that weave back and forth and then the end of that leg of cord is this side of of of the uh of the necklace so um so we're working from the left the center and the right okay so i hope that's that's clear and so let me show you this it involves a little bit of pre-planning and a little bit of like pre-stringing and stuff so i'm just gonna kind of wing it a little bit and we'll hope that it kind of turns out okay but i i think it will i i i i'm gonna kind of play around with it um if you want anything in between these loops at the bottom we need to pre-string it okay you could wire wrap later which is what i'm going to do with some things but anything you want on this bottom loop we need to pre-string and you can always if you string too many you can always take them off at the end right but you can't add them to add more so i'm just going to and i haven't used the pearls so it might all end in tears but we'll see what happens um i'm also going to grab i'm going to use just a few [Music] jump rings now you can let me pull this down a bit i got our large jump rings these are seven millimeter jump rings in bright gold so i'm kind of mixing my bright and my matte which is fine with me but you could also use as jump rings like i did here the coil spacers right or you could use the um what i want to say you could use the we have the the coil jump rings we have the oval jump rings we also have the soldered rings um that would work out really well so any of those would work okay so i'm going to close these are going to be for my drops so i'm going to close five rings okay and i'm making sure that they're closed let me open that take that one off and notice here how i just have i just grabbed two of my um [Music] chain on my bent chain nose right and that closes them really well so that's ready so i'm going to string on let's see i have let me count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 i've got 14 knots here at the top or 14 loops i'm actually going to do one extra 15 so i have a center okay so let me just lay this out real quick that'll be my middle these will go here and here oh i thought i had five well i lied to you i have four of these and i have five pearls so the pearl will be my middle so i'll only need four rings and i'll move my hand here in just a second so you can see the layout okay so there are those okay then i've got these sixth cents so one two three four five six seven eight nine so here's 10 11 twelve thirteen maybe i will i'll see how this is going to look here and i can always add if i want a little more space in between where i'm knotting here and where i'm not in here i actually might need to add these next two or something so we'll see so if i have a bundle or a grouping this is one two three maybe this is all together four five six seven eight nine ten eleven let's see what eleven looks like okay and uh because this may be big enough right because all of this the beads that i'm using are quite a bit bigger than the um coil spacers that i used earlier so we'll just see okay and this is a seven millimeter jump ring i use the seven millimeter jump ring because that's what i had sitting right here all right but you could go down a size probably as well but i wanted to see this so i wanted to see how i i want to i want them to show is what i'm trying to say so that's why i did that so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to prepare these drops real quick instead of wire wrapping them after the fact i'm going to do this at kate speed because i i probably would have prepared this if this wasn't kind of a fly by night one of you know my free tip fridays where i really kind of fly by the seat of my pants on these designs sometimes but i also think that's kind of the fun part let me go ahead and straighten these pins out sometimes they come to you a little wrinkly but that's okay your wire straightening plier will fix that up toot suite okay [Music] and there and here okay so let's go ahead and wire wrap these in on our beadshop.com website you will see sorry i just i can't see these very well you will see um some great uh tutorials sorry i had to get a little closer to my eyes you guys so bear with me here just a second um you'll see a bunch of different tutorials that we've got on this basic wire wrapping and you'll be able to to play around with those so there's that one and you want to check the holes on these guys sometimes the holes are a bit small so i'm going to double check i've got these two that worked out well these i think i might just need bear with me here just a second hold please see if i can get that through there [Music] well i'll wrap these on later i can't quite get these i'm going to check these drops to the ones that we have in the drawer to make sure that they fit on all of the wires so i'll i'll wire wrap those in just a second but i've got these guys here so let me do these i'm going to bend and that's just how the semi-precious is sometimes and these vermeil loops or head pins that we have they're a slightly heavier gauge because um they've been vermeid right it's gold 18 karat i believe um and they are pleated over the top and i'm gonna hey chris are you out there can i ask you a quick question chris always coming to the rescue i have uh three more of those and leave those out on the counter for me thank you okay and i'm going to come in and wire up these there we go and you can read the tip using the bead reamer you can ream those the holes on these beads ever ever so carefully you have to be very very gentle and you have to do it under water it's very it would be easy to chip them but i would i would do i would do that right so um so that's that story i'm sticking to it so now i'm just going to go ahead i'm going to open these up put that on i see that my mom on the where she watching from i think she's watching on the youtube feed she told the diving board story when i was little thanks so much appreciate okay so let's get this on close this up and let's do these other ones here so you can see i'm just kind of laying this out and kind of seeing how this looks i know amy this is amy's funny right suspense is killing me i can't wait to see how this is going to come together it is true amy i can't wait to see how this comes together either and the jump rings themselves these aren't vermeil um shelly these are plated um so they're gold plate um over brass i believe also very very durable um really a great quality but it's these head pins that are the vermeil so when we say that they're like a 28 gauge or 26 gauge having that vermeil plating over the top of them makes them just a hair thicker engage so where i probably would not have any trouble at all getting the silver ones or the antique silver ones through sometimes with the vermeil you have to hunt um to make sure but these went on i think i just had two that weren't anomaly but i'm gonna check them after the broadcast to make sure uh that they all fit on the pins so don't don't worry about that if you get them okay so and i'm gonna cut these off like so um like i was saying earlier we've got these skill builders on beadshop.com so i'm not going over how i did these wire wraps because i've showed you this many many times but we've got a great skill builder over on bead shop that if your wire wrapping needs a little um pumping up or a little love then uh then you're good okay so here's um here we go so here this is so i'm gonna um i don't know i'm going to string it and we'll see i'm going to cut a angle cut in this leather and let's i think that these six cents yep i didn't even check them beforehand but they sail right on there this these pearls should also go they might have a little what i'm going to do is and the pearls have a nice hole size to them um but they've been drilled so they may have a little bit of residue from you know the pearl maker as they've been drilled so you could always rinse them a bit but see how if you angle cut your cord real well and it comes through and then you can grab onto it and pull it through so it's no it's no big deal this is kind of the squishy end of the cord anyway so i have a lot so i can angle cut to get everything through there see that one just sailed right through so don't let those pesky bead holes be the boss of you you are the boss of those beads okay so here i go and then before i begin to knot i'm going to make sure that my order is correct oh i didn't connect that one so let me connect that now okay let me lift this up sorry thanks you guys i got so excited i was stringing that i went out of frame so i'm back thanks for the nudge it's hard being the producer and the talent and the camera woman all at the same time right but we got this okay there we go almost there and i could re-cut that angle if i needed but i don't need to here we go and this one okay so now i look at it and i make sure that everything is kind of in order these jump rings these seven millimeter jump rings are kind of big so i want to make sure that they don't um that they don't get out of order but so those go around there that's my center here that one comes and this goes around that one and then that goes there okay so we can see that all right okay so now [Music] i'm going to push all of these into the loop remember we had that 10 inch way back way back when so i'm going to push these into the loop here and i'm going to start my knot so i'm going to make just a couple of plain knots or unadorned knots as i like to say uh to begin okay and this is where we're gonna begin knotting so this was our 10 inch piece over here here's our 10 inches of top loop 10 inches on the bottom loop okay and then i'm going to start with this tail to knot now none of this is really exact okay so just kind of go with me on this what i'm going to do is i'm going to start and i'm going to take this tail i'm going to go over the top loop under that leg of the top loop and down and this this leg is coming on top okay now for every single knot there is on top loop on top there are two on the bottom okay so this is actually my first one here i come around and now i'm going to go around this one doesn't really count right it's it's kind of my first knot and it goes to the bottom so i'm going to go around once on the bottom okay around twice on the bottom okay so i've got two standy up loops right there okay now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna bring this cord up to the top of the loop and flip it underneath okay now i need so i've got two here one loop there and so i'm really going in that's why this is called the figure eight right so i've gone up and around and now i'm going to go over this bottom chord twice once and twice now i come up to the top and go underneath like i did before so i've done two knots like this so now i think it's going to be time to add beads so i'm going to go through once i'm going to go around twice now before i go up and around the top loop i'm going to slide a bead where i want it to be and see i also want to start like tightening this up a little bit i'm making this kind of looser than it should be because i want you guys to see kind of how the loop is created but i'm going to now tighten it up and i'm going to get my hands out of here in just a second so bear with me here momentarily there we go pull that around and that one so see how i've tightened everything let me get tight right there right looks that looks about even and you want your tension to be even on this and now i can unpin that side and now i can kind of hold it in my hand like this okay because it's established now i'm going to slide this bead over okay i'm going to go over the cord at the top under the back of it and loop around twice on the bottom cord once and twice and that bead sits i'll bring it up so you can see it that bead sits in the middle of like where that loop comes up and down okay and you might want to try what i did was i just tried knotting this until i knotted this um first without beads to get the hang of it and then i thought i'm going to add beads so i did you can see i slid that pearl there without any fanfare did it there right slide the the one with the drop up now behind and on the other side i hope i don't run out of cord because everything is a little bit bigger but we'll see what happens once and twice around now up slide the um this trio here let's see how it looks go from the front to the back it's going to make it kind of big but i don't know let's see what happens if we don't like it we can take it out it's all right once and twice now up slide the drop over the drop wants to go over these sixth sense spacers but not on my watch they're not so over the top cord around the back and twice around the bottom cord always remember when you're pulling your beads forward or you're pulling your when you're putting your cord around the top that it always goes from the front to the back don't make the mistake of coming from the back to the front or your knot will look kind of wonky so see what we've got here so far i'm just going to keep going we're in it now kids no turning back once twice and up we're on the home stretch we're past the halfway mark and down once and twice up move those beads over come down loop once and twice up slide this bad boy over bring it over the bottom cord and around twice and up and over the top put the purl in come down and over wrap twice i like how i did that slide with in the middle of this this down and around and now i just have to knot two plain ones so it matches once and twice i'm running out of cord a little bit but that's okay one time [Music] around twice and up and then i'll move my hand in just a second i know it's frustrating but you kind of have to hold all of this tension okay and so you end like this so let me show you before we go any further okay so now what i want what i want to do is i want to clamp this and i want to take a look at what i've got here okay so you can see how my tension was a little gets a little funny because of these beads so what i'm going to do is i'm going to kind of walk this tension down just a little and that's simply coming in and tugging from the left to the right and kind of evening everything out because the tension doesn't really even out when you pull it okay and having all of these beads of many sizes and things kind of screws you up a little bit or it just it's not a screw-up it's just you have to adjust a hair this is when you're all i'm using a t-pin and my fingers but this is also when your awl would really come in handy so just bear with me as i walk this through you can't rush knots right and i think that's what made the knotting segments of kate's creative connections i think that's what made them so appealing because during this past year as we were sheltering in place and thinking about loved ones that we couldn't see in all of those things that we were forced to slow down and i am still kind of forced to slow down right things haven't really opened up even though we're getting our shots and things are getting better you know we're still we're still social distancing we're still trying to flatten that curve because um we're not quite out of the woods yet right so taking a moment to kind of keep your hands busy and your mind occupied is still and you can see this is starting to that evened up a bit which is good but doing all of that i think uh is helpful still right in even in kind of normal times to take a moment for meditation and in wendy's book a couple of the things that i've been reading in there she talks about her creative process and giving herself time to slow down and to create um which i found really uh inspiring because you know i too um you know i pretty much create something almost every day so that helps my mind as it goes 100 miles a minute um to kind of center and calm itself down so this is always so don't rush this and if you're trying if you're going to try this this weekend or try this later try it without beads first right just remember that every knot that you do up at the top has to be repeated at the bottom twice so one knot on the top twice on the bottom and there you go and we've even gotten a little more cord for our uses okay so now here comes the magic moment that we've all been waiting for okay we're going to tighten this up and then we're going to see how it looks hopefully it won't look like the dog's breakfast and we'll see what happens okay so i'm going to come in and i'm going to pull on this top cord right here and can you see how as i pull you can't but i'm going to pin it here so you can as i pull and tighten this top cord you can see how everything starts to come together i'm going to pull it tight and then i'm going to undo it a bit this edge was a little tight so i'm going to fix it and i can also still come around and tighten this side up if i want to because now that i've pulled it you can see and i can play around with this a little bit later but you can kind of spread out especially with these plain knots the knots that don't have beads and i'm going to pull the one that i did earlier i'm going to pull that one into the shot so you can see the difference between using beads that are all the same size and beads that are different i of course always like to jump in and say you know what i'm just going to wing it and see what happens but you can see i'm walking this chord through where is it it's right there there we go sometimes i get confused when you're tying a knot which way is up i'm going to leave this out so you can see i'll bring that back in but here's the other one okay i'm going to put that there so you can see that that one is um it's much more even because the core the beads are all the same size but i really want to walk this one through because i want to add this to a necklace gosh darn it and i want it to look nice so let's even amount so when you're tying i guess the lesson that we're learning from this portion is that when you're tying these beginning knots you really want to try and keep your tension as even as you can so that you don't have this issue of having to take up the slack and when you have this piece in your hand and i don't want you to get discouraged like oh i can't tie this knot yes you sure can go back to the beginning of this video and you're gonna watch how i start it and then you're gonna maybe make a couple of failed attempts and then all of a sudden it'll click so don't don't don't stress it right um knot tying is kind of like you know just another good jewelry skill to have you can also try i would say without beads i've said that before but you can also try on some like kitchen twine that might be a little bit heavier which i have here you know using like what wendy did in her book she used some really nice white looks almost like clothesline rope i really like the looks of that so that would really be great to use and see how much slack we're taking out right like this um and again you just have to meditate it through we got we're doing all right i still got a little bit of time before i'm gonna literally wrap this up but we'll talk about through the rest of this design and here's this you know nothing worth having has ever come easy right sometimes you have to beatings the same way you just have to practice and giving yourself permission to practice i think is really important right and you can see i mean i just taught myself this not yesterday there's a lot of things to discover about it you know but it's all right jumping on today and sharing my discovery with you so we're almost there gosh the pearls of wisdom are just dropping like rain out of me today right i need to take up the time here while i'm doing this oh look we're so close kids so so close walk this through and this through [Music] and this through [Music] and this through [Music] and this through and now let's clean this up let's follow the line this goes here and tightens this comes around here it'll make this end look a lot better too because it was a little wonky there we go so one of the things you want to think about when you're making this centerpiece piece okay is how much cord you're gonna need there we go that looks pretty good okay how much cord you're gonna need like so this one that i did earlier let me pull this up this one i started with 10 inches of cord on this side to the left i made about a 10 inch about a 20 inch loop right that i wove through and then i didn't use as much cord in the wrapping because these beads were spaced tighter right so i started with two yards for this one and the ends are about even okay i started with two yards for this one and you can see when i pulled i have a whole lot over here on the left hand side and not a lot here on the right hand side but that was my guess that that's what kind of would happen because um because it took up some space okay and you could even circle this around even tighter let's pull it even tighter and see what it looks like kind of tightened up looks pretty cool with the beads let me get a little tighter on that right that's the center there um i like the pearls i feel like the pearls maybe might be a little big but maybe not especially if you use cord that's a little bit larger um i'm probably going to re-knot this anyway for the final photo for drea to make it you know to put in everything that i've discovered but let's go ahead and widen this out again we can pull it out like this and we could even counterbalance with some beads up at the top here okay but i think that these pearls they might be this section because it makes this look a little funky up here right what i love about this is i love the drops maybe i'd not use those sixth sense ones because see over here where it's just the pearl it looks a little bit better i think so the way i'd finish this off and i'll i'll talk about this i'm not going to actually do it on this one but i'm going to walk you through it because i want you to play around with the beads um maybe if i because i really like the pearl on this though maybe i would just use them on the cord up here i don't have any extra ones i didn't bring one extra but maybe i'd put it on the cord here instead of in the body of the piece here and have this be a little bit tighter so it looks like this a little bit more because this visually is super pleasing to me but i would love to see some drops coming from this okay so what i would do to finish this off let me let me show you i'll put some beads some of the larger hole pearls maybe a few right to give it some heft at the end then what i'll do is i'm going to come in and i've got this paperclip chain and i'm going to come in and probably silk wrap that sucker what i'm going to do here instead is clip it okay so you can see how that kind of mocks up okay then maybe at the end i'm going to cut this away because i can maybe i'll bring this all the way around and have this closure go on this side okay then somehow here you know how much we love what we call the trails end closure here at bead shop which is pretty much just a figure eight knot and i just happen to have some cord right here this is chinese knotting cord 0.5 millimeter antique since it's here that's what i'm going to use i'm going to silk wrap on this guy just to close it up we have a great skill builder on how to seal crap it is a bead shop staple in our stable of beading techniques so if you don't know how to silk wrap i'm not going to go over it in this video but you will find it under our skill builders on beadshop.com and we use it in so many you can also macrame this closed right do a flat macrame over the top i'm going to pull them both straighten it all out and now i can cut everything away i'm going to cut that at an angle i'm going to pull that forward and cut i could also thread burn pull that forward cut it at an angle and just cut the thread not the wrap and so this would connect here that would attach the jump ring this would come through and i'd still grab it here let me clip it and let me show you and i could maybe wire wrap i don't have a bead here but i'd probably wire wrap it a bead there okay what did my mom say my mom said something yeah and i could so my mom was asking me could you add drops later using the jump ring and you certainly could yeah without a doubt so you can see how that's going to look right and so this we want this to hit kind of short around the neckline let me move this up so you can see it a little bit better let me center it so it doesn't look all hodge-podgy there we go so i think that'll work i like this element here i like the big clasp at the side i like and this will be fairly ish if this is a foot of chain let me measure this out where did my my tape measure fell on the floor hold please uh this is about six inches so that's 18 it's about 20 this is about 21 inches 20 or 21 it'll be which i guess i just gravitate towards what would work on my neck so i'm going to off camera and you'll see this in the sample what i'm going to do and i'm going to come in here a little bit closer so you guys can see it i'm going to rework this a little bit i think i'm going to take the pearls out of this and make this tighter and just use the sixth sense and these drops on these jump rings i think i'm going to put a pearl on the end and the end there and then maybe these extra you know with the large holes i could wire wrap them or i could do something here so i think i'm going to take them out of this section though we'll see but i think it's a little wide i like um the look of that with those beads incorporated a little bit better but it's good to to you can see how this design is kind of fleshing out so drea of course has already put everything on the page over on bead shop so of

i made a commitment at the beginning of the year i just had an absolute horrible hangover and i just said i'm done with alcohol and going sober so waking up and seeing all the boys sleep till one o'clock is just such an absolute reassurance and i love kind of sharing that thing with you guys about being stoked on not needing to party to have fun i know that some people like doing it and that's fine if it's not affecting you cool but a lot of people are trying to get away from it and so if i could be a little positive influence to tell you that you're gonna wake up earlier and feel better the next day if you don't go out and party and you can have just as much fun then i'm stoked on that so we're shutting this thing down right now two days from now the merch drop is going live march

but I'm real good with these sharp projectiles is what I'll call these cuz there's a there's a variety of them dude the wall oh you're telling me we transition to breaking that wall opposed to this wall it's up to you but it's not what I want I know yeah this is still missed well as you can see I may have missed this bunny but I hit a lot of spots this truly is a 350 pound of chocolate wall you know how much this cost where's the goth even in buying chocolate in both this cost $2,000 for all this chocolate and it took us literally two days just to melt it and put it in the mold I know what you guys are thinking I didn't even get the bunny the bunny oh dude you got the eyes yeah that's right who's tough now huh Barney the bank didn't deserve that but but it is a great disagreed on I said hey this is really good chocolate these no longer belong to me the giveaway huge congrats you guys you have 48 hours to respond I should do another one of these you should smash the like button I'll

ball you need chocolate here we go well you see that literally shattered chocolate everywhere good thing I got a whole lot more I dived for it hoping I would catch it before it touch the ground it touched the ground no five-second I don't think you said metal chocolate what you can go faster grab it weapon ah nothing nothing it just snapped on my finger no babies around here I'm good next weapon tiger chain punchy thing give a shot oh yeah that really doesn't help in any way I'm gonna throw it I'm not really look at the pattern oh cool horn oh wow yeah a second with the pattern no Peters cool I guess let's make it a bigger pattern I'm talking about I'm talking about you see that one - I don't want to count them but that's a lot of holes something a lot of bite marks some what what bites like that platypus we got even more change it's gonna be a good day today this is how just Dustin celebrates Easter look at this we're gonna see that I tell you get your chocolate you won't find it on to the couch you break it out of a 300 counts there could be under couch we roll you high Easter eggs it's not gross Oh exactly I used or just like couch chocolate yeah yeah that's group yeah it goes you know Aquaman also like chocolate no you know why he probably doesn't even like chocolate the guy's body is like he's super DS he probably doesn't eat chocolate but does even know it is there's no chocolate under the seat dude in spongebob they're all about chocolate okay yeah I may have broke my harpoon doesn't mean I can't throw it I know it's like a balance let's do that again if you draw it like a spear and then it hits it actually pushes off and comes back to you and look at how much damage that did see that oh did that yeah let's do more of that here we go why don't we just forget about the harpoon all right all right yeah let's I mean chocolate again I wouldn't bit it off the wall you guys didn't see that but no I'm nibbling at it saw blade don't don't include this part dude I'm gonna include it you have to know he ate it eat it please poor bunny got chopped right there see that piece goodbye your new shield every time I eat it all the time yes I mean it's a food I can't waste it tiger paw time and you know what thank you for all you guys have backed me up in the comments saying that Tigers were better than lions really because they are Tiger claws I'm a chocolatier that's what they're called yeah chocolatiers it's like a ship but for chocolate oh I didn't know that yeah chocolatier welcome to the just Destin store if you would like a 95 percent cocoa

bunny right here Oh big chunk meat chunk see that the brother bunny used to be that's like his uh his chalk outline yeah cuz he's no longer with us oh I never used this part whoa that's pretty effective alright like I do everything yeah alright just don't mess with this one okay yeah I'm not gonna mention it haven't used these in a while but I think it's appropriate for this yeah I just pinched it yeah it's like cold stone over here yeah a nice little shaving oh my god this is actually one of my most underrated weapons yeah you can actually punch with it kind of hurts the wrist a little not gonna lie and it cuts like this look little daggers if I just did that for the next two hours I might be through it we don't have that kind of time see this part leave that and it digs can't even believe how satisfying this is just yeah so far you'll be so nice right now what hot chocolate yeah just lick that off tonight and not the smartest thing I'm not gonna show that all right give me that I'll bet you just took mine RL not a big deal it's okay every calm down all right speaking Al's it's not it's not really yeah kind of yeah it's gonna be but are you and that's right it's you know what I wanna do take this outside and like throw it so that actually comes back we can't go outside right now take two they did go back yeah exactly this is like a boomerang well just a boomerang cuz all boomerangs come back you know I thought it would do a lot more damage oh wait I remember someone in the comments told me I've been throwing you wrong it's not like this it's like this not really sorry that is more I wasn't over damage let's see oh but it's kind of because it hit the the bunny spot see by the way there's a different types of chocolate in here and as you can see we've hit the milk chocolate era which is my favorite oh you don't have to show that every time do you know if you're gonna go digging for some chocolate okay you may as well do it the right way we got our twisty knife thing here we go ah see yeah and then you twist you dig yeah yeah yeah just keep going that's a mining for chocolate yeah there you go exquisite there you go don't like that Oh clean like cool it's like you know if I dig for long enough it might go through but let's just put a nice whole that's not what we're looking for we're looking for like like obliteration you know this is one of the funner weapons to use it's the tomahawk it does way to me it's the tomahawk I'm saying it gets stuck what do you say I say it just bounces back okay that's for you to believe in me only one way to find out it didn't bounce back it just bounced down but what if we just grab it like that oh did I put some significant damage that's good that's good damage I think this was from the throw and these are the chunks gone you know what I should have done what did like wafers and like peanuts and different type of things in chocolate that's your favorite chocolate bar oh Henry no Henry yeah it's pretty good comment down below your favorite chocolate bar people Henry's if we agree I'll give you a heart I do this off cam it's not great I think we forgot about the swords another L the the handle on this broke because I think this is not meant to actually be used and it pinched me it's just I had let's get something better here we go bro you call that better listen Jeremy thank Jeff I bought a new samurai sword you know this a couple videos ago and I completely broke it in the last video when in doubt you go with what you know and well this is what we got oh yeah big chunks this is the last one that I was talking about and from wish calm and well it what is that yeah just that's about as good as it is this though it used to be good and you're all judging me I know okay right rightfully so let's get some something like this this is always a good go to trusty weapon that's what I'm talking about a little to trust that almost got me here we go yeah yeah okay I can't see anything that's a lot it is a lot we're not dead oh yeah it's a masterpiece look at this this just looks so good doesn't it it does it looks like we went skating run chocolate you're actually imagine going skating on chocolate I don't think that would work why you won't blyde yeah okay maybe that wouldn't work my breath I don't know what's next but I think we're onto something shovel time this is not just any shovel okay this is the m48 Spade cold steel thing I think I don't know I don't think that was a theme name you said lots with you know let's get the corner right here ready for this GoPro oh okay okay I got a corner that's a big chunk of chocolate but this is probably like maybe a third of how thick it is we need something that's gonna do this with more force I think I know what that is I think I know what you know what that is yeah let's get that we got the axe oh why yes yes you're an axe touring Jeremy yeah oh here's my target right here see this x marks the spot I know that doesn't yeah it doesn't matter the spy that doesn't have a good night that was close not really you give me no no Ben no anything think I'm gonna have to improvise blunt force trauma just beat it up what do you think beat it up that's what I'm thinking with the og Batwa this is getting shorter and shorter by the wall video it's just let's let's keep going that's not gonna work let's get the second og back second og back trying to Mitch really just aren't nice to my things do we are another one of these oh yeah we did okay good who knew he didn't talk it would be that loud and I heard your hands so much and look what's happening to my back I just this G greens I'm gonna get a splinter so I'm gonna put this away but not before we got it intact bunny yes I've had enough okay now you're saying sure all the other times chuckling now yeah sure well that's that's a clean piece though I wanna die [Applause] you like that oh yeah grabbed my mouth I guess Oh My yes that's some pretty good damage I was all right close range close range is better yeah oh dude how would it be great but it's bolted into the floor yeah I remember is there anything else we can do I got something that's all kicks oh no don't pull anymore nothing nothing this is this a weapon set video not a hidden weapon bro you really think of boobs gonna work no I just I got I got a clean I mean why not throw the broom give us a sec I broke the broom pretty strong wall it's a very strong wall we're gonna have to really step it up oh nice but we're about to make another mess here we go [Music] okay that's more than I learned more hearing it like straight down into it now we got ourselves a crater this is probably one of my sharpest until this look oh yeah not bad right oh yeah look at that why is it like I know it's milk chocolate but like come on ah she a she chocolate John lotion on that yep some lotion on that chocolate you know what I'm thinking those things still don't know the true name of these but they work really well Lily just the pinch technique ready boom ballina okay neither one hit yeah you missed both here's what it is a lot of damage didn't I say after all I said blunt force except this is after Trent hear that it's like it's ratalie throat destroyed literally like I want to invite Tran back but at the same time I don't write just gonna show up yep all the handle hit first and it broke let me go where to go uh we may have lost the handle but it still works maybe this is not struggle as I thought but this is oh I don't even I just want to have this molded and put in my living room this is like art it's not art you said this is the cart I like and this is right here it's like a full charcoal bar mmm as much as I don't want to remove this I also want to do that again Oh [Applause] oops I'm done with that you remember what happened last time with this roll I'll win the cream soda I never forget that yeah more cream soda okay now I was joking Eric you joking no I refuse let's see if it does that to the wall oh yeah okay not bad as a cream soda but a lot of damage ah that glittery like that one of those is like the same as the harpoon let's see about this not this is like the spear except you know what as good as a spear what a spear that doesn't make me I spear as this goodness that makes sense you know it does I was so blessed not because I didn't make it real you know I didn't put effort into it I just don't know what to say oh jeez WWE yes yeah you would like this kind of I do like it if you guys don't know why Jeremy likes this weapon you don't watch this channel enough we'll be back it's time to make some hot chocolate oh yeah you know I'm thinking right except for the fact that there's a big leak on this right now and every time I turn on it hisses so I'm still gonna do it but we got only like a ten-second window here let's do it what give graham cracker no no marshmallow cheese what see chocolate and cheese yeah no one likes cheese and chocolate next let's hit it well this week time for the moss eh this is just does this ever make sense we always think it's not that strong right well you got chocolate on your ceiling Wow it's available time we really really tried to finish this off this usually does the trick well did nothing you usually does the trick you did more damage to that door okay I know this is something new this is a new purchase and a new favorite maketh the Indian War Club solid drop the steel spike oh oh that's deep oh dude yeah that's what I'm talking about see that yeah oh you know this is kind of like it's like a sledgehammer so why don't you guys sledgehammer ah it's all kind of like shaped like a boomerang that's why yeah you're right you're right you really like a boomerang sixteen pound sledgehammer a lot some damage oh yeah yeah I say these things on 100 layers okay if you melted 100 chocolate bars on top of each other this would be more than a hundred layers look at that we're not even through but we will be you don't start to think what because the Indian War Club is a mix of blunt and sharp so this this is just blunt the big end but I think you guys know where the most damage comes from I think it's time to break this for real it's time let's do it all right are you sure it didn't look like it doesn't look broken enough I want to tell them first by the way guys if you didn't know I actually have a second channel Dustin and Corley with my girlfriend where we do vlogs and challenges and I showed how I made this it's a really really good channel as matter you guys man yeah bangers oh we miss hope to see you guys over on me and my girlfriends channel and if you guys love this channel boom boom click one of those videos it helps me way more than you would ever know Happy Easter and you guys know I always like to leave on a high note [Music]", "oklyVZkVtuk": "good evening and thanks for joining tonight's ti technology webinar hosted by texas instruments where tonight we are going to stimulate you with some simulations for your statistics students my name is mike houston and i'm the moderator for this event i teach algebra and calculus near pittsburgh where i use ti technology to make tough to learn tough to teach concepts accessible to all my students excited to be joined by our two panelists becky byer and tracy watson becky is a nationally board certified teacher who teaches grades nine through twelve her current classes at kelly walsh high school include ap statistics c plus a b computer science a and ap computer science principles in the past becky's taught algebra 1 algebra 2 and visual basic programming becky has a bachelor's degree in mathematics education from black hill state university and a master's in mathematics education from montana state university becky it's great to have you with us tonight great here to be here tonight and tracy has been teaching geometry ap statistics and ap computer science at benton high school in arkansas for the past six years previously she taught college mathematics courses for over 15 years she's been an ap statistics reader for two years which she feels was the best pd for teaching ap statistics as a t cube national instructor she enjoys sharing with teachers across the country the appropriate use of technology in the classroom tracy thanks for joining us tonight good evening mike it's great here to be here with you and becky we're expecting a large crowd to see your audio is muted feel free to send any questions to becky or tracy using the q a window on the right side of your screen we'll also be using the chat window to send general messages as a reminder the session is being recorded and we'll provide a link to vince to the event certificate of attendance at the conclusion of the webinar we hope you don't have any audio issues but if you do try toggling the audio broadcast icon at the bottom of your webex screen at this point becky is going to discuss our agenda um so tonight we've already done the welcome and introductions we're going to start out tonight with a activity called pumpkin patch which is going to give us a method to look at different sampling methods we're going to look at convenience samples simple random samples stratified and clustered once we've talked about how to collect data then we're going to move on to sampling distributions and explore mean median and standard deviation then we'll talk about combining variables and do a similar simulation from the sampling distribution and then we'll wrap things up with a type 1 and type 2 error simulation that deals with both probability for type 1 and type 2 error and how to calculate power becky thanks so much and tracy is going to discuss our expected outcomes our outcomes from these four stimulating simulations that becky created are going to be that you can explain the difference between various sampling methods you can calculate the standard deviation for a sampling distribution know when a sampling distribution is approximately normal and you can calculate the mean and standard deviation for a sum or difference of two random variables and also calculate power awesome thanks so much tracy and while you get up uh get set up sharing your screen um becky i'm gonna put you on the spot for a minute and tracy too if you want to chime in uh today we're talking about simulations and i just want to know if you guys can give me your short five five second spiel about why you think it's important that people are teaching statistics use simulations um i think it's the visualization piece and getting an idea in your head of what's going on but i also think it with simulations you get to see the messiness of statistics and the variability and so that it's not just you know you're not always going to roll a six every single time you roll a dice or when you go do a sampling distribution it doesn't always give you the exact same same level so i think it's really important for kids to see that variability and i think their first experiences with probability is so theoretical that seeing the messiness of what it is in real life is extremely important and to constantly remind them of that and the stimulation stimulating simulations do that hey you guys create the title i knew that i was going to trip over my words tonight thank you so much it's awesome me too so it's okay so the first activity that the first activity that we're going to explore tonight is um called the pumpkin patch activity so typically i do this with my students in the fall so imagine that it's this nice september october feel um you've had your garden growing and now we're ready to bring in the harvest and we kind of want to get an idea of how much time it's going to take us to bring in all of the lovely items that we've grown in our garden so if tracy will go ahead and click over to page 1.2 actually i guess 1.3 for my pages so here's our pumpkin patch um if you'll notice your pumpkin patch has um 100 um little squares it's kind of been graded off for us we have 10 rows and we have 10 columns you have a nice road system running off to the left hand side and you have some water running along the bottom so for those of you out there who happen to grow things do you think that every one of those squares is going to contain approximately the same number of pumpkins or do you think that there could be some variability due to some factors and what do you think those factors are so if you'll go ahead and type that into the chat window what do you think if you're going to grow in that sort of a situation should your field be uniform or what do you think might be some factors and we're assuming that you are a green thumb and not like me that i tend to not do so well i just throw seeds in and see what happens best intentions i always have the best intentions all right so we've got some water the water will be a factor more pumpkins will be near the water less far away soil and sun oh someone said about i missed it salt in the soil from the oh salt from the road yes in montana i think you've probably had your road salted recently all right so we're going to start out with trying to make an approximation about how many pumpkins are in our entire field here and so i tell my students okay if you've ever been out to any sort of a garden situation you know i might not want to like weed through all of of the pumpkins to get to the other side of the field i don't want to trip over things i don't want to get tangled so it might be just just nice and simple to just sample all 10 of those places along the road so the way that the activity works on the calculator is you can just click right on the squares and those then will become part of your sample if you accidentally click on a square you can actually click off of it and it'll make it unselected for you deselect it i guess so i have a hundred squares and i'm gonna take a sample of ten so if tracy clicks the total there we'll have a sum of 154 pumpkins in our patch that sounds like a lot to go harvest because you have 100 squares and that's just the sum for 10 of them so if we multiply that by 10 you're going to have a grand total of 1500 pumpkins in your patch but you know that sounds like an awful lot of work to go sample all these pumpkins so maybe instead of going along the road i wonder what would happen a lot of you said that the water was going to play a big role in our pumpkin patch so what happens if we maybe lazily went along the river maybe fishing as we're going and counting all of our pumpkins that are along the river oh along the river some of you are right water might make a difference so we went from an average of 15.4 to an average of 28.4 so almost doubled going along the river which someone has noticed the sample is probably not accurate because you're only using part of the patch first one is a convenient sample and i don't you might even say the second one might even be a convenience sample because i i'd rather go fishing while i'm counting you know that than going right along the road so if you were going to teach us with your statistics students what might be some better methods that might maybe account for the fact that maybe along the road and along the river maybe your your situations are different what might we be able to do instead go ahead and put that in the chat random 10 stratify with columns as strata diagonal x sample along the diagonal all right so tracy why don't you go ahead and you you already clicked on the road um someone said to stratify by the columns what if we stratified by the road because your mouse is already there do you think you can get this to make a random sample for you oh yes i can because i read the directions on 1.1 it says if i click along the road it will randomly select a block in that row so i can get my 10 random samples using the rows and strata so so along the rows we now end up with an average of what 26.9 so for those of you who are keeping track our original low on the road was 15.4 along the river was 28.4 and now going by rows is 26.9 all right so i wonder if it's not great someone says better but not great so i wonder if somebody did that somebody else like another student did this what their answers would look like tracy what do you think if i had like if i gave this to a different student and they have a different student randomly i hope they realize and they'll find out if they each student is doing their own they're each going to get a different sample so now i only have 229 i told you i just throw it in and see what happens not doing so well so so with my students we actually do a little bit of data collection and every i have every student do what we've just done going across do you have to seed your calculator the answer to that is usually i tell the kids to seed anyhow i'm 99 sure that in the code that it's pulling a random seed anyhow but just to make sure my kids always set their random seed on their calculators before we do any sort of a simulation but i'm pretty sure in the code that this one is set for that and i think so because i think this is different answers from when i've done it before it is and i can tell you that when we did it in class i'm pretty i'm pretty sure that it's got a random seed in there yeah um so this is a really nice data collection activity with the kids because then you can have them plot those those values on a nice dot plot and you can come up with like a class mean for the rows you could come up with a standard deviation for the rows um but then you could say someone had mentioned do the rows and the columns have something different with them is it better to sample by the rows and example by the columns so now i'm clicking on the water area to get a random sample of the columns and i get a total of 237. why would it be why might rows be a little bit better than the columns thinking about the situation that we have someone want to put that in the chat because i'm leaning towards i'm liking the rope especially just looking at this even i'm liking doing the rows better than the columns so good observation if you go just by columns you could end up with all of them along the water yeah or i was thinking i didn't get any along the water this time you know get nothing along the water whereas if you do rose you're at least going to guarantee i should clear first guarantee you're going to get something near the water something a little bit further away because we really think the water's definitely got something to do with how pumpkins grow and the way it's coated if you have the students do it both by columns and by rows the variability one has a smaller variability than the other and i'm pretty sure that that you're right if you sample we need the water the higher influencer for numbers um somebody did ask can you just click on one and see what's in one cell let's try it yes and that's actually how we end up with what's what's really in the field at the end we do a big reveal or if the kids stumble upon it on their own they'll click on all 100 squares and go i already know the answer here's what's in there by the time they're at the end but it does take a little bit of work to do that and we all have that student that will do that all right what's another sampling method we might want to use here what do you guys think we've talked about strata we could do systematic systematic okay oh totally random sample i wonder if i could do a totally random sample there yeah simple how in the oh becky i think you're gonna need to show us something really cool that if you were given this file you might not even know it's there unless you read directions which i'm a teacher i don't usually read directions i jump and i play first so there's one i even forgot to when the kids got there i always tell the kids for statistics my favorite button is the menu button because that's what my options are for statistics well if you hit the menu button you'll notice under select there is a simple random sample you can actually get it to do as the columns and the rows stratification for you all 10 samples at once but if you click on simple random sample there is my nice simple random sample everyone had an equal opportunity and there's my meme nice and so again i would have all of my students do this and we would do on the board a nice little dot plot and have the kids plot their values so we can kind of see what the typical or where it's centered for for all of our samples and i can kind of see what is the the spread look like because some of these um like i said i know the rows and the columns the spread is different and so it's kind of a nice conversational point to have with your kids and there's one other one underneath the menu select sampling method do you all notice it cluster this is for that lazy person who doesn't wants to not really just find a spot and grab everything around not wait very long so you can do two kinds of clusters come up with their totals i'll tell you one of the things that i really like about this i've done something similar but with a worksheet where all the numbers were there and they did the work on the side and they had a lot of i called the grunt work to do a lot of the calculations to adding them all up and calculating the mean which is not hard but it takes away from the process of learning what different sampling methods and so i like that that piece of this that type of activity is kind of taken out of the hands of the students so we can focus on the sampling methods and have good discussions around that now along with the tns files becky has also created some worksheets that you will get you will get them in word version so that you can change them if you like do you want to show them that for this one becky um yes we were going to talk about that second page yep yeah this is i jumped to the second page on this one and so what are we doing on these so so this is what we were talking about so this one says to have the students do a simple random sample so the picture is there i have the kids actually color in on the the image off to the left hand side the 10 that they sampled because when we get to our our class dot plot up on the board and we're copying it on the paper it's kind of nice to say okay those of you who had a higher um average can you tell me what your dot plot or what your field look like for your sample those of you in a lower mean can you tell what they look like and so the kids can kind of come up with why those numbers might be have an outlier one way or the other but then having them write it on the board this is an early on activity i do in the fall and one thing i find with my students is that they really struggle trying to get data collection and figure out in their head what that scale should be so as they're looking on the board trying to figure out okay what do i increment my my dot plots by and so i like to kind of leave this worksheet open ended and i have them wait until everybody's data is on the board and then we kind of develop as a class where what should my scale look like what are the maxes what are the mins and what are we incrementing by just to kind of reinforce those skills from earlier in the year yeah i thought that was interesting because at first i noticed there's no scaling and i of course asked her why isn't there any scaling on this and she reminds us of they have trouble with some of that stuff that we think oh this is you know this is going to be the easy part gather those put those plots on but some some students really have trouble thinking about the best way to plot their raw data then and it does it for different samples ask them to do stratified each row and then there's cluster so they can see all of those different class data plots then and then i like the follow-up questions what methods have smaller variabilities which methods have the largest variabilities and reminding them what our ultimate goal is and then of course how many pumpkins do you think are they in the entire field and then justify they have trouble justifying at least my students do just because all right so that's our first activity to kind of set the stage talking about how to get samples um this one everybody has the same field and so if everybody clicked in the top left-hand square and made a reveal they'd all have the same value so that that way we're talking about the same field when we're collecting our data and they can see how those different data collections would would result in different sample means the second file that we're going to switch to for sampling distributions um also i know has a random speed i'm pretty sure in the code here because it doesn't ask you for a random seed for it and so this one actually is going to be different for every student so as they're comparing their answers when they're not or when they're taking a random sample on purpose everyone is going to be different so for this sampling distribution activity we're going to start with a nice little normal distribution it tells the students what the population mean is and the standard deviation for their their sample and to begin with we're just going to take a nice little sample of five data points out of our uniform distribution and you'll notice it shows you those five values and then it plots on the bottom the mean of your one sample and so the very first question i asked my students because this is again early on is can they describe the top graph and so they'll talk about the shape the center and the spread and then after we take the very first sample i ask the kids okay so you've got one mean below if i were to let you take multiple samples over and over and over again what do you think the shape center and spread would be down below if i let you repeatedly take samples of size 5. and i really like how you're kind of asking them to predict without doing it what do you think's going to happen and on the worksheet you'll notice that this one we do very deliberate very slow to ask them every single time they take a sample to make some predictions and fine-tune those predictions so the first question is going to ask them to define the population the second one they're going to only take one sample so they get in their head that they're taking only five pieces of five data points and averaging them and then they're going to take 19 more and then they're going to make some predictions as to what do they think is going to happen with the can i take my 19 more you can take your 19 more and what's nice is notice each time she takes a sample on the bottom the new point that's added is in yellow um the points are in blue so that they can kind of see how that most recent sample has been added to their distribution of sample means down below and in case you're worried because i was at first it's keeping track of how many times i've clicked at the bottom so i know when i've hit 19 more so now in the chat what are you noticing about the distribution of the sample means if you were asked to describe that distribution what would you say getting some normals less variable than the population i like the close to normal oh some of you are thinking it's unimodal which which um it looks unimodal okay what other vocab words can we use approximately normal yes symmetric nice roughly symmetric mm-hmm all right so sample mean is getting closer to 40. and actually that's one of the questions on the worksheet for them to look at is to kind of compare the sample mean to the population mean so that's a good observation and i like notice in that part after this they're also comparing with their neighbors sample means because remember everybody is getting their own their own distribution of sample means right now they're not the same because they're each getting randomly generated their own samples so i think that variability is important to constantly point out to students all right so the next one has them jump to a total of 30 and you might be thinking to yourself poor tracy is going to have to click this um 280 more times actually she's got her you got your exercise finger ready to go there boom i'm doing 30 at a time now and i was worried and so then notice it jumps to taking 50 at a time for the students um just so that they're not clicking over and over and over again and um tracy is using the button but you can actually just hit the enter button on the calculator and it will take another sample for you all right so we have 350 we have 400 what do y'all think he said approximately normal after we'd only done 20 after 400 are you guys still going to go with the approximately normal yes yeah much closer and this is for the inspire there is not um anything for the 84 like this but somebody did mention in the chat there are applets also on the internet that do something very similar what i'm i have inspires unfortunately my classroom that each my students have inspires and so getting their hands on it unless everyone's got a computer it's really nice for them to actually do this individually instead of me just showing it up on the screen all right so i want you to take a look at the standard deviation at the top for your sampling distribution and the standard deviation for your distribution of sample means and we have a good conversation as a class notice the means are approximately equivalent but your standard deviations are not and so at this point i have my students make a prediction um how do you think the distribution or your standard deviation for your population compares to that one below is there some math that we can do to calculate that out and typically at this point my students tell me it's about roughly half they'll tell me that my distribution and my sample means look like it's roughly half that of the population and that's a very typical answer so so then it would be nice to say okay so if it's roughly half what happens if you change your sample size and somebody already said menu earlier so if you hit the menu there is a way to change your sample size and so let's go ahead and change it to 30. noticing our standard deviation had been 10 and a half so i'm going to write that down that was 10 and a half from before and then tracy can now just repeat the process so you can go ahead and sample um and it works just like before it takes it one at a time so you hit 20 and then they go by 50s and now they're like oh yeah no it's not half not anymore so what did we change it's not a half anymore so what would have affected it um size so let's make a prediction if tracy changes the sample size too i think was was 100 an option tracy oh 40 what was the what was the neck don't see 50 50. if tracy changes it to 50 let's make a prediction what do you think will happen to the standard deviation for our distribution of sample means do you think it's going to be the same so it's going to be 4.4 ish is it going to get smaller is it going to increase well what was it again when i did a sample size of 5 you wrote it down and i didn't 10 and a half okay thank you and then i went to 4.4 ish so i'm going to say 2 just because all right so let's check tracy's hypothesis out and see if she gets to two come on come on not too much i went too far she's about 3.2 so on the worksheet the students do the same thing that tracy just did they will keep um at a normal distribution but they will change the sample size and they'll notice as the sample size increases their standard deviation decreases um and then it's really kind of funny because the that when tracy scrolls down here you're going to notice that the formula is on the page and i'm asking the kids usually so how do you think we're going to calculate this and they don't jump ahead i don't know why they don't jump ahead to get to the punch line um but then at the bottom it does show them theoretically how to get the standard deviation and then they will compare that to to what they've got and see if it kind of looks like they're approximately the same values and so if you have a class you know that had it has that student here's where having the word version of this document will be handy maybe cover that up i don't always have that student but sometimes i do all right so then the question is does this phenomenon that you can take the standard deviation and divide by the sample size does that hold for other distributions so what type of a distribution would you guys like to see for oh actually trace it's not even go to the menu oh why why don't you just draw like an art student okay i was practicing to come up don't go too fast to come up with something interesting if she just clicks and holds the mouse you're allowed to go ahead and change the shape of your um sampling distribution or sorry your population distribution and the kids really kind of get into being creative and trying to come up with different patterns and see what they can kind of come up with okay i'm happy with that one all right and so then we just said that it's gonna the formula was the standard deviation over the square root of n so tracy let's go to a quick scratch pad because we know the standard deviation for yours is a 21.78 and we're going to divide by the square root of n what sample size do you want to use let's do the 30. okay so 3.98 8 yep all right so then we can go put it into practice and do the exact same thing as before so you can take a sample a size 30. we're looking for 3.98 pretty darn close all right so you could have your kids do all sorts of different shapes and have them check this out what is one more thing you might want to discuss with your kids using an app like this what's one other important conversation that might need to occur here any ideas where we might have a little bit of a misconception going on essential limit theorem new skewed distribution small sample distribution size okay so tracy do you want to go ahead and investigate that one that let's make the original shape skewed and let's keep the sample size at five so let's go back and make it small let's go ahead and kind of take a look to see so this is one when you're gonna try to talk to kids about sample size and trying to decide if it's skewed or not skewed to really point out to them to use up top the the scale to kind of approximate where is the center of that distribution and then kind of use that as a like a some a line of symmetry and ask them does the spread on the right hand side look approximately the same as the spread on the left hand side that's one thing that my students kind of gloss over when we do this activity so i really have to point out with them when they're drawing their sketches on their their notes which ones really are approximately normal and which ones are definitely skewed and if you wanted to make it even more skewed than what i've got there because you saw that tracy could draw she could fill that in even more in the upper right hand corner if she wanted to give it um the population wasn't badly skewed we could really make that a badly skewed population and you can illustrate with your kids um how that sample size really needs to be over 30. and so becky has the worksheet laid out really nicely to help with some of this guided exploration to see someone had an interesting question will it hold for other statistics i think there's a page for that oh awesome i love it when we plant people in the audience right thank you is exactly like page one i guess this is page 1.4 is the same as 1.2 only now it's going to measure the medians and not the means you can explore with your students does this hold can you still take and do the standard deviation over the square root of n and they can kind of look at does that 30 number still kind of appear just eyeballing it if it looks like it's approximately normal and i like doing other statistics too with them for that reason so i don't think we always have to be looking at mean even though our focus in ap statistics is typically proportions and means there are other statistics that statisticians do use and investigate so okay i think we're ready to move on to stimulating simulations number three all right so now that we've done sampling distributions for one population i wonder what it looks like if you have two populations and you take a sample from one and a sample from the other and maybe add those together so you're going to notice the layout of this one looks really similar so you'll notice we have that nice i don't know magenta color on the left hand side that's a nice normal distributor or nice uniform distribution but we're going to take one and only one sample from that population and we're going to partner with a sample from the blue population on the right so if you'll notice now in the middle box it says i got a 27 from the purple population and i got a 40 from the blue population so now when i combine those i get a nice sum of 67. that's kind of maybe a nice point to talk about right now how come the standard deviation and the variance down below is zero you only have one value you're not marrying at all so there's no variation okay all right go ahead take another sample okay let's stop at 2 that's interesting so using the populations from above notice the purple population has a mean of 20. they both have a standard deviation of 14.7 and they both have sorry as a variance and they both have a standard deviation of 11.84 after two samples where i've added them together my distribution of sample sums has a mean of 68 a variance of 2 and a standard deviation of 1.41 what do i think it's going to look like as i take more samples sample sizes right here and you called me out on it yup sample size right now is only one we're going to get to over 30 but right now we're going to kind of set up the premise for them to realize that we're going to do kind of a matched pairs here so you're going to have one from the populations purple and one from the blue so i can sum those together so to begin with we're going to start with just the one sample and with the visuals on the side because when you start taking 30 samples little calculators don't have enough real estate on the screen to show students that you have 30 samples that you're getting one purple one blue combining them together and then doing my 30 samples there all right so if you'll go ahead and sample there and it's going by one at a time so the students can kind of make the connection between what are we sampling and and how are we getting the distribution i can't remember when does this one jump i was just sitting here going i don't know if this one jumps you might have to go change it to jump i might not have made it jump its own you hit menu looks like you change the sample size i'm pretty sure it does oh just a sample size so don't do that yeah don't do that okay there we go we just hit the enter button a whole lot so even though at 142 students can kind of start making some comparisons if you look at the means for the populations and the variances for the populations and the standard deviations for the populations say that 10 times fast how do they compare to my distribution of my sample sums down below what are some observations mean is the sum the means they are both double is everything double something else with standard deviation variance is close to the sum but that's not quite double just mean and variance are doubled so then this is where you start having the students try to make some predictions how can they go from the variance to the standard deviation and if you covered that earlier in the year they might be like oh yeah that's how those two are related so now that that tracy has done this one sample at a time so your students understand that you're doing one from the pink population and one from the blue population and summing them but you've done that sampling distribution from before to realize your sample size probably should be more than 30. we can change the sample size to 5 if you want to reinforce with the kids how this this matching is going to work because with five you still have a little bit of real estate on there up you might need to go clear that tracy oh sorry and so now notice five barely fits on the real estate but they can see i'm taking five values from the um the pink population and five from the blue and i'm pairing them together finding the sums and then taking the the mean of that sample this has gone a little faster i think that visual of them seeing that connection of what they're actually doing is so important because they forget that there's multiple ways to get this one doesn't have a duplicate of 36 there's different ways i like getting stopping at a screen where they're seeing two of the same sums there we go 16 and 22 and 8 and 30. that's something i know my students they know it but they don't really understand it in this situation and then this file is just like the other distribution file so if tracy wants to channel her inner artistic she can actually change the population distribution to any shape her heart desires get a really skewed one this time oh go and go away go away okay i'm not being creative there we go this actually does work on the ipad app if you have the inspire ipad app on there you can download it and it works really well on the ipad very nice very nice is that all that's in this inspire document oh no what would be nice y'all any ideas what would be nice to be on the next page what might we want to explore in a combining variables we looked at the sum standard deviation subtract them subtraction would be nice and this one um i think is really helpful with kids because my kids always want to just subtract those standard deviations from one another yes so it's set up exactly the same way let's go ahead and do 50. we didn't do 50 on the other one can't see them all but nice okay so we have started we started with um how to collect data we talked with different sampling method different ways to take samples we've gone to sampling distributions now we're going to jump into hypothesis testing with you and talk a little type 1 type 2 error so this one does not have the random seed in the code so for those of you who have been waiting for the random seed to pop up i did this activity today with my students and if they all type in the same random seed you all know what they're going to get the same results so i told them to put their birthdays real birthdays but they can put anything they want in here to randomly see the calculator so they don't match their neighbors for this one you don't want them to to match their neighbors at all um but oh so tracy you're actually going to want to put random seed in front of that oh yeah duh i'm excited about trying to remember my dog's birthday because i don't want to put in my birthday so they just have to put a random seed and hit enter and then that will go ahead and random seed their calculator so that theirs is different from their neighbors so i don't know about you tracy but probably um type one type two errors and powers are not necessarily some of my favorite topics to teach just because i think they're really hard for kids to grasp what do you think no power of the first year i was so determined to teach power i spent two days each day going back and saying i'm going to do better than i did yesterday i actually think it went into three days before i finally said you know i understand it but not enough to really get you to understand it so let's just call it a day this first year of teaching ap statistics it did not happen in my room at all and it still was a couple years later before i started doing better at teaching it so becky i love your story about what inspired you to create this end spar file i told tracy i said i i like to put power off to the end because i think it's really hard for them to grasp and so one year i put it off to the very very end like two days before the ap test we taught it and reviewed and the kids came back in and they were so excited because it was somewhere on the test i don't know where some were on the test they were so excited they could do power and all i could think of was i don't know that you guys grasp power there's got to be a better way for me to teach this for you and so i sat down and i'm like i've got to get what's in my head onto some sort of app for you guys to play with and so that's actually where this came from is how to get them to play to understand really how are we getting those probabilities from type 1 type 2 errors so now that you have a nice random seed let's go ahead and go to the first page um so there's a story that goes with this that says you have a an infinite candy jar that has a population proportion of six or there you go so you have an infinite jar of candies sixty percent of your candies are green forty percent of them are some other colors i mean you've been some hired to do some quality control to see is the true population proportion of green that's my school color really sixty percent or are they they not sixty percent so it's just a a simple null hypothesis uh p is point six or p is not point six um so what are you going to do you're going to go out and you're going to take a sample so i told them i can't send them all to a candy store and have them take a random sample we could go get them you know all sorts of candy to go do that but on our sampling distribution app um i can send them all out to really quickly do a sample so here's what's going to happen she's going to hit the sample button she's going to go out and sample 30 candies and collect how many of them are green and we're going to plot that proportion and so out of her sample only point or 7.704 of them happen to be green and so where they've landed on our normal distribution is in a region where i would fail to reject because it's only it looks like maybe roughly more than one standard deviation away which is exactly where those are marked out you can have your kids actually calculate the standard deviation for for this scenario where the sample size is 30 and and verify that those are one standard deviation and two standard deviations away from the mean but remember you have your kids randomly see their calculator not everybody's is the same so if tracy took another sample the kid sitting next to her might end up with the reject and if she does another one to represent the kid sitting behind her they're gonna fail to reject so what i have my my students do is get into small groups of six to eight and have each of them take one sample and look at does their sample cause them to reject or fail to reject and then they kind of look around the room and their groups and they talk about did everybody get similar results why or why not so then i'm going to ask how could we maybe investigate this further so how could we come up with should we really reject or fail to reject like are those is our sample really representative of the whole population and is it telling us that we really should fail to reject or not so if we go to the next page we're going to build off of that last apple with our sampling distribution and this one's going to let the kids repeatedly take their samples so instead of erasing each time they take a sample now tracy's up to five and she's got roughly a 20 rejection rate so if she pauses here what do you guys think just looking at the 10 samples she's taken do you think the true population proportion of green is really 0.6 or looking at her 10 samples do you think it's not 0.6 some knots looks to be larger than 0.6 higher not not all right let's go ahead and take some samples and check that out notice the 50 did pop up here yay does look higher but it was only 10 samples [Music] i'm getting more evidence now 260 samples and so as they start to take their more and more samples they're going to start to develop that sampling distribution um and then they'll notice what you guys have noticed that the population proportion is not really 0.6 it is actually higher but there there's so much overlap between this 0.6 and what appears to be maybe i don't know 0.7 ish 0.68 ish that there were a lot of data points that were actually going to cause me to fail to reject just because of the overlap in those sampling distributions okay so from here it might be nice if tracy could i don't know change the sample size or change her her actual population so if you go to the next page it could be two pages over two three pages three now the students are actually allowed to change both the null hypothesis and the actual population proportion and they can change the sample size so at this point if you want to talk to your students about the probability of a type 1 error you could actually set both of those guys to equivalence so have the null hypothesis and the population proportion be set to 0.6 so if the population really is 0.6 and the null hypothesis is 0.6 we know the population's 0.6 that we probably shouldn't reject but what we know about sampling distributions is 5 of the time if that's where my alpha level is i'm going to reject so in the worksheet with the kids you're going to have them do a bunch of setting the population proportion the same as the null hypothesis and letting them change the sample size to come up with does the sample size lets you change whether or not the probability you reject or fail to reject when the population proportion is really centered at your null hypothesis and then you can do the same thing with a type two error you can make it so your null hypothesis and your alternative hypothesis or your null hypothesis and your population parameters are not the same and you can talk about the probability of making a type two error so you fail to reject but we can tell that that it's really there and i'm looking at the time here tracy yeah this is a beautiful visual of this and like i said this to me is still to this day like one of the hardest things to teach students because it puts so much of it all together um and i'm with you i like wait until one of the very last things that i do is teach power because they've got to get really comfortable with sampling distributions and tests before this is really going to make sense and so i just want to point out the worksheet that you have that goes with this is describing exactly how she has the students working through this so i know we went through that really fast and so then it's going to tell the kids exactly what to set the populations and the proportions to go to the two pages we haven't shown you yet but again you guys get the files will actually let you change the alpha level as well and so you can explore as you increase or decrease the alpha level how does that change the probability for a type 1 or a type 2 error and then the very last page is kind of that traditional picture that i've seen in a lot of textbooks where you get to com compare the distribution for your hypothesis verse against something and look at your probabilities so again the worksheets will be there and the tns files will be there for you and hats off to becky this is this is all becky's stuff i'm just going to use it in my classroom like we all are now probably i'm just glad it goes to some good use oh wait i know you worked really hard on this and now i got to say i already tweaked one of her files so do not that that's that's just kind of how i am that's how we all are so that's why she's been so nice to give us the word files thank you so much becky for that you're welcome a quick question i know a lot of people especially at the beginning were asking about the 84 um so what did you use to create these files on the inspire which coding language so it's actually coded in lua is embedded in the inspire language um it's not on the 84 and so it you can't jump drive it you can't bring it over to an 84. thanks and i know a lot of people um are probably still using the 84 in their classrooms and i just want to mention that you know the you get a free trial version of the inspire if you're interested on our website uh with all the files that becky spent time creating you'll get all those tonight and although you know tracy mentioned earlier it's really great whenever students can actually have this file in their hands on a handheld playing noticing wondering if you don't have that opportunity i still think that students would benefit from this being in front of them large and in charge even if you just use the teacher software and you're demonstrating some of this but definitely when we were locked down last year my kids didn't have anything at home that's exactly how i taught i just presented it on my screen the kids didn't even have the files right well we're getting close to the end here so if you have any questions for becky or tracy please try to get those asked i know they'll do their best in the short amount of time we have to get those answered to receive a certificate of attendance go ahead and click the links in the chat window one is a link for the certificate for tonight and the other link for the documents if you're watching this on demand go ahead and copy your certificate link into your favorite browser to receive your certificate and if either either of these links are not working for any reason tonight just hang tight you will automatically get a follow up email with links to the certificate the recording and the documents within a few days good question what am i working on next i have not decided that yet anybody have any good ideas so you could actually if you're interested you can leave those ideas in the post webinar survey and i can get those over to becky and tracy and the ti team and maybe one of your ideas will come to fruition there we go so when you leave the webinar brief survey will automatically appear in your browser your feedback truly guides us as we plan future online events so we hope you share your thoughts in the post webinar survey so huge thanks to becky and tracy for everything you created and shared tonight it was definitely exciting to see the visuals that can be created in statistics so thanks so much for all of that tonight thanks for having us thanks for coming everyone yes it was awesome i agree thanks so much for joining us and we hope to see you back online next week have a great night good night night", "v0oQd1ajp-k": "[Music] [Music] do [Music]

to people in youtube land so last sunday i i talked a little bit about uh what did i talk about catholic and lunch some aspects of them that are very similar and uh i want to talk a little bit today about again sort of a history comparative lifestyle thing in the united states to my way of thinking now i people could disagree with me and i wouldn't argue with them about it but uh having worn the rope for a few decades my impression is that most of the buddhist centers in america that are run by americans are of japanese influence me what i mean by that is a japanese teacher came over here back in perhaps the 50s and uh were 60s and established these centers and then their descendants their religious descendants took over and now they're run by americans but the flavor is very much japanese now i'm excluding ethnic temples the chinese in california have built at the time they built it they said it was the largest chinese style temple in the western world and i don't know if that's changed but it's very impressive very beautiful very big very chinese and of course we have the jodha shin which is the pure land school out of japan that have built these gorgeous temples just like they you see in the pictures of japan and hawaii has quite a few of them because the japanese would go there to work in the fields harvesting cane and pineapple and then they would work there for a year to save up their money and go back to japan and do what people that have a lot of money do when they go back to their country and so they built these these incredible temples most of them are empty now some of them are actually starting to be torn down and apartment buildings put up on this very expensive land they built beautiful temples like that here i call those ethnic temples the japanese temples at least in the past maybe it's changing now but they really were not interested in teaching their buddhism to americans and this was reinforced by the fact that their services were never in english they were in japanese they brought priests over here from japan who would bring their families and i'll get into that in a second but they would teach in japanese and the first generation japanese not first generation the first immigrants in japan learned just a minimal amount of english like most immigrants do to get by in the in the economy and the culture and of course we have the vietnamese now which are a very large presence the largest contingency of vietnamese outside of vietnam are in orange county california and the second largest is in san jose california and the third largest is around paris and france and so we're not counting those temples but you should know that most of those temples up until recently everything was done in vietnamese they did not want to exclude americans it's just that's what the people spoke that came that established the temples and if you think about it temples are built by middle-aged and older people they're not built by kids because kids are going through college and getting out and establishing careers and starting families and maybe buying a house for the family live and they don't have a lot of money but by the time they hit middle age they're comfortable and they're able to support the monks and the temples and they build beautiful temples in the memory of the buddha and in buddhism it's very important to support the religion financially the monks because the monks typically have nothing they as i said last week talking about the franciscans and buddhist monks they take a vow of poverty so they don't it's kind of hard for them to do anything like you know buy anything buy a piece of land so they need to help with the laity and the famous monk technion han talks about that's a lady's purpose is to support the monks both to buy them food and to help them have things like temples and places to sleep places to worship so let's go back to japan i'm writing a book very sporadically and the last time i sat down to work on it i started talking about the japanese influence of buddhism in this country and it's something that's good for buddhists to be aware of because in japan there's not a lot of people going to the temples it's not like vietnam where people go to the temples all through the year they go through multiple holidays rites of passage are celebrated there famous monks well-known monks put on retreats that might be as long as a week long and hundreds of people go to these retreats in vietnam the temple and buddhism is tremendously important in vietnam i was explaining to some americans a few years ago that considered themselves buddhist and had never been in a temple they had gone to meditation centers where all they did was meditate the american there who was not a monk would give a talk on the practice of meditation and they would go home and they considered themselves buddhist i would not tell them they're not buddhists but most of them know very little about buddhism because these lay people who are not monks are not teaching buddhism they're teaching meditation this is an important distinction the buddhism that arrived here isn't really buddhism by my reckoning we have on the on one end of the pole we have the vipassana meditation we have multiple pasta meditation centers across america and all the teachers there are lay people none of them are ordained now they many of them have gone to southeast asia and stayed there for six months or a year sometimes as long as a year and a half at a meditation center most of them don't speak the language makes it kind of difficult to learn to find nuances of the religion they do some very intense meditation they feel very positive about it they come back here and they start teaching americans how to do meditation and meditation is a powerful thing meditation used properly can solve a lot of problems doctors in this country are in the habit now it's very common for them to recommend that people that have problems with depression anxiety um and a whole bunch of mental issues uh but basically depression and anxiety high blood pressure things like that uh recommend to their patients that they learn some meditation they don't tell them to learn buddhist meditation but they tell them that you should learn some meditation now you can go to a yoga studio and learn meditation you can start doing tai chi like i do or did until the pandemic with other people it's a form of meditation is also related to tai chi a form of meditation even martial arts if they're taught by a good teacher can become a form of meditation for you when i got back from asia i went to practice with a japanese man in orange county that taught aikido because i had learned that in asia and he started every session with 15 minutes of meditation it's the first thing you did you had to learn to settle and become centered before you began doing the martial arts so meditation can help your health mental and physical health but you're not practicing buddhism you're practicing meditation and you're practicing a healthy lifestyle i should say i would never and have never in all my life proselytized buddhism i have never told anybody that they would be more happy in their life if they learned the stories of the buddha learned his recommendations for life i've just never done it buddhism does not prosecute i have proselytized meditation i've taught meditations to protestants and catholics and jews and it never crossed my mind to try to teach them buddhism because all they wanted was some meditation the last person i worked with mongol understand this we have a bell in the back of our community room that we called the saga hall and it's a train bill and a good friend of mine his wife had cancer and he had this train bill over in the town of barstow and she was having she was dying and she knew she was dying there was no cure and she was having a very hard time dealing with it she was a wonderful lady a secretary in elementary school if you know anything about education she was the one in charge the principal would ask her what he could do because secretaries and school systems are the power and i went over at his request and taught her meditation spent some evenings with her and after she had passed on he showed up at the temple one day with a bell and gave it to me and i said oh thank you girl wonderful i'd offered to buy it he said no you can't buy it i was in his living room i'd gone there to teach meditation and i saw him a few years later and i said you know that bill is so wonderful that you gave us at the temple and i never quite understood you know i tried to buy it you didn't get me his home his wife wanted this to happen for teaching her meditation so meditation is tremendous it's like exercise everybody should exercise i'll proselytize exercise all day long if you can't go to the gym you can always walk okay you can get up and walk a little bit i'm on oxygen now some of you that watch these videos noticed that all of a sudden i had plastic tubes going to me and i decided the other day it's very difficult for me to walk particularly carrying this thing but inside i have a big concentrator i don't have to carry and i decided i would get into a regimen of at least for 15 or 20 minutes every day turning the oxygen up see my oxygen goes way low the minute i start doing anything i'll turn it up real high and walk for 15 minutes 15 20 minutes back and forth across the room because i need to do something i'm doing a little weight lifting i pick up a weight about this heavy and i do this it's three pounds i do this and i do this you know and because i'm becoming weak like a kitten and i decided i need i've got to be doing something here you know i've got to take care of mom mom gets all worried i tell him oh when i'm gone and he goes oh they'll talk that way so now i have to say well i'm gonna i told him to stay before we started talking i'll be here for at least into my 90s which i actually believe but it's easy when you're you've got limitations to start putting limitations on yourself and the next thing you know all the limitations you put on yourself come true because you created those limitations yourself the mind is terribly powerful so buddhism came over here primarily in the form of meditation and people started practicing meditation and most of the ceremonies there's a huge buddhist center there's actually two of them in los angeles that are japanese where they still do everything in japanese ridiculous this is 2021 and they're still chanting everything japanese is not a canonical language pali is a canonical language sanskrit is a canonical language a holy language and some people consider chinese because so much was done in chinese but japanese is not a canonical language there's no reason for people to be chanting in the language that they absolutely do not understand you know the catholics chanted in latin but people that are not catholic don't realize they had a missile they could follow the missile and they knew what they were doing right mom yes there were no secrets but you go into a japanese temple and they start chanting the japanese you there's nothing tells you what's going on so all of a sudden it becomes a big mystery and there's no reason for it to be a mystery this couple that came here taught me a lot of things real quick when i started describing temples in asia the wife it was a married couple the wife said but that sounds like like a community center i said well yeah you see i've been a buddhist all my life this is not a new thing for me this is it was never a fan and i said well yeah of course it's a community center it's a community center just like the catholic churches you know i went to catholic school one year so i had exposure to catholic church and nuns i had exposure to the ruler oh yes so but catholic churches traditionally are community centers and buddhist churches once they build churches once they built temples were always community centers classes took place there all kinds of classes you could have a cooking class you could have anything you wanted at the temple that belonged to the people the temple i stayed at in orange county the doors were never locked the kitchen was open i'd go out in the morning to do my walk back when i could do a lot of walking and there'd be people already they'd gone in and made tea for themselves and they were having teas and cookies and crackers and drinking tea it was six o'clock in the morning nobody thought they were saying you know there was no open clothes side now when it got dark you know i think you know i really don't know if that kitchen ever got locked to tell you the truth i think it was just open all the time so i want to talk in japan this thing of practice americans have gotten very confused about it they think if they give a title to a layman then the layman is on the same level as a monk and that's not true i talked about monks last week that they take about poverty obedience and they take more than three vowels but i use three poverty obedience and come on mom help me here oh uh chastity chastity but they also they they take other valves but those are the three they take a valve stability americans don't even understand the valve stability i probably really need to talk a lot about that sometime and stability means that you don't just wander off whenever you feel like wandering off so if you're if you belong to a religious order and you can't be a monk without belonging to a religious order and you can't have a religious order without having rules and they call it the rule and these valves are part of that rule that you'll do this and you won't do that so in japan they consider seven levels this is what my japanese teacher taught me seven levels of being a monk and the first level was to become a buddhist and they have a name for it they call it yukai you take the precepts take the three refuges go to the buddha the dharma and the sangha for refuge and you keep the five precepts of not taking life not lying lying or speaking against others not stealing not improper sexual conduct and not becoming intoxicated or even the buddhas they just don't drink anything at all and they take those five precepts those are the most important precepts and they're the difficult ones to keep the next five for a notice are pretty easy but that's where you get you can't have any money again cannot handle gold or silver those are the old rules they have changed with time it's very difficult to drive a car and not handle some form of money because you'd have to keep calling people to come put gas in your car hello i'm in orange county i've got two gallons left in the tank where you drive all the way down here which for us is about 100 miles and fill up my gas tank so i can drive back to the temple no so the monks will usually carry a gas card so that's a form of money credit cards are money checks are money it's just another form of it so we become lenient with that but in japan the first thing you do is you become a buddhist firm the second thing is you become an acolyte or an apostate and these are typically young men could be women but the most common are men in a village that helped the village priest and they're they're drawn to the church as a catholic would say they're drawn to the church and they like being there they like the smells they like the sound they like the rhythm and they can start to help this month and most temples in japan only have one monkey and that monk may be married or the monk may not be married and that's the topic of another topic how that aberration happened in japan but about 130 years ago there was a big change and i'll talk about that next week but right now you could have a married or an unmarried monk living at the temple alone and the youngster will come around usually you know maybe 10 at the youngest but more like 12 or 14 they would come around and show a great interest and the monk would start teaching them to do things he might in the beginning just teach him to ring the big bell every morning ring the big bell and let people know that the temple's there in medieval japan the big temple bell was used to tell time and somebody at the temple would go out and ring the bell throughout the day let people in the village know what time it was nobody had a watch as time went by he might be asked to maybe the monk has to do a ceremony and people go to zen temples and by the way zen is the second largest denomination in japan and we have monks the choro shinshu which is the pure land which came with the japanese workers he came to california to work in the central valley and the gold fuels and things like this they don't have monks they have ministers so we're talking about monks right now but there is they're the largest group in japan the pure land group and they have ministers and they can marry and they've always been able to marry since the 13th century because they are ministers and if you went to visit their temple they'd probably greet you in a suit have a tie and a suit on and during ceremonies they would put a monk's rope on remembering that monks wore robes and conduct their ceremony so can you tell that at one time at our temple years ago i taught a class on japanese buddhism yes but we don't do that anymore because nobody asked for it so we we have these young people that are there they're 12 14 years old in japan commonly you graduate from high school at 15. and you have a couple choices it's just like europe you have a couple of choices you could go on to university or you go to an apprenticeship uh an apprenticeship would be any of the manual trades even for an artist you you know and you don't usually think of an artist as a manual trade but artists work with their hands along with their mind and so these 15 year olds who graduate from high school when they're around 16 now they're going to go and they're either going to go to university that's the goal or they're going to go into the trades now if they decide to go to university just like in england that i know about they would go for a couple years of prep school which we would call high school and they would prepare to go off to university if they're helping out at the temple at some point the monk at the temple probably ask for it and he would shave their head they have done the most important ceremony in buddhism they've shaved their head they probably don't have a beard to shave but the shaving of the head and the beard isn't what we call leaving home you leave the comfort of your home you leave the comfort of your family and you go and live someplace else the misunderstanding that many people have is you don't divorce your family you can still see your family you can go visit your family the visit family might visit you with the temple my teacher my vietnamese teacher is a japanese teacher grew up in a temple his dad was a priest and his mom was long-suffering wife of a priest but my vietnamese teacher at 12 years of old 12 years of age went to live at a temple and he wasn't a novice until he was around 14 or 15 years old but his dad used to come by every day with a bag of candy but not every day i'm sorry overspeak every week he'd bring a little bag of candy for him and he'd stand outside the gate my master would see him and he would go and say hi to his dad his dad would encourage him how are you doing and give him the little bag of candy and later on after my teacher's family was completely grown up his dad became a monk after him not uncommon in buddhist countries so this this postulate or this acolyte whichever one you want to call usually acolytes are used for the very very young and postulates maybe the next title we want to give them and he would get his head shaped and he would be given a black rub to put on and he would wear it during ceremonies kind of like a choir at a christian church puts on these ropes you know special occasion ropes and then takes them off when they're done helping out with the ceremony it's entirely possible that around the age of 14 15 maybe 16 he would be given nova's ordination and you take five more precepts and those five precepts have to do with the notion of poverty that you can't keep money that you can't have fancy it said you can't sleep on high bed or high chair and that's fancy furniture that wealthy people would have fancy furniture that wealthy people would have um can't wear perfume and garlands which would attract the opposite sex but it also would make you look pretty so it's it's more than just attracting somebody it's about making yourself special we don't have to worry about cooling our hair i mean most people would cold their hair before they went out we don't have to worry about that and i always forget one it doesn't matter which set of rules i'm doing i always forget when i do it length so we have no fancy beds no keeping of money no garlands or perfume i only got three that's it what's that he said gossip the what he said gossip that's the name no that's in the first five but anyway so next time i'll review those since we've got a train going here and i'll have a list for you because i always forget okay we're almost out of time but the next the next thing over here is that that young person will typically go to a buddhist universities all the sects in japan have buddhist universities sex is another word for denomination and they all have their own universities and so komozawa university would be for the soto zen set and uh would be for the renzoi set and told it we'd go off and we get a bachelor's degree my japanese teacher was encouraged to do one more year and get a teaching credential because teaching is a good occupation for monks and if they need money to run their temple to support their family and so at that stage that's number three number four is once you come out of the university and you have a degree uh you go to headquarters now my experiences with soto zen renzi zen is a little bit different in the way they do things solo zen actually has a headquarters they have two main monasteries and people do their monastic training at the monasteries and the headquarters assigns people to go out to temples that are empty to take care of them and so when you're at the fourth level of a monk you would go and you would work at a temple with a senior monk senior priest usually by this time they start calling a priest maybe not and you would learn how to run a temple before that you were helping out now on an ideal situation and ideal situations are just that it means that they don't always happen one of the monks that is very famous in america is a was named shinru suzuki he uh basically started the san francisco zin center he had this problem he was poor so when he uh went out to the temple at the fourth level he had never gone to monastery he could not afford cost money in japan to go and train at a monastery with the exception of aj so he had not gone to a monastery but he was still considered a fourth level ordained buddhist monk slash priest and he worked there for quite a while and at some point he got enough money and he could go off and train at one of the two big monasteries and that brought him up the level of five roughly and five is what we think of if you walk into a catholic church and meet a priest if he's a four he's a deacon he's helping pastor the priest or pastor of the church if he's a five he is the pastor of the church so this is within buddhism there's all these parallels and so now he's a fighter and he doesn't necessarily go above that but if he's intelligent and he speaks well maybe a little charisma he will be asked when in his middle age age is important with these ranks too to start giving lectures and he might go and give a lecture on the lotus sutra or the bottom sakura sutra or the shiragama sutra at other temples and he will plan this lecture so that it's very good and entertaining and illuminating and he will go down the road and uh to another temple maybe on a train he'll go far away and he will do a lecture series commonly of about a week and everybody will come in the evening and here i did this in washington 20 years ago everybody came in the evening to hear me talk and then on the weekend they could come during the day and one of those might be on um sensual entertainment central entertainment is that the one you are missing yeah so he got a title which basically meant that he could lecture and teach typically those monks had students part of the monk's life training is to teach other people and so they might have two or three students living with them who would take care of the temple and i have a saying that i invented years ago when i had a bunch of students living at the temple with me and i would go off to teach while the master is away the monks will play i would leave them assignments to do when i came back you know they've been goofing off and then the final thing if you're at least 60 years old you have to be at least 60 years old and you have taught the ideas that you've taught monks and ordained monks then the headquarters might give you the title of roshi and roshi literally means old monk but could mean in the vietnamese tradition it would mean great master of high standard in the vietnamese tradition we only have two ordinations we have no we have postulants but usually take eight precepts and live at a temple and do not necessarily shave their head might wear amongst work clothes on sundays or saturdays or whenever they had a celebration they would wear a very simple layman's robe and they're deciding whether they like the idea of being a monk and then they take 10 precepts and that's their first ordination as a monk and then two to four years later they take full ordination they have to keep four 250 rules and they begin their training on how to run a temple and after five years they can go anywhere they want because they now they have to do five years of training and then after that we have to hope that they know what they're doing and that they can do the necessary ceremonies and teach the necessary lessons and if they're going to do what i call pioneering work go out start a temple they can pull that off or they can stay and support the temple they're at because their master is getting old and at some temples you'll see where the master gets really really old a few of the really good monks will stay around because they know somebody's got to fill in the gap and so next week i'll talk about what happened in japan [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you", "GtNwqhsEh4k": "[Music] ugh [Music] love can hold you down [Applause] [Music] huh [Applause] so what's up youtube welcome back to another full day of eating uh picking up where we left off we was four weeks out from the last show our show has now been moved for another three weeks so five weeks in total so we are back to carbon up and keeping food high so i've been two days on the on carb load so i'm just going to show you what my carb load is probably the last day before i check in with chris um before i do usual porridge as 120 grams usually i use my protein powder but i've actually got a package from insight they've got a new flavor so i'm just going to open this up i'm just going to show you guys so they've also given me a pretty little vegan prank that's good um if you have any supplements i always try and go to inside or various companies but uh uk uh quite closely sir this company so and i've talked to them on instagram they're very good company so if you got an order go get some but switching out today i'm just starting with the carrot cake my protein no carrot cake green uh just so i can put it in mine some flavor i've not tried it so it's gonna be a first thing for me i'm gonna use 60 grams of that so i'm just going to wave it now [Music] it smells exactly like carrot cake as well um so hopefully it should be really nice in porridge which is what i've been waiting for all week because on my depletion actually wasn't allowed my porridge in the morning it was steak and eggs so this is going to taste amazing so 60 60 grams of that i mixed up 120 grams of protein well 120 grams of oats and 60 grams of protein for my carb load i just mix it all in and get nice and thick so that's my porridge what i use is scottish porridge oats and because i'm carb loading you guys know gdas are needed for this just for the carb flow just how much carbs i've been putting back in uh so you want that digestion so two of them and at the moment i've been trying the amiga free visa from my pro but you can get them anywhere and i take three of these every morning and uh that's my breakfast but where i'm at we are still aiming for the show our show is now on the 17th of april but i'm gonna enjoy this just i'm having this right after the abs and posing session as you guys saw which i try and do every morning about an hour of abs and about you know 20 to 30 minutes of um posing so that's it uh that's meal one and i'll see you milton cool so [Applause] okay so meal two 130 grams of chicken about 100 plus of broccoli and a bit of cauliflower and 250 grams of rice um this is actually going to be my meal two and three i have this for my two and three so um i'm going to have this at it's now 10 o'clock so i did it i'll have that at 12. um just gonna eat this and start seeing my clients and then at some point i'm gonna go for a workout um this type of meals are the ones where i put my salts in so i tried to have my salts quite high around meal two and three right before i work out there's no oils or anything on it um i just had the pretty much the same stuff every every time throughout the whole month uh even from the last video you saw me it's pretty much the same meal um just different volumes of different grams so i'm gonna put some himalayan salt [Music] and just a little bit of pepper and because my show got pushed back by another three weeks i'm actually gonna incorporate this i wasn't going to because it was so close to show being two weeks out so i ordered myself some skinny syrups and sauces energy drink good uh this is the grenade energy natural caffeine low sugar energy drink i've actually got some sauces but i'll start with the chocolate this is going on my porridges and anything i want to uh satisfy my sweet uh cravings rhubarb and custard never tried this but it sounded quite fancy so i'm going to try this one out and then i've got some variety of different flavors p for my meals like this just to add a bit of flavor and try and keep the calories down so what i've got is ranch garlic and mayo burger relish another garlic and herb not tried these but i have had some products from skinny food code before and they work wonders especially when you're on prep as well as offer prep so i'm just going to add this on top just a few dashes of it nothing too crazy and i'm going to enjoy this and tend to my clients so see you next time so we are here at the check-in let's go see chris at check-in and then we're gonna go train uh paul with josh josh is here yeah we're here josh is obviously coming to physique to see chris brought my check in um and then after that i'm gonna have meal free which is again as you guys know some chicken and rice doesn't look as appealing as how i presented last time but just gotta get it in for a pre-workout josh that's yours sure yeah we're gonna get that in and uh i'll see you at the check-in i'm gonna try and record and see what chris is for the updates for the show because obviously things have now changed for the plan um he knows that we now got an extra three weeks to uh prep so obviously he's carving up for two days he wants to see where i'm at now i'm going to see what he says see what change we're going to do and see if we want to carry on the carbs build it back up he's cutting the cardio as well so the cardio is out and yeah just going to see what updates he gets today and we'll go from there so just walking through to town it's nice and sun's finally coming out he's good and the wind's calm down yeah but um before i ask josh how his diet's going because obviously he's got to be he's got a different coach to me obviously i'm coached by chris he's trained by jp yep which is famously known really really good one so he'll see dumb in terms for you uh how's it how's it looking you know what it's it so previously i've always prepped myself so what six years yeah and it's kind of obviously i've done it i've done things stupid things i've done learned so much from it but for someone else to like kind of take the reins and do it so i don't have to think and predict the next it's like a game of chess that's why i always kind of think about when you're prepping people or really kind of coaching them is you're trying to predict what their body's going to do yeah it's simple science but you know everyone's different so for him to just take that from me he's like it's been really really nice uh the least stressful prep ever although the show's and if he's been moved around and corona and everything else so you know what it's going really well and the amount of things and the style of my body changing and stuff from jp uh is amazing like going from what i'd say has been kind of like a kind of showy physique kind of um look and now it's more bodybuilding so a little bit thicker denser um see it's going good you know the food's going down i'm still on mammoth amounts of food for most people but uh considering like probably like yourself like six thousand calories down to you know two and a half it's been a struggle so oh sorry it's going away yeah that's what i'm trying to do probably because when we started the prep and to be fair what we thought would have been quite a short prep and it's now turned into an extra five weeks yeah um like you said going down from 6 000 now to like 2 000. so i think i calculated my day for today it's looking at about 2 400 2400 yeah yeah so it's still quite high for someone like people like averaging around average now yeah yeah so but i think it is it's the manipulation of food you know like you could be on 3 000 calories 4 000 calories but if you're you know high protein your body's metabolism is going faster you're trying to break the food down and it's the carbohydrates which you lack yeah well then suddenly you become a lot more hungry like your body's working overtime so yeah you might be on three thousand but a lot of that is not caused yeah you know so the body does struggle you are tired you are right and people can say you know it's easy for someone to say from an outsider's perspective oh yeah you've got loads of food though but that's fine but you try eating it and you'll get hungry as well yeah well you know as soon as we found out we found out that the show's been moved for another three weeks two days ago so chris is up putting me up on high carbs and obviously yours has stayed the same so yeah i'm still playing catch up like yeah we're coming well i mean we're coming in like there was a physical change to my what normally is every two weeks yeah you'd be like whoa okay i've changed a bit this was every like three days i was like [ __ ] it out yeah we're coming in fast yeah that's really nice biking and coming coming like two two days ago when i started spiking in my body started to change really really high when we started like adding things like cardio step master yeah yeah skipping all that stuff and then suddenly as i started seeing the change we had the result our mail is so good but carbs are back in getting fuller and i think obviously seeing chris now from what i see he wants to fill me up still maintain it and then do exactly what we were just doing two days ago but even better and longer so yeah we're coming in fast we're coming in ready yeah and it moves and i think the thing is you know we're you know for myself and i think the same for you we're going in for may yeah as well for the you know the ben weiner so we got a long prep but you need that little bump in terms of filling up the carbs the adrenaline on being on stage and things like that and now because that's pushed back we haven't got that and then you think [ __ ] okay this is tough now like we yeah we're pushing that little bit further again we're not ready like that's what i'm thinking i'm looking for mindset change yeah that's what i'm saying i was gutted but i was like hold on i can't keep that keep going that condition for another five weeks otherwise i'll lose what i should do in peak week in two weeks so yeah for me to take that step back and readjust and just keep it reassessed it's uh almost what's needed oh chicken in front of us honestly anything with food like mention food i mean josh just get automatic orgasm complete cream in my pants literally [Music] so obviously yeah so it's level 100 but yeah here back home stay back home i miss it so much obviously but at least we get to see chris every week p for checking reasons so we're gonna see him see what he says hopefully i'll get recording i've not had chris on the on the on the vlog let alone him have a camera in his face so we'll see we'll see if he likes it yeah yeah so i'm just like hi chris up in your face what's up so we'll see but um yeah we're here now for a check-in for those who don't know physique's gym probably the best gym in hertfordshire i would say uh but we're here and we're ready so sorry what's got taken out by a pigeon there is like being filmed guy in the red oh he would like he'd love to be filmed oh we didn't uh ask him any of yeah um yeah it was 68.5 so it's not actually going up as high as before i feel very frustrated i think it's going to stress do you decipher this when you see that very good so nothing really changed as of today he's going to look at me again on monday and probably do a diet from there but from today it's uh carbon up still like usual so which is good because i had all my meals prepped for what i wanted to do for this video so just gonna keep consistent you'll see all the meals for the carb up and then monday we change it so you'll probably see that on a different video to be fair my next video is going to be more closer to show day so you'll probably see lower food lower calories and a bit more change in the body really yeah a bit more skull looking which i mean so so now we're gonna go train paul i'm gonna eat this for my pre-workout and just have a good session we've now moved to having our sessions in the car park really for reasons because my neighbors are [ __ ] um but obviously because of kobe obviously because like you know me and josh have been training anyway but we just nothing's really stopping us we're using uh all our equipment bringing it to the to the car park and uh do you use what we've got really like to be fair but the car park train has been really good like this is where the police [ __ ] up the video [ __ ] inconsiderate i knew something i was gonna happen every time you try and talk something over does it we've been training in the car park and too bad intensity the intensity of the train has been the same but mentally yeah like we're not using obviously the sheer weight some bits are yeah we got today like we'll do deadlifts and stuff with the bar as usual it's just all outside we're just using what we got we have all the weights to to shift and we're pretty much hitting everything that we need to hear it's just uh you know not being in a gym as a mental state really so but we're getting it done we've done it for weeks now so nothing's changed mindset's still the same and uh yeah we're gonna get it roll the sick [Music] [Applause] edit [Music] [Music] ah [Music] if you guys haven't seen the last leg video we did make sure you do right here go click on it this one right here click on the hook yeah make sure you go check out the leg day session it's real and then obviously you've got a full day of eating today five weeks out from show day would have been two but we can't control kobe so here's what it is i'll keep working we'll get on that stage we'll get on the stage [Music] [Music] me [Music] the best thing i promise you if we ever go back into a lockdown or you want a gym at home the best thing is to invest into one of these little pulleys purely because since i invested into this i was able to get on track tricep push downs lat pull downs i promise you home training workouts if this is a game changer for you so if you haven't got this i know amazon being you go online find a pulley find a little rope put down you know personally i'll put the link in the description or right here where um where i got it from pretty sure i got it from amazon so yeah i'll let it pop up definitely the best 720s best thing you'll do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what's that did you get that flat pancake finger at the back yeah so another workout finished uh underground car park done we never pack all the stuff away always is good regardless of where we are uh i enjoyed it yeah take it off get it done five weeks to go get it get it in the gym get me the burgers give me the cookies yeah give me everything we possibly can i think the hardest bit of this is now putting weights back in the bloody cars so yeah that's where we're gonna injure ourselves yeah yeah again number one i'm gonna show you guys my next meal after this actually i have what i'm meant to have now is a post-workout shake so i am having a banana and some whey protein i'll show you that nothing special just my protein whey and banana but other than that we're done for today saturday gonna enjoy the rest of the day do absolutely nothing and uh get on eating get on straight to the plan and get ready for the weekend so thanks for watching i'll see you in the next meal so just got back from the workout with josh um now meal 4 is just 130 grams of chicken some iceberg lettuce and two tortilla wraps so that's what we got here lettuce and i've gotta cook the chicken it's just turns out to be one small chicken breast anyway uh keeping the proteins quite low and carbs high purely because we were carbon up gonna enjoy this this is quite a small meal but i like it because i go into the next meal my dinner is quite a big meal and then i've got one more before bed so i'm gonna cook this and enjoy this and i'll show you mill 5. where you are [Music] so okay so meal number five we have 150 grams of steak and about 300 grams of sweet potato and 100 plus vegetables so i'm just gonna cook the steak i go for fill it try and get the leanest type of steak for it so it's gonna go on just gonna let that cook i've got the sweet potatoes in the microwave in the oven and obviously this is my dinner uh so and then after this i've got a scoop of casing right before bed a nice juicy steak with some sweet potato carbs loads of it as well 300 grams of sweet potato is going to go down real nice um and that's really going to be the end of the day i'm going to eat this and then i've got a couple of packages upstairs i'm going to show you i've got a couple of ginger shark packages as well as a package for muscle mousse so i'll show you that but i'm gonna cook this and uh just get onto that [Music] we're number five's all cooked obviously here i'm gonna enjoy this uh and get ready for bed but i just wanna say obviously the last time you saw my video on the leg day session as well as the full day of eating obviously the show was meant to be around this time and then it got pushed back two weeks um and now two days ago as i probably would say throughout this video we now aim for five weeks but where my head's at the moment is that two days ago obviously i was peaking i was looking great still looking looking great but obviously carbs back in it just sends for me it was a bit of a stress level um and obviously i started worrying and speaking to chris just stressing about my physique and what's going on like is the delay gonna do damage to my physique but my mind's got put back in place and uh we're just pushing for it i think josh is in the same the same boat as well you can hear elvis pan his little legs around her but a little bastard but yeah josh is in the same boat i mean the good thing about being with josh and training is that we kind of have each other to bounce back i think if i didn't have josh and the people around me i don't think i'd be able to do this on my own so i'm just gonna get help you're making too much he's making too much noise might as well get a minute okay yeah i say hello yeah little bastard okay he's not been very well recently so he's literally the most neediest dog in the world but well yeah what i was saying is that if i didn't have josh and chris and everyone at physique's gym it'd be a very very hard place going from my last prep to um having everything for me like every day in the gym speaking to chris doing whatever i can do to everyday looking at me um it was perfect so now it's like when can i see chris what am i doing right like i'm trying to bounce back seven videos and just checking with him but everything's in place and i'm happy with where it's going so as it stands five weeks we will be stepping on stage 17th of april at the maidenhead show for the two bros and then hopefully if we qualify for that we actually do the the ryan terry the day after which will be great because if you win your class on the 17th you actually get to enter the show for free so that's what we're aiming for um carbs back in as of monday we've got a new structure and then we start going from there so i'm just going to enjoy this and then i'll see you on the next clip so i'm now in the dressing room after i've eaten my dinner uh i said i'm going to show you guys the packages i got obviously i got some packages in the morning that you saw and um a few bits have just arrived while i was out so let's give you a little insight [Music] good also some of you guys in the comments for saying how the dressing room is messy i mean what can i say i'm i'm a guy so it gets messy sometimes but i'll try my best next time um it doesn't look too bad today to be fair but standards if you guys don't know i love jim sharp you know i've got represent who doesn't like jim sharp so what i've got is just a plain gray t-shirt like gym trucks fits they fit quite nice this is obviously the oversized tee but can't go wrong with a standard t-shirt so that's that i've got i've been living in joggers at the moment so i had to get myself some joggers this is everything i wear is actually a small sometimes a medium but mainly everything is small so a small pair of joggers and it's just plain playing back joggers okay and the last thing i got is so it's the same thing what i've got on an oversized gray gym shark t-shirt i've got a really big thing with oversized t-shirts at the moment so they're nice and loose and i can train them but this is the gray one nice little graphing i think i've seen chris bumsey wear this a lot so i think because i watch his videos i really want this t-shirt and i actually feel like i've got this t-shirt from um ryan terry i've been watching ryan terry so shout out to ryan and shout out to chris mr olympia's you can't go wrong with him and then last one a package from muscle moose so they actually contacted me and wanted to send me a parcel which to be fair to them i want to say thank you to you guys i've already shouted them out on my instagram if you haven't seen them on instagram um i'm going to show you what they sent me and you know what for some for a company that wants to send you a package they went all out this is a big package pretty much all their products and um i can't thank you guys enough for it so thank you to the team at muscle moose and i'm about to show you what i got so what we've got is two flavor of crisps i've tried these these are really really good so you got the barbecue and the sweet chili flavors i personally like the the barbecue flavor but this really sweet chili is just as good energy shots you guys can see that obviously you've got the grape tastic and the rainbow can candy definitely try these four pre-workouts it'll be really good uh car air freshener some flapjack bars i literally love flapjack anything of oats oh honestly any anything of those it's amazing yeah flapjack bars two protein bars chocolate caramel and white chocolate see that and obviously they're cans so their cans what we got you got green apple flavor berry flavor blue raspberry and tropical flavor and all of these are zero calorie energy drinks they've got bcaas caffeine b vitamins so i can't wait to try these i'm normally a monster guy as you can see crater monster there but i'm excited to try these during my workout i'm going to get some footage with these in the future but yeah this is it so thank you muscle moves and i'll see you in the next clip okay guys so it's now 10 o'clock i'm gonna have my last meal which is casein just before bed um i think roughly doesn't really matter what time i have it after my meal five but i try to give about two to three hours digestive period um just so i can have it plus i like having it right literally before i let you get into bed so i just feel like i'm ready to just sleep and not worry about getting the meals in this it's all done so what i've got is just a little bowl of casein i haven't mixed it in yet i'm going to show you i don't know if you can see that anyway i'm just going to show you how i have my casein so obviously when you're dying for me i don't really like drinking liquids because it doesn't really fill me up um i drink a lot of water anyway so i prefer to have some some kind of mixture of some foods so what i'm gonna do is grab your casein add a little bit of water it doesn't really work well with whey so if you try and do this away it doesn't really do it so i add like a dash of water and i mix it in so if you if you feel like you want something sweet at the end of the night and something that you're actually eating something this for me it works wonders and i've actually got chocolate flavored my protein to see how it goes into like a little moose type thing and that way it goes fixed it's scoop feels like you're eating more and it's my last meal that's good i've got a really big sweet tooth so this really helps my cravings before i go to bed and it kind of stops me with the urge to um binge so that's it full day of eating i hope you enjoyed the video of

come maybe a long ways thank you for being with us tonight we're going to have one song and then we're going to have a prayer and we're going to dive in so um after this song if you have not partaken of the lord's supper this morning and do not do not have the opportunity if you exit these doors and go to the left hall over here that that there's only one room but that room over here that's where you can meet and uh to be served there so right after this song and right after this song we'll have a prayer in here all right 794 unto thee oh lord 794. unto thee [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] remember oh my [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you so much for being here tonight what a fun crowd we have and we have several of our evangelists that are here tonight if uh if you are an evangelist and visiting here if you and your wife would please stand up i'd like for you to right now well tommy chris glenda well thank you so much for being here tonight and of course uh ron and uh so we uh we're excited to share this launch session with you tonight and i just want to have a brief devotional uh with you tonight and then we'll uh jim lucas will close us with a word of prayer and then we'll start a hanger session that way anybody can speak and and we want everybody to speak up we've got a lot of things we want you to talk about and you're going to be telling us what you want this church to do and we'll be asking you about that it's very important that you give us a good list from that james chapter 4 verse 13 through 17 says come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a city and spend a year there and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what is on tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away for that you ought to say if the lord wills we will do this or that but as it is you glory in your boasting and you know all such glorying is evil therefore to him that knows the right thing to do and does it not to him and his sin someone once took a rope i don't know how many feet it had on it yards and yards of rope and he brought it from the back room and brought it out and it was all the way to the back i think i don't know how far it was maybe i know two 300 feet of rope and at the very end he had it painted red and he said now this rope your existence in eternity and on this and then and this little bitty red spot on this earth is your existence on this earth and he said this little bitty spot at the end of this red spot is when you retire and get to take it easy and the point was very clear compared to eternity we don't have long on this earth and we only have a short time to make a difference for the lord that's why he said don't you can plan to go do this and that but you need to consider the lord's will in everything you do everything that you do and if you say you're going to do this and that and you don't put the lord's will in it then you're boasting and you know all such boasting is evil so those who know the right thing to do and do it not to him it is sin you're here tonight to participate in the right thing to look forward from this day on to what this congregation is going to do for the lord and how we will be working together and i pray that you will strongly consider these things as we work together as we talk about the future and as we consider what god wants us to do here not so much as what we want to do but what god wants us and expects us to do here thank you for coming god bless you and brother jim if you would lead us in a opening and a closing prayer thank you very much would you pray with me our god and our father in heaven we come before you praising you knowing that you are our creator you are the one who that only provides us all things that we enjoy but you are the one who made us you're the one who gives us breath and we know oh god that you know us even better than we know ourselves and it's our desire to continue to look to you for guidance to look to your word to understand what it is that you would have us to do and that we may better understand how we can be pleasing to you and be the people that you have called us to be at this time we ask your blessings upon each person each member of this west freeway congregation that you would be with them and that you your wisdom and your guidance would be showered on them as as they seek to do your will in this place and to to determine a path that you would lead them on that will help them to shine brighter in this community we we thank you for the blessing that they have been over the years as a pillar in this area and we know that with your blessing and their efforts and their desire that that light can shine even brighter in the days to come dear god we know that as your people at different times throughout history we are under siege and from time to time we as your people we lose our way because we take our eyes off of you but at this time and and specifically dear god at the time that is set aside this evening as they as they look to the future again seeking to do your will we pray that the path that they choose will be the path that you will guide them on and again as they become renewed and revitalized in their commitment to this community and to you it's our prayer and their prayer that everything be done to your glory heavenly father we thank you for your son we thank you for his example of love for us and his example of obedience to you that has allowed us to have this relationship with you and with each other in this the body of christ and as we go forward we we thank you for all the blessings that you bestow on us and we pray that we will always be found to be good stewards of those things knowing that everything we have just simply own loan from you help us to be all that you would have us to be and again we ask this and all other blessings through your son and our savior's name jesus amen thank you brother jim and welcome to the hanger session hangar is an acronym hmm okay he's working on that hanger is an acronym for uh well the h stands for history there we go events in the past largest attendance etc so someone tell me how this congregation got started do we have a micro a roving microphone that's great who would like to tell us how this congregation got started there we go there we go there were six congregations uh sunset over on i-30 was uh being bought and that started five other congregations to get together and search for a way to consolidate expand and be all together in one spot and did so at a large building over here in white settlement and had quite a few elders quite a few deacons quite and got a lot of things going the buildings only one sold the others did not it hampered all efforts after that there were many many things that got done and we had a benevolence center that was quite quite quite useful in the area would that be an understatement i'm trying to think what else to add but that's pretty pretty quick and simple on part of it and uh at one point we had to make a choice and we came to this building what was the largest attendance you ever had over there thousand one thousand one so what's the largest attendance you've had here in this building carlton's just we filled the pews there was 500 plus i saw 500 plus yeah with carlton yeah yesterday okay keep the microphone because we'll need to spread it around here before it's over with thank you very much what do you think has been the most defining positive characteristic of this congregation over the years don't everybody volunteer all at once friendly you know what my answer is singing the singing i've enjoyed miss margaret i didn't catch mine is a one that they do not do and that is gossip i've been in this congregation 25 years and i just have to stumble on some information because it is not spread around for anyone's fun outstanding and that that's worth applauding for you can't say that about many congregations oh my so would you say you've had a colorful history how long ago was it when you merged and started over there 1986. you've had some uh you've had some great preachers through the years here and uh a good one just left before him was a longtime friend of mine terry casey and he's in florida and every once in a while he'll he'll call me up and says what's going on over there you know west freeway i heard such and such and i just said well just keep your nose out of it [Laughter] and uh terry and i go all the way back we went to preaching school together at preston road school of preaching okay so this congregation has had a rich and colorful history there's been a lot of events that have happened through the years mostly good few bad but most importantly as this congregation is still together and working together this congregation was responsible for supporting my wife and i when we started a congregation uh in needville texas a ch uh a town that had never had a church of christ they tried twice and it failed and so we uh started working with it the congregation that we had preached before was our overseeing congregation for the first few years and when they finished their commitment then west freeway took over as the overseeing supporting congregation until it got on his feet in about about six years all total and then we left about seven and a half years after it began my son jonathan was a part of that effort and uh in fact he attended the needville institute of biblical studies the satellite school of of sunset while he was there and got his degree at sunset and uh and so that was a great experience there uh during that time i think over 80 people came to christ during that time that god had done and brought to himself and the congregation is very stable now they've they've bought and paid they bought and paid off their building really dressed it up looked nice and they're just now getting back from the covet thing they were meeting outside in cars for a good while and now i think they're back into meeting uh full time thank you for starting that church in needville texas don't break your arm but pat yourself on the back and so god bless you for that the a stands for advantages so what advantages do you have is the building paid off that's a huge advantage because i remember before before you moved here that was a a an albatross nice building but y'all were very limited as to what you could do because of the tremendous huge building debt and that when that gets around the collar of people i know a big church in florida that hasn't supported a missionary in 15 or 20 years because they're strapped so with a financial debt and the congregation itself is about five or six hundred they still can't support anyone because they're having to pay such a huge amount on their building debt so having a building paid off is a great advantage is it as nice as the one that you move from in some ways but it's not as large but it's very adequate and meets your needs what about your financial situation are you in decent shape financially okay well good that's that's very good as well what about leadership you have five elders uh not many congregations have five elders in fact it took faith village a long time just to get back up to five elders and so and in many congregations that we work with don't have elders at all in fact at one time there were over 120 churches of christ in iowa today there's around 60. half of half of those do not have elders i'm sorry half of those do not have preachers and only half of them have elders and so it's a tremendous difficulty the farther north you have to find leadership uh what about evangelism opportunities are there evangelism opportunities in this neighborhood have you been able to take advantage of it in the last year not very because of the covid situation and i know that you're ready to throw it off so that you can go back and do what god wanted you to do what are some of the evangelistic events that you've had in the past have you had some very successful gospel meetings vacation bible school very successful also had a i remember your big benevolence building by itself helped thousands of people very good uh situation um other activities that you've done for evangelistic outreach can you think of any big one that just really stands out okay like a fall festival or something like that that's good all right any others it was very and and it has been around the country too someone else had a hand up wonderful so you've had some community outreach what about do they have a some kind of fair or special event in the town that you could go to and do something like this white settlement have is it known for a big shin dig every year a community parade have you ever had a float in the community parade you have i just thought i'd float the idea for you and it gets it goes downhill from here i'm sorry uh any other evangelistic opportunities that you might have friends day has that been well attended good a lot of people to follow up on family day also good well that's good so those are things you can build on anything else mission work okay and i know the ladies worked very very hard uh on putting books together for uh the mission um mission printing that's right what about current outreach what do we have going on right now mission printing supporting india supporting home mission good world bible school anything else ladies bible class supports chinese orphans that's good a that's a new one i haven't heard that yeah that's great advantages in the community to reach lost souls have you have you thought about what you could do as a congregation here to reach i mean what advantage does this building have in this congregation what what type of income people do you have going toward uh going down las vegas trails that north yes that north okay north into white settlement what advantages can we take of people there what kind of uh income lev average level there middle class and what about south of here much lower class and it is middle class and lower class that are much more receptive to the gospel so that's an advantage where you are and you're right in the middle aren't you have you ever had a door knocking campaign here in your history it's been a long time been a long time do you remember what happened when you had it okay is that a possibility again in the future okay how talented is is this membership pretty talented janelle is that right yes ma'am geneva i knew it was a g or something well if you've ever seen what what she's got back there and that that is a an amazing thing she has created curriculum and by the way uh sometime lisa you and megan if you get a chance if you could see what geneva has back there she has i mean it's just amazing and she has all kinds of things she can put on zip usb drives and can be downloaded and just gobs and gobs and gobs of material so that is a a wonderful thing and i hope that you all will meet each other and get together and be able to get together maybe early one night this week and go over some of those things or tonight after work or tonight after church what other talents do your members have well you've got plenty of people that can preach here you have outstanding song leaders you have great singing and uh i don't know many congregations that can sing mansion robe and crown but this one can man i'll tell you what they get it revved up and going and it is great it is great um do we have some outreach evangelists soul winners in the congregation how many of y'all feel like you could hold a bible study with somebody right now okay four five six seven okay probably some more that's good uh additional assistance already in place well a lot of this we're going to talk about and we're going to work on it and wednesday night we're going to have a takeoff session where you'll get to vote on the top four things that you want to do so let's begin what are the what are the needs of the congregation another clicker i need a quicker clicker huh where do you turn it on at what side of it oh okay you don't need a quicker clicker you need a better speaker okay all right needs what kind of needs does this congregation have looking for a preacher ways to attract young families ways to attract young families what else what would you like to do what's that evangelize evangelize okay advertise good idea what are some ways you can advertise radio what else internet facebook do y'all have a facebook page that you keep up okay good let's think outside the box you have a park here in white settlement is it a nice one two of them have you ever had anything event out at the park what did you do okay rented out a field family i know a congregation who just bought a tent that'll seat 400 people and they're going to go around the communities in their community and some others and they're going to have an old-fashioned tent meeting and they're going to knock doors and invite people put signs up all over the place and have a tent meeting get other congregations to come what does that sound like crazy scent sir original original yeah back to old school what was old can be new again nothing new under the sun who said that solomon he ought to know he tried it all um what about uh are there other ways that we can be involved in community outreach reach yes sir gospel singing at the park people love to listen to singing especially acapella singing because they've never they seldom ever hear it if they go to some church in the area they're not going to hear a cappella singing what are they going to hear basically and to hear a cappella singing is is something very unique and beautiful are there other community outreach things you would like to try anybody have any ideas you have a hospital in white settlement do you have schools at white settlement have you ever done anything with your schools what did you do backpack packs okay loaded backpacks when how long ago did you do that was it well received good something you might want to do again okay uh are there is there anything that any kind of repair or anything that needs to be done around the building any remodeling that you would like to do the kitchen okay so remodel the kitchen might be a good project to do right okay and then once you get it remodeled and you have a gigantic barbecue can't you there you go and invite people to come maybe have a friend's day after that in fact would you like to plant start planning for a friend's day now in the fall what about vacation bible school i know this covid thing is a real uh real tough thing have you all thought about that talked about it yes we have talked about it pbs because okay so moving on to fall okay so have a friend's day and then maybe have a fall festival too someone mentioned that and doing an outreach in the community what about you you mentioned outreach like advertising and stuff communication uh those are some things that uh you might could do what about signage well we've had consideration for some time of doing a marquee up front okay that's a rather expensive involvement okay are there other things that you could do to advertise on your and put it on your property let me throw out one what about a blessing box y'all know what i mean by a blessing box i don't know if any churches in white settlement have them but uh i know a few churches that have them and they put it right out in front and what people can see people can see it and it what it is it's a sign that says i care about you and the way a blessing box is put up is that it is um it's put up it's it's easy to get to it has uh doors that you open and people fill it full of uh canned goods mainly canned goods that you can with a flip top you can open up or like uh um smack raymond or something like that that's easy for people to use and to uh uh to get um i know this one church that has one and they put it up and they've gone it's just been a and a lot of the members go by each day to make sure it's full and they had a note there one day and it was from a lady that signed it she said thank you for having this blessing box here this is the first time i didn't have to beg borrow or steal food well that just breaks your heart doesn't it you may not can have that gigantic benevolence center that you had but what about a blessing box anybody that could build one and is that not a sign that we we we care about the community uh you could spend 30 or 40 000 on a lighted sign and that would be nice or you could spend about two or three hundred dollars on a sign and put out in front and said we love families is that true would that get any attention how do you know unless you try it you could put out signs like that from time to time is there any restrictions on it from the city see that's a good thing about living in a small town you're less restricted on what you can do uh-huh yes ma'am what's that billboards okay advertising on billboards a prayer box there you go having up having the prayer box and the blessing box side by side how about i've seen people with prayer boxes and they pray for people uh and uh that's a good idea ways to get prospects and ways to help other people so prayer box uh having information on opportunities for assistance and growth some congregations have papers that they can hand out when people ask you know who can pay my water bill or who can do this or who can do that maybe you can't pay everybody's water bill but you could put down places in the area that help with that all the different things i mean you know with children you have chips and you have other things for children and so on and and then maybe you can be a part of that and you can say we'll do such and such in the fall do you have your hand up okay use head and shoulders next time uh anyway uh mother this is my son jonathan and his wife amber and uh he's our little boy he pats me on the head and say it'll be all right little man [Laughter] any other needs that you feel like you have that you would like to have here what about having yes sir we need youth working on youth and people to work with youth and ways to attract youth and build up the youth program here right any suggestions on that well you have to you have to have families sometimes to bring in youth you don't always have to have it but you can build up youth from that way what about getting involved with uh i know one preacher that goes to a to a fellowship of christian athletes and uh and holds a devotional with them once a week you know they a lot of those kids go to a church but not all of them do what percentage do you think of the people in this community attend church on sunday morning well barna growth experts uh 30 years ago said 85 percent do not attend church anywhere on sunday morning on a regular basis 85 well it's probably down in probably only 10 now of the community attends worship services somewhere does that give you a mission field right here at home and of course you're planning to have the home mission school of evangelism here and that's coming up next year and of course uh providing opportunities and we'll be talking more about that chris will be uh you know telling you how what opportunities that you can be involved in we're going to need a lot of things for that housing is going to be one of them what about having a singing a fifth sunday singing here inviting all the congregations in the area i think we have that you had that has stopped a lot of good things and so it's like starting over again isn't it so everything's new again so whatever you did in the past it's in the past it hadn't been done in at least a year or year and a half and so now you can start all over again so every idea is new from here on out isn't it except maybe some of the things that you've been doing what are some of the goals that you have for this congregation the clicker works now what are some specific goals that you would like to see done would you like to improve the contribution would you like to see the contribution double is that a possibility one of the workshops that we have is how to double your contribution and or it's actually how to how to grow your called higher ground giving is what's called and it's how to double the contribution could you do anything more if you had your contribution doubled here in this community possible are some what about some goals for outreach in the community would you like to do you all have anything like well i've heard it called in other things like pie partners for schools what does pi stand for sudhi partners in education do y'all have something like that in the school systems here nothing we're presently involved in there's some of that going on okay so is that something you might want to check on and see see if there's is that one of your goals to get involved with the school systems here and you have two school systems here right what's that fort worth and white settlement fort worth and white settlement it's one on one side one on the other okay do they have good football teams depends on the year doesn't it what about bible class upgrades we talked about youth getting a youth program what else what about some more special events or any is there anything that you would like to do that's special one thing i was to proud well supply for his summer mission okay having jose supplied for his mission trip and we have something that he can take with him from home mission he translated foundations for disciples into spanish so we'll need to copy that off and put it together so that he can take several supplies with him plus he plans to go to two churches in new jersey and and take a plus i heard of another one too he might go to in arkansas and take these uh he can do the launch workshop and he can also take the uh foundations in spanish as well as i died last night in spanish uh we have that in spanish as well how can we improve attendance how many did we have this morning i counted once around 85 i believe 85. how many did you do you have an attendance before the 2 pandemic 2 30 2 50. what happened to everybody a bunch of them are staying home some moved some passed away and some went to churches that were open and so you have lost some families because of that you'll always lose families you'll always have families come and go you'll always have deaths you'll have always have people move so congregation cannot just stay the same can't it flabel yakeley a church growth expert passed away a few years ago from harding said a church only changes 10 a year either to the good or to the bad i don't think we changed to the good this last year i don't think any church changed to the good although there were some churches that took advantage of it i know one church in iowa that had 20 baptisms even with the covid problems a lot of them got coveted but you know something they uh only one person died from it and they they didn't meet all the time but they still did a lot of virtual bible studies what about working toward 100 involvement for all members do y'all want to get rid of the 80 20 syndrome here wouldn't that be great what is that going to take what would it take for this church to be known as the lovingest church in town what would that take well we talked about some of it this morning learning to connect with people and that family that was visiting today they're about the last family to get out the door except ours and brandon and and uh his name was victor so when i said we're going to have a hanger session hang victor he thought what did i do so they were very friendly and they're thinking about trying to move to the area and they have five kids two of them are in one of them's in junior high one of them's in high school or maybe two of them are in high school wow now how do we follow up with those people we're going to talk about that tuesday tuesday night uh i want you to remember what second opinions 6 and 1 says he that hath a good visitation ministry shall groweth the churches okay second opinion six and one actually that that is a true statement anything else any other goals that you would like to have dreams and goals what if someone were baptized here today is your baptistry ready we'd have a problem we need to get water in it okay is that a is that something we need to put up on one of our goals to do that'll be a fix soon that that's a that is a uh that's a test of faith you got to have water in the baptistry if you expect to have baptisms i know you can take them to another congregation but but that's some that's a must isn't it you gotta have bible classes if you want children to come so um there's all kinds of things that you can do anybody else have any other suggestions well that's enough to get started with and if you have more let me know before wednesday go home and think about what you want to do how many of you started filling out your 10 on your uh dream card anybody okay well go home and work on your 10 and so bring it back tomorrow with one name on your dream card and you'll get a prize okay by the way another thing that i thought was great is that uh someone brought cookies up here a couple of times who was that who leslie rutledge she here tonight oh she's she's on zoom hi leslie thank you for bringing cookies next time bring the low carb cookies sugar-free no that's all right i thought that was wonderful i was looking around today when we were talking to that family and i was thinking boy if we had a stash up here like we have at home now a stash is a gigantic bowl of candy and so when our grandkids come over they get a dr pepper and they hit the stash now i know the word stash means something else to other people but we ought to have what do you think about having a stash here and having somebody handing it out to the kids you know and and if if the parents aren't here and the kids came by themselves give them a triple helping so they can go home and bounce off the walls send a note next time you come or we're giving them more candy okay now what excuses can you give me that we can't grow we tried that and it didn't work that's the usual one what else what covid what's another excuse no time no time what's that too old that's right yeah let's throw them excuses out there i'm just not any good at that i'm just not any good at that tommy can i ask a big favor can you go into my room and look in my shelving and look for uh philippians 4 13. i've got a whole bunch of copies made thank you very much any other excuses we make yes sir not enough time not enough time that's right just too busy are there some other excuses well you can't say not enough talent this this congregation is loaded with talent haven't ever done that before that's a good excuse what's another one i can't talk in front of people okay what's that get behind them you can pray from the back okay there you go anything else what about uh can't sing can't teach can't talk can't talk get too nervous when i talk i don't have any friends to influence that's a that's a good excuse i don't know anybody in this community several of you drive from outside this community don't know anybody any other excuses okay so let's close with resolve choose a scripture that you want to use as a result for the remainder of this year now i've got one if tommy can find it that i'm going to hand out to all of you it's usually the most requested one but do you have a scripture that we could use we'll copy it off before tomorrow night as a resolve that all of us can live by for next year a scripture that we can print off that you can put on your refrigerator or in the bathroom or in the bedroom or wherever you spend the most time y'all want to hand that out guys you can start with this one if you have another scripture let me know anybody else have another one that you want to use yes sir acts 2 42-42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and in fellowship in the breaking of bread and in prayer and everyone shared what they had basically they met in each other's homes in the temple and from house to house and after doing that praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church how often daily daily those that should be saved the closer you get to acts 2 42-47 the more you're going to grow that's not from second opinions that works did anybody not get one put it up wherever you spend the most time so that you can see it every day i can do all things i can do some things right that way he said i can do a few things through christ that gives me things is that what he says i can do about half the things through christ that gives me strength no i can do all things through christ that gives me strength and all things is all things and is that for young and old rich and poor ugly and beautiful i was at the doctor's the other day and asked him i've got some varicose veins starting he says does it hurt and i said no he says does your wife think it's ugly and i said listen she has to wake up every morning and see this the veracruz veins are a breeze [Laughter] so anyway okay any more ideas before we leave isaiah 40 isaiah 40 and 8 which says the grass withers and the flowers faith but the word of our god stands forever beautiful i love isaiah 40. there's a bunch of goodies there okay the grass withers and the flower fades and the word of the lord lasts forever yes sir oh okay okay well say something any more ideas that you can think of that you've seen other people do or people try what about having more what about having small uh group sessions in the homes as we get back to that that's how this brother in iowa had 20 baptisms last year was on zoom just like that little kid said tsum tsum so there's a lot of new things open to us that we didn't think about before isn't there have y'all ever heard of 10g you've heard of 5g hadn't you have you heard of 10g 10g doesn't have to have anything to do with phones it has to do let me say well we're using the right word but the modem what gives you your internet those things their work companies are working on that now to do 30 times what your internet modem does in your house now 30 times and robotics are going right behind it where you tell alexa to mow your lawn today at 10 o'clock and it'll be mowed when you get back lisa said i can't wait if you can only find if you can only tell alexa to paint the walls you know i mean but uh uh there's all kinds of new ideas coming out that we need to keep our ear on the ground uh they're gonna start there they finally figured out a way to to efficiently and affordably do uh vertical farming it'll increase products so much that they will eliminate hunger maybe within 20 years around the world uh they can already get six times more grain out of a fee out of one acre than they used to be able to when my grandfather was or even when i my dad tried to raise wheat uh they have all their robotics they have things in medicine that can eliminate cancer how many of y'all ever heard of mrna well what do you think this covet vaccine is it's a result of mrna your dna is the structure inside your cell how much dna do you have in your cell billy do you know in your body did you know you have enough just in your body billy to go from the earth to the sun two times do you believe me no reason not to that's a lot of dna well your rna is the uh kind of the copy that's made off your dna and it goes to other cells and so they're messing with our rna to go to other cells to turn bad cells viruses into cells that attack viruses and that's something to turn the bad cells into good cells so there's all kinds of things and i say this because we live in a new world every day in the in the change right before the change of the 20th century 1900s one of the men in the patent office said there's not going to be hardly any new patents because everything that can be created by man has already gotten a patent on it think about that think about that now what can we do in the church and how can we use some of these tools and what other ideas that may be a lot simpler than 10-g that we can do to show compassion and love and mercy and share the gospel with other people for instance what is the largest what is the largest percentage-wise growing group in america today it's single mothers it's exploding because there's such a lack of responsibility ladies could you train to work together to to find and locate single mothers and bring them to the lord study with them and help them do you think they have problems they can't deal with they sure do have a lot of problems and a lot of them just barely get by and there's a group that we can really work with we can work with anybody but there's a group we really need to work with there's a lot of other statistics like that and so on that we can work with ideas we need to pray that the lord will open our hearts and our minds to more ideas but most importantly we need to pray for god's will to be done because we have a god that created the heavens and the earth he is not concerned about our limitations our lack of time our lack of money our health our this our that he wants to know what we're going to do in spite of what we have to deal with and that that is what god is looking for and that is how god's will is accomplished and so i'd like for all of you to stand if you so desire and we're going to sing bind us together if you want to join hands with a person next to you you can if you want to stay socially distant you can and then i want to ask uh brother bill clark to come up and close us in a word of prayer bind us together lord bind us together there is only one there is only one body that is [Music] together almighty god uh we pause at the end of this time and we just want to reflect on what a great and what a gracious and what a good god you are and to thank you for how good you have been to us not just on this day but all through our lives father we want to thank you for

save our family to save our friends and even father to save our enemies thank you for the gospel and help us to be comfortable with it help us to be committed just to share it with one more person confident in your promise that your word that your gospel will not come back void father we have many excuses i make them every one of us make them there's things we'll deal with tomorrow morning that tend to take our attention and our commitment off what we really desire deep in our hearts and service to you help us father to overcome those things to look for the opportunities and look for the people that you put in our lives that we can just be the example and father that very gently and very lovingly your spirit would so fill us that we would be bold bold and sharing the good news and sharing the very jesus that we love and honor and respect we are thankful father you promised us a inheritance that nothing can take away from us that you have reserved and locked up we're thankful

serve you but most of all help us father not to depend upon ourselves but to depend upon you help us father to continue to love you more and more each day and to love one another and to even father reach out and love our enemies we thank you so much for our jesus make him special to us each and every moment with each and every breath that we take and help us to be content father to be realize

name that we pray amen thank you so much for coming and tomorrow night we will talk we will introduce the foundation and talk about the benefits tuesday night tonight so looking forward to the rest of this week", "L9qyIQpXexs": "[Music] things you wanna [Music] my reputation [Music] is [Music] i'm not gonna my reputation so [Music] my [Music] oh [Music] um [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] so

you", "GmONnOGdOk4": "[Music] it turns out that being a magician is not that hard after all get ready because after watching this video you will learn to perform tricks with bills cards and handkerchiefs anyways enough talking let's get to the training and for starters you will need a watermelon rubber bands and a friend to help you out pull the rubber band around the middle of the watermelon ten bands twenty thirty of them one hundred two hundred three hundred how much will it be able to withstand it seems like it's about to burst boom no that's an explosion we did not expect such an effect it took us almost 800 rubber bands to beat the watermelon and a trick like this one is not only relevant on Halloween oh my god you pierced your neck with your finger and now it's sticking out of your mouth how did you manage to do that do you need help no everything is okay of course everything is fine and you are about to understand why take a little gelatin and flour add some water to the gelatin and mix gradually add flour to the mixture don't forget to thoroughly mix it make a mold from modeling clay and carefully seal all the gaps [Music] fill the mold with the gelatin flour mixture put it in the freezer for several hours when the finger freezes tear and remove the modeling clay decorate the finger with paint and makeup to give it a natural look make a nail from a piece of dense polyethylene or plastic paint it so now you can surprise everyone by taking out your artificial finger at the worst possible moments a self opening bottle who said that it didn't exist take a bottle and prepare your hands no openers only a few correct and needless to say magical movements and voila the cap gently flies off the neck how did this happen all you need is to open the bottle in advance but don't remove the cap you will also need a thin but strong thread which we pulled out of a nylon stocking tie the thread in a ring and put it on your fingers it's almost completely invisible perform movements with your hands to pry off the cap the main condition is to not show the trick from up close otherwise the magic can be exposed very fast and now what's this did money learn to fly one bill has learned for sure just look it's floating in the air not touching your hands at all real magic mat or the threat from the previous trick it is thin almost invisible but strong enough connect the ends of the segments put them on your fingers show off your magic but don't come close to the audience remember and now a very simple trick look your hand is missing its index finger wait a minute pass your hand over your other hand and the finger returns to its place how is this possible only thanks to your flexibility just bend your finger back and turn the hand so that the trick won't be visible and with a clap sharply return your finger to its place that's the whole secret I think we spent too much time sitting it's time for some yoga throw your legs behind your head a good stretch never hurt anyone although there aren't many benefits from this exercise since the legs on the shoulders belong to another person but the shocking effect it produces is excellent and to pull it off first lay down on your stomach and your friend should lie on top back to back feet to the head and then bend the legs over the shoulders you can do whatever you want with this new pair of legs then record everything and send the video to your friends oh yeah and get ready to share experiences on how to achieve the same stretch for the next trick you will need a hankerchief hang it on your hand perform several magical movements and get a glass from under the hankerchief the secret of the trick is in well-organized teamwork and a correctly set camera hide your friend in another room and wait for her to hand you a glass at the right moment if you wish you can create a whole video cycle and get a new item from under the hankerchief each [Music] be warned after this bit of magic the trick with pulling a rabbit out of a hat will not be so interesting anymore but it's worth it take a magic box conjure over it a little and open the door and there you have some untold treasures maybe there is even a rabbit in fact there may even be a kin it all depends on what you put in the box to repeat the trick cover the cardboard box from the inside with patterned paper take a mirror of the right size and fasten it diagonally cut the door in the wall behind the mirror and put all sorts of things into the resulting compartment take them out one by one with a very surprised look [Music] now let's learn how to do a cart wreck take a card and put it in a ziploc bag shake the bag hard and see how the card changes this suit how is this possible the secret of this trick is very simple you just need to glue a pair of cards of the same value but of different suits front to front before the show and try not to turn the bag upside down so the audience can see arm yourself with a ping-pong ball and continue to amaze there are miracles at work here the ball source and the air and now it disappears behind the cards and as you can see the magician's hands have absolutely nothing to do with that of course it's because all the main work is performed by an assistant with a hairdryer that holds the ball up with a jet of air the next trick is also to be performed in pairs wrap a string around your friends waist say the magic words and now the Rope is passing through her body leaving no traces you can try the trick out by crossing the ends of the string just grab the opposite ends and pull sharply the string is in your hands and the audience is shocked by what they see for the next trick you will need a bank note of any denomination take it and tear it into small pieces collect all the scraps into your fist and work your magic take a corner of the bill sticking out of the palm of your hand and begin to pull its hole did everyone see that and now we will tell you how to repeat it you need to fake bills twist one and a tube and fold it in half hide it behind the one that you will tear and hold it tightly when all the scraps are in your fist gently pull out the preserved bill practice and you will succeed to and now a little bit of rope hankerchief magic take an ordinary hankerchief and tie it in a knot on a pair of ropes fasten it tightly there's no trick here take the two edges of the ropes tie them in a knot tie up a couple more ends and sharply pull at the same moment the handkerchiefs magically slide off the rope the secret of the trick is that the strings need to be tied in the middle with a thin reel of thread at first hide the place of attachment with your hand and then tie a handkerchief over it tie the first pair of ropes pull the second and tear the secret thread the handkerchiefs are free and now a simple but effective trick turn a matchbox around in your hands and show the public that it's completely empty inside close it make a couple of special magical movements open the box and what do you see a pencil appeared from inside grab it and pull it out entirely where did the pencil come from in the box the secret of this trick is that the back of the wall of the box is missing and a pencil hidden in your sleeve can easily be pushed into the box with a deft hand movement at the right time no wonder they say that all its genius is simple [Music] did you like our tricks let us know which of them you have already managed to perform and what impressions this is made on the public do not forget to Like

performance i actually was uh introduced to leo through rick sessinghouse um for those of you who joined us last year for the youth summit we did a virtual series of six different segments um we're fortunate to have rick sessinghouse and colin morakawa do the first segment with us and afterwards i was i was kind of debriefing with rick and i was saying you know if we do this again i've got to get some specifics on on the physio world developing athletes and your name was the first and only name that came up and said you got to try to get that guy so uh really looking forward to you to being on with us today and shedding some light on the physical world and i'm going to give you the stage sir awesome well thanks josh uh it's a it's a pleasure to be here um i'm gonna get going but if anybody has questions uh during my talk please i have the chat up i have the q a up i would love to make it interactive i always love to see what questions come up during the presentation because um you know especially on zoom i'm talking into a black hole so appreciate if anybody has questions uh while i go so today i'm going to talk about why some golfers improve faster than others you know and i think as coaches we see this all the time why is it that some people just have it and why do some people just not get it right away or it takes longer for them to develop and there's obviously a lot of explanations but here's kind of one clue and i'm going to show you a video right away here and it's two different videos one person grew up playing only football and the other person grew up playing golf and table tennis and i'll let you kind of judge um who you think grew up playing football and who you think grew up playing golf and table tennis so we'll uh we'll start with the first one here and you just take a look at the body movement um the goal with this is it's this is kind of like a litmus test for sequencing and of the golf swing so it's a way for to kind of expose someone and how well their mechanics works and how well they sequence and the only instruction i i give people with this is make big waves with the rope and it's one of my favorite tests because you can easily quickly see how experienced they are with this so take a look at this and if you look at the body movement he's trying really hard to create those waves okay so kind of save that in your memory and then the next person here if you look at the body movement and the sequencing two very different looking movements okay one person grew up playing only football one person grew up playing golf and table tennis and so that's really what i'm going to talk about today is what is how how important is sports history and how does it play a part in in developing juniors and developing athletes in general and and um i'll quickly go over my background so um i'm director of performance and ceo at urban golf performance we have three locations here in southern california two in la one here in orange county um we're a team of 50 full-time we have golf coaching fitness training physical therapy club fitting club building and mental coaching under the same roof so we help guys like colin maracava the ucla men's golf team and complete beginners so the whole spectrum but from all different angles in the same facility i played 17 years of competitive golf both in college and professionally i'm originally from sweden came over here to play golf got a degree in exercise physiology so that's my background both doing training and coaching and i've been doing that my whole career so what i want to talk to you about today is remember the guy the first guy he grew up playing football i think you kind of saw the difference and so he grew up playing a sport and if you make the analogy like a language he grew up speaking one language and i argue that that language football is like a completely foreign language when it's supposed to be applied to golf in the sequencing and you saw that he had to try really hard to create those waves and so some sports transfer better to golf than others so there's these kind of golf like movement languages that that transfers really well and are kind of from the same family and then there's others that belong to different movement language families if that makes sense and so similar movement languages determines potential in golf and i'll talk more about that later but what other sports are in the same family as golf and why is it that some athletes some juniors just pick it up so quickly um some of it is you know dna and software meaning your brain and nervous system some of it is hardware the body and we're going to talk about that later but i really believe that there's more clues to this question the goss wing is a sequence and it doesn't require a lot of strength i believe that every client that walks through the door can is capable of hitting it around 260 yards that's kind of a controversial statement anybody walking in through the door so the whipping motion of the gossiping is an elastic speed movement that actually doesn't require a lot of strength but it requires years of training to refine that sequence and the proper sequence creates both speed and accuracy now we're going to get into the other language families that that are really similar to golf which is really beneficial to um someone that want to get into golf and get competitive so we have hockey and there's a couple key things about these other sports one there's an object you're holding an object and ideally you're hitting another object in this case a stick and a puck two a very unique hip movement you're rotating internally into the hip which you don't do in a lot of different sports and we'll get to that later baseball primarily pitching because the throwing motion is um sequencing very similar to the golf swing i know that i think a lot of people that know baseball think you know pitchers are better golfers because they have more time i'm from sweden so i don't know much about baseball but i think if hitters also worked more on on their game they'd probably be pretty good but they're kind of careful because they don't want to mess up their the baseball swing same thing in football really the only position that i think is helpful is is a quarterback the throwing motion here um and if you look at players that were quarterbacks they're gonna have an easier time getting into golf tennis this is where we're starting to get really close to the golf movement language tennis players have a really easy time picking up golf because it's so similar in a lot of ways so it's kind of like if you grew up speaking spanish learning portuguese is going to be a lot easier than learning chinese so if you imagine you know the football player in the beginning of the video he's going to have he grew up you know speaking english he's gonna have to learn you know spanish from scratch whereas uh or portuguese from scratch where someone that grew up playing uh speaking spanish can easily get you know um develop their language skills in in spanish and this is kind of the king of other sports that translates well to golf table tennis and the reason why i love table tennis so much i grew up playing table 10 as i'm biased and there's a lot of reasons why i think table tennis is a popular sport on tour for example there's a lot of similarities so the ball size the ball looks roughly the same you'll learn spin dynamics so you learn how to spin the ball you learn how to control the face so the the paddle um of a table tennis paddle is you know you're the way you control the face so the same and that transfers straight into the golf club hand-eye coordination holding an object hitting another object and then you get a lot of feel uh that transfers to the short game so that's why i think if you want someone to develop really quickly you would want them to be at least engaged in some way in sports that are in the same movement family so racket sports are great and so this is just a way to expedite golf development obviously we know that it's important that young kids are playing multiple sports um for injury prevention but also for for performance and um not e every sport is is made the same basically or is worth the same when it comes to the transfer so we go back after looking at all those other sports we go back and look at the similarities holding an object hitting another object you see internal rotation of the hip these are very unique traits there's you know you don't see anything similar in basketball for example you actually taught to not separate upper and lower body because it's dangerous and so they're sure playing baseball i'm not saying it's or basketball it's not detrimental but it's probably not going to help you uh play better golf whereas there are sports that i really think can help what are some sports outside of the golf movement language well pretty much most field sports right soccer basketball football except maybe quarterback gymnastics wrestling while ball swimming track and field running none of these sports are gonna have have a have an object that you're handling with your hands they don't have the unique hip movement they actually teach to not do it and so here you can start to see why you know if you have an athlete growing up just speaking one language it's going to be very difficult for them to just jump and get into a completely new language and develop fast in that it's just not the same and so how do we integrate and actually get on the same page when it comes to these movement languages because this is not something that we talk a lot about i think people know that tennis players improve fasting golf i think people kind of know but we don't talk about it in development much so this is where i think it's important to realize that it's all sports are great i'm not saying that you shouldn't be doing running because it's not going to help your game if you want to be a golfer but it's only adding it's kind of like movement literally so you're adding letters to that to your movement alphabet when you're doing all these different things right different sports for each rep you you learn the alphabet and then you start to kind of the more and more you get into it you start to learn learn words but it takes years and years and and then you can start to form sentences and then maybe eventually like we saw the sequence of tiger you can write poetry but that's gonna take time and a lot of work and but imagine if you grew up only playing football in your alignment and now you're you know you're 12 or 13 or 14 years old suddenly you have to learn a completely new language compared to if you played football and table tennis for years you you would have that in your software like your brain and your nervous system would know roughly how it's supposed to behave in that new movement so that's really uh you know the my main theme today i'm going to get into kind of the training the athletes but um that's why we care a lot about sports history and we we can actually calculate uh potential meaning if someone comes in and they say i didn't grow up playing sports the only thing i did was playing basketball okay would know that they're going to have a different opportunity than someone that grew up playing racquet sports that's just a fact there's not a lot of research on this but anecdotally this is very very safe to say that everybody has a different potential and a different opportunity depending on their sports history leo can i jump in and ask a quick question that would be great um just as we go and i'm just again i'm sort of linking this to you know our some of our earlier presenters uh even from different walks or the effect of social media and phones and inactivity obviously covets put a whole another layer on that yeah do you you know it's my opinion uh from from my lens that kids are less active less outdoor less physical less clea tree climbing less exploring less all those kinds of things because we just don't do it as much as maybe maybe we did we were kids do you see that as a i mean obviously as a concern and or you know just just just comment on that what's that going to breed moving forward yeah and i think i think we have to look ourselves in the mirror i don't like to blame it on the kids right like i think we do too much of that i think that generation that are frustrated with the millennials or the generation z or whatever that they're lazy and they they're on their phone all the time i think we have to look in the mirror and ask ourselves like what we what can we do better and in a lot of ways we kind of we created that right like that's a generation that someone raced so i think that i'm actually getting to that where how do you motivate someone that maybe doesn't really want to do it or doesn't understand why they have to do it and i think that's that's really important to cover as well um and that's goes back to having fun and and and playing games um and so it was does that kind of answer your question yeah no absolutely i mean i think that just sort of kind of you know it's ironic that it it does highlight and keeps coming back to the same things that if we can offer things that are fun and things in forms of games in ways to you know in your world that are educational and and physical building um why should we not accomplish all of those things because then we will have that interest 100 i mean i always say the best program for an athlete is the program that they will do it seems trivial but most people are trying to create the perfect program that may that the client might might not follow and so then it's a waste of time anyways so when we design programs design programs with the goal of making sure that they're going to actually do the program and that means they have it has to be fun it has to actually be interesting for them to do and and you'll see later in my presentation like i'll do it with people that you think wouldn't want to do that like call more comma number four in the world i haven't played games in our workouts like because i want him to have fun and i want him to do it and i want him to be excited about it so i think that it's our responsibility as coaches to to make sure that we do that well so any other questions before i move on here okay great so we have three goals at ugp when it comes to our fitness department number one goal is to ensure that physical disruptors does not slow down development meaning i don't want tight hips to slow down how quickly you can progress with with the golf coach i know there's a lot of golf coaches on here and i'm sure that most of coaches most coaches are are are slowed down by this right the hardware is just not performing the way they need to um so it's basically disrupting their how fast they can develop number two is obviously to make sure that they don't get injured and then our goal is also to enable golf development with less swing thoughts you know if you make the hip and the t-spine function better with mobility and stability you might not have to think about clearing the hips through the shot and so then if we can minimize swing thoughts we we feel like we've done a good job without even talking about the golf swing so because of the audience here in the scpga i want to talk about quickly about strength training for children i think this is a myth that is still kind of around we're very hesitant around weight training with the younger population and there's no real research to support this growth plates uh stunt stunted growth and things like that we have a lot of good research that actually shows the opposite is true is that we need to safely create strength early to to prevent injury so like you mentioning you know jumping down trees the research actually shows that things like that are kind of risky for kids right repeated plyometric resistance is kind of what could potentially stunt growth but it's very rare controlled resistant training is actually shown to be very beneficial to create stability because kids are usually mobile and not very stable so they need resistance training to get stable and strong and not necessarily jump down from the tree 30 times in a row without that stability being present so i just want to kind of talk about that first so when and when it's done right with a professional strength training for children is completely fine develop speed before accuracy i think this is pretty well documented now you know we want to get into speed really early because it sets the tone for the nervous system to fire in a different way if you start too late here there's a really slow kind of there's diminishing returns the harder you work it doesn't matter so you need to work on really high velocity training especially arms and arm and hand speed in other sports that transfers wealth like badminton tennis table tennis and and jumping and things like that work on speed before accuracy and then you can figure out accuracy later on what's very unique with golf is that you know we only you know the golf swing is between one and two seconds long so in 18 holes we're really only active in the swing for about 90 seconds and that's you know shooting him apart basically um and so it's this low intensity walking on the other side and then this elastic speed swinging on the other side so that makes up for a very unique sport specific training program um and so it's not necessarily just like oh let's create a strong athlete that can swing fast it's much more complicated than that and so it shouldn't maybe be three sets of ten that we grew up thinking about because that's not golf specific we would we never do that um there's a time and place for that as you grow and as you uh build foundational strength but um the god the the game of golf is played in a very different way than any other sport it's a five hour thing and you only swing uh you know 40 times or whatever and that activity only takes about two seconds a very strange sport and that last point is the best program is the program with the highest compliance so that being brings me to um if there's three things that i want every golfer to be able to do is to control these three things i call them the big three and it's very simple hip being mobile and stable t-spine which is your upper back being mobile and stable and the axe factor which is the relationship between the two and if we can cover those which very few people have just normally so those are the usually the big three that we start with and this goes for juniors as well they might have the mobility but they might not be able to stabilize the hip very well so those are the three rules that i mentioned and then the three biggest focuses that we have when we develop golfers in the gym so i wanted to show you a little bit some of the training that i've done with colin i started working with colin when he was at cal and going back to your question josh is you know kids are on their phone they're distracted they might not really enjoy training so you have to make it fun so even with someone like colin i want to make it fun because i want him to be inspired and motivated to train he's already super motivated and i still do this stuff with them so you can see i'm doing a lateral push off drill and i'm simply just dropping a tennis ball so that he can react to something we're working on focus attention and he's has a clear objective with the exercise and so that's that's how we create athletes in the gym it's not just about um doing the best program it's about doing the program that he will come in and do every single time i think i would need one of those really high bouncy elastic balls that got all the way up to the ceiling to do that one but i think i could probably handle that yeah yeah exactly well this is another movement that going back to the other sports like there's no other sports that really in the other movement language families that would need to be able to do this right this is kind of an advanced x-factor drill and we're working on the on the diagonal slings and the coordination this is probably one of the first times he does this exercise it just shows you how you know how skilled colin is he picks it up very quickly you know he's already a very good mover and so we're working on separate upper separating upper and lower body without um without moving together so like in in basketball you would never throw a basketball to the side and keep your hips facing forward that's never taught and so in golf we have to do that that's a part of the golf swing so we train that and then we also train attention and focus and you can you can see on on colin's face like um he's enjoying this he he he's competitive he gets pissed he gets really pissed when he when he fails um i've never worked with a competitor like like colin like it's unbelievable his focus and his attention and how present he is is something i've never seen with anybody else and i've worked with multiple tour players and so there's a lot to learn from colin just seeing him in the gym we work on um other movements going back to these other sports this is just a silly warm-up drill but i want him to get because he's now he's only playing golf right like he's not playing other sports and so now i want him to get dynamic as an athlete and you can see he's laughing he's having fun because this is fun like he's competitive he's a and i i give him a gamify it so there's a there's a point system but what i'm doing here is really reverse engineering those other things right that we talked about earlier i want him to become a really you know proficient mover and so i'm kind of throwing in different languages here and there so that he becomes more dynamic as an athlete in general and so when he's put in pressured situations his body is very intelligent but if i was doing 300 pound deadlifts like a footballer would do that you know that to me at least is not something that would help him on the golf course and obviously we build strength as well just not the way a football player would be be trained so this is a simple so you can see here i don't have to stand there and do the manual resistance with the med ball but i'd do it because i know it's more fun and it's pretty like it's it gives a completely different focus and engages him in a completely different way and so i'm just telling him to push as hard as he can try and push the ball through me and so that creates a completely different engagement in his muscles and and i make sure that it's fun and so he leaves that day feeling good about his training we we got what we needed in terms of working on his weaknesses getting stronger but we also had fun so was it the best ultimate program for colin markava maybe not and i'm actually happy about that and so i think that's so important for juniors to and when when coaching juniors is don't get obsessed with the perfect program do the program that they will do and they will develop and then going back to the to the movement languages you know i think it's just an an interesting topic that i think we can talk more about and you know i think it's important to get people golfers into racket sports and this is just a personal opinion and this could be just adding like i did with colin just a silly drill here and there because just that small little piece gives someone a lot of complexity around the mechanics of a movement in the same family so do we want someone that grew up you know speaking spanish learn portuguese or do we want early you know specialize early and then only know one language and you get very one-dimensional we see that a lot actually we see a lot of people that specialize early and i know that there's exceptions but they become very one-dimensional and injury rates are higher and there's a lot of there's a lot of factors that goes into that but but those are kind of my two messages here is make sure you're having fun when you're developing athletes and make sure that you take sports in history into account because it really matters because their software is what's going to determine their potential and so you want to install some programs um and some software early on that can be applied in the sport that you want to perform it yeah now that's brilliant leo and and i just um you know it's got you know it's got me thinking obviously and it's it's unfortunate that we we had to do this presentation in the zoom format i i know it it sucks it sucks for people watching who've been who've been sticking with us it sucks for the presenter um you know in an ideal world and you know to have to have done this in in person where we could have set up an obstacle course or something on the side of a of a putting green area and shown how to integrate what you're talking about into a 15 to 20 minute station if you were leading kids in your program and really getting instructors to start to think outside of the typical how i run a group class box it's so easy to have a fun physical fitness training type of a thing that might look like it has nothing to do with golf in fact there might not be a golf club a golf ball anything to do with it but if we're creating something that that's a break it's getting kids moving more than a typical golf lesson would um and we know that the behind the scenes things are that that program is really helping them move better obviously it's getting them to have more fun be more engaged do something a little different um the example of what you're talking about and how we integrate it into our programs as professionals is i think is is something that we all should be taken very seriously and and i've been looking very closely at myself and what i offer and trying to do better with it and and it has a lot more of this kind of thing in it so that it's not so cold you know it's not elite advanced but it's it's super fun and engaging and getting people to move yeah exactly any any other questions from the attendees the other thing i would say there is what are kids addicted to well they're addicted to their to mobile games right and so what can we learn from that well you can regardless if you're a coach or trainer you can make it you can design it like a mobile game right you can design it like candy crush and give them points gamify the whole experience there's nothing stopping us from doing that and i i promise you they will engage with that because their phone is just a you know stimulant that they have gotten addicted to i mean i think we're most people in the modern world are because it's designed to to make you addicted it's designed to make you spend more time on the screen that's how the apps are incentivized so there's all these colors and uh there's hundreds of engineers just working on how do we get someone to spend more minutes on the screen so we can use similar techniques and i think that kids are always going to actually um appreciate the in-person stuff more than you think if we actually look ourselves in the mirror and and figure out how can we do better how can we make it more engaging and fun so that we can compete with with the phone i guess leo that is a fantastic final message uh 100 on point and i hope that the people who are recording this grab that one and throw that out there somewhere because that is as on the market as we've had uh thank you so much for your time really appreciate it um and uh i hope to i'm gonna come visit you here soon yeah so anybody's welcome to come by for a tour um you know like i said we have two locations up in l.a and one in orange county we've open arms if you have any questions about how we do things please let me know i'll i'll tell you anything you want to hear and uh because we have no secrets we're just we really care about what we're doing and uh and anybody's welcome so uh please don't hesitate to reach out and

ministry the executive director there i've known dean for many years he'll come up and i'm sure give us some interesting things to consider in this life so dino cody hello everybody good to be here again origins um i was thinking about what to talk about mark called me a few weeks ago on he said can you can you teach i said yeah i'd love to you know i was thinking on what to preach preach and teach on and and i'm thinking back on the last year we've all had a pretty difficult year you think we go back from march of last year to march right now last year i was in uganda we have a bunch of schools there that we've started and uh what i learned when we were leaving is we we got the last plane out i would we would have been there six months and so when we were taken off the steward it says well you must be the lucky ones i said what does that mean she says that's the airport's closed behind us so the good lord knew that there it was going to be a rough year and it's been a rough year um in uganda um they forced all the schools to be closed and in uganda they when when you're forced to close the schools they just terminated the teachers so there's no teachers so there's millions of people that have been put into abject poverty in the last year around the world you know how many million in america eight million eight million people have been forced into poverty because of the lockdowns so we're really struggling the whole world is struggling right now and so what we're going to talk about today is suffering suffering you know the bible has a lot to say about suffering lots to say about suffering and so it's a topic that uh yeah who wants to talk about that well we're going to talk about today because god uses suffering in amazing ways so if you have your bibles let's go to isaiah 53. do you know what jewish synagogues all over the world they will not read this passage do you know why because if you read the passage you can very quickly figure out who it is who is it who's it about it's about jesus and the jewish people even when yeshua was here his his birth name they rejected him didn't they they didn't want to believe it was him but if you look at isaiah 53 and we start to read here you can you can see very quickly that this is the promised messiah so god doesn't want us to believe in a vacuum he wants us to have the word of god to understand who he is and he's revealing himself all throughout time through all these men and some of the the ladies of our faith all of this is written down so that we don't have to believe who yeshua is or who jesus is in a vacuum he wants us to understand who he is uh using logic and reason and faith so let's go to isaiah 53 who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord revealed he grew up before him like a tender shoot like a root out of dry ground he had no beauty and majesty for us to attract to attract us to him nothing in his appearance that we should desire him he was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering that's that's an amazing verse so this this jesus whom god promised satan in genesis 3 you can read this when satan tempted eve and god rebuked satan do you know what he said to satan out of this woman eve out of her offspring will come my seed my seed will crush your head i promise check it out quite amazing he promised that when the seed of god was put into miriam mary right who proclaimed that who's the one that says you are with child who was that it was an angel from god saying you are with child and that same angel actually told joseph not to divorce her because she had god's seed within her within the first year of that baby being born he got hunted didn't he why did jesus get hunted because he was a threat to the kingdom of herod he was a threat to the entire kingdom of darkness you are correct and there was a king who hated this new king that was going to arise and take power see so there's all this political stuff even going on in jesus day you think nothing new under the sun is there political wranglings and threats and evil and death and a bunch of babies got killed didn't they very very sad kind of kind of like what's happening in our nation today yes legally permissible to kill the babies being knit by god in their mother's womb okayed by rulers in our nation you think god's happy with that say no he's broken-hearted over that and so a part of our sufferings we're going to talk about today some of our sufferings are brought about by our own choices at times god will not be mocked a nation can't keep doing what it's doing without god's justice being brought and so we're going to talk a little bit about that today so we see this man despised rejected by men a man of sorrows familiar with suffering like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he took upon our affirmatives and he carried our sorrows yet we considered him stricken by god smitten and afflicted he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities amazing who got pierced on gargatha who was it what was his name it was jesus did he go there willingly yes he did because when he said i am to the roman guards and to the chief priests that came to get him what happened when they said are you jesus and he said i am what happened to him they fell backwards passed out he could have run you think you think he could have escaped easy he could have walked away he stood and waited for them to get back up to take him away he chose to do that he willingly went for what purpose why did he allow that what god talked about in genesis 3 to satan out of this woman will come my seed that will crush your head only the blood of the lamb of god could take away the sin of the world only his blood which is kind of interesting when you think about the blood of that man do you know that only jesus blood only his blood could have ever been shed for human sin are you aware of that do you know why it was completely pure and here's why when the seed of god goes into a woman that one seed and that one woman created a child who had a new bloodline there was no other child in the history of the planet with a new bloodline except jesus and if you look at this biologically you can you can research this a woman's blood a mother's blood never mixes with the child's blood it does not mix you can have an a positive mother and a b negative baby interesting only one baby ever in the history of the planet could have paid the price for human sin being fully god and fully human amazing and predicted in isaiah 53 that this was going to happen he was going to come and he was going to be afflicted and a man of sorrows acquainted with grief he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed verse 6 we all like sheep have gone astray each one of us has turned to his own way and the lord has laid upon him the iniquity of us all who in this room is a rebel better raise your hands we're all rebels weren't we because why why were we all born rebels were born and sent with sin natures right you ever you ever see a two-year-old in a grocery store wanting candy that's a rubble they stomp their feet they yell they throw they throw tantrums they're gonna get what they want right that's a that's amazing and so we have this sin nature because of the fall of adam and eve jesus he was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth he was led like a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before his shears he stood silent he did not open his mouth and that can be found if you read the new testaments if you read about what happened with jesus at his own crucifixion he just stood there silent he didn't really respond and read some more on suffering here let's go to let's scroll ahead now to the new testament let's go to hebrews 5. i'm trying to lay the groundwork here if jesus suffered the son of god suffered and was afflicted and now he is the good shepherd right who are the sheep uh-huh where the good shepherd goes so shall the sheep get ahold of that the good shepherd has shown us how to do this well and he's calling the sheep to come follow him yes all right so now we read about isaiah 53 what it was going to be like now let's see what it was like let's see if it was true so we're going out of the new testament let's go to hebrews 5 every high priest is selected from among men to be appointed to represent them in matters related to god this is 5 1 to offer gifts and sacrifices for sin he is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and who are going astray since he himself is subject to weakness this is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sin as well as for the sins of the people that's that's what would happen in the holy of holies so the high priest would go in but before he did that he'd offer sacrifices for his own sin did you know in the holy of holies they'd tie a rope to that guy you know why to pull them out and it tastes like it gets struck bad that's correct you got a rope tied to your foot in case you went in there with a wrong motive with wrong ideas and we can see from other scriptures where men were struck down when they did things the wrong way when you're dealing with the ark remember the one fellow that just reached out to touch it because it was falling what happened to him boom he's done don't touch that this is serious so that's how serious this was you got a rope tied to your foot when you're going into the holy of holies it's that holy so this man would have to do all kinds of ceremonies before he ever went in there on behalf of the people he was going to offer that sacrifice no one takes this honor upon himself but he must be called by god just as aaron was and so christ also did not take this upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest but god said to him you are my son today i've become your father and he says in another place you are a priest forever in the order of melchizedek now this is very important i want you to hear this hear these words during the days of jesus life on earth he would offer up prayers and petitions with vehement cries and tears to the one who could save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission although he was the son he learned obedience from what he suffered once made perfect what that means is matured he is perfect he's being matured he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him and was designated by god to be a high priest in the order of melchizedek that's amazing jesus christ crying out with what prayers and petitions with what vehement cries and tears how often did he do that according to the text during the days of jesus life on earth what do you think that means it sounds like every day to me here's a man intimate with his heavenly father and he's weeping what's he weeping for you and i he sees what's going on it's more than he can bear as a human but he's fully god are we willing are we willing to enter into the sufferings of others like this when one part suffers we [Music] all suffer so god is calling us to be high priest today right jesus our high priest is now in heaven yes he's sitting at the right hand of the father what's he doing he's interceding for who for y'all so that you can do what he did while he was here yes i'm going to give you my holy spirit he's coming down to heaven wait till power comes from on high wait you'll get the power and then you'll be doing what i was doing you'll be doing it i'll give it to you to do and when you enter into that ministry his ministry what are you giving what are you going to be confronted with suffering suffering of what the entire human race do you know there's people suffering all around you right now at work at school in your businesses there are people suffering all around you quietly they're not saying a word so when you ask him hey how are you look him squirt in the eyes and say really and when they say i'm fine then you ask him again how are you really you okay are you in any amount of suffering can i pray for you in any way can i enter into some of your pain because that's the ways of jesus right these are the ways of jesus that's set free we have thousands of people calling from all over the world and we in a whole team of volunteers 50 volunteers and a staff of 12 we are entering into the sufferings daily with people there's a girl called the other day and her father was her father called and he's pleading he says can i get help from my daughter i said tell me what's up she's cutting herself with razors sent me pictures she's 17. i says let's get her let's get her stabilized first let's get her into pine rest or forest view calls me back an hour later they're full i said what they're not taking any new patients our mental wards are full right now jam-packed with people filled with fear anxiety pain 25 percent of teens last year thought of suicide one in four that's how bad it's getting right now because of the fear that's coming over us as a nation the fear of things unknown the fear of death and so as children of the light right as children of truth as children of eternal life can we respond differently to times as such yes we can how can we do this if we believe in the resurrection in the life do we have to fear death yes or no no we do not we do not have to fear death i got tested in this a couple years ago as i was hanging by a thread to life i'd gone to uganda i got sick i got malaria and i got the only type of malaria that kills you in three days i got that one guess what day i learned that on day three not good i could feel my gizzard i don't know where it is but i can feel it the report said chronic kidney failure look that up sometimes see how many survive you don't survive that that's that's how that's the type of shape i was in i was hanging by a thread and you know what happens when you're hanging by a thread and stirring death in the face you know what happens you get real serious with your savior yes you get real serious with your maker because it you might be facing him within minutes or hours and it's it's a very precious time i'm close to the brokenhearted i save those crushed in spirit i draw near them he does and me and the heavenly father had a real nice chat and apparently i'm a blockhead because i got delivered from malaria in spectrum and i went home and i thought you know what i almost died i'm gonna i'm gonna go to camp i'm gonna go my camp in the u.p take my grandkids and i'm just gonna have a vacation i went up there guess who got sick again me they hadn't got all the parasites and now i'm in a u.p hospital that they don't even know what malaria sounds like you think they've ever treated anyone with malaria and marquette hospital nope now you know what it is the first doctor i met prescribed me amoxicillin i'm like what are you giving me he said this should do it it's not to do it because i had already studied on what i had i said that is not going to help me and the doctor the following morning said he started cussing he goes what in the blankety blank i mocks the cell and he goes yeah what the it doesn't work does he says no and he prescribed me meds that saved my life again in the middle of that dying process again i'm dying 104 fever 104 and a half i'm on ice the lord's speaking to me he gives me psalm 40 verse 1 and 2. i will lift you out of the pit i will set your feet upon a rock i said that lord that's a good word that's a good word i'm going to live and i had hope that i was not going to die i was going to live and then the holy spirit says uh by the way p-i-t understand it lift you out of the pit pit understand it i'm like lord what does that mean prevention identification and treatment of malaria you don't have that in uganda for the five thousand teachers or five thousand teachers and students underneath the set free canopy so when children are dying this is how it feels like this is how they die and now you know i learned through suffering firsthand what it feels like guess what we had the next week we had pit programs in every school thank you jesus that you saved my life to teach me a lesson that i needed to know about the sufferings of people that i had removed myself from i was too far away from it so the lord allowed me to go through the process of almost dying from malaria to know what it feels like do you think maybe i have compassion for children right now who are dying from malaria i do why because i went through the process of dying with malaria god used that process of suffering for me to be awakened to the plight of what's happening on the planet do you know what the number two killer in the world is today malaria it kills most people in the world and it's completely 100 percent treatable and preventable and we're going to do something about that so god allows suffering as training oftentimes there's other things he does through suffering and i want to just share a few of those things god's allows suffering to perfect and mature our faith that's what we just read about in hebrews 5. it matures us but it also makes us very compassionate for those who are going through it yes who's our high priest in heaven it's jesus right can he relate to what you and i are going through can he he can i love that i love the fact that he was here crying with loud cry vehement cries and tears daily i love that fact because when i'm brought to that place i know he knows and i can it's total relatability with my high priest and our high priest your high priest he completely understands your suffering because he's been there done that that is a beautiful thing to know that your high priest is jesus not only that are you not high priest yes we are yes we are so now that we're high priest what does god expect of us to be involved with other people's suffering the same thing that's here now for us now right now jesus said i'm leaving i'm going back to heaven i'm handing you the keys to the kingdom right what's what's the lord's prayer your kingdom come your will be done what on earth who's going to do that only the church can do that nobody else only us only the high priest only those who are called by god to do that will we be doing what jesus did yes or no yes we will we will be doing exactly what he was doing and what's it going to cost us it will cost us suffering it might cost you everything it may cost your life because depending on where you're a christian right now your head's coming off if you preach his name yes 100 000 last year martyrs 100 000. are we willing are you willing to lose relationships for the sake of jesus in his name because when you stand for truth do you get hated oh yeah yes you will especially in this day and age you start standing for truth and righteousness how much are you going to get attacked a lot you will you will be hated for his namesake they will hate you like they hated me they will hate you without reason like they hated me that's matthew 5. so there's going to be a cost to this it's okay and now we're entering into the sufferings number two god allows suffering to not only test our faith but to encourage others when you look at job when you get when you get in dire straits and you wonder what's going on in life and it's it's almost too much that you can bear read job it will help you it'll help you cling to faith even though you don't understand all of the suffering and when you're suffering things aren't real clear at the time is it i didn't know until i got sick twice near death twice within a four week span the purpose of some of the sufferings i was going through with malaria i fully understood it probably on the last day of my life when the holy spirit actually talked to me very clearly using that scripture that came right out of the bible and i i had to look it up to see if it was even a real verse and it was i'm like this is amazing and because of it it's probably going to save hundreds if not thousands of lives because here's the deal when in our schools we have now nurses in our schools with malaria meds and it's for the whole community it's not just for the children there and at our schools sometimes we have three to five hundred kids but it's impacting thousands of people from the community how cool is that i wouldn't have known i i that was not on my radar so the lord will allow your suffering to be used for his greater glory it will also encourage others of how you suffered and stood for faith what was the last thing that uh job his kind of is when he's he's got the boils his kids are all gone his stuff's all stolen and his wife said what to him curse god and die what was his response though he slay me yet will i trust him you don't know what you're talking about woman i'm standing firm and i love my father i love him and i trust him though he slay me i will still trust him and he did so when things get really really rough you pick up that book of job and say thank you lord for a man that stood the ultimate test even though he didn't understand it do you know whose idea that was when you look at the book of job do you know who whose idea it was have you considered my servant job do you know who said that that was god that was god the father knowing that he would stand the test and knowing it would bring hope to millions for thousands of years to come how do you come overcome satan by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony i heard someone say this it was kind of funny you first have to be tested before you can have a moaning testimony you're going to get tested yes and it's okay three god's allowed suffering to keep us humble do you believe that is there any scriptures that come to mind something that will keep us humble so you're going to be tested severely to stay humble anything come to mind how about the guy that wrote most of the new testament he had an affliction of his flesh what was that a demonic tormentor huh say what what does that mean tell me what that means and the devil is god's devil on a leash used as a disciplinary tool for some but also to keep men humble and so he and so paul apostle paul asked three times that it be removed and god's word on that third request my grace is sufficient for you correct first corinthians 5 you should read it the immoral man who will not repent he just keeps doing it and affects the whole community what's god's solution to that according to the written word you'll find this a little bit amazing hand this person over to satan that his flesh be destroyed but his spirit saved for the day of redemption what does that mean it means what it says there's going to be torment until there's repentance suffering i actually watch that work in my family i had a mother-in-law that was immoral and it's the only person i know of in our town that was excommunicated and rightly so and that and the elders of the church were wise enough to do exactly what first corinthians 5 said and it works i'm telling you and a decade later she came back to christ and it was the most beautiful ceremony i've been at it was precious and i watched the woman suffer and i watched her get tormented until she repented it works it's true i've seen it god's word is true it works and so god uses that type of suffering for correction 2 corinthians 12 6 even if i should boast i would not be a fool because when i was speaking truth this is this is apostle paul of these surpassingly great revelations therefore in order to keep me from becoming conceited i was given a thorn in my flesh a messenger of satan to torment me torment me three times i pleaded with the lord to take it away and he said my grace is sufficient there's the guy that wrote much of the new testament number four god allows suffering to bring his body together when one part suffers what we all suffer we have to enter into each other's sufferings it draws us close to each other yes what's the what is the bullseye according to jesus what's the bullseye of the greatest commandment of the entire bible what's the bullseye that's second goddess god with all your heart soul mind and strength that is the center of the bullseye the second is love your neighbor as yourself upon these two laws the whole law hangs you want to love your neighbor second command of the whole bible if we're going to be hitting the bullseye daily knowing what god wants and he and he is for front in our minds to bring the kingdom of god on earth as it is in heaven then we're going to be asking god who he wants to use he wants to use us to touch who in the midst of the suffering that's love that's loving your neighbor well entering into the

sinners in your ways and lead others back to you verse 13 i love that verse 13 i will take the worst things i've ever done and the sufferings i brought my my wife my own child died because of it this is a horrific thing that has happened to a covenant child and god's grace was sufficient to use it to use him later on in life to help others how cool is that is that good can god do that with you yes he can and so what god will do with our sufferings is he will prepare you for ministry with your sufferings [Music] i love prison ministry [Music] we have 14 prisons all over the world that we minister in every week and when i go to india or africa or dominican republic first place i want to go is prison why do you think that is because because i belong there that's why when i was a young buck i should have been put in prison i was that naughty i was a bad boy and i can relate to those men very well i relate to them i understand them i know they're angry and i know they're hurt and i know why they're incarcerated and i want to help them with my testimony of what i had done and god was able to forgive me if he's able to forgive me he's able to forgive you yes so god will use your suffering as your ministry i love it so check out check out psalm 38 psalm 51 today and just see how powerful this is that god can use all of your mistakes for his greater glory if you hand it back to

We couldn't do that without some preparation first get two plates and glue a paper pocket to the bottom of each one Place a coin in each of the plates the only thing is that it takes a bit of training to get it. Just right? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo This easy trick is great for beginner magicians The knot gets untied inside a towel roll What is this is this the power of will nope it's the power of the magic hole? Cut out a small circle in the roll through that hole you should be able to hold the string with your finger Keep it a secret Under which of the cones is the paper ball what about now? Where does it keep disappearing? For this trick you'll need two cardboard Semicircles make comes out of them with the help of some glue the secret is to slightly press on the walls of the cone Gently squeeze the cone and the paper ball will be sucked inside a simple But fun trick here's another simple trick pop balloons with a single touch all you need is an orange peel Rub it in into your finger and go on to impress your friends The orange peel contains a substance that can dissolve rubber in seconds. That's why the balloons immediately pop The bulb lights up right in your hands without any wires or anything How is that possible to be the lord of light? You must first be the lord of the ring We will need an opaque lightbulb carefully take off the base using a knife and some pliers We'll also need a metal base from an old incandescent light bulb we will attach it to the opaque light bulb some additional supplies To 3 volt batteries and LED and a couple of wires. We'll use a hot glue gun instead of a soldering iron Connect everything as shown in the picture Tape the two batteries together glue the long end of the LED to the positive plus side Connect the other end of the LED to the side of the base with a wire Connect the negative - side of the battery to the bottom of the base with another wire Put the base on the light bulb Press the ring against the wall and the bottom of the base This way we close the circuit and the LED shines right in our hands a great way to impress your friends Do you remember that childish trick with the vanishing fingers Well, you just didn't have a magic ring back. Then now it just got real put on the ring ah Where's my finger give it back? Oh? Thank god. It's back Want to try out this trick get a piece of black EBA foam and cut off a slice? Put the ring next to it Hold the prop between the thumb and the index finger done Remember that the illusionist must wear black clothes in order for the trick to work For the next trick we will need the help of physics fill up a bottle with water and place a tennis ball on top Turn the bottle upside down. Don't worry you won't wet your feet because of the pressure difference the ball stays firmly in place even if we give it a little turn a Magic glass that changes the suit of the card, but how does it work? We'll need two playing cards of the same order but different suit Join them together by applying some double-sided tape to their top parts when placing down the glass hold the edge of the outer card with Your fingers the eight of Hearts folds back and the viewer sees the eights of clubs A bit of practice and you can go show off your magic skills to the public Some playing cards and some money That's what we're going to need for our next trick wrap a dollar bill around a card folding its edges on both sides Turn the card face down and unfold the edges of the bill the card ends up inside the bill It looks like it's about to tear apart But the bill stays intact how cut the card in half tape one half to the back of the main card This secret pocket is what allows the car to freely move inside the bill amazing and For our next trick we will need two glasses and a dollar Bank No, turn the glasses upside down fold the dollar bill lengthwise in half Put it on top of the glasses Then tell your friend to push one of the glasses without moving the banknote of course. He's going to fail Let's demonstrate our financial wits by sneaking a coin on top of the end of the bill Wallah the bill stays in place some sleight of hand and just a teeny bit of swindle. What a fun little trick The props for our next trick are pretty straightforward a banknote a sheet of paper and a pencil Place the bank note inside the sheet of paper Then take the pencil and pierce the bill at this point we would ask the sensitive members of the audience to look away But wait no need for that the pencil went through the bill and left it intact The sheet of paper wasn't that lucky though you do understand that this trick needs some preparation in advance with a sharp blade Carefully make a cut in the bill so that the pencil can go through it. That's it. No one will even notice it a cup of coffee and a glass of smoke Please what yes, we want to teach you a new trick and show you how to make liquid smoke Wrap some matches along with a pencil and some foil you should get a kind of a tube Take out the pencil and pinch one end of the tube Place the prop inside a glass and light on fire the side with the match heads The smoke pours out like liquid to the bottom of the glass and stays there You could keep watching it forever. It's very beautiful You can also make some cool smoke rings with this smoke cut a plastic bottle in half cut off the wide part of a balloon and Put it on the half of the bottle with the neck you should end up with a cool instrument for making smoke rings whoever makes the most smoke rings wins Don't let go of the balloon. It'll deflate wait what here's the secret? We'll need a small ball place it inside the balloon and start inflating it turn the balloon neck down so that our plug securely closes the hole And that's the whole trick no one will figure it out unless you tell them yourself in the next bit We'll show you how to make a pendulum candle pierce the candle in the middle with a red-hot needle on the bottom of the candle Clean the wick from any wax Position the candle between two glasses and light both ends at the same time The wax melts and drips from one end making it lighter, and then does the same for the other end a perpetual motion machine Prays the magic but always remember about fire safety What do we have here an ordinary matchbox? What's inside? unsurprisingly matches wait a minute where did this coin come from place the coin between the box and the moving part the coin will fall inside as soon as the Box is closed Open it again. Isn't it wonderful? Don't take away the matches just yet We've got a few more tricks up our sleeve take a match and light it up blow Explicitly on the box and the match goes out do it one more time and again the match goes out by itself The trick is to snap your fingers just at the right moment on the match head to make the flame go out make a lot of noise while blowing to distract the audience if The previous trick didn't work. We've got a trick that works every time Take five matches out of the box and crack each of them in the middle Position them in a star formation and put a drop of water in the center The star slowly opens up The secret is that the water droplets lift up the ends of the matches, and they will slowly drift apart We are going to need a plastic bottle for our next trick show the audience that the bottle is empty Hit the bottle with your palms and suddenly a bottle cap appears inside. Where did it come from? Take off the sticker and make an opening like a small door in the side of the bottle get the cap and attach it inside The bottle with some double-sided tape put the sticker back on now if the cap will just fall down If you give it a good hit Leave a comment and tell us which trick you found the most fun was it the liquid smoke magic lightbulb or maybe the cartridge Don't forget to hit the like

hit us up with a comment let us know what you think we would really appreciate that so uh this week is super excited uh we usually do these physical tours and we reach out to this next homeowner to do a tour in san francisco because her and her home is is so cool uh we found an article about uh judy henderson as the mannequin queen and uh her story is so fun and we you know doing these the tours for the past eight years we'll see homes with a couple mannequins and they're always roll fun they'll decorate them for the holidays and that sort of thing uh but we're going to talk to judy about her love for mannequins her home who that has mannequins for decorations and the whole this whole idea of using mannequins for decorations how they can be more than just kind of putting on a shirt and all that fun stuff and how they can be like a really kind of fun and interesting part of your of your home so i am going to bring beauty up right now judy how are you doing yeah i'm doing well i'm doing well uh so uh thank you so much for being with us we're we're so super uh super interested to kind of see your home and see everything that you've done with mannequins and so i guess my first question for you is like what set you on this path of becoming the mannequin queen like how did you fall in love with mannequins well originally i just had a mannequin rental business that i just kind of stumbled into and then i realized that many times retail stores were just throwing mannequins in the trash when they were closed or remodeled and i thought mannequins have so many other usages besides just being in the store window displaying clothes i personally wanted a mannequin to put in my backyard as a mosaic art project i knew that there were other people like me so i went from just renting mannequins to people to acquiring more mannequins from retail stores when they would close and then i resell those mannequins to other people very cool very cool so you have uh you have a business reselling mannequins can you talk a little bit more about that yes with mannequin madness we we sell a range of mannequins and we say mannequins that's everything for mannequin hands legs any kind of a body part that's related to a human we sell that so what happens stores remodel clothes we pick up their mannequins for free so they no longer go into the length of what they would normally would go and mannequins are made out of materials that don't biodegrade so they really should not be gone in the landfill anyway but there's so many creative ways that people private individuals artists community groups museums that they need a mannequin at a discount price to really be able to do something else fun with it so we like to say we extend the use of mannequins beyond their initial purpose yeah i i love that concept so much you know these department stores aren't paying to get rid of mannequins that they would have to pay to throw into the landfill uh these these other small smaller retail retailers are getting mannequins that they normally couldn't afford plus all of these uh you know we're saving all these landfills from filling up with something that we could do i really consider it a win-win we're taking mannequins out of the landfill we're allowing people to have a creative use for them and don't we need more creativity right now we find that diy projects have really gone on an upswing with this pandemic because people want something fun to do they like making something with their hands and there's always been a fascination with the human body yeah love it and uh so why don't you get started and kind of show us your home those show mannequins and let's let's talk about mannequin decoration all that fun stuff now while my mannequin warehouse is wall-to-wall mannequins my home is not a lot of people think i'm going to be living with mannequins at home i have them but i have the very edited version so let's start with reading me here you may see we call him benson here's our headless male mannequin that has a little candy tray that greets people when they come in just something kind of fun um it was a mannequin that we got from i think a bloomingdale store they had in their cooking department and we thought let's repurpose it for another another need now one of the most popular reasons why people buy mannequins is they want to repurpose it into some sort of an art display and i've got one here where like i said it's just where we took some decoupage some feathers and we just made it up an art piece a life-size art piece an art is just everybody's personal interpretation of what art is but the fact that it's based on some sort of human form makes it feel a little well first of all it's three-dimensional but it also allows people that they can relate to it a little bit so i want to show you a couple of pictures because i get inspired by what my customers have done with mannequins i have a pinterest board that's just full of ideas of what people do with mannequins and once again we say mannequins we're also talking dress forms mannequin heads things like that one of the most popular one is the one you see on the screen now which is using it for decoupage um and decoupage has been around for like thousands of years and like i said it's a nice project you can do with simple materials many times you're repurposing paper we love the idea that it's up cycle materials on an upcycled mannequin let's go to the next screen this is another example of deca with old patterns we thought since usually mannequins relate to sewing why not take old patterns this is one of the members of my design team has created this and then we sell them on etsy next one love it this is one of my favorites i don't know who did this got to be labor intensive but imagine if you have like old pieces of broken jewelry old pearls brooches this is a way to once again create a piece of art with it that can live with you and i love the angel wings on that one you said pretty labor intensive i'm not saying everything has to be quick and easy but the finished result recorders i think the next one we're going to start going into mannequin lamps most people think of the christmas tree leg lamp as the standard for mannequin lamps but mannequin lamps have gone upscale now there's a company in london jimmy martin and his mannequin lamps are like and i think 1300 but they're life-size mannequins like this can we go to my screen for a second i want to show you one of the mannequin lamps that i have in my living room this is a leather form that came from a louis vuitton store and i'm thinking oh i love the leather on it and why not make a lamp out of it so it's functional you may not be able to see there's an edison bulb up here and then i just put a piece of jewelry here and i just have this here in my living room i just love the leather and like i said to have it be something i can look at as well as functional let's look at a few more lamps love it and before we go to the lamps you talked about the the leather uh mannequin right behind you that uh i'm really surprised because i didn't know that mannequins came in different uh different materials yes leather jersey sometimes they're made up of a muslin kind of fabric i mean there's a whole range of materials none of them are really biodegradable that's the one thing that's the common theme but yes the more upscale the store the higher the quality the material of the mannequin is going to be ah i love it all right well uh let's look at some more layers let's look at let's look a few more lamps like i said while we still do sell many mannequin legs for leg lamps i just wanted to show some other examples let's go to another screen of how other people are interpreting labs this is a company called mckenzie childs they're very very high-end mannequins i mean i wouldn't say this is this particular one is for the faint of heart to try to do but they have purchased mannequins from us and then they've repurposed them like this this is definitely repurposed square and i think these cost like thousands of dollars but we like to show people for inspiration you can do your own version of that with the materials that you have at hand i think we have one more lamp to show oh now we're getting to something else this is using mannequins as art and also functional i don't know that many people have a mannequin in their bathroom but i do know sometimes people put it there just to be able to put say their terry cloth robe on to really have it be something that's almost once again like a silent butler let's look at another one um jewelry or this particular case is belt and essence especially if you have some really beautiful belts why have them in the drawer why not have them out on display for you to see as well as easy for you just to pick and grab when you want to go go take them a lot of times people put necklaces on there because it keeps their necklaces from being tangled up in their drawer okay another one oh can we switch back to me real quick yeah now we're getting into mannequins as christmas tree i just wanted to show in my bed but i do have a mannequin in every room but each one is a little bit different this is a little mannequin and i put a little crown on the top here i'm trying to make sure i get that uh and i just put a lot of my pens on here just kind of little miscellaneous pens doesn't mean anything to anybody else but i just things that make me laugh or something i want to enjoy and so this material particular material is sort of like a velvety type of material and you see it white and once again they come in different colors while we're shiny i want to show one other kind of artistic mannequin this is almost like an art deco mannequin it's a little tall that's what i'm having to stretch up here this came out of the nordstrom store and all they simply did was have purses dangling on it because that the fascination with the human form and these are little slats here and what i did was i put some led lights in there you're not going to be able to see during the daytime so at night time it just lights up it's like a giant lamp i'm sorry for you guys from trying to get this right right here okay this is in my dining room okay i love it okay one of the things and i have to admit we've been really popularizing this as we'll go to the next screen is using mannequins as dress form christmas treats it's an alternative to a regular that one's in the corner so you can't see it quite as clearly but as you can see from the decoration hey it's christmas time christmassy with the decoration or look at the next couple of slides where in lieu of a tree they have actually made a pine garland skirt let's go to the next slide and then they decorate it like they would a tree a lot of african-american women call them diva trees just because they make the trees have a little bit of extra kind of little fat take off the pine garland skirt and then use the dress form for displaying your clothes or jewelry so it makes it like an eco-friendly version of celebrating christmas or what some people do is they just change the decoration they'll still leave the pine garland skirt but maybe they'll put flowers on it for chris for uh springtime or during the fall season they'll decorate it with leaves so it becomes a seasonal display that changes throughout the year oh i love that idea another example here after that one i think the next one we did one for oh this one was beautiful someone did this in ireland i have a facebook group called dress for christmas trees we actually call it dress from holiday trees since people are doing them all year round so people send me examples of all over the world of how they take in a dress form and see this one's made out of white hair you talked about the different materials that they're made out of this is more kind of a vintage kind of look and they made a tree out of that one and let's do one more we didn't want our jewish community to be left knocked out we did a hanukkah tree where it's in the hanukkah colors and i think she may even have a star of david around her neck grant you have to have a pretty big space to have something like this and some people do have a big foyer or many times they're retail stores that are using it but it's just to show that mannequins can be decorated for all kinds of purposes i think the most popular reason people use mannequins are in the garden so as i transition to my garden let's go and on the slide and let's show you some examples of what people have done with the garden um oh that's another one i'm sorry that's another one of just using his decoration even though they don't have hats on there they just use the heads because their vintage heads is decoration a lot of people will use head forms and put their hats on display hats or scarves are we okay let's go to the next one are we in garden yet i love this can you believe that a pair of mannequin legs as a planter this is the company based out of england called muck and grab muk and brass and they are really famous for taking mannequin legs and mannequin butts and making planters out of them as i said the fascination with the human form is why people like to repurpose things in different ways let's keep going as i'm making my way to my garden mosaic is another uh popular material that people like to do on a mannequin leg um a little bit of work like i said but we try to say there's something for every skill level if you don't have the skill to do a whole mosaic people then just will paint it sometimes let's keep going mannequin but you know sometimes it's just a matter of just something that's kind of whimsical and something to laugh at not necessarily something that's high art let's go to another screen oh did we skip ahead i think we might have skipped one but this is another example of a mosaic version okay maybe not mosaic in the garden i love that one too i always have my little special favorites let's keep going no little x-rated at least pg rated but once again these are ideas of what i've seen other people do so i just provide the raw material and people have their own creativity and inspiration that they take it from there yeah i have to say that guy's a little prickly yeah he's a prick all right i think i've got a few more yeah my garden this is another one where they're just using a wire form and you can use it as like a topiary or as a vertical garden i've seen people use succulents they put on here especially if someone has a small space it's a way to get more color for your bang i think i have two more and then we're going to switch to my garden before i get rained out it's raining here in california oh uh i'm not getting any more photos okay but let's switch to me so in my backyard i've got a little couple here i call adam and eve out here in the garden just kind of frolicking together these mannequins are made out of fiberglass so they can withstand being in the elements um like i said it's raining right now and they're just sitting out here no problem whatsoever then i've got a little lurker back over here he's just sitting here next to my water fountain and then i've got a girl over here she needs a little work we were going to initially just cover her with ivy and let her just feel sort of like a topiary sculpture back here we paint her a bright red so she can stand out so judy thank you so much for for sharing your home and for sharing these really kind of fun ideas i love the the christmas uh tree skirt i love the idea of using kind of a mannequin to put like your robe on that sort of thing uh for for other people who are like me who are you know seeing some of these mannequins and then they want to get into it they want to do something with their home uh where do you think that they should start what advice would you give to the new people well first i'd recommend that they would go to my pinterest boards because i had them divided up by category by interest so if you're interested in mosaics or some people some tattoo artists like to buy mannequins to practice different type of designs and be able to showcase that people who are into rope art like shibari they'll buy manikins to be able to do their art with i mean there's all different types of art art is very subjective whether you're painting mosaic or decoupage as a whole range and so i try to divide it up by category so people can easily find what interests them many times we actually have tutorials we teach zoom classes for our dress room christmas trees we have youtube tutorials we also have some printed tutorials so sometimes we might already have some tools to help you but i think the main thing is just to have fun with it it's easier than ever to find the raw materials either from companies like myself or on craigslist you can many times find used mannequins and i give to give you a chance just to have fun i think many times as adults particularly now we don't give ourselves the opportunity just to have fun this is something you can do at home on your own time love it love it and so yeah people can go and do a lot of these really fun projects uh really all they have to do is just kind of go to the pinterest board get some ideas and just get started you know it's as simple as that right exactly and that's why i recommend people buy a used mannequin so you can have some trial and error i mean obviously you may not be able to make your dream banning lamp the first time you try it so that's why i say don't spend a lot of money by buying a brand new mannequin by the used one to be able to practice with or like you said even as simple as just putting a mannequin and put it in your backyard and sometimes people take a mannequin that has some cracks in their head and they attach flowers in there either fake or real flowers that's beautiful as well love it yeah it's yeah it's uh it's so much so much fun just you know taking uh taking a mannequin and just running with it you know it's so much better than winding up in the landfill and all that fun stuff and everyone's looking for fun projects nowadays right totally and even after 20 years of being in the business i still am amazed with something new that someone comes up with the mannequins now people are attaching them to drones and doing something creative with that they're doing more digital kind of things with mannequins too maybe sometimes they're putting a computer monitor on the head like i said art is very broad-ranging so whatever you're interested in if it involves a mannequin body part we've got you covered yeah and if you need a human form you know what what better way to do it than get a mannequin right right and i said especially a recycled one not only is it good from an environmental standpoint but you also save money so it's a total win-win love it well well judy thank you so much for for taking the time out showing us your amazing home and getting us some really wonderful ideas about how to incorporate mannequins or in our own homes i think we're probably going to see a lot more like mannequin tree skirts and that sort of thing in the future um yeah love it uh thank you again and thank

had no idea they were a dollar ninety-nine at Walgreens and there are five different flavors in here three and a half servings are in the container eleven pieces are 110 calories so we have strawberry blue punch cherry apple and orange key what you want I do like the rest and it feels like there is a lot of sugar in here but I'm just gonna read what syringe [Applause] there's a few of them already yeah but that's crazy did we not get all the flowers there's a red pink blue green in the large yeah we got at least two of everything okay red pink blue green and orange yeah you wanna take a picture of these before you eat them all yes there's a little bit about two boys are two greens the whole box yeah so I had to take a picture before we could start just so that we wouldn't eat them all okay why don't we do the the orange these are babies going flat mm-hmm that's baby I love it though that's very good it's got the Tarkan's to it Wow so instead there were three and a half servings in here I've had this is a product of Mexico it says close it no like the flavor I would like turn orange yes the textures really not I give a tortoise dog yes lots and lots of orange Bible and let them how about a strawberry is that the really paint would be they have a nice chewed your home hmm that's it okay story it isn't it's not Jolly Rancher ruling it isn't as sweet of a strawberry even though I mean it is incredibly sweet but there's like a like a starburst strawberry it's not like that yeah it's not that strong yeah it just it's good it just doesn't have the fiber okay how about cherry rude yeah it's a stronger flavor mm-hmm it's heartless Kuchar mm-hmm it's a leaning towards a lifesavers cherry but I still don't think it's that strong no I think I'm lifesavers cherry is stronger but I still like this device it's very good okay blue punch mm-hmm hmm look I'm oh yeah I could definitely get them it's like a fruit punch oh yeah they're calling it blue punched as it's blue but it is like a fruit punch kind of like a kool-aid for no punch um they're gonna fly it's nice and the last one is Apple the green so we mainly have cherry mm-hmm which is good mmm Apple strong I figured the Apple would be stronger that's why when to do it laughs it's a strong it tastes like a blow pop a green blood pop there's an apple that one's nice yeah Apple only ones are the strongest levers yes and then probably the punch then the cherries and the strawberries last I agree I agree even though I like the flavor of the strawberry it just doesn't have as much fiber as I would like for it to have yeah but these are good they're good it's got a good chewy texture to it so stuff is like a gummy right the only thing is you're gonna be tempted it said there's three three and a half servings in here and you're gonna want to eat all of these cuz they're that good yeah I mean you saw how quick we ate five of them they they go pretty fast I mean I guess you could suck on it for a while but me I have a tendency to just treat a minute it gets in my mouth I want to chew it up you know and and move on to the next so I would like know I maybe you should drop if you like a little bit of the sweet and the tart then I think you'll like them too so thank you again to Rachael for telling me about them and thanks for watching [Music]", "OwntTW7uUbE": "all right so fitness and nutrition one-on-one my name is fania as pastor d'amico said and i am here to walk you through my fitness and nutrition guide that's really designed to kick-start your health and wellness journey and really get you on track to live a healthy lifestyle so without further ado let's jump right in so the objectives today is to a live a healthy lifestyle lose weight how to boost your metabolism and how to really jump start your fitness so those are going to be some of the areas i cover today so first off i want to talk about some success tips um the number one tip that i have learned throughout my last super focused year of fitness has been to a work at your own pace you know you don't always have to overdo it you can modify exercise you can modify food modify any you need so listen to your body um injury prevention is more important than through your workout and your body will thank you later and secondly don't give up you know keeping up with the diets and the workouts will be definitely a challenge but it's not too difficult so if you want to feel and see changes you definitely have to put in the work and really commit to yourself to be dedicated for at least an entire month and and remember not to be lazy so it does take work and you'll see as i talk how much of what we learn in in bible study what we learn in our sunday service they all tie in together as one big happy lifestyle balanced so you'll hear a lot of the same things we hear on sunday and as it relates to fitness third tip would be to find an accountability partner working out is sometimes more fun with other people so try to find someone to do with you maybe you know your wife husband significant other your kids teammate etc so but if you're going to do a program solo at least maybe let someone know that you're doing it so they can check in with you and and keep you accountable keep you in check and pumped up and motivated throughout the week next tip for success would be to have fun don't make this just about working out or just about eating clean make sure you're having a good time doing it you know you want to create an atmosphere that will allow you to do that you know whether it's dancing around the way i do whether it's singing your song whether it's being outdoors whatever environment you like that brings you joy i would i would focus on that and last but not least you can do this so just bring remember that believe in yourself surround yourself with people who believe in you and if you have any questions you know feel free to to email someone like myself someone like larry or or anyone that can keep you motivated and keep you on the right track to to reach your goals so my information you'll see is on every slide here if you want to contact me i got you okay my next slide is probably where i'm going to take most of the time talking so i have been surrounded with sports and fitness my whole life you know as a as an athlete as coming from a family of athletes um my my dad was an athlete and coach so you learn all these things you you grow um i worked for equinox for years so you you know all of the scientific things you know the food pyramid but what i really learned this last year was the relationship aspect of food and eating that's what really changed for me that was different so let's talk about it um food for thought yes i'm corny uh relationship status so you you focus on your relationships with people you focus on your relationship with god and you put work into so in a similar fashion think of food as a relationship so what is your status is it healthy right now is it toxic is it an abusive relationship you have with food so really sit there and unpack that and be honest with it and the same way we have therapists and we seek um help and in other areas of our relationships we might need the same with food you know that relationship didn't start just today just yesterday so just be mindful of that that it is a work in progress and an ongoing relationship that you will have to work on um next is really know your why so a why are you why are you eating why do we need to eat so i had to really change the way i thought about food i would run to food as a comfort because it tastes so good that melted cheese got butter that bread and i thought you know it was making me happy so when i kind of switched my mindset to think about food as really fueling my body and giving me the energy i need to perform daily life functions just understanding the effect that food had on me mentally physically my energy just how i carried myself so it's definitely work in progress but i i shifted that so when you take your car to the gas station you know you're not going to just put diesel gas in it or if you're driving around in your bins and it calls for 91 you're not going to put 87 because you know that's not the type of fuel that your car needs so that really made a light bulb go off in my head and like okay so why would i opt to eat five snickers instead of something a little bit more balanced or you know or a whole peach cobbler when i have a little bit you know it's it's it's it's a it's a work so you i do love my sweets anyone who knows me knows i i can definitely um devour uh a lot but um i've helped to control that and balance that again that word balance um next is really respecting your temple you know we focus at least on sundays on being you know being mindful of of of the temple of god that that and your body is a temple and we we talk about ear gate we talk about your eye gate but what about your mouth gate like what are you putting inside your body you have this beautiful home you have these nice cars you wear these pretty fancy clothes but what is the inside of your body looking like so just just just think about that so it really starts the next point is my internal transformation it starts from the inside and what we eat really really matters it it affects everything so all of those things we've already talked about what's done in the dark comes to the light what you eat in the dark and what you eat in your secret room and you know you pull things out of your pocket that you probably shouldn't eat um it will show in some some shape form or shape or form it might be physically it might be emotionally um so it definitely shows so there's no there's really no no way way to hide it um my next point is really be honest with yourself you have to tell the truth to you first like look in the mirror that is not an easy thing to do so just speaking from experience uh when i started my journey i didn't realize how hard it was to be transparent about what i was eating i still felt this feeling of of shame um working with with my coach and not wanting to say oh um yeah i i kind of ate not one piece of pound cake i might have ate the whole cake so it really helped helps help me to realize why i was doing that and and what i was getting from it and and and then i realized it really wasn't that big of a deal like once i started talking about what i was doing that's where i could start okay i can meet you there i can meet you um if you're honest well we can work from where you're at so i think just being honest with with yourself um is a great starting point so you know where to go but if you aren't honest um you're only fooling yourself every someone's gonna know that you are not doing what you say you are doing um next uh really make a decision make that choice and be willing to do something different that you've never done before and you will get those results um i was very very stubborn i'm like no i will work out you know ten times a day if i have to i'm gonna eat my in and out and as much as it was ingrained in my head you can't outwork um the kitchen abs are made in the kitchen i was like yeah yeah yeah um tyrobank said i could eat a little bit of everything so i'm gonna eat a little bit of everything um but i never got the results i've gotten now um until i finally made a decision to stop running from nutrition and making a change and stop saying that no i just don't eat that i don't i don't like black beans i don't like brown rice no i have to eat white bread so making that choice and sticking to it has really um made a huge difference in my my life um practice discipline and obedience some days are easy some days are hard but if you are disciplined and obedient you will reap the benefits self-love and self-care very very important but can you truly love yourself and feed yourself toxins you know it's it's tough i know this is the this is the tough part everything else is fun but i think these roadblocks these mental robots are really what stop you from getting started we we love to say we love ourselves but are we really making decisions that show that that we love ourselves food can really affect your your your organs your your livelihood your mobility these things you know either can extend your life or it can shorten your life you know the choice is yours so um all that again i say um comes with balance we want to live a balanced lifestyle um mix it all in you have to have fun you guys know i love to have fun so just just just even it out okay so next so next speaking of balance we've all seen this i won't spend a ton of time um talking about what's on your plate but really what is on your plate you know is it stacked up with macaroni and cheese or is it stacked up with something that's going to help your digestive system so um this is kind of things that we've all we all all seen before but i'll review it and it's just about balance you're going to balance some exercise in there you're going to balance your carbs carbs are good um you they are a source of fuel they help satisfy your hunger they help lasting energy but just make sure you have fiber in there and we can talk about you know what type of fiber we're going to go over a shopping list in a second so the fiber helps with your digestion hydration water water water water water is is essential and you must drink it period point-blank there's no game around that at least eight glasses um so we'll talk about tips on how you can drink more water um even fats you still need fat in your diet but you know think of the good fats that's why the omega-3 fatty acids um are there that really help support your cardiovascular health and some places you can get that or like um from olive oil avocados egg yolks nuts or ocean caught fish and you want to make sure you have your vitamins and minerals i really suggest a multivitamin for everyone on here um just so you're on a cellular level um your body is um converting the nutrients to energy and absorbing them um in a good way um there's also you should be eating plant-based things uh that's not on here but get some phytonutrients some things that grow from the ground everything should you really shouldn't eat processed foods um but i know that's easier said than done um exercise it doesn't have to be intense you're not going to go from 0 to 100 you know you start where you're at so if that just means you you walk every day for 30 minutes that's that that's a start but just moving around a little bit every day will make a big difference and i think a big area that people miss and don't understand the importance of is rest you must really rest your body um at least six hours so it can rejuvenate and rebuild you want to get to that rem sleep so again just making sure your plate is balanced you have your protein on there which i don't think i talked um deeply about protein but protein is probably one of the most important building blocks of the body to help build your muscles and maintain your muscles and and give you that energy so when you make your plate i'm i love to go for my carbs first but try to eat your protein first um before you eat your other things that's because otherwise i eat all my rice i'm like i have this little chicken left um but keep your keep your plate balanced yeah so self-explanatory and everyone could have a copy of this as well i have a pdf form of this so next was the shopping list i was like okay well just tell me what to buy and i'll buy it um this this is what i started with and it's not the end all be all lit is a guide to to jump start like i said kind of a cleanse and and tell you where you can start and then you can add things in as you see how your body reacts to it so i know you all can read so i won't go down the list but i think these are a great starting point for your proteins here's a list of where you can start your good fats your non-starch carbs basically your vegetables but you have to be mindful on your vegetables because in me i was like oh i'll eat corn but corn is not on here and corn is not technically um one of these fiber rich non-starch carbs so this is a great start here and then for your basic starch starchy complex carbs are going to be anything brown even some jasmine rice oatmeal the sweet potato not candy yams but just a sweet potato so just be mindful of the sugars and the salt as well those really really make a huge difference so pick up your pepper pick up your red pepper use the savory seasonings before you use the salt you will thank me um who i was i grabbed salt for everything i grew up in a household where you know i go cut an orange and the first thing we ask is oh where's the salt and like put the salt on there like i love salt so if i can do it i know you can um so also with brown rice a trick that i have found is i still don't know how to make it from the bag but they sell these amazing little packs in the store like by kroger and you just put them in the microwave for 90 seconds and they're fluffy and good and they taste yummy so if you were scared of trying brown rice you should look that up and and try that out and then fruits we know they're good however everything on here you have to eat in the right portion so you can't anything too much of one thing is always is is not a good thing so with your fruit you're going to limit that you remember seeing that pyramid but i would say like two servings of these a day because fruit is a natural sugar so you can't necessarily overdo the fruit either because it tastes so good you know we all love good apples and and pineapples but don't go overboard with that um also on the bottom um you'll see a supplement list that i suggest that that's something that i have been using um for the past year so if you have any questions or want to know more about a personalized program for me for you then you can definitely reach out to me and we can talk offline about that but i use that in conjunction with these foods and the next one okay so the next thing i want to talk about is really the timing of your meals this is also very important a lot of a lot of us have built got our body clocks off a lot of us get up and just start the day and you know that breakfast is the most important but do you know why um so i recommend eating within the first hour of waking and at least hydrate your body to get your body going you know as you eat and your body starts the digestion process you know it's burning calories and you know we're like a machine and if that machine has stopped moving that's why you feel like you're not hungry and your body kind of goes into um starvation mode and survival mode and it's not going to work it's going to hold on to all of those calories so at first this might seem like oh my god this is so much food but it it really gets gets your gets your body um going so i'm going to kind of break this down a little bit i gave a sample time as if you woke up between six and seven and like your first meal was at seven so i break my day down into five um five meals a day starting at seven a.m with breakfast or a meal replacement of your choice and then your portions would be as follows refer back to the shopping guide if you stick with one cup of protein one cup of a non-starch carb like a vegetable and a half a cup of complex carb you'll know that you're basically having a balanced meal so go back to that list and think oh well what can i actually i'm going to go back to it because and think what can i make for breakfast okay well maybe my little bat oh there it is so let's look at protein what kind of protein would i want for my breakfast okay maybe turkey bacon great let me get that oh i love scrambled eggs for for breakfast great let me get some of those eggs for the fat maybe not five eggs but you know limit your eggs and then you can you know go on and so forth into you know maybe put some spinach in your eggs and then let's look over and instead of regular potatoes or you could have a potato um you know put some potatoes in there and then some fruit and there's your breakfast you know so you can mix and match and stay healthy so that's breakfast and then you're going to want to eat between two and three hours between two and a half to three and a half hours um in between each meal so then my next meal would be suggested to be at 10 a.m to be a snack and that snack could be a fruit and nuts my go-to snack is one green apple and i'll han a handful of um raw almonds from trader joe's it's simple quick and it gives me the energy i need to sustain throughout the day because if i miss a meal i get hangry very hangry so there's different options too you um you know as long as your nuts are a fourth of a cup lightly salted no salt if you can do it would be better um two two two boiled eggs and veggies one cup of greek yogurt so things like that you can mix and match with your snacks too to make make healthy snacks and then and so on and so forth one o'clock would be your lunch four o'clock would be your snack and then seven o'clock would be your dinner um and then if you get on that schedule you'll start to see the the the changes and and really um get your party's engine working like you should like it's like a train going down the tracks chugging along and then once you get going it just goes and so that's been exciting and then um for me but what i do i live by my calendar i have my water on my calendar so i have a a alarm when it's time for me to drink water and i have an alarm when it's time for me to eat all these things like you you do what works for you to stay on track and then remember and keep throwing that in drink a gallon of water a day and yes it seems like a gallon um it's not as much as you think you know it's really just eight water bottles a day um so if you drink a glass before every meal there's a there's there's five down so just throw in three more so um that is that all right workout plan uh so i try to do a little bit of exercise every day this is just a suggestive plan um i know we were all in quarantine so a lot of all of these were just some body workouts that body weight workouts that i was able to do in my living room um you can do them outside you can do them on the beach you can do them in your gym anywhere you go again it's really all about balance so this was um each exercise i would do one minute per exercise and have a complete three to four sets and this is where it would help to to have a coach to make sure you know you have the correct form make sure you watch videos and you're mindful of that so you don't injure yourself but a lot of these exercises we have grown up doing or seen before and there's lots of different videos you can see me doing them you can see others doing them or or look them up and and go from there but that's that's it you know i it seems so simple and i'm like i this has been holding me back like it almost almost takes minutes really to complete one cycle so you start where you're at so if you can give 10 minutes do 10 minutes then if you can work up to 30 great if you need to work out for an hour later like you're gonna just keep pushing yourself where you where you are but again the balance so you can start say monday with like a upper body tuesday go back to your abs and cardio wednesday lower body thursday it's always on rotation maybe friday a full day of full body work saturday abs and cardio again and then sunday you need to rest rest is so important again you know maintain your sabbath take your time you must rebuild you can't just go go go you will break down so um take a break and and honor yourself and rest um so that that is definitely um very very crucial next we're going to talk oh there we go so next we're going to talk a little bit more about some more weight loss tips and how this all goes together just in review so the number one thing um that really helps you is building muscle so building muscle requires you know more effort to maintain so that makes you burn more calories um build more muscle burn more calories pretty simple next is really using compound and full body exercises this really exercises that cross over more joints use more muscles and burn more um calories like squats lunges burpees push-ups bench presses um etc um especially like working your leg muscles like your biggest muscle in the body um just it it helps burn throughout the day um even myself i kind of slapped off um after my birthday and i was at a plateau for a while you know just maintaining you know happy but i started a challenge at the beginning of the month and i really focused again on my workouts and i was able to cross over that plateau because my muscles started working again and really burning um when i wasn't working so i was very very happy to see that um i was not stuck anymore so that was great you're welcome okay next thing i think someone came off the mute hello hello all right so the next thing is eat early and eat often i know we reviewed the meal schedule but just want to reiterate the importance of that so it takes energy calories to digest food eating reasonably portioned meals and snacks every two to three hours will put your body in a constant burning state due to constant digestion also eating slow digesting foods like complex carbs will extend the calorie burning um digestion so when you hear when people talk about empty calories those are calories that do nothing for you they just take up space so yeah a diet coke might have zero calories but it's also not doing anything for you whereas you know a 100 whole wheat piece of bread um has a lot of things that nutrients in it that your body's going to have to break down and burn and work um in in and turn into energy and really work for so keep that in keep that in mind eat within an hour of waking up to jumpstart your metabolism breakfast is the most important meal of the day for a reason and drink plenty of water one gallon one gallon one gallon and one gallon most of us really retain water due to dehydration because we don't drink enough water so again the trick of drinking one full glass before you eat will really help curb your appetite a little bit as well maintain a calorie deficit that means consume less calories than you burn and you will lose weight you know it seems like simple math you know a 500 calorie deficit per day will generate about one pound of fat loss per week there are calorie counters out there but beware you know i we all might have that lose it app on our phone i got stuck on that lose app for maybe three years like well you know it says i have 1400 more calories of the day let me just eat um a double double and one snickers and then i'm good um so you you need to be mindful because then you might be hurting your engine if you are not eating on a regular schedule and you will not see progress because i definitely didn't see progress that way and i have friends who use that so you have to make sure you keep a balance of your proteins carbs and and fats and make sure it matters where your calories come from so not all calories are created equal um keep keep that in mind um so you can definitely keep using those to help you help get you started but if you want to take it to the next level then you could you know hire someone like me to help you um or someone like mr larry and we will get you where you want to get and last two rest rest is one of the most optimal fat burning periods happening when you're asleep your body's actually repairing itself metabolizing while you rest so you really want to optimize your weight loss get some sleep at least six hours if possible and make sure it's good sleep rem sleep um and stress we all know that stress kills so whatever you can do to really relieve stress on a weekly basis at minimum but even a daily basis really having your me time something like i said that brings you joy because stress really breaks down your immune system causes your body to stop working properly results in high blood pressure migraines we all know what stress does and it doesn't feel feel good so find your outlet like i said mine is dance you guys i'm sure have seen me dance all around on here and uh i love it and i'm going to keep doing it it makes me happy it brings me joy so i hope you find something to do that brings you as much joy as dancing brings me so um that's definitely definitely helped me um throughout this yoga massages you can go to burke williams spas are opening now stretch breathe breathe stretch shake you know just have have

through video screen go ahead and give her a clap wonderful information really appreciate it i also want to appreciate everyone who's online taking their time out of their schedule um be with us this morning we really appreciate it you guys see my screen yes thank you thank you so the gist of what i'm going to talk about today is master your nutrition and how to build power um key emphasis your i try to be as prescriptive as possible and talk to you a little bit about the soft science of nutrition and building up power power is basically strength over time so that's basically what we'll be talking about today during the presentation i found it very interesting though today uh if you guys don't mind me sharing um i do a daily bible verse and this morning it just so happens my daily bible verse today was um ephesians chapter 2 verse 10. and what that verse says is god planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live this is why he sent christ to make us what we are and i just found that interesting i can't make it up again that was just my bible verse of today but again god planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live so again that's why highlighting our nutrition and learning how to build up some some of our strength in terms of muscle development it's just very important it's vital information so again thanks for being with us today my name is larry reid um my catchphrase is t2p and that just means whatever you're doing in terms of training your body your mental health you just want to be able to perform that might be able to perform on the job site um just coming home performing your day-to-day activities it might even just be interacting with your children um and then you can take that to a higher level if you want to compete in sports and stuff like that so again it's just t2p so what i'm gonna talk about is just trying to get yourself how to train to perform so today i would like to discuss with everyone some nutrition plans and i'm gonna discuss three of them um but to me the key is just drinking half your body weight and water on a daily basis and that's if you can you always want to progress up if it starts with six bottles of water start at six bottles of water um if you can get all the way up to a gallon you can get to a gallon but the soft science says as long as you're getting half your body weight in water daily um you'll be okay so why that's important for me um i'm an athlete so i need a little bit more hydration um so what i do is i add bcaas and i'm gonna break that acronym down but i add bcaas to my water because it number one it just gives it some flavor i'm gonna just keep it real meat drinking regular water um i can't really do anywhere close to half my body weight um so that was just the first reason i started to take an interest in and drinking bcaas in my water and so what bca bcaas are they're your branched chain amino acids and so people say well what's important about that so we all talk about having protein in our body um and basically the building blocks of proteins are amino acids and then the branch chain amino acids are the three most essential of those so again let me break that down for you the building blocks of protein are amino acids right and then the bcaas are the most essential of the amino acids so what these amino acids do is number one they increase muscle growth two decrease muscle soreness three reduce exercise fatigue four prevent muscle wasting what muscle wasting is a there's something that occurs when your protein breakdown basically exceeds your muscle synthesis which is the process of your muscles building itself up so basically you're taxing your body is what we're saying so bcaas um help with all of those things but for me the number one thing it just added flavor to my water so i can have my daily intake of at least half my body sizing water level one of the nutrition plan you just want to get to a point where you can master your own macro intake you need to be able to master your own macro intake what macro is is your protein which should be 40 of your calorie count for the day your carbs which same thing should be 40 of your calorie intake for the day and then your fats which should be 20 so don't let anyone tell you that on any nutrition plan you're not supposed to have some fats in your diet and for you if that's dark chocolate if that's your thing again your body needs 20 of that on a daily basis so again don't get mad at yourself when you take 25 because again we're all humans and this is just a soft science um and a lot of us we're walking around anyways with our job we might be walking up and down stairs um some of you guys might take lunch break walks just walking around just because you have three kids at home but a lot of us are already doing some form of exercise because we're walking right and if you're not and you're sitting down all day you can still do stuff like yoga um you can do dumbbells so if you're not on a percentage you're okay just get to a point where you're close to those percentages but you need to master your macro intake and it can't be mine has to be yours and that's based on your body weight and we'll get into that a little bit later so level one of any nutrition plan learn to master your macro intake again you get 40 protein 40 carbs 20 fats in your diet on a daily basis level 2 which i'm going to discuss today is using your macro information and using that and then slowly reducing your carb intake right slowly reducing your carb intake as you're still taking in your protein and your fats and then adding on the workout a specific workout we usually allow uh people to use like an eight-week period um and after that eight-week period you can come back and recalculate your numbers because usually you might have lost five fixed three um pounds and so that way your numbers are going to change slightly if you lose 10 15 pounds your numbers are going to change a little bit more but again you give yourself eight weeks to master your macro information right and then slowly reducing your carbs and that known to work out level three which i'm going to discuss is what i'm currently in the faith of trying to go plant-based um all things work in progression i'm gonna show you a plan on how to progressively get to a place where you are more plant-based than bringing in your animal protein um i'm not gonna try to sell you on to going into having a plant-based diet but the soft science said animal protein has heme iron in it so you want to try to avoid as much hemet iron if you can so what hemi iron does is it slowly starts to reduce your epithelial tissue which is wrapped around um your muscles um which again that's where our blood is flowing through um so you're basically just starting to restrict your pipes it's almost like having a huge ficus tree in the middle of your yard and at some point you know it's going to get underneath and grow long long strong roots and those roots are going to uh start to damage your pipes you're just going to start squeezing them squeezing them squeezing them to where your water flow in your house isn't running properly so that's the same thing hemi iron is doing with our blood and our body and oftentimes we think certain diseases such as diabetes is genetic and the soft science says it's really not genetic it's our diet that is we genetically take on from our parents or we watch tv and try to figure out what they're eating and so we intake that into our diet and so diseases like diabetes cardiovascular diseases is usually happening because of our diet and dramatically is happening because of the hema iron that we're in taking into our body so those are the three nutrition plans i'm going to speak with you about today um again the first part of any nutrition plan is drinking half your body weight in water um if you're like me you want to add some flavor to it go ahead and add those bcaas some people do coconut water i'm a huge fan of coconut water and again i'll jump into that a little bit later but coconut water does have 70 more electrolytes than gatorade level one of our nutrition plan i'm gonna discuss is matching your macro intake level two using that macro information to reduce your carbs slowly and adding on the workout and then level three plant-based um avoiding hemi iron let's go ahead and jump into level one master your mic macros right so your macros again are protein carbs and fats that we intake on a daily basis protein you need to take in as much grams of protein to match your body weight so if your body weight is 200 pounds you need to intake 200 grams of protein on a daily basis why protein what protein does is it grows and repairs our muscle tissue right again so as you're eating your protein what that's doing internally is growing and repairing your muscle tissue um protein that i used to intake and i still intake a little bit at this point on the salmon chicken breast turkey breast ground beef black beans protein pancakes and if you ever want to get to a point where you're mastering your macros one gram of protein equals four calories for my calorie counters one gram of protein equals four calories so let's say let's take something like chicken breasts chicken breast depending on the size of it but let's go with one that has 25 grams of protein in it 25 times 4 that's going to be 100 calories you're intaking for the day at some point you will need to get a food scale if you want to start to master your macros i know a lot of us just like to do the eye test but it's way better if you can use a scale and actually start to really measure your intake of your macros it's very important there are other proteins out there um but again i just try to be prescriptive to my information the ones that i like to intake um with famine chicken breasts turkey breast ground beef black beans and protein pancakes carbs there's a lot of information out there saying people going low-carb diet no carb diet you do not ever want to go no carb diet but you do slowly want to reduce your carb intake if you are trying to lose weight if you just want to maintain your weight and usually for us if we're going over our macro count if you just learn to master your carb count you'll you'll start to lose weight as well and again your carb intake is just like protein it's going to match your body weight so again 200 pounds you're able to take in 200 grams of carbs on a daily basis and your body will not grow in terms of adding on 10 pounds if you're mastering your macro account i mean adding on your proteins and your fats so again a lot of information is out there that you have to go no carbs um i don't i don't recommend that the science says your body does need 40 of carbs every day why carbs carbs with fuel for hard exercise um but again it's just few for your engine for your tank for your body right um but if you want to get into exercise you're definitely need carbs for the energy that's why most people before going to the gym they have an intake of carbs to give them themselves a natural energy so that way they'll have the energy to burn off as they're working out and they just have the energy to work out as they're working out again what i like to intake for carbs were pasta beans so you see beans appearing in both lists protein and carbs and a lot of foods do potatoes i used to like the red potatoes but if you're just getting the big old stack of potatoes those potatoes that's all you need um whole wheat bread fruit oats oatmeal um i used to as a kid they should really really like oatmeal i've kind of gotten away from it but now that i've gone to a plant-based more diet um i have been adding in my oats and i'm gonna continue to add in my oats but again that's just oatmeal again one gram um equals four calories so you're able to intake that based on your body weight so again if i'm 200 pounds i can take in 200 grams of carbs which times four i can get 800 of my my calories from carbs that's a lot of calories of carbs so again i don't want to scare anyone off they think i can't eat this i can't if you if you master your macro account you can almost eat anything you want just in moderation and use it as a progression to master your macros um fats fats is the third category of your macros again you have protein carbs but fats um there you can have 30 of your body weight this is on a daily basis right you don't get to match it per body weight but you get 30 of your body weight so that's important and i'll break that down a little bit further later um why fats because fat helps you um your body vitamin absorption plus hormone production right those are two vital things it's helping your body break down and absorb the vitamins that we intake and that's through food some of us do the pills some of us do the liquid protein but it's helping our body absorb the vitamins that our body naturally needs on a daily basis plus it's creating hormone production so those are two vital things that our body needs and on a daily basis as social beings we need both how i like to get my fats in is guacamole whole eggs nuts so again you feed nuts appearing again in the category and then peanut butter guacamole whole eggs nuts and peanut butter um as a kid i never even tasted guacamole but always thought i didn't like a real funny story is i'm in my household i'm called little larry i am larry junior my dad larry senior he never ate onions so just because my dad never ate onions you know what sign me up to you dad i'm not eating onions either but as i started doing more research and just growing and maturing a little bit for my own nutritional plan right for the last month and a half i have been consuming onions and actually i'm a huge proponent of the taste and the flavor that he gives to food um i often tell my girlfriend that she's making my bake my bagel vegetarian sandwich i say please give me some more onions so again just a funny story anybody's nutritional information knowledge and daily intake can change um that's what makes us all lifelong learners don't think just because you weren't willing to do something two days ago um if it's healthy if it's scientifically proven that it's gonna be the best for your body and your nutrition plan right i added on um onions i have not added on coconut right because i don't want to touch coconut but you can change as you get older as you gain more information but make your nutrition plan about you that's the biggest thing i want to harp on for level one mastering your macros make your nutrition plan fit your body your needs um your ones level two level two is the same as level one you wanna master your macro count right again for your protein you want your forty percent but you do wanna slowly right slowly reduce your carb intake um try to do it on gradually like every two weeks it's way easier um when you first start off your level two plan you actually want to just master your macro count and stick to that for the first two weeks you don't want to reduce any carbs first two weeks go ahead and give yourself the chance just to master your macro account and for some of you guys it's gonna take about four weeks maybe even a year it could take five years just to master your macro account but that is level one get to the point in life where you can master your macro count because again what we intake in terms of nutrition is going to definitely affect our bodies um and we want to live through him and we want to be on earth as long as we can to be able to live through him so we can share the information of him and we all know what we're talking about but again how you attack can help is mastering your macro account and level two you just want to start to reduce your cap your carb intake you still get to have your fats on here it says 20 um because the 20 here is different than the 30 of your body weight right so i don't want to cause any confusion this is just 20 of your daily intake maxed up at the 40 and 40 was equal to 100 right so this is more about your calorie intake not about the grams of fats that you're gonna get because again i don't want to cause any confusion because some of you guys might be writing notes or some of you guys might be visual learners you saw 30 percent um for mastering your macro account in here saying 20 you just want 20 of your calorie intake for it which would be 30 grams of your body weight also attached to level 2 um i just kind of wanted to put some numbers behind it so that way you can see what those numbers look like here i use a person i'm 190 pounds um i went away from the 200 pounds because i just kind of said that but here visually i want to break down someone's mastering their macro account on and they weigh 190 pounds in the chat um if you would like for me to do this for your body weight but we'll do it in secrecy um you can email me and i'll drop that information in the chat and i'll send you your own macro account so that way you don't have to do the numbers yourself right so again protein 190 pounds that means you need to take in 190 grams every day of the program every day because again protein that's going to rebuild your muscles and your muscle tissue so you need your protein again that's just the soft science of white protein is very very important um you want to start off with your protein taking that early in the morning um protein is thermogenic i just received this information this morning um as my girlfriend saw me preparing for it for today's um workshop she drops a little bit more information on me and i'm always blessed because she always comes with a wealth of information but she was telling me that what protein is is thermogenic right what does that mean it's going to help us speed up our metabolism and if you want to speed up your metabolism by 20 right by taking in your protein you want to take it first thing in the morning if you can get to the point where you wake up and your first nutritional intake is protein within the first 30 minutes you're going to speed up your metabolism by 20 again we're just talking soft science um but i always want to put the why behind the what so again if you're really trying to reduce weight or just maintain weight and you want to learn how to speed up your metabolism and again this is based off science just know in taking a protein within the first 30 minutes of your day right that's going to help you speed up your metabolism by 20 20 that's that's big specifically if you get 190 grams of it if you're at 190 pounds you're at 150 pounds you get 150 pounders 50 grams of protein to intake so why not get a jump start your carb count so this is according to our eight week schedule um we have the carbs which is one gram for the first two weeks then it reduces to 80 of your body weight so weeks three and four you would only take 80 of your your body weight in grams of protein um the next two weeks you would take in 70 and then the last two weeks which would be week seven and eight you would take in 60 of your carbs never drop below 60 of your carb intake on a daily basis because again carbon is going to give you that energy that fuel that your body needs so again in terms of numbers week one to two you want to take in 190 grams of carbs week three and four 152 grams week five and six 133 grams and then seven and eight 113 grams and again if you send me your email i'll calculate all of this for you if you send me your information in chat all i need to know is how many pounds of body weight do you have your fats you get 57 grams of every day of the program but you kind of want to stick to eating the healthy fats and again this is based off someone that's 190 pounds but you get 57 grams of fats every day of the program you don't have to reduce that you don't have to reduce your fat intake um if you learn how to master your macro count and that's why mastering your macro count becomes a little bit easy um because you start to figure out you don't have to cut out everything right allow yourself to eat whatever you would like to eat just know how to put it on the macro scale and then progressively get to where you're only having that amount of grams per day and you'll be followed workout program um again i kind of based this off of me but again this is just some of the soft science i do three days on one day off that one day off is vital it just allows me to recharge um just unplug get away from working out um because when i am to three days on i am on um so attached to level two as you're mastering your macro account and reducing your carbs weeks one to two 45 minutes of cardio consecutive that can be a brisk walk that can you be bike riding um walking upstairs doing heel sprints whatever your level of athleticism is whatever level of your physical activity the first two weeks 45 minutes of cardio there are some cardio that you can do while sitting down you can do dumbbells um you can do a lot of other things by just sitting down um and again send me an email if you need more information on how to sit down and continue to do exercise to be physically active um i'm gonna drop my email in the chat so i can help you out again first two weeks just get to a point where three days consecutive you're doing 45 minutes of cardio then one day off week three to four um you want to step it up just a little bit you want to stick with that 45 minutes of cardio because again i try to promote mastery so giving yourself four weeks to stay on that 45 minutes of cardio but now you want to add in weight lifting the weight lifting is going to be important because weight lifting does start to chisel your body and it does help reduce calories for sure some of the weightlifting um you can think about doing and some of these things are cardio as well um body squats try to get to 500 of them um bulgarian split squats those are really good 100 each leg um or forward and reverse lunges 50 steps each leg in each direction forward and reverse lunges and again these are all things that you don't need any weights for um so that's why i kind of scripted this one first push-ups 300 you can do that throughout the day i know a friend what he tries to do he just try to do 20 per hour right um so he's up at seven o'clock he goes to bed about eight o'clock um so that's not bad if you're trying to just get started um planks try to build up to total of three minutes just doing your planks and again you don't need weights um you don't need uh a gym membership to do any of these body squats that's this you standing there sitting down in the squat position standing back up you definitely want to try to keep your back as straight as possible as you're doing your body squats if you need help um you can get yourself against the wall um in basketball we used to call it wall squats that was a punishment usually by the basketball coach but it promoted healthy development of our quads um so body squats is all you really need don't think because you're sitting there body squatting without any any weights that it's not a good workout um again some basketball coaches usually use that just as a form of punishment so you know it's definitely a good workout bulgarian split squats um if you need to youtube it get a video um so that way you can see what that looks like but those are very very beneficial um 100 each leg forward and reverse lunges 50 steps each leg each direction um push-ups planks if you can't fully do a push-up just try to sit in the plank position right um that's the that's the progression of being able to do a push-up is just being able to get into a plank position that's why i kind of try to match those up push-ups planks because you can use the planks to progressively get to a push-up week 5-6 60 minutes of cardio so you want to bump that cardio up by 15 minutes from doing your 45 minutes um and then add on the same weightlifting that you were doing um on the week three to four so in this phase you just stepping up your cardio 15 minutes the last two weeks 60 minutes of cardio fame weightlifting plus adding on 500 jump ropes um my soft science for jump ropes is always try to give uh kids that i talk to and ask that i talk to a visual i always say probably the most violent sport that we have is a box with boxing um and often times we see them in the gym they're doing a jump rope boxers don't lift a lot of weights um because again in order to be strong you want to get strong through the hips so that's why the diet is important because that's going to reduce the the muscle or the fat around the hip area um so if you just stick to your push your jump ropes that'll slowly start to reduce that for sure um it would definitely if jump rope is probably one of the best ab workouts out there it's definitely a whole body workout but doing 500 jump ropes is beneficial to week 7 and 8. i often try to promote this with women a lot of women when they were little girls they did a lot of jump roping some of them did double dutch bring that jump rope back if you can if you can't do a full jump rope um there are some other things you can do um you can get a little small plyo box or just the side of the curve and you can step on the curve and off the curve and on the curve and off the curve but again your body going up and down um will start to produce sweat um as long as you progressively and consecutively i mean you'll start to shaping up the ab area that's the workout program attached to level two of the nutritional account where you're reducing your carbs for my accolades who really really really want to get into some more in-depth knowledge of the science behind burning your heart rate um here's a heart rate calculator if you only want to burn fat this is the fat burning heart rate at the following heart rate your body will only burn fat let me say that again at the following heart rate your body will only burn fat sometimes i see people in the gym and they are burning muscle right i'm not sure if you necessarily want to do that um if you're in the gym working out so this is how you only burn fat this is the formula basic number 220 minus whatever your age is and that's why i left that blank so whatever 220 minus your age you want to get that number and then times that by 70 that's going to give you your first number and then take that same number 220 minus your age whatever that number is times it by point 80 percent and that's going to give you your window of your heart rate for those of you guys who don't have a watch that can burn your heart rate um and you just want to know if you're doing it as you're exercising these are three points that need to happen to know you're possibly burning fat only you want to be slightly out of breath right you're going to start to notice a thin film of sweat on your back and it's going to be hard to talk without stopping to draw breath that's when you know you're getting into your fat burning heart rate so here are some examples and again if you email me i will run the numbers for you so you don't have to do it yourself at age 30 right your fat burning heart rate is between 133 to 152. so if you get your heart rate in between those numbers at that stage of your cardio you are only burning fat at age 35 your numbers are 129 to 148 at age 40 your numbers are 126 to 144 at age 45 just in my age my fat burning heart rate if i can get my heart rate to 122 to 140 140 i'm only burning fat at that point i'm not burning any muscle i don't want to burn muscle i want to build muscle so that's why your fat burning heart rate is very important if you only want to burn fat while you're doing your your cardio my weight lifters um because again i just wanted to build a program that was progressive um what i like to do i like to talk about lifting for power right power is strength over time what does that look like in the weight room you want to move the bar quickly but still under control with as much weight as possible i love to promote lifting as heavy as possible but you want to lift it by using power if you can't lift it don't lift it right but if you can lift it with power which means you're moving that bar quickly and under control with as much waste as much weight as possible you're going to slowly start to create athletic movements um if you are a parent and you have a kid that is interested in athletics please start teaching them how to live for power because that's what creates athletic movements again i don't want to get into too much depth of what athleticism really defiance of it um but you want to live for power not for strength right at some point you do have to live for strength to create power but as you're focusing yourself in the weight room three out of four of your weight room um days you want to lift more for the power um you want to move that bar quick and you want to lift heavy heavy heavy as you can um what does that look like um i like to deadlift i like to squat me personally i like the basketball squat i'm not really a deep squatter but deep squatting does burn more calories during your um cardio um bench press pull-ups dips power cleans lat pull-downs you want to do your curls i always like to mess with people when i see them doing curls i tell them that's the smallest muscle in your body so of course they should grow but if you just want to get a quick hitter do some curls small muscle farmers walk um a lot of us we've been doing farmers walks our whole life when you had to go to that car and you had to get them groceries out of the car and then groceries had to have within that ralph bag and you tried to carry five six seven men at a time you're doing a farmer's walk um i often promote farmer's walk also because um one of the greatest athletes that's ever walked this planet lebron james that's one of his favorite exercises he loves to do the farmer's walk um a thousand jump ropes if you can it just kind of helps you stay fluid and flexible um again this is it for my weight lifters and my my original program level two i talked about 500 jump ropes for my weight lifters if you really really really want to get to the point where you're becoming more athletic a thousand jump ropes if you would just jump rope a thousand times five days a week you would get way quicker faster stronger and your core area hips through your belly button would develop um a lot a lot of muscle mass so again as a parent and you have a little five-year-old at the house and he looks like he wants to be a basketball player football player or she wants to be a cheerleader start her off jumping rope just get her to about 300 to 500 a day and you will start to slowly see her athleticism improve dramatically at the end compound movements are very beneficial um compound movements are some of the things that i highlighted squats your bench press your power cleans um some people say well why compound movements right you're going to burn more calories you're going to improve your intra muscular coordination that means your muscle groups are going to be working together a little bit quicker um and more under control elevating your heart rate we already talked about if you can get your heart rate to a certain stage um your body's only going to burn fat so that's why you want to do compound movements um it's going to improve your flexibility um it's going to improve your strength dramatically and you're going to gain way more muscle mass so that's why compound movements are very important a lot of people like to do stuff in isolation and that's fine for your muscle group development but if you want to see more gains if you have limited time to be able to work out you want to do compound movements because you don't have to do as many of them level three plant-based again i have progressively got into a plant-based diet i would like to say i've been doing it pretty much 80 percent of my day since march 3rd i started off very slow for a month i just um just tried to get more specific about taking in my vegan protein um my vegan protein i get it from a website called the protein works it's based in australia um but it's it's a vegan protein that tastes really well doesn't have an aftertaste and just kind of helped me get into eliminating the animal protein out of my diet so instead of trying to take in my 200 grams of protein through eating chicken breasts salmon um eggs i slowly started to move into the protein shake taking that more on a daily basis so i can get my protein intake through that um and then i just gradually started getting to the point where i was only eating animal protein at night for dinner um and i was just kind of just so i could have something big as i went to bed um and just kind of reduced the anxiety and my anxiousness of not having the animal protein in my body or just in my diet because a lot of your diet is just what we think our body needs but it's not actually what our body actually does need um so what i did i just progressively reduced my animal protein and again why the soft science i wanted to reduce my heme iron right and again what hemi iron does is it collapses the epithelial tissue which again is going to restrict your blood flow here's some numbers um it reduces cancer and type 2 diabetes by 500 by getting away from animal protein i'm gonna repeat that it's gonna reduce cancer and type two diabetes by 500 those are some incredible numbers that struck me specifically because my dad did passive cancer right so i always thought man genetically that means i'm predisposed to probably getting cancer right but again a lot of these things are not genetically passed on it's not in our dna if our diet that's part of our dna that's causing these things to happen to us some number another soft number for you within three weeks you can reduce inflammation by 20 percent just within three weeks you can reduce inflammation by 20 percent a lot of us might have inflammation in various areas that doesn't get a lot of blood flow um so going to more of a plant-based diet would be very very beneficial for you um for me i get a lot of inflammation in my elbows and that's just a place where you don't get a lot of blood flow through your elbows right why because your elbow is usually hanging below your heart right and the key to getting blood flow is elevating that body part above your heart and i'm gonna get into that too as we talk about recovery but my elbows have started to reduce this inflammation um i can't say 20 percent but there is a definite reduction in my elbows a lot of us have inflammation in our ankles which isn't going to get a lot of blood flow or in our hip area um and so in order for me to just trust why going plant-based um it's going to reduce your inflammation by 20 percent some people say well if you want plant-based how are you getting your protein in so again my protein how i'm getting it i use my vegan protein powder i get it from a website called the protein works um it doesn't have an aftertaste they have many flavors i stick to the to the vanilla um but it's it's a very flavorful taste i use it with almond milk i moved away from drinking the vitamin d um milk and then a two percent milk i slowly got into drinking almond milk um and so i mix my almond milk with my vegan protein powder and that's usually how i get probably about 60 70 of my protein intake for the day i eat plant-based yogurt um the first time i had it i didn't like it it tastes grainy um for the second day i was able to add some blueberries and strawberries into that plant plant-based yogurt um and it still didn't taste all that well um but i like the fruit so i just ate it i just finished it by the third day my palate my tasting patterns um was able to absorb the plant-based yogurt and at that point it was just weird like i didn't even really need the fruit anymore but i kept the fruit in it and i still keep the fruit in it but i can now eat plant-based yogurt um and my palate my taste it it does it's not thrown up throat thrown off um dramatically um ezekiel bread um as a great bread to eat as we want to absorb our protein i'm a very healthy um again it's plant-based um evictio bread on the packaging i think that i forget the verse but it's pretty much considered god's bread um almond butter um i moved away from peanut butter to almond butter um i eat a lot of black and pinto beans when i go to chipotle they usually kind of look at me funny when they ask me what do i want and i say white rice and they say where's your beans i say both um because i do like pinto beans um but i've slowly learned to eat black beans why black beans black beans have the most protein in them sofritas um again when i go to chipotle um i don't get the chicken anymore i don't get the carne soda anymore i get to se free this bowl um so again that's how i get a lot of my intake of protein and through my protein powder and the sulfurites that i eat um lately we've been using soy riso you can get that at ralph's um to me it tastes like souffles but i haven't done the research to say it is sofritas um but if it's a good quality meat um that's vegan that i like um actually last night we had some so these still tacos um just with some some white rice and some guacamole and i'm telling you it was quite delicious tofu i don't eat tofu but that is a protein intake you can get if you're um on a plant-based diet tempeh i don't eat tempeh as well but it is a a really good source of protein and it's a very lean protein that your body can then take if you're looking at going plant-based edamame beans lentils satan chickpeas i like protein pancakes green peas spirulina spinach quinoa soy milk oatmeal wild rice nuts broccoli asparagus sweet potatoes brussels sprouts i just want to give people a list of things you can take to get protein as you're trying to get to your protein count if you go away from the animal protein quickly i just want to talk about recovery um the phases of recovery first one is you got to get that that sleep sleep is the main recovery that we can get that's why we should be doing it at least six to eight hours on a daily basis maximum if you get eight hours of sleep um your body's gonna naturally recover stretch because it's gonna keep your muscles muscle groups really flexible um that's a very important um way to recover it's a healthy way to recover you don't need any money to stretch you don't need any money to sleep um those are two things you should definitely definitely try to start your day off by doing um coming off a good great sleep getting a nice stretch rest um as i'm working out i always rest days in between muscle groups um for my bench press on monday i'm not going to bench press again until wednesday most likely for me my best day is gonna be if i bench press monday thursday if i go ahead and get my full two days in between the same muscle group and do the same exercise um what recovery does um if you want to use some items listed below is you want to create blood flow to the sore area we talked earlier about why we have sticking points in our bodies such as our ankles our hips um and our elbows because they're all been underneath our heart um the first part of recovery is you just want to get whatever that muscle group that is sore above your heart so if you just slowly elevate that muscle group over your heart right that's going to slowly get blood to drip down we are all alive because our blood is flowing so that's another key piece of recovery you see some people using a foam roller um some people get massages some people do the massage gun um one of my favorites is the tens unit um it's a very inexpensive item you can get it from like cvs it's like at like 60 bucks you can pay 100 bucks for it for a bigger more expensive one but you can just get a basic tens unit for like 60 bucks um it's gonna create blood flow right to that area um normatech boots um recently um we have got purchased the normatec boots my daughters who run track they've been using normatec boots for like the last five years it's just a suction massage um but it's going to create blood flow in that area that is if the suction is on um you can do cupping some people think cup cupping hurts um for me when i got cupping it didn't hurt cupping the benefits of cupping is going to start to slowly bring those toxins those bad toxins up to the blood and release it out if you want to do the ice heat ice cycle um always end on ice so that's why i bolted ice because sometimes you can just ice right but as long as you end on ice not on heat as long as you end on ice you're going to create blood flow um and reduce the inflammation and whatever that body part is but if you want to maximize it you want to put that body that body part over your heart um some people do ice baths some people do cryotherapy crowd therapy is just nothing but an ice bath without having to feel the wetness of the ice um but those things are going to create blood flow um and it's key parts to recovery before working out right have your carb intake right because if you just need energy which is part of recovery that's why you want a recovery to create energy um just have carbon intake before you work out or black coffee remember black coffee only has five um calories in it it's usually the stuff we add to our coffee that's going to create the calories so black coffee is not bad and it could definitely be a pre-workout after workout if you can try to take your protein within 30 minutes why because during that 30 minutes you've taken in your protein after your workout is going to be absorbed by the fresh blood cells and those fresh blood cells will travel to your muscle groups that are being repaired liquid protein gets you the bloodstream quicker than food so if you can try to have liquid protein but if you need to eat a meal like chicken breast um or salmon or eggs try to do it 30 minutes after your workout because those are gonna do that that um those grams of protein are going to go to your fresh blood cells which again travel into your muscle groups that are being repaired um again my name is larry reid i'm gonna drop my email in the chat if you have questions we're gonna be around for 20 minutes to answer some of those questions but again i just wanted to give you guys just a little bit of the soft science behind creating a nutrition plan that's more valuable for you i'm not about me um so again that's why the presentation we start off saying master your nutrition right yours is based off your body weight again thank you for taking the time really appreciate it come on let's give both our speakers a round of applause go ahead and clap your hands go ahead and and just be appreciative of the wisdom and the knowledge uh the scripture says and all that i didn't get an understanding and so we just praise god for sending these two wonderful vessels here to pour into us uh now we're going to play this unmuting thing and i'm not going to unmute everybody because that's just opens up the door for mass chaos and so if you have a question would you just unmute yourself and ask either sister fania and brother reed the question and then if you don't mind i want to um at the conclusion of that i want to pray us out that god may continue to cover us and then uh we'll be free to go on this day so let's spend like 15 minutes or so asking any questions that you may have for either sister fania or brother reed if you would unmute yourself we would all be able to hear hi i have a question hi everyone good morning good morning i have a question for uh brother larry and sister uh for fania for my my sister all right well um but larry um good great job to both of you guys this was very uh informative um i wanted to ask you larry because you mentioned a lot about workouts and things like that um i've recently been in the accident so i got to be careful with my um my workouts right now it's all about stretching and yoga i wanted to know your thoughts anthony is too if you are if you have uh experience with the exercise ball but not just the exercise ball but the desk like it's like uh you use it to work like at your workstation but you can also use it to work out supposed to help with your power correct that's what i was gonna say i don't have much um knowledge of it um i i do have the the the big um round ball that i often use um just by sitting on it sometimes that's going to develop um your muscle your core strength um because it has no balance to it um so just stuff like that sticking to your yoga um yoga definitely of the strengthening activity um yeah just sitting down i will just stick with those but they definitely work because it's going to create core stability thank i had a you question about you mentioned corn i don't know if i missed broccoli i heard recently broccoli's not like it's like a hybrid or it's not a real vegetable or so i don't know i heard it somewhere and um i wanted to ask you about broccoli and avocado well avocado is still a good fat um wasn't sure what your question was about avocado just make sure you're limited porsche portions uh so i love avocado but i know it's good for you but it's too much yes i would say again you can i like to do a quarter uh a quarter of a cup per serving if i'm going to eat it maybe like twice a day so i would say a half of avocado maybe or if you do a whole one you're going to make sure you're balancing out with your exercise if you want to get into the nitty gritty we can use the formulas that that larry shared to get your macros of how much fat you can have so that way we can see if you want to use all of your fat grams on avocado then then that's you won't have room for anything else so we can we can work offline to get your your your number so we can understand how much you can have in your intake and yes you are correct as far as the broccoli being a hybrid so again you can just make your choice of what you want to eat of um of vegetables you know a lot of people still like to eat broccoli but yes it is as a hybrid of the um i'd have to get those get the exact things they're hybrid of but there are other options out there so just that has that's definitely true thank you i have a quick question uh for you guys both so i know that a lot of the things that you guys covered was kind of about like losing healthy weight but what tips do you guys have for gaining i'm trying to kind of gain like more muscle weight and just like healthier weight all around so any tips for gaining any weight for sure um that's the stage i'm in um usually if i'm not lifting weights um i am naturally anywhere between 182 and 186 um and i'm six foot five so um i just have a natural slim build currently i'm at 202 because i do do exercises um that build up muscle mass so i'm not sure what type of equipment you have access to um but if you have access to a weight room you definitely want to do compound movements um dips pull-ups um squats dead lifts stuff like that will build muscle mass um and hit multiple areas in terms of muscle groupings um so just do some research on compound muscle movement if you don't have access to a weight room push-ups planks sit-ups um those will all start to develop muscle and so what what i tell the athletes that i work with again the people that are on tv they're strong from the naval to the hip area um and push-ups dips um planks all strengthen those areas so it could either start to shred but it also as it's shredding is building muscle muscle around it if that makes sense i think everything he said is is perfect i would just add to make sure you have enough you are eating enough protein i think as women we don't eat enough protein so just being very adamant on you know you know your chicken waffles but make sure you add on some more chicken sounds good i have a question um it's trey shawn hall baker uh my question is first thank you for promoting jump roping that is like the new black i love it love it love it and then if you don't have a jump rope um jumping jacks are also good my question is about intermittent fasting i heard you both say you should eat right away in the morning and i'm just hoping i'm not damaging anything because i do intermittent fasting and i do make sure i have a 12 to 14 hour gap between dinner and breakfast and i get up really early in the morning at about 4 45 to be at work by 6. so um am i am i doing damage because i'm not eating within an hour from waking up i'm just curious that's my first question and either of you could answer and then the second question is also i live by squats but i'm noticing that my butt is getting really big um much bigger than i wanted to get how do you get around that and still get the benefits of squatting thank you i'm trishan hall baker and i'm done speaking so um unfortunately yes the squads are going to build up that muscle group um so i'm not sure how you'll be able to get away from that um maybe reduce the pounds that you're squatting um or try to do them a little bit quicker so your squats turn into more of a cardio in terms of the intermittent fasting um i kind of went through that stage as well um i'm in i'm i'm an administrator at my um day-to-day job so just and this wasn't in a healthy format but i would go to where maybe i might have some yogurt in the morning for breakfast because i was trying to get to work early um and then i wouldn't have another meal um until maybe like three o'clock and i was again waking up after about six to eight hours of sleep so i was just doing intermittent fasting without trying to do intermittent fasting and i know you said you do about 12 to 14 hours but intermittent fasting just kind of goes in favors but i think that just kind of naturally kept me slim but i wasn't building any muscle because i wasn't getting my enough protein or usually i was binging a one big old meal um and that one big old meal your body cells at some point has to absorb all of these things that they need to intake um so it just made them bigger and bigger and bigger so i was producing more fat as opposed to muscle mass um thank you brother larry if i could add trey shawn um with the squats like he said they're going to build that but maybe you can aside from just the how quick you're doing your squats maybe look at your feet placement as well um how how their place could put a different area of of your butt um change the focus a little bit so maybe we can look at that and with with the intermittent fasting that's something i saw that both you and sharon asked so we'll definitely look into that but i don't i don't see it as being damaging but if you don't currently have the results that you want maybe it's it's worth looking into sometimes i don't eat right away and i do a fasted workout but i at least drink my water right away to get my body at least going and something in there and then i might do a workout and then eat so that's the only time that skip um eating as soon as i wake up you know thank you for that just it out one more thing you're right i do drink almost half a gallon before i eat anything so that is the first thing that i do when i get up as soon as i get up i get a you know my first um ounces of water um but going back to uh mr larry um the 12 to 14 hours are only between dinner and breakfast and then it's it may be two hours at least two hours in between for the rest of the day so i just wanted to clarify that and thank you both i i appreciate um this was great no for sure and again if you're using your intermittent fasting to control your um caloric intake on a daily basis then it's basically it's working for you so i would definitely stick to it we'll take about like for like five eight more minutes uh any questions i have a question what about keto i'm trying keto you guys have an opinion on keto no i i i prefer a more balanced uh approach i i haven't tried keto i've noted some people who who have done keto but i think the biggest thing for me is just really being able to sustain something for a long period of time so if you want to sustain that and continue with such restrictions then that could work um but i think at the end of the day you want to pick something that you'll be able to sustain and maintain and still um i i personally wouldn't i don't like as many restrictions because i don't feel great and i feel like it's more of a chore and i haven't really met a lot of people on keto who are happy while going through the process but you know if you are enjoying it and brings you joy then you know i would do it but um i think it's i personally a more balanced approach i have a question this is deborah russell can you hear me you can okay great um my concern is i well i thank you both is very been very informative and i really thank you uh i'd like to know about you said you need rest uh sleep i don't get eight hours asleep i don't get a good six hour sleep i was wondering if you had some tips on how i can get more rest or you know what i can do as far as getting some real good sleep uh i would say probably about four months ago i was i was i was only getting about three to four hours of sleep yeah um per day so i started off by using melatonin um and and that worked a little bit um but it just wasn't it wasn't getting me to the six or eight hours of sleep that i really really needed um so lately what i do try to do is i try to have like a heavy meal before i go to bed um and and to be honest i just have learned to reduce my anxiety and anxiousness a little bit in the morning um so when i first wake up around 4 a.m i usually just get up but now i just try to have control um my urges to get up and i just stay laying in the bed um and i and usually within about 25 to 30 more minutes um i am able to fall back to sleep so i just had for me i had to just conquer a little bit of my anxiety and my anxiousness about not just wanting to be the first person up um or just waking up opening my eyes and just trying to get up get up out of bed so that was some strategies that work for me um i do try to um give myself um the benefit of a doubt if i only sleep four hours i will try to just catch a nap later on during the day um but that rest cycle was important and like um sister fenia talked about earlier if you can get to that rem sleep that that's even more essential love too okay i even tried a sleep class and it just didn't work so i'm looking for ways and i did do the melatonin as well it does not help me well i think you should maybe think about all the things you do in the day maybe keep a diary keep a journal of what you're eating so it might be a food that you're eating that's giving you extra energy kind of what you're feeling as well like as your mind just racing did you exercise in the day was it someone you talk to like just really pay attention to what you do all day and can you adjust anything in your daily schedule to get your body on another track because right now your body is used to what it's doing if it's used to not sleeping it's going to keep not sleeping unless you do something deliberate to change that pattern so i think it's first understanding what's happening to see what you can tweak daily and to try something different thank you thank you and sister russell put on the bible app right before you go to bed okay sounds good okay okay with jesus on your mind amen amen all right i wake up when i wake up with him on my mind six a.m that's it all right uh mr reed i just like to say to you you guys you and pania did a fantastic job and i was wondering how could my friend and another man be named the same larry reed and you explained it and you explained it i was a very good friend of your father who passed the way of cancer who belonged to jackie robinson american legion and was the best dancer i know we were partners for years so um just want you to know i had a good job i'm very bad at dieting dieting is something i'm i'm not very good at doing but i really know i need to do it and exercise to stop shaking your head your name uh and i know i need to do it so i'm so glad that you guys had this format and possibly this can lead me into a better lifestyle so thank you so much no thank thank you um and just do everything in progressions just start slow um again try try to start what you can maintain um so just start off slow to go fast at some point but definitely start off slow and just use progressions and when you're not able to do um your goal for the day don't don't don't get down on yourself just just know that you have another day um to get back to it thank you agree and then uh joyce i would just say yes make sure you give yourself grace you know where no one is perfect and no day is perfect so some days you might want to have an extra treat or eat a whole pizza or or you know some days some days you don't so just know that i don't i don't look at it as a diet i look at it as a way of life slight changes to just keep keep doing it's a lifestyle it's not a it's not a diet because if you do a diet then you stop you go right back so something that you can maintain and enjoy so it's just finding ways to um to to change your lifestyle slowly but make it work for you thank you hi this is oh doctor just want to know what is uh bcaa to put it in the water yeah so is it is your branch chain amino acids again i use it more for flavor where do you get it from um i get it off amazon um the brand i use is called extend extnd okay um also you know i i do i do um have bcaas on some on my website i do sell herbalife and i use bcaas from there and i use aloe in my water um for my digestion i didn't get to all those details but if you want to okay from me so i'd be happy to review those with you if anyone has any questions about that as well um but you're welcome to buy them anywhere you please oh okay send me a bottle trying to lose weight it's been over a year that i have not been eating what i want to i have been cooking like i want to i've been trying to eat healthy more vegetables my question is since i'm older it's taking forever anthony i'd like to know how when you say stay motivated stay positive it's hard staying positive when you are walking in place and and walking and doing what i'm supposed to do and i know women lose slower than men and i know um age has something to do with it but my because my knees aren't good and i can't do squats and i can't do lunges i don't i'm having a difficult time staying motivated it's almost like well why don't if i'm only going to lose two and a half pounds in the whole month of why don't i just eat and just say okay this is what i'm supposed to look like i understand i i mean i understand and i think it's really having us having a sounding board so you know you i don't know who you're comfortable with but say you're comfortable talking to me you could call me and say you know this is how i feel today and we could we could kind of review the week and what was it that you did and find your wins i think really finding the small wins that might not be on the scale it might be wow i ate clean all week and did you did you feel how was your energy was your energy increase like look find the increases because they are somewhere you know oh well i motivated my my family to to eat better so that's a win so think all those small things add up and yes it's going to take time but there might be other things like you said if your knee is hurt you can't um exercise hard that you're going to hurt yourself so just find the things that are working to help motivate you and don't tie everything to weight because if you're so focused on the scale it's not going to move either because that's another stressor that you're putting on yourself and your body's going to hold on to that weight um and so you saying that you know you're not eating the things so it's like as you're eating you're mad at it so it should still be an enjoyable process so let's figure out how we can take away some of that feeling that this is not a good thing i don't want to eat this let's make it more more enjoyable so maybe we can maybe we can talk and tweak something so that way you're having a great time okay thank you so much you're welcome real quick real quick are there any more questions real quick um if not i had one question pastor okay um first i just wanted to say i don't know funny if you were on your um on the herbalife mission yet but just in adoration of you you guys she is an excellent person to talk to um she has helped me understand what i needed to do to get my metabolism going because it is a problem of mine i've been obese my entire adult life um but in knowing what you need to do for your body because growing up we didn't learn like you taught us mr reed about our body where diabetes is not hereditary it's the processes and the ways that we've ate in family functions that have encouraged us to continue that diabetic life but pania has taught me i now carry almonds with me i carry um a lunch with me where i was eating only one time a day i completely took everything out of my drink life than water my question about um metabolism how am i or what should i be eating more so to encourage my body to eat up the fat that i'm eating and not hold on to the fact that i'm storing i guess it's where i was actually going with it and joyce i wasn't shaking my head at you i was in that's me thank you both and i'm gonna be off uh i i would say just start with with with the balance you you know the protein right away you know your meal i know you and i speak often about it but waking up and having that balanced meal i think just starting with having your proteins carbs and and fats is really making sure every meal is balanced and i think it will it will it will happen and um just just try be consistent um as consistent as you can be for as long as you can be to really make that change it's going to be a process but i i would just say stick with with the the balanced portions and and you will you will get there um so i think we'd have to talk about um what what's actually happening but i would i would just say stay consistent with the proteins no and i agree great point to stick with your proteins um normalized um eating eating from your three categories your protein fats and carbs and try to get the healthier versions of those if you can into you um and just stay on your journey and stay consistent and persistent one more question anyone have pastor this is david i wanted to know if it was possible i can uh make a comment um fania uh thank you for your challenge because i've accepted the challenge and um i gotta admit um the one thing that i was hiding from was accountability and with me doing the challenge um and having fania as an accountability partner she does tell me the truth um in love even though i didn't want to hear a lot of the stuff but the nutrition is the one that stepped up my metabolism so i've already seen like immediate changes within the seven days no the eight days that i've been doing it um and i have the evidence to show it later down the line so thank you for this forum um i have a lot of energy as you can see i'm already outside that's the background noise you hear me walking as i'm watching it so that's become a lifestyle so just thank you cedar david pastor dimiko and the forum for allowing us to learn it and now we just have to apply it so thanks again thank you any other questions no well let's give our um let's give our two panelists of sister fania and brother larry just a hand clap of of kudos and accommodations and appreciation i am so gifted and blessed i feel that god has sent uh these type of individuals who love god and then have love for people and so we praise god for bringing these vessels to us that we might benefit from and and share with and so i praise god i want you to write and i want you to meditate on this journey psalm 118 verse psalm 118 verse 17 and the psalmist declared that i shall live and not die and declare the wondrous works of god and notice the scripture says i shall live i shall live and not die i shall live i shall live on this side and not just exist it does not say i should exist i shall live and so my hope and my prayer is that you got information that would allow for you to make better choices that you might live shame on us if we leave this life and it's only said that we existed when the goal should be that we lived jesus hung on a cross that we might live and so i i salute and ask you to write that down as you hold yourself accountable with the information that you have received i want to use this time also to announce to you that our next conversation at the city will be april 17th if you recall we brought dr tama in february and the discussion was so rich that we thought it'd be prudent that we bring her back that she might feed into us about our mental our mental health is just as is is as it works in concert with our physical health and how we might relate one with another and so if you would mark your calendars on april 17 from 10 30 to 12 we'll have our next conversation at the city let's pray out amen if you don't mind and i pray that you have a wonderful day and once again i thank you sister for me and brother larry for how you are poured out and we will be sending tangible expressions uh for the time that you have committed to us both of them shared their contact information i pray that you uh have their contact information and you wrote it down that you may speak with them offline in order for offline conversations let us pray merciful god we thank you for this day we feel truly god that this is the day that you have made and we will rejoice and be glad in it it's a day unlike any that we have ever seen or ever will see and so god i pray that you help us to maximize this moment god created all of us a clean heart and renew a right spirit god i pray and i believe by faith that the steps of the righteous are ordered by you and so we're not going to lean on our own understanding god in all our ways we will acknowledge you and believe god that you will direct our path thank you for these two individuals god that have poured out unto us you have used them in a mighty way god and they have served you and served your people god and so i pray right now god that you would return back to them a double portion of that which they have poured out meet every need in their lives god bless them abundantly all that they set their hands to and god i ask as we leave this call that you would convict us that we make better choices god that we understand life is about choices you gave us free will god and so we ask that you make we make better choices related to our diet make better choices god related to our health god god i pray right now that you would convict our hearts to give us the discipline to to see any progress as progress and that we put one good moment on top of another good moment and soon god we shall build a monument that you would find glory i pray right now god that you have your angels to attend to every one of our needs be a hedge fund to protection all around us thank you for every participant thank you for the families and the dreams that are connected to them bless both abundantly and we will give you and you along god all the glory all the honor and all the praise we love you god and adore you in jesus name amen amen thank you much have a wonderful day and i pray god's blessings upon your lives not only this day but in this season", "47KbNA-vHY4": "yoanne wanted to be sick if we could just get all this candy inside of our house so we don't come here every day yeah but who would do that I mean I'll do it really yeah doing right now let's do it what it's doing right now right now I have a question is it possible for me to purchase one of every box that you guys have did you guys have like a stock of that all right well it looks like we got to find another store that can supply all of this candy I'm thinking somewhere like a wholesale place maybe like Sam's Club or Costco one of them will have it so of course if I'm gonna purchase all this candy I need to make sure first that there is an area in my house where we can do this and I had to buy shelving for it we went to multiple stores and there was no stores that actually had the shelves that we needed so I had to purchase the shelves online and wait a couple of days so you made it over here to Sam's Club let's see if they got what we need we found the aisle and let's get stacking I'm going to be getting one box of every single thing here regardless if I like it or not it doesn't matter geez dark chocolate cookies and cream are they just like all open well this one's taped that thing no they're literally all open it doesn't even matter at this point [Music] what if it's too much so as you guys can see this is what we have so far but there's a complete whole other aisle let's get it oh that's open baby bottle talks Baby Bottle Pops lollipops I was a tongue-twister by the way we're just getting all boxes obviously we're not gonna get stuff that's wrapped in plastic short people Wow only had two tall people here to get something for you this is sick dude this is literally like a childhood dream right now every skittle no man may be the best idea you ever had Lyons right yo if anything we're getting more here than we would I want anyone ring pops sour straws airheads extreme brother we need another cart Tootsie Pops and the guy blow pops yeah this is all falling literally have too much no never too much I think he might have gotten one of everything Lance I'm trying to stay away from the gum and stuff cuz I know we're like probably never gonna know and I mean that would be an excessive amount of gamma if I literally got one of every piece of gum I will get one pack of gum though pick one juicy fruit there you go yeah [Music] people are looking at me like I'm crazy like what am I doing with all this candy I'm gonna eat it yeah we got a lot of candy [Music] got it going honestly I'm hoping we can fit all this in my car as you guys can see that back on that car is pretty much completely full we actually did get these boxes where we can store more stuff in there and it'll be a lot easier to bring all the stuff inside so we wrap put the rest in the back of the car and go home [Music] so we just have to shipment in of the wire shelving so now we're gonna put this all together now it's time to add the candy [Music] oh my god this is insane oh I cannot believe I actually did this Wow it really works perfectly [Music] [Music] now know what I saw sans bub you want to know the price of this entire video until the guy saw me why you know how much this cost I seen was wasn't it 500 no it wasn't over $1000 get out of here look bruises doing them had it was more than 500 for just ease candy Bruce is good okay so they can do with us it was a thousand two hundred this everything all together is like almost 2000 I had the bottom of mine we actually went to a lot of different stories that may we couldn't find my for this yeah home people because now I am my very own candy bar we don't even have to go to while I was here so you don't have to my pantry anymore yeah you guys are pretty much gonna raid mine we're going to push the table back over just for the video yeah look how perfect it fits it's grainy two days ago like six months decorating a house I'm trying to be nice and like every situation these boxes in this I guess this is for us in the family eats everything just grab everything that we saw where it's Sam's clothes I think you're nuts is proud of Mike we got a store yeah [Music] the craziest ideas but we did know dad's gonna get it back cuz he's gonna be here every day no he did it's just mom opened that wrong so we turn to the other regulators we the past like 15 20 minutes we just say they're opening up on the boxes Brittany's gonna be Rover all the time you and Dad get candy and on guitar all right well thank you for coming like okay there's probably some people out there that do but like this much it's crazy and I don't know what any of it I just my OCD is kicking in because this is the only box not open yeah honestly and we're just talking we're sitting here looking at this we realized that there's a lot of candies in here that we've never even tried in our lives so I'll possibly end up recording that on the vlog of course if you guys are not yet subscribed hit that subscribe button I'm also throwing up the thumbs up symbol so you guys can hit that thumbs up button too hey maybe if you hit the thumbs up button you can get a piece of candy that's a little weird it's like feeding kids okay but yeah there's some candies on here I literally just want to bring kids here and be like look at this alright guys that is gonna do it for today's video I want you guys to leave a comment down below of some

rules my channel welcome back guys to another video i'm james and take her okay this is a candy review guys i'm gonna start a new series candy review this is not some childish thing it's popular this is nerd rope guys you're going to find this crazy but i've never had nervous no you don't need to have you already had your nervous mind it's nerd rub guys i've never had this i mean i just had it earlier but it's really hard i think the thing is near rope is that it starts off kind of weird you know but as you chew it it's also very dense yeah it gets better and because that was happening the first time i did it i was like i don't know about this and then they just kind of hit me like wow this is amazing so apparently it's like a thing to eat a lot of nerd rope we only have about a foot of nerve rope but like each of us it comes in these i'd say this is not but yeah this is a foot in their rope i don't have to guess it's fine um but yeah nerd rope um apparently dude's perfect to see like 45 yards of your yards of nerd rope which is bigger than your intestines um so anyway i'll see you guys next time candy review i give it overall a what 4.5 so because it's the i think the thing is missing is is the first bite it's kind of weird like it almost makes your mouth feel weird i think yeah i feel like if they engineered it so it wouldn't hurt your like make your mouth feel weird i mean it might just be me and anna but to me that's probably what got it at 4.5 but anyway guys we'll see you in the next one peace out", "qcIKxLb2a4I": "(groans loudly) - So good, oh my gosh, it's so

All right, peace!", "d5NhAWpgo5M": "so what happens when you take a prey to the next level and make it 100 layers well these pranks turn into my most extreme yet I know you've had a really stressful day I know what's about to happen what are you doing there's a been a huge update on Call of Duty ID so I really want to show you it and I think because of this update I can finally beat you something bad is about to happen what is that why a present to play Call of Duty this is not a present I know there's something up with this here we can just sit down and play call of duty first you don't know what is this you don't need to look at your present yet I found a partner in crime for my prank Eloise is always being pranked by Preston so it's time to get him back okay always it's time there it is Oh oh she's going for it she's going she's going she's going and she's gone she's gone that's the only partner in crime I have looks like you're gonna have to do it on your own breathe Oh it's wireless that makes it simple now it's time to put this in a box and then wrap it and then put it in another box and then wrap it and then put it in another box and wrap it a hundred years later put it in another box and wrap it put another box and wrap it and another box and wrap it what am I get carpal tunnel you might cuz we have to do this a hundred times this is not how you wrap something a hundred times I'm trying hence I'm trying to show off my royally b.com merch you know in a handstand version I'm very dizzy we even have accessories I was trying to do a cool fashion pose upside down yeah fine let's get into the prank okay I have to admit something to you what is I don't often fold boxes so this crate may take long we anticipated you know what it would be a lot easier to be a man for this prank because having long nails and using a lot of tape is not easy for you gentlemen out there this is not gonna hold and this is the smallest box I might need some duct I'm that's not a duck it's a pig should I be gentle with that no I don't see any reason to yeah that's good okay let's get whoa I am The Box ready and I have initiated it we are going to start with the cactus paper because it is my favorite succulent so we are going to start on the first layer and after every 20 layers we are going to put another box on there but uh here's the thing buddy I'm actually legit or perfectionist with graphic process this is already starting off rough this first layer is looking a little bad so this paper is not good and then you clip it like this and then you trim these scissors are terrible for this experience I hope you're enjoying my rapping lessons guys this is gonna be a long one so I look under this video if that's subscription by this red can you make it great because literally I'm sweating and this is box number one wait I think I should just plate nope just play cod first no I'm on no I'm unwrapping that you should play cod I don't want to play cause they're smirking behind the camera Breanna is smiling and it's it's making me really uncomfortable you're making me uncomfortable yeah yeah you will hurt I did a really good job at rapping just making sure there's nothing there's a good something's like hidden why there's so many lectures trust and you're kind of making a mess David there's stuff that he layers in the box I will say he will want whatever is in the box so you'll definitely want to get to the center of that precedent here Anna's not with you right no okay I'm really bored and there's not a lot of stuff to do here besides play with Brianna's car well we're pranking Preston with a hundred layers so we're doing pranks with a hundred layers and then pranking him a hundred layers pranks that's a good idea but you know there's no one pranking Bree no one yet all right hold on I'll show you what I have in mind I show you exactly what I have in mind Maddy so brand and you know what's good about saran wrap you can do a hundred layers in like ten minutes so I feel like I should prank Bree and what better way then saran-wrapping her car yes Maddy that's where I keep all of the saran wrap hidden and Brees car so what exactly is your plan here how do you my plan is to open the door and just get a spot where the sticky rap is gonna stick cuz once the sticky rap sticks then I can just run around it and that's gonna be really easy 100 times done the first layer is pretty much already happening look this is so good okay I did five layers is that enough no no you need a hundred of these you need to keep going 95 times okay you know what that means well what time-lapse what layer are you on 50 but I have a problem what I think I left the rest of the saran wrap in the trunk oh oh here there's a little cross place for you right here just just hop right in there okay oh oh you're actually do you're actually gonna do that Nick well Maddie I need the saran wrap okay and I left in the trunk and I think the Tesla would not mind okay okay now back to the time-lapse I need those geezers you're slaving away on this package you're just bleep [Music] we didn't Andre okay we did it yeah we just have to fold it and it'll be on hundred so now we have a pair right 100 times now we have to go test it out first how much does this weigh guess below I am going to put it on a scale and then I'm gonna drop it off my balcony see if it lasts test number one guess how much you think this is gonna weigh like 20 pounds 20 pounds yeah what if my bed is on five okay let's see bring it weighs so much it broke the scale oh no well then we're ready for test number two test number two it looks fine that means Preston is never getting into this I still have another prank I think that may not be the only trick up my leg I have brought you here for prank number oh so you might want to stand back stay back oh wait I can still hold on to this yeah you you know what Maddie that wasn't exciting enough that's trash Oh I told you I was gonna do something pretty extreme for this prank and we were gonna be filling this entire tub with Diet Coke I don't want to drink ever there's a lot of coke the piece though is this bus the last coke using you studied in France is not a thing the peat though does it son that means more go the Boston Tea Party so I have a master plan once I am sitting in said cook back you will pass me live in toast box bomb this is a box bomb patent coming soon and I am going to lure Preston up this way by telling him I have big lips and then when he gets here I will comes up here I am going to terrify him by ax throwing the Mentos in the tub why did I do this in my bathroom Madi I've got 98 layers on this car and I only have this much left okay so we got to get creative with some of these layers here are you gonna make it I'm gonna go up and over save space 99 okay this is gonna be tight matted there's only enough for 99 in like a half the windows we would a 100 layer challenge the windows though windows will help throw me the thing don't we the thing okay a hundred a hundred layers of saran wrap just like you said well know what Brie's reactions gonna be I think she'll love it nah she's gonna be mad oh he is trying real hard guys dude look I got up at 7 a.m. I went for a run the last thing I want to do is spend 10 years opening this box how many layers does this have it's like an onion there's so many layers if this is the prank I think it is I've done this on my sister before but nowhere near this much okay if there's not something amazing after all of these layers somebody don't die and if the person who has Bree where you going I have to get something on my car no no maybe no I don't think you I'll get it Mady you're acting weird what is that noise what what don't even know how he got in there did you wrap him into the car got in there saran wrap very thin 100 layers barely made a difference but bubble wrap is much thicker we're gonna wrap breeze phone in it because I just so happened to steal it when she wasn't looking and don't tell her okay so let's wrap this in one layer of bubble wrap and see what we have it's not bad one last high-five it's already getting pretty big and it's only 5 layers 20 layers in and we're coming into a little bit of a problem here okay I'm having trouble figuring out when I'm turning the phone over it's just a giant like it's almost like a circle it's just a big ball it's basically turning into this with a phone inside of it from now on the way that I'm gonna be able to tell which side is which is I'm gonna put a dollar on one side and we'll be able to see it through the bubble wrap 21 layers by the way 30 we can no longer see the dollar this is much thicker than the saran wrap and I think it's time for me to make a cut and start rolling it this away I want to be done with this well where are you on this is 90 and it's getting so big like at this point I'm not even certain that the phone is still inside it could be just dip disappeared somewhere 95 this is terrible 96 97 yes I can Maddy 98 99 we're getting closer 100 layers of bubble wrap and cardboard just a little bit that's okay there is a dog pillow there before we give this to Bri I feel like we need to do some research on just how safe this is so naughty follow me Nick Nick out naughty up here see perfectly protected oh yeah but Mandy actually it's almost time for me to pick up my pizza so you're gonna have to be the one to tell Bree about this nope no y'all sorry you have fun oh I missed the but that is so indecent of me I Betty there's like fart spray inside of here I bet there's something disgusting inside dude I think I've gone through like 80 layers I'm not happy I might have a smile on my face but it's permanent I am miserable right now this is what misery looks and sounds like hey looks fine that's hold on this is gonna be the last box yeah come on baby I don't this please tell him this is the last just tell me your hold on I've got this I'm praying to Jesus [Music] yes I'm gonna break the glass behind me I sigh I'm not swear on anything because I'm a good Christian boy there's no way this is the last layer there's no way bodyguard in imagine having to wrap it this is Swiss isn't funny he didn't have to wrap it Matty it's not this guy so 10 years ago [Applause] should I just know okay finally we're down to the last box what is this you put my mouth so something happened [Applause] by the way Nick Nick Nick did this for you not not me really fragile I thought this was my birthday gift is it something bad eloise in here Bri you're making quite a mess someone else did this in it with you oh here you go thank you and it's police appeal unless you did this my phone in here oh so now I have me large box of mid toss it up it's time to get precedent here in house you summon my husband Preston you tell them [Music] that's why he couldn't hear go away daddy what they're not sunglasses they're hater blockers waiter

name it is the name of jesus what a powerful name it is the name of jesus what a powerful name it is the name of jesus [Music] yes we are going to be learning a new song together this morning um but it's a song that has really been speaking to my heart a lot lately especially in the sermon series of what terry's been talking about of making sure we're clinging to him and not to things of this world not to relationships not to our jobs not to money not to our kids but clinging to him and we're going to be singing the song another in the fire and some of you may know it and if you don't that's okay but verse 2 is my favorite of this song that says all my debt left for dead beneath the waters i'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore should i fall in the space between what remains of me and the reckoning either way i won't bow to the things of this world so we're going to sing that this morning there's a grace when the heart is under fire another way when the walls are closing in and when i look at the space between where i used to be and this reckoning i know i will never be alone there was another in the fire standing next to me there was another in the waters holding back the sea should i ever need reminding of how i've been set free there is a cross that bears the burden where another died for me there is another [Music] i'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore and should i fall in the space between what remains of me and this reckoning either way i will bow to the things of the world and i know i will never be alone there is another in the fire standing next to me there is another in the water holding back the sea and should i ever need reminding the voice power set me free there is a grave that holds nobody and now that power lives in me there is another in the fire [Music] and i can see the light in the darkness is the darkness bounced to him i can hear the roar in the heavens and the space between within i can feel the ground shake between us as the prison woes cave in nothing says between us nothing stands between [Music] name that us jesus he was and still is and we'll be through it all [Music] so we'll convey in the space between all the things i'm seeing and this reckoning there'll be another in the fire standing next to me there'll be another in the waters holding back the sea and should i ever need reminding how good you've been to me i'll count the joy come every battle cause i know that's where you'll be i'll count the joy come every battle cause i know that's where you'll be i'll count the joy come every battle cause i know that's where you'll be heavenly father thank you so much that you are standing in the fire with us as you hold back the seas i'm thankful that we can be grateful for the battles because we know that's when you're closest to us lord heavenly father i just pray that you soften our hearts to receive the message that terry has for us this morning it's your name i pray amen romans 8 5-15 those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires but those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on what the spirit desires the mind a sinful man is death but the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to god's law nor can it do so those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please god you however are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the spirit if the spirit of god lives in you and if anyone does not have the spirit of christ he does not belong to christ but if christ is in you your body is dead because of sin yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness and if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead is living in you he who raised christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who lives in you therefore brothers we have an obligation but it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it for if you live according to the sinful nature you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body you will live because those who are led by the spirit of god are sons of god for you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear but you received the spirit of sonship and by him we cry abba father do you remember what it was like being a kid now if you're doug hozier that was a long long long long time ago do you really remember what it was like being a kid because i remember being that kid who loved going 100 miles per hour watch a kid there's no such thing as going from point a to point b at the slow pace you are literally going as fast as you can as much as you want and that's just how kind of life is life is meant to be lived as an adventure right and you can't wait until you can have fun with your friends and you can go outside and jump on a trampoline and do all the things that kids can do and you just have very little worry in your life tucker the other day looks at me my youngest and he beckons me over to him and i go over to him i said what's up buddy goes i have a secret i said oh yeah what's your secret he goes tomorrow we get to go to the movies and have candy and i was like yes that's the greatest thing in the world literally his life is dependent on a movie and eating candy i mean that's like the coolest thing you could ever have and he couldn't wait till he could do that and i started thinking in that moment i've lost that kind of passion for life where do we lose that kind of passion for life i'll show you a picture and if you would show this to the people online this age is where i kind of lost passion for life now maybe some of you say man you're pretty young but i don't know if you could tell my eyes are halfway closed uh i've missed retakes uh i have hair yes i have hair i had hair i cared about my hair uh but in this in this as well this is kind of the age where i kind of lost this idea that the world revolved just around me and this this kid here i remember is the one who could make the last shot at the buzzer right and i could win every single championship that i ever came across and this was the kid who didn't care what people thought of him but i remember this age of fourth grade was really difficult for me that was the age where i knew people made fun of me because of how loud i was they made fun of me because of my teeth i remember that they made they made fun of me because i was had a weird laugh and i remember those times where i kind of lost my innocence ee family remember those of you who are watching online remember those times where there was a hardship of a pain a loss and those moments you learned and this could have been when you're a kid this could have been a teenager this could have been in college i don't know what time this was for you but somewhere in our life all of us have lost that moment of innocence and in those moments of pain and hurt and loss we begin to do something that i want to talk about today what we begin to do is we begin to protect the kingdom of self you see when we lose something in our life maybe for you it was a divorce mom and dad getting divorced and that was the time where you're like what in the world is happening to my world what is happening to my life i always thought mom and dad would always be together maybe there's a time where you lost someone in your life a friend or even a loved one where you thought they were the ones who are always going to be next to you for the rest of your life and now they're gone and some of you i know because i know you you have lost people you loved dearly way too early and maybe in those moments you said to yourself and you said to others and maybe mostly we just say to ourselves and some of us say this unintentionally but we say i'm never going to get hurt like that again maybe some of you it doesn't even have to be a divorce or a loss of a loved one maybe it's just something someone said to you made fun of you you got bullied you got told you weren't something was done to you that said to you you aren't worth loving a coach a mentor even a parent you see we're all living in a world that everything around us is made kind of to have um to let us down and when we come to this moment we begin to believe in this lie that what i'm a have for myself i'm going to keep and i'm going to protect and what we begin to do is to build up a kingdom of self and what we begin to do is we begin to lay out this castle and we lay out a moat around our castle and some of us put up walls and some of us put up barbed wires and some of us put up land mines that if anybody stepped on them they're going to get hurt and it's on purpose because if they get hurt before they get to me then i don't get hurt and it's because of these moments in our lives that have taught us and told us that this world is not a safe place to live and we maneuver and we posture ourselves for power and control and this is where we really get into trouble because listen when we're posturing and maneuvering for power what we're saying is this i want to be in control of my own life because if i'm in control of my life then nothing can hurt me and what we begin to do is to live in such a way where we're isolating ourselves from people loved ones and especially god because there's no need for god in my life because i have what i need in order to do what i need to do and we begin to maneuver and lie and believe in the lie that everything that we have and everything that we're doing is for me for self and what we've been discussing this month and the series relent is allowing for ourselves and for certain things in our life for us to hear the message that god has for us and what i've asked of you this church and those of you who are followers of christ will you allow for time of fasting because in the time of fasting we begin to recognize and to realize that we've allowed other things to take priority over god fasting is like the greatest way for us to find out real quick where we've allowed other things to take priority over our relationship with god and last week what i talked about was repentance and the time of repentance we are able to ask the lord to forgive us of the things that we've allowed in our lives to take priority over him that there's things we've allowed even into the church to take priority over our relationship with here and so what we begin to do is we find significance and our value in our worth and other things besides jesus and if we take this season of lent may we find out what god is wanting to talk to us about and i believe that the next thing that we need to be looking at is why is it that we are willing to hold on to the kingdom of self and not relent to the kingdom of god and it's exactly what i just spoke about that many of us believe that we are in control and us being in control we are able to no longer get hurt and if we do get hurt then it's because of someone else's fault and not ours but i want to look at some truths this morning that was already read to us by kathy in romans chapter eight and i want to just look at romans chapter eight in three different verses of chapter eight for us to begin to see and understand the importance of letting go of the kingdom of self and and instead look at the kingdom of god are we willing to relent to the kingdom of god and i also want us to remember why we're not okay with relenting ourself to the kingdom of god first paul says this those who are living according to flesh now every time you see flesh what i want you to hear and see to make it relevant to us today is the kingdom of self those of you who are living to the kingdom of self have your minds set on what self desires but those who live in accordance with the kingdom of god or the spirit i want to replace the word spirit with the kingdom of god or jesus whoever has their life in accordance with the kingdom of god have their minds set on what the kingdom of god desires you see the mind governed by the kingdom of self is death but the mind governed by the spirit or the kingdom of god is life and peace the mind governed by the kingdom of self is hostile to god and it does not it will not submit or relent to god's law nor can it do so those who are in the realm of the kingdom of self cannot please god what i'm wanting us to do this morning is to look at some of the things that paul is describing in romans 8 because it's really clear and it's very very relevant to the world that we live in today first and foremost you have to understand the what you think about and what your mind is set on determines how you live what i'm thinking about determines how i live and how i live determines my outcomes you see some of us forget this some of us think we can think however we want we can live however we want and then we complain about the outcomes what paul is describing here is if we're going to continue to focus on kingdom of self what it begins to lead to is things and outcomes that we don't want to experience but what he's also saying that if we're willing to relent if we're willing to submit the kingdom of self if we're willing to remove the moat if we're willing to remove the walls if we're willing to take down the barbed wire if we're willing to dig up the land mines that we've set in front of us what we're saying to god is i am done living life how i want to live it because every time that i do it leads me into a place into a position where i'm hurting where i'm lost and i'm without significance because many of us listen some of us are living according to the kingdom of self because we want to protect ourselves and living in the flesh as paul puts it i want to say it this way we are then all about self-preservation we fear the losing of control thus allowing for insecurities to enter into our lives thus we don't believe that we're worthy of life that we're not worthy of living we're not worthy of love and we begin to look for our significance and our worth in other things besides the kingdom of god and when we look for things outside of the kingdom of god paul says it will lead to death but if we set our minds on the kingdom of god if we set our minds and the things that god wants us to set our minds to if we set our minds on the spirit this is what paul says you will find freedom you will find peace you will find life you will find significance you will find worth you will find that you have value and that he loves you no matter what you've done no matter where you've been and no matter what you're going to do he wants you to know that he will give you life and life abundantly you will find purpose you see many of us have strategized our life in such a way so that you don't get hurt that no one hurts you you don't want to offend anyone you don't want to be offended so what you begin to do is you begin to isolate you become enthralled with the kingdom of self instead of the kingdom of god and what you begin to do is you begin to be filled up with the things of flesh instead of the kingdom of god you see your intentions are meaningful you mean well but what you're doing is you're living opposite of what the god our father the creator of the universe is wanting for us of how to live so he continues paul continues and this time he's a little more blunt he's a little more direct he says in romans 8 12-13 therefore brothers and sisters we have an obligation but not to the kingdom of self and to live according to it for if you live according to the kingdom of self you will die but if by the spirit or by the kingdom of god you put to death the misdeeds of the body you will live he's very direct you have an obligation those of you who call yourselves followers of jesus to relent the kingdom of self and to accept the kingdom of god because when we set our minds on this kingdom of self what we begin to do listen this is what i wrote down listen when we begin to focus on the kingdom of self when we begin to isolate protect ourselves now this is also those of you who aren't followers of jesus you're just exploring or have a little bit of question about your faith i want you to know that no matter what if you implement anything that i talk about today you will begin to see a difference because if we change the way we think now i'm not talking about this new age thing okay paul gave us this a long time ago he says you transformed by the renewing of your mind literally means if we begin to change the way we think we begin to change what we focus on we've been talking about this for a long time if we begin to think and put our focus on jesus and our significance and our value and worth is only found in him and not in other things you will find life and peace but if you focus on the flesh the kingdom of self you become dependent on self worry anxiety you separate yourselves from others and what you begin to do e family listen what we begin to do is we begin to tell half truths we begin to gossip we begin to lie and manipulate why would that be if we're focusing on self because you don't want to lose control i tell half truths and i gossip because i want things to go my way why because you're focusing on the kingdom of self when you focus on the kingdom of self you're okay with lying you're okay with manipulating you're okay with sharing things that aren't always true you lie in your taxes you steal from the clock at work you manipulate because you're wanting to stay in control and listen church family listen when we are focusing on the kingdom of self what we're thinking about what did i say thinking leads to what a certain way of living and a certain way of living leads to a certain outcome and many of us are seeing an outcome of emptiness loneliness needing to find answers but can't find them then we lead into things that we don't like to talk about in church we're focusing on images lust intoxication self-medicating insecurities unable to commit you are wanting the church to serve you instead of you serving it why kingdom of self you always are thinking about self what about me what about what i want what about my likes what about my desires the reason why is because we've learned how to focus on self leading us to live how we want to live and we get tied up in knots do you know what that feels like i know many of you do it wouldn't take you very long for you to remember what it feels like to have that anxiety inside of your gut that controls your every decision and you're worried and you're afraid and you hold on to things that you shouldn't hold on to you maneuver and posture yourself for power and control leading you to mistreating people poor behaviors depression anxiety nervousness unable to sleep depression why because you are maneuvering for power and control you are posturing yourself to focus on the kingdom of self instead of the kingdom of god because listen this is what paul says when you begin to relent or submit yourselves over to the kingdom of god we become patient and kind and gentle and we've learned how to love we learn who's in control worry doesn't have to consume us anymore why we know who's got the best interest in mind we know who's in control we know who holds tomorrow we put our hope in the things we should put our hope into we learn where to find our value and our worth we find freedom we learn how to live how to raise a family what it means to have a marriage what it means to be okay with being by yourself when you're single learning to wait and letting god find you and give you significance and worth and value instead of looking it and finding it an other person or in a relationship you become secure because you know who's fighting for you there's no reason to maneuver and posture for power because god's in control and that way of living that thinking leads to a certain way of living which leads to a certain way of outcome how many of you would like to have freedom and peace to find your worth and value and significance only in christ jesus because the scripture says no angel no demon life nor death can ever separate us from the love of christ nothing but are we willing to relent to submit kingdom of self over to the kingdom of god pastor you say all of these do's and don'ts man you're like fire and brimstone preacher i mean what am i supposed to do with all this why does it always do this and do that and don't do that and don't do this listen as i described last week i set boundaries for my kids why because i love them scripture says god disciplines those who he loves because he wants you to know that there's a better way of living than living in fear and the knots and the anxiety and the worry about tomorrow he wants you to know that you can have freedom and peace and life and listen these aren't about do's and don'ts paul says it better than i do he says this for those of you who are led by the spirit of god are the children of god the spirit you received does not make you slaves instead what it does so that you live in fear rather the spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship and by him we cry abba father abba literally means daddy the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are god's children what i don't know what else is there a better message than that that we are god's children that he accepts us for who we are that we are now his sons and daughters why because we're willing to let go of our kingdom for the kingdom of god we can call him daddy father abba we love you we're so thankful for what you've given us listen what i love about going to my mom and dad's house is that whatever is in the fridge is mine right whatever is in the shed whatever tool i need to do what i need to do is at my disposal i don't need to ask i go right in if the door's locked i have a key if there's a combination i know it if they have food in the fridge and my mom knows what i love what is in the fridge is amish cheese and a can of coke cold coke i love it that's what i want but my father's house when i am a god when a god accepts me as his son think about that what do you think is available in god's shed i mean jeez i mean i you can if i'm in trouble and i'm in a hardship i'm being humiliated if i'm being persecuted if i need help if i need an answer if i need to feel worth value significance it's available to me i don't have to go down to the street i don't have to go sleep with a woman i don't have to go and do things that's outside of the context of god's boundaries for me there's no need for me to find significance in a job or an income there's no need for me to go outside of what god has asked me to do because everything that i need and everything that i wanted is in my father's house thank you amen thank you we're quiet this morning and maybe i said i say that because we're stepping on some toes and that's okay we don't need to go outside the house in the shed of our father because everything that we need is at our disposal there's no need for lying there's no need for half truths there's no need for gossip there's no need to worry about our finances there's no need to worry about our children there's no need to tell half truth to our grandchildren to get them into church because we know that our father is in control amen god is good to us but some of you are saying how how how do i have access to a house like that how do i have access to his equipment his tools are you willing to relent kingdom of self that's really really hard to do let me be honest you have worked all of your life even if you're 12 years old 15 22 102 you've worked all your life to protect kingdom of self and then this man named jesus comes along and says i want you to give of yourself to me to die to self is to gain what does that even mean die to self is to gain what it means is that if i give up kingdom of self i have access to my father's house love joy freedom peace here's the problem here's where we find ourselves in trouble see i want to get real with you just for a second if i may life on earth i want to sum it up this way and then i have a little bit of an analogy i want to use to sum up my sermon and then we'll be done okay listen life on earth listen life on earth lived by the spirit leads to hope and peace ability to overcome healing grace and mercy life lived in the light avoiding life's entanglements of fear and worry and anxiety hope for things not yet seen noticing god and the ability to hear him to see him which allows for you to be equipped to overcome life's greatest obstacles pain hurt and storms you're content that's a word we all need to hear right now content contentment comes from relenting of self to the kingdom of god you see we then look for ways to give to give to people love and we tell them how much they have worth and they deserve because of what god's given us we're happy we're filled with joy and ability to see god in all things around us ability to live by faith and not by sight ability to overcome thoughts that often took hold of us confidence in your day-to-day decision making with family children your marriage overcoming an addiction power and control over tongue and words and gossip leading us to a life that can also experience and lead others who can also experience life filled with love freedom and joy but listen life on earth lived by the flesh leads us to always wanting more never content filled with insecurities that drives your decision-making there's no sense of always there's always a sense of being overwhelmed continued broken relationships need to numb to overcome extreme negative emotions through busyness sex power substances and money the need to prove yourself to others i'm only listing these things because i want you to know the difference between where you are and where god wants you to be the need and to draw and to fight for what's yours your fear of losing what you have obtained always keeping a close eye on wealth and fear of losing it holding and keeping relationships that only benefit you or your bank account continual need to prove your worth and value to those around you which is insecurity needing to earn and keep the respect of those only in authority or you have a rebellious spirit sense of authority and those who have it was only obtained because they lied or cheated for it and then you are misled and manipulated by whatever fits your narrative often leading us to believe what is often not true or in line with what god is about and wants for your life you're easily persuaded by those whose narratives fit what you want to hear leading us then to mislead others to the same unfulfilled life that we're living and i've got to say this i know i don't preach on this much but it's also truth and it's also something jesus spoke about and it's what the new testament speaks about and i have to speak it too life after death lived by the spirit our mortal bodies will pass away but we will have the ability to spend eternity with god no more pain no more sorrow no more sickness no more tears no more destruction no more covid that should have got a loud amen no more chaos but listen listen i've got to be honest with you life lived by the flesh after death continual eternity and separation from god weeping and gnashing of teeth continued life filled with the most extreme pain and unending flames that never cease a life lived away from purpose for all of eternity a place where jesus described where there is a pit that never ceases to burn and he used an analogy that jerusalem had outside of the outskirts where they burned trash they burned old sacrifices and things they wanted to get rid of it stunk to high heaven no one wanted to be near it and it's something you avoided and he says that's what it's going to be like if you decide to live life how you want to live it instead of living life how i'm asking you to live it and it really comes down to this simple analogy and i know some of you may have seen this analogy before this rope is extremely long let's put it that way okay this blue part of this rope is your life on earth look how short it is we're literally living for what we want to live for the shortest amount of time david says this i love this prayer that david reads in in psalms he says he says teach me to number my days because my life is but a breath you see many of us are vying for control for power for worth and significance outside of god because we feel let me live how i want to live i want to love who i want to love let me be who i want to be and it's for this short period of time and you're fighting and vying for kingdom of self and it's literally this short but here's the thing many of us are living for the kingdom of self we're only focusing on this but when we learn to relent and submit our lives over to god we learn to focus on what's after and what's after is eternity and we live this short short life and this rope and this eternity we're literally living 70 averages 74 years for the rest to determine the rest of our rope where we're fighting for power fighting for control we're fighting for love in the wrong places we're learning how to find medication and pills and addictions and gossip and manipulating a lie and control for such a small piece of life and i could go on like this forever cheryl that raids a long rope it goes all the way downstairs all the way under all the way down the aisle downstairs we're literally fighting for this god says listen listen i want to teach you how to live life in this space so you can have life with me in this space i don't know it gets me excited that's why i love easter that's why i love being a pastor that's why i love being part of a church that's because my freedom my hope is things and things unseen you see my eyes are not fixed on the things that i can't see they're fixed on the things that i can't see and because of that i'm willing to relent god you let me know and i'll remove it you want me to change something i'll change it you want me to go left i'll go left why because my eyes are not said on the things that i can see but are said unto things i can't see and i will ask for forgiveness i will ask for grace i will ask for love i will give up whatever you want me to give up i will do whatever you ask me to do i will serve what you wherever you want me to serve i will do whatever you want me to do for this church because i want others to know they can have life in eternity with jesus christ and i must do everything in my power to make sure that message is heard and known and spoken because everyone deserves to have life in eternity with heaven no more sorrow no more pain no more tears [Music] a place where you know that god loves you unconditionally a place where you deserve to be because he calls you his son and daughter would you stand with me would you just would you just make time in the space right now to ask yourself have i been living for the kingdom of self or have i been living for the kingdom of god listen listen there's no such thing as lying on foot on the left and foot on the right revelation says you are a lukewarm christian and i will spit you out of my mouth there is no gray here now listen listen i'm not saying i'm not saying we don't make mistakes but it's those who are saying i'm living for the kingdom of god and we're made aware of something we've done a person who's following the kingdom of god says i am sorry and i'm willing to ask forgiveness would you spout your head and close your eyes with me just for a second maybe some of you here are hurting and you're lost and there's nuts and there's worry and there's fear and there's anxiety it's because you've learned how to focus on self and god is asking will you be willing to relent the kingdom of self for the kingdom of god because in my kingdom church listen to the spirit right now listen to as he speaks to you to your heart because in the kingdom of god you will find what you're looking for that coach that parent that moment in life that toll told you you had no worth you had no value that stole your innocence god is wanting you to know that he is wanting to heal you to redeem you to restore you that person who came along and told you you have nothing you're worth nothing through action or words jesus is wanting to know that is not who you are and all i'm asking i know it's hard and i know it's difficult but will you give up of self no more barbed wire no more walls no more emotes let me in he's knocking i just want to come in would you let me in please i want to restore you back to life i want to show you what it means to have peace i want you to know that you're worthy of love and you don't have to find it in someone else [Music] i'm the only thing that you need if you let me in that emptiness that hole that you're feeling i can fill it father would you just speak to us today would you draw us close to you make us aware of your kingdom that lasts for eternity and may we be willing to give up of self so we can see the kingdom of god and may we as a church live in such a way that others may see your face because they're willing to relent of their kingdom in your name amen that you've prepared for me in the presence of my enemies it's your body and your blood to share for me this is [Music] this is how i find my best this is how i find my best

through let's find out this is a rock solid wall meeting this is gotta be like probably a couple hundred thousand Orbeez maybe more maybe more but this this is over 100 million or be this is long overdue but you guys remember when I spent the night in Orbeez boy and I said you guys yeah you remember that yeah I said if you guys smash 100,000 likes I'd fill this entire warehouse with Orbeez well you guys got like 300,000 like so so we should do it three times okay okay okay there are more than 100,000 we've been on three warehouses but we are gonna fill this entire thing now obviously this is gonna take a lot of time okay this is also gonna take a lot of money so if you guys can smash 200,000 likes on this video we're gonna work double time and we're gonna skip the video we had scheduled and drop this one next so smash that like button put your post notifications on to not miss it you're scared huh I'm very scared also you know what higher dollar gift card to ours first yeah one hundred dollar gift card to whoever's first on this video post notifications on it's coming out with neck if you smash two hundred thousand likes what you want to start breaking the wall let's start it let's start breaking the wall last time we skipped mallet time but not this time bro this is gonna be a strong wall so screw could be so strong but like little mini shock absorbers no no yeah you guys are probably wondering how we stuck Orbeez together we just glued hundreds of thousands of Orbeez together that didn't take long it took so long dude yeah I got me good tried twice next time next time I make a whip oh oh Oh big shots though good shot thank you yeah right right here no move move right there we see the mark you can't you can't see okay there's mark back-end oh we should probably retire the whip really okay maybe not but maybe get a new one now yep whoa-ho that's a good eye that's a good bad idea cuz like then we got a better whip but then we yet then we have a better weapon you don't want a better with my time for the new throwing weapons yeah we got we've got a lot of them feel good about this yo that's not possible yeah look like a pop they pop let's see if the zombie blades a make them pop not the wall feel free to cut that I am NOT a fan or not oh my god okay we just never but look one of them got stuck in it you guys probably didn't hear but it made like a loud popping sound because when it goes in we have to throw harder than that to go in but when it goes in with lots of layers or Orbeez and I guess there's an air pocket and pull okay Todd these are actually better than you think see that's what that that demonstration came it came at a cost but you get the but you get the point I get the point yes Oh Mayday we're already breaking weapons out here this is a steel blade it's the new one - this is Orbeez how does this you going spiky metal balls oh my come on it's really hard throw don't throw it oh just just take these and just never let me touch those again please boomerang time wait what is it what welcome that bird oh it balanced and it broke the wood off but this is okay is the boomerang okay who moves okay yeah it looks like it's ready for another one let's do it can't remember if you're supposed to throw it this way or this way it doesn't really matter we'll call this one and we'll call this - how should I throw it - - okay one it's nobody hit did somewhere here this is not indicative of the fact of whether I hit it or not I hit I didn't see it oh but one time it comes back and hits you I know right this seems promising we got a slingshot we got up it's a bolt or nuts and not on the bolt yeah did it yes I did I had to think about it for a second oh I knew that was gonna happen reload whoa ah you got that on camera I did roll we have so much glass around here dude Oh should we just leave it there it just it just I was gonna take it back but um so we are leaving it there yeah let's leave it there oh we got various damage marks in various places there's I'd say we're making progress oh you guys have been skating on a rink full of Orbeez no one has I have well I haven't I've just scratched over the tiger claw but okay that's not gonna do it no it's not there's a little out of control it was one time yeah one I think yeah yeah can you quickly maybe Google had a break-in or baseball dude I don't think there's another done this huh no but at least make it look really damaged up seat here look if we do this yeah maybe we can like scratch it off the entire web [ __ ] that's kind of satisfying is a funny feeling after we break through the first like tiny little layer or Weezer gonna start falling really I don't actually know that this is just a hope more than anything I hope to help three oh you poor stop it Eric grapplers ready to go young that's good that was good but we could do better ready why I might microwave not the microwave Oh have I learned anything from this is what you're asking no you have it yes I have what what you learnt that I'm a ninja out of early it's not maybe before a breeze would do well against or visa it didn't I didn't pick up looks like we got nothing but surface damage which means we need to try to go below the surface okay this is pretty good at that there you go yeah okay this is this is gonna take a while I don't know what to do anymore right right oh that's really why not you did I miss I didn't miss time to test some of the new weapons you put it on wrong like this no you've got a favorite slow cuz it has backwards teeth I call this the tuning fork here's why yeah yeah oh I love okay Jeremy yeah this stores pretty good but like it's not like thick enough you know I can't like do like many heavier heavier we got something heavier like the machete oh yeah I always loved the shitty look that's like a big crack inside see I don't really see it what do you mean the big white line that like goes into does not there's a lot cracks are cracked the scratch but we got more swords don't worry Oh just so you guys know look what this does to wood okay look what it does to this come on here we go oh yeah what do you think throw it Oh [Music] let's go I told you when you can't / it you throw it okay no oh yes it's still solid all the way through but look some of the Orbeez are starting to come out oh yeah oh this is kind of giving me like um the the tripe oh stuff you guys know what I'm talking about the small holes thing this is you okay we got a big chunk think when you concentrate our energy here right there uh it's just a concentrate our energy when we how we get it back someone give them water I knew it I knew it I knew it I had a funny feeling you guys find this mm-hmm here's the target oh yeah oh yeah throw it okay I'm so sorry yeah I caught that but this is where I asked you guys to smash the like button cuz we need new weapons we do we do these are kind of cool you guys have seen this before sharp tip surgically sharp in fact this is going in you think oh it's an all these are going in here we go oh do you in scared yo never scared okay sometimes I get a little yeah you do I never no way that was it this is literally gone into like rock solid door frames and we've gone again move closer try to hit a red or B red RV a red one okay I think Eric put more red actually I still I still had a red our view the all right put a blue one then I'm deciding I'm retiring undefeated one for one I'm bow and arrow shots oh gee bad time I need some ideas here I got no ideas yeah yo we're running into an issue more axes if these axes aren't doing the damage they're supposed to I don't know where to go with this you know like they say oh look see the fractures here here yeah where's that from I don't know probably the ax let's keep going okay yeah oh look some perfectly good or B's let me just we can maybe get the front off a lot oh there is the guts goods I know what we need to do we need to dig it out dig it okay I'm digging it out let's see what we can do here okay I'm not this is doing pretty well now we've broken the surface I think it's like the you know it's a structural integrity thing so like the more that you break the weaker it becomes so like this area is all should be weaker now it's just a theory it doesn't look anything right well how does that not look weaker it just looks more damaged but doesn't look weaker does that make sense this new weapon alone we got Goldie hawk the golden axe let's throw it not throwing one kind of weird cuz Hawks fly right Hawks do fly Fox do fly yeah okay look at this oh yeah yo this is pretty good sharp is definitely great now that we broke the surface okay we should continue with the new weapons oh dude I need a face mask let's do this [Music] yeah yeah I think we have a problem what's wrong this is obviously the problem we're running out of weapons but the big ones are left big big ones big ones big ones it's time to go fishing for some Orbeez we got our harpoon ready what what's in the end of it I don't know oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I missed there you go did I call it a harpoon I meant to call it a spear Oh hit it twice see yeah positive I like that you guys knew where I was going with this we got the spear spear that I like this is what I'm trying to say and it works really well on a lot of walls oh I think it's blowing away in let's do it it went it straighter we got stuck let's do it again here we go okay what do we got you went in but it like closed the hole after I see it like all this is cracked hit it again yeah what are we gonna do mini crowbar doctor a pry bar this is a crowbar this is a mini crowbar you know sometimes when I build these things I'm like how strong could it be you know we're probably gonna be able to break in the end I legitimately don't know how I'm gonna break this I was more confident against the rock wall Venice really yeah legit but we got the full-size crowbar this is like bigger than a full-sized crowbar this is like this is like a barbell this is literally like a barbell there we go yes yeah yes yeah yes you get bring you yep see that guy's you know what that's called with the call I'm not gonna say it but they're gonna tell you oh my goodness if you're gonna spank pro bar grab a tape yes that's working pretty well but it's really tiring I need something lighter and faster but still hard yeah you got that yeah I got that Massa Tom it's working oh it's working I'm also working this is usually really effective ah look at these seashell spiral sorta difficult oh yeah it actually does the foster Pokemon pom knit turf I'm Nick soon uh-huh-huh yes definite that but you guys know I'm talking about the Kabutops and then there's look at all these holes let's make more [Music] the whole family of seashells now we need to keep upgrading yeah we do that's Kissin honestly Trent at Trent he liked it oh yeah with that right what was he doing with it why did you guys been saying you've been missing out on this that I haven't had it well I found it here it is oh okay leave that we're getting real deep I think it's like there's more more more all these underneath how's it going Benny you guys watched my last video you know what this is there we go oh yeah yeah honestly this would probably do it but I can't like it's gonna break my hands my vibrations on it like it's crazy it's steel on the inside but Wow Oh whopping ah how am I even kidding these are not good for absorbing shock okay we really need to escalate the weapons like fast how am I gonna make all right oh that's good this yeah this is I need a new one of these because this is this is scary for me cuz that is leaking and ball ovaries of water anyways so back to smashing we got a sledgehammer so really heavy do the wall euro might come off the wall oh it might fall down yeah oh it's not even doing enough damage I was expecting you tell my studio no I have nothing ever least you have the pickaxe though okay that's horrific gasps nice Oh that gum old gum say old gum nobody likes old gum nope let's finish that oh yeah oh yeah that's the technique you just gotta go and then you gotta okay a thousand of those we just do that for the next three to five days we might be able to break into it but we don't got due to five days we don't got three to five days we got this whole warehouse to fill up floor B so we're gonna have to do something we've never done before what do you got here I can tell you about well it's always better I just show you let's do it let's do it yeah it's about to happen I'm a little nervous oh this doesn't work this would be the first wall that goes unbroken we can't allow it we can't yo we didn't go all the way through though keep going keep going good good [Music] my hands are wet it's like shooting water [Music] oh look at how thick this is we literally stood no chance remember we could smash 200,000 likes on this video this entire place will be filled with 100 million Orbeez next video get your pose notifications on whoever's first wins a prize and you guys know I always like to leave on a high note [Applause]

twisted rainbow punch now they are soft and chewy ropes colors from real sources there's a nice big cherry there's a nice big strawberry and there's a whole bunch of fruit so let's well you want to take a nice closer look at each bag here you go they're very flat the bags are flat and that is the first one that is the twisted rainbow punch enlarge to show full detail so they're not that big

all out of the package Oh cool-looking there's three of those three cherry the smell is just wonderfully overwhelming three of those it's almost like a pinkish color you can try come on don't you automatically zoom out and zoom into me no no I know I'm trained to do that let's just take them all that let's quit messing around with onesie twosie then show awesome right that's pretty look how beautiful that is let's push messing around it's okay to mess around when you're eating wonderful looking candy like that just take them all up okay they're very pretty looking just all the wonderful colors basically getting ready for the thumbnail right the way the thumbnail is gonna look let's just leave it like that that's a nice colorful thumbnail and I'll string them up okay that's better alright so let's try of that cherry now there is a color on the inside which looks like it runs all the way through it does I almost made it to the end there's the inside okay that's the same problem but click it they're very soft like a soft gummy I like it wonderful flavor wonderful cherry flavor and it's delicious fruity flavor exactly it is sweet sweeter than say just like a piece of licorice cuz you got that where the Twizzlers cuz you got that extra sugar on the inside let us try another let's put all these together boy they're almost metallic looking with that on the inside aren't they look would you eat them I'm playing with all my food no one's gonna want one okay in the middle oh the flavor is really strong I like that I guess I don't have to eat a whole undo it mmm probably one of the sweeter candies I've had in a long time all right last but not least the beautiful rainbow colors so they're not rounded but sort of flat alright two sides alright last one here we go mm mm hmm I taste a green apple I really taste a green apple let me it neat all the different colors in there I can't isolate orange or isolate Balu but either way very tasty all right I'm done it was a quick video because I found him in the store I saw the new and it's the first time I've ever had sweet tarts ropes I was saying that they do taste like sweet tarts and sweet tarts are sweet so these are just a sweet of sweet tarts does that make any sense I think so I think the inside has almost like a similar powder to like a sweet tart that's been powdered it's soft it's not chewed mm-hmm yeah

wall that I can't go through that's a boomy that's\nwhat this is it makes schools out of this and houses and buildings and things\nthat they don't want people to go through I think the at my point yeah\nit's a hard wall so we should move on to the battle act don't show that I put a\nlot of stress on my ears and this wall smash that like button I don't need a\nreason I can't run I was gonna run and stab it with with this skull thing but\nit's probably best that I don't Who am I kidding the blades gonna break it's\ngonna slice me fully back it's not no fire no fire no this is not not

it's\nsatisfying that was fine you know sometimes I think\nmy videos are a little bit out of control sometimes sometimes like that\nbut with this we should we should probably stay in control with this yeah\nnot one yeah exactly but we don't really need to go that\ncrazy with it cuz I put a little dent but I was gonna say we don't need to go\nthat crazy because if you could see here we already put a\nlittle hole and we could just drill it see what I'm doing yeah nice little\ndrill right everybody gets drill on okay this is not working a little bit today\nyeah you know I'd like to just stop it

I'm kind of breaking through\nbrick wall or not I love you guys and I always like to leave on a high note who\nwe're gonna be here late", "gIlrndL2FQU": "this is a potato launcher and this is a\nhundred where's whoever can make the biggest hole in the end which we are\ngoing to see if Wolverine claws can get through a hundred layers come on Bree do\nit for the girls you gotta like push push it in more rough how many layers do\nyou see if I could feel it on the other side I can't feel anything\nyou gotta push harder like you're in labor I've never done that before so\ninterested and I think we should see what you are gonna try for your layers\nwe're putting an extra spin on my challenge we've got a target that is\nextremely small on my 100 layers and these are notorious for bouncing off the\nduct tape because of how rubbery okay I'm gonna back up all right if I can\njust get I wanted is it landed on the target somewhere let me just land it in\nthe target throwing stars they work be it's done I've got one more left in the\nArsenal guys one more no how did that feel for your confidence he was hating\non my claws and I think I made it through there I once got a perfect score\nI got a six pointer okay just gonna point that out six pointer is pretty\ngood he's just trying to compensate for the fact that he didn't beat me this is\nthe professional way to start a weed whacker do you guys think she can start\nthis leave a like if you think Bree can start I did a lap time hold the trigger but\nunderneath it what's happening it's like not take it comes doesn't want to step\nup to the plate yeah I keep going you're hitting the\nwood challenge great let's go your name with it I think that the damage is insignificant\nweedwacker is proving to be very very useless of its situation we just have\nthis this is literally all I did that's it one layer maybe if you could like I\nwish that you can replace this the plastic wire if we could replace that\nwith like steel or so good idea do they make those phonemes we'd like you to\nmodify the weedwacker can you guys guess what I'm going to be\nloading into here a baby bag it can't be that strong right I don't think I don't\nthink let's see let's see I don't shoot the don't shoot the door we're good I\nfeel like Bree has no idea what she's doing\ndo you would you know if I helped a little bit no no I don't I've got this\nguy's billeted me let me there that was much easier wasn't it why didn't you get\na target and I just have a random woman so she's got this like ceramic bowl and\nour goal is to bust it using the beanbag launcher why ain't you get the ball just\nyou gotta grow these oh that make me hit right here oh yeah\nI miss fortune you got this take your time make sure it's on Oh at the way but\nit didn't really shatter I heard I heard the hit where did it hit finally in my job this is the tale of\ntwo javelins this is a newly ordered one we have which looks insanely powerful\nthen we've got this off this one which is homemade we're gonna actually use a\nblowtorch on this and heat this up as much as possible so we're gonna start\nwith the new one first now just a disclaimer I've never thrown a javelin\nbefore definitely don't do it at home so Jimmy a time I gotta get the find the\nbalance scoot back a little bit yeah I just get back a little bit all right I\nknow it's all about the throw I've seen this in League of Legends seven points\nbaby seven points that's God's number there was no really it didn't really do\nanything yeah it isn't it doesn't do a ton I think I didn't throw it hard\nenough I want to throw it again but like with way more force if you can make it\nthrough everyone has to subscribe to my channel I think that's just how it work\nif I manage to do well if people sub to Brees channel get out of here dude let\nme give it another go so satisfying to do that that one actually did really\ngood out of you guys can see kind of went in at a slight angle to penetrate\nthe wall no damage has yet been made while I'm ready for the javelin to heat\nup do us a favour if you guys get to one of our videos in the first 60 minutes\nyou have a chance to have your comments featured in red right here on the screen\nso don't miss out on a brand new video hi Bri get a nice and hot yeah do you\nwant more heats yeah give me give me some more heat this thing steamy\nwhy don't we melt the metal I can feel the heat on my face at this distance\nmeet you when is the heat enough breath then I'm trying to get it as hot as\npossible here hold it all right the tip I think the tip is\nready why we're going fast you're going fast\nI remember do not touch the different people in the comments remind me not to\ntouch the tip of this because it is hot I here we go I'm going for the center\nballoon if we can come on I think it melted some ducks hold on hold on I want\nto get enough look at how deep that wind sorry I think I was like three inches oh\nwe've got enough heat let's try one more toss all right here we go here we go okay so that didn't just go through a\nlittle bit I don't know if you guys saw the other side of the javelin like this\nmuch I'm excited and you're beating me no I need to I need so apparently this\nis a harpoon you don't want a hit baby show no you do want to hit baby waves\nthat the shark from Finding Nemo oh it's just a Ross Ross Bruce all right\nno it's Bruce Ross Ross of the shark has no really my firstborn child Ross you\ndon't bra stupid baby's yours are you shooting either of them you\nshoot the ceiling at this rate how's my aim I did sure it's great I'm sure it's\ngreat oh yeah check the damage oh wait can you see it poking on the other side\noh I wonder if it's not long enough oh it's definitely not long enough\nI think only this much went through it's got a really small tip you know I at\nleast I got proof some layers hello okay this time you got any shark\nbriefed I don't want to hit a human got to pick one or the other either it's\nBruce or baby shark hoping you'd like a pistol it flings back guys Briana is the\nmost dangerous woman alive right now this is how I hit the shark it's on the\npaper I avoided it on purpose because I love animal I don't think that counts\nyou know maybe I should do what you did Preston just make it real hot in space I\ndon't think there's water I don't the harpoon guns weak but it might work\nwith a fire tip yeah it doesn't want you to get through no no probably it so\napparently the harpoon wasn't good enough we need a flaming so a lot don't\ndon't touch me or

don't think we even got here if you look underneath here yeah so put a\ncamera underneath there you guys can see it's it's not even touching the other 50\nlayers oh he's trying to make that whole Baker I'm trying to get there I'm just\ntrying to make that let's just calm down there Missy move if\nyou guys want to see us destroy 100 layers how about you look under this\nvideo and if your

great and also you mix in some melted\nduct tape in there yeah so we've exhausted all our weapons so I think\nit's time to measure out at least let me measure my own side okay breathe so I\nhad two different holes that managed to make it all the way through by under\nlayers one right here maybe you're stealing it's not even like\nthat what is it like 1/8 of an inch it's so tiny and then this one right here\npretty much misses hey barely made empty I barely made any old damage they saved\nthe best for last but see we didn't clarify what type of hole we had to\ncreate I agree your hole is definitely bigger but but it's definitely not gonna\nhave three inches come on I mean I mean guys look look - clearly she's a rigging\nvisitor Preston it is safe to say I won so go ahead click on one

"YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for tuning in i will see you guys next time peace and subscribe if you haven't already peace out everyone",

starbursts to this now we're going to add the popcorn in it that looks so good all right and once it's all mixed just pop it onto a parchment paper so you want to leave it about 10 minutes to cool down try this cheers mmm this is so good i'm not a huge fan of sweet popcorn normally i love this it's got like a little bit of tanginess and it's very stuck to my teeth all right try it at home it's really good now it's time to make the mold for the starburst we got a fabulous shaped box but first we're going to line it with some silicon all right we have 10 tubes of silicon i hope this is enough guys because i have a giant starburst mold to make all right so i found this square box what we're gonna do is cut the top off so we can start pouring the mold inside bam as you noticed since i've cut the top off the structure is not quite right we're gonna use some duct tape to tape it up all right guys so the box is duct taped and i've got a little surprise there's something in here what is it oh my god for once can i get some peace and quiet as you can see the box has now become more starburst shaped we had to get coco out of there he was having too much fun that we couldn't cut up the box i feel like this is a good shape for a mall [Music] guys this smells so bad it hurts my nerves [Music] look at my hands they're all pruny gross all right guys it's been a full 24 hours and this mold has finally set it smells really bad doesn't know if he wants to get in the box anymore because it smells really bad this is not bad coco so what we're doing with the melting is we're adding a layer of light corn syrup on the very bottom because we figured this made it burn less and we're gonna start with the yellow [Music] all right guys so we have our final color i was really worried we didn't have enough starbursts for this mold but we do so let's pour it in the final color we are almost there oh my god it's so heavy all right guys it's been a full day guys look how solid it is and look at these little bubbles they're all squishy can wendy oh my gosh it is it is very heavy oh did you see that it's still like movable it's like bending so before i take it out i'm gonna prepare the wrapping and my little starburst side you're in the way go go alright guys so now that my cat is holding the wrapping in place i'm not getting paid for this i've got my trusty knife and i am going to cut open the box actually because i don't think it's going to flip over and come out check it out the silicon really helped it not stick the cute rainbow layers in our style burst [Music] guys look at

it's kind of nice splitter from what cardboard would the problem is is with this i'm just beating it in the cardboard it's not really doing much damage i made a smiley face it's pretty bad honestly yeah that don't work yeah you got some big brands but that don't work it's my face oh is that a smiley face oh nice too oh nice epic it has a zit now that's a big exit it's like that episode of spongebob everything's like i get stung by the jellyfish everything's like that episode of spongebob that's what everything is so are we like in that box where it's like they're imaginating everything imaginating i imagine that's getting to the other side of this wall run into it nine and three quarters run into it right into it full speed i'll give you guys like the three two one oh yeah the the drag flap yeah the drive all right drop ready all right so i'm gonna like put my left shoulder into it okay i'll put my right so we can like stare at each other all right are you ready are you ready yeah yeah i want to move kind of go okay wait you said we were gonna look at each other you said that was awkward it's just ridiculous it's like a cardboard right there i i think i made it through one layer i just want to this is what i made it through so all i'm saying is is i didn't realize how strong cardboard was this is kind of ridiculous this isn't gonna work this is not gonna work i just figured something out this isn't gonna work yeah yeah that's that's what that's where i can hear that from this right here is our new furry friend look at this needs to be a happy camper happy camper should you give it a nose um yep two legs eyebrows two big nostrils give us some like tongue twisters front teeth freckles more freckles whiskers yeah we're good all right there it is it looks like spongebob yeah it kind of does this is the battering ram we're just gonna just all right okay ready oh no it's supposed to let me see it i thought it was supposed to like give you leverage so you could go into it oh yeah yeah oh it's kind of nice [Music] those are like those are like perfect circles it's not doing anything wow what if you did it backwards that's really big now you can like smile at him while he smiles at you it's really heavy here give it a try uh the boy all right watch out boys i'm just gonna throw it nope wait wait wait wait wait watch out watch out watch out watch out okay what if we break through the bottle it's probably where we gonna go there's floor underneath yeah concrete and stuff that's not the best idea sorry yeah that seems much harder than the other oh someone's at the front door someone just oh oh hello pizza delivery i can't hear anything it's really quiet my finger hurts you made the perfect noise for it yeah it was like dead all right so uh we have a chainsaw i'll be in this corner 45 centimeters 18 inch blade that should make it halfway through halfway halfway just kind of big giant doorway trap door like that wow did he break it oh i feel like i got your superpower oh there's so many particles in here those are molecules huh come on why is it going up it goes that way wait what if i try the other way oh no he's gonna go down yo this is scary here you take this have fun buddy okay um i'll just hey hey hey hey huh there's already a hole why don't you just well you forgot your safety glasses then oh thanks safety first i didn't even get safety glasses so you cut this way i cut that way okay you can go do the top or you can go up yeah i'm gonna go smells like burning [Music] cardboard we can take turns you can do the next cut before there you go how do you even work one of these uh there's a he has bite right idea that's how you're supposed to do it we're doing it wrong yeah i couldn't stay in the hole i see that but i mean we could probably like cut right here give me the chainsaw oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah maybe that's what we're supposed to do what are you talking about oh yeah oh yeah did you uh did you do the top uh i went diagonal okay oh oh wow yeah [Laughter] yeah you're like covered in dust yeah that is oh it's like a german habitat all right let's assess the damage all right pull it out ripped nice epic that's like four layers what else we got in there oh that's like probably six layers no that's me right there bro i did that all right that's like another six layers i got more out epic dude cool you got like another six layers yeah look how deep this is yo it's like a picture frame oh my gosh there's still more he'll destroy yeah it's kind of hard to pull out yo use the box cutter wait it's like dusty in there dog you know that might be easier if we had a crowbar yeah i think that's the end of it so we made it through probably like 20 layers no we went through more layers we just can't pull how many layers is this oh i found this under cardboard epic you want me to try this one yeah epic it's like changing bro i really didn't think it'd be this hard to break through only a hundred layers there's only 100. on this video we should do a part two and we'll do a thousand layers we will just grabbing too many at once we'll probably have to get a car and drive it through it say my phone symmetra spikes yes snow plows snowplow not gonna happen james i'm sorry no so i think we're about not even halfway through that yeah i don't know bro that's not bad are you what i thought you were painting water oh it's a water gun you have a water gun yes think about it cardboard water destruction dude it's literally not doing anything see if that makes it weaker hit it with the axe oh okay no no the axe yo this ain't gonna work look you gotta get creative with it yeah there you go exactly yeah do that do that oh it's oh man that's not working oh no what do you expect it's the top of the hammer big brains yeah big brains big brains it's actually doing something there you go now it's stuck yeah it just didn't want to hit it it's actually doing quite a bit of damage since the cardboard is wet hold on stick it in there it's not sticking get it stuck it's not sticking yeah it's just not really hit with the ram yeah five bucks just says he hits the cardboard i don't have five bucks but yeah we're in a room of cardboard go for it go for it go for it all right i owe you five bucks we tried that it didn't work yeah now turn it on all right now go for it it's wireless now it's bluetooth the entire floor we're stuck in here boys just admit it yeah we've been stuck in here yeah [Applause] i think you're losing your pride we're going on a trip in my favorite cardboard ship going to the wall look at my saw hey why don't you continue the hole we've already started yet noob it's not really doing anything to be honest it broke in half the cardboard broke the beyblade that's how i cut my burritos in half i got one of those hey that's pretty good it bent the blade it's sideways yeah i wouldn't use that anymore that probably isn't safe yeah i'm gonna say it now i can see the light where i don't see it i can't see the light all right yeah this thing's gotta retire yeah you got cardboard you won't believe this to find more cardboard more cardboard that way more cardboard no way cardboard no way yeah cardboard cardboard what are you doing hey hang on boys we're getting through some layers here yeah i literally just cut it with a saw home slice forget the saw forget the battery ham forget the paper cutter we got one of these roller yeah look at all that debris coming out holy mackerel did you try turning it on and off again no do it oh the whole chainsaw is gone it's stuck we're getting out of here today did you break it did you plug it did we break to get out of here so how are we gonna fit through that hole i'll just push you through okay and then you can like unlock it yeah once you're on the other side how deep does this go all right well what'd you do it's really warm look how dude we have how deep we are now we have to be how deep this is bro we have to be at least halfway through dude look at this look at all the shavings we still have to go deeper yeah we still haven't sideways we're good probably like two feet in the wall right now now it's voldemort now it's scarface now we have a harpoon gun this is very scary it's meant for underwater and big fishes it's also not made to be shot out of water and or at cardboard go for it no that's all you know whoa oh what what whoa be careful where you point that thing dog what are you talking about yo chill man all right all right look how close it is i know right it's like as big as the room all right i'm ready three two one my gosh we caught ourselves a cardboard wall it's not wanting to come out it's not when you come out oh oh i got it wait okay see the outside oh i see light really i see light okay this is how long the harpoon is right it's literally as tall as me it went all the way to here oh there's the hole bro we got a lot of cutting to do we can do this where's the chainsaw go go go stop stop stop stop stop stop no i said stop oh it sounded like stop stop stop yeah i'll keep going i think i see the light like legit on the right side oh i see it keep going keep going we're literally [Music] we there sell mac and cheese with our faces like the little frog no flipping way watch out watch out for no hamster bedding i'll pull it out my guy oh my it looks like granola or stuffing from thanksgiving ah don't eat it though all right there's uh two two layers nice good cut job yeah i like your cut jeez we should have made a circle yeah that would have been nice or a bigger hole so you can fit through it yeah i don't know how any of us are gonna even like go through this but we'll try right i think i'll fit ah yeah dude keep going with it yo wait wait watch out watch out with you watch out dude nice i would clap but i have a chainsaw yeah don't do that all right put them down turn it off dude i cut this part a little bit i think it's dusty in there it's dusty in there oh it's real dusty in there all right we got like four layers there right dude all i'm saying is this is tough this is more than a hundred layers i think we miscalculated why don't we create a tool that grabs cardboard like in this situation yeah almost oh yeah because how many people you know get stuck in a cardboard box other than youtubers four right oh yeah four of us yeah right okay well see i'll create it and i'll sell it for a thousand bucks so i'll make three grand off you guys and then uh we'll get out yeah yeah let's just move a little bit and we just enter hey oh yo that worked yeah oh i got like five yo that was more than five that's yeah one two three five six seven eight nine nine layers right there oh are you through no no way i see the light boys go go go go go go grab those lights oh i see it i see it we did it but not here there's still one more layer and we fit through it technically making me a box cutter do you want one with a blade in it oh there it is there you are so you don't need this anymore no i'm good okay oh why is it wet sorry okay so how are we supposed to fit through it i'll push you through yeah you said you could fit you got it hold on this is what you were [Music] [Applause] born y'all you're almost there yeah he might get it i can't quit okay yeah pick me up [Laughter] do you want us to push more yeah keep pushing okay

not gonna eat one i made the whole thing and y'all are gonna experience what happens to me behind the scenes from tiktok all right so [Music] let's get this [ __ ] started all right so i opened the bag and that's what i thought it smelled delicious like you already know but here's one strip already so let's do it it's not bad taking mine you gotta eat one straight for 40 minutes and this is all freaking sugar and you know that good stuff so pretty bomb i made out other one [ __ ] it you're about to witness the transformation with my eyes i'm like on my fifth one and take in mind that you're supposed to only take one or 45 minutes but i'm thinking the whole thing because i'm just feel different so i'm a cut where like i'm starting to feel the symptoms in like 15 minutes and i'm starting to feel some symptoms man i'm trying to feel kind of slow your mind starts traveling somewhere else you start speaking stuff like this right now but i got i got three left so you can see it's it's night time the whole bag is done and they're hitting holy [ __ ] but you know i was i was gonna be scared that they were not gonna hit but they're hitting they're headed i can feel my whole body like expanding to the universe right now and um twitter that's all that i don't say when they hear you talking [ __ ] about them and they're right about um for this video is don't do edibles stay healthy and goodnight", "U2rp6Jo8FQo": "[Music] what's up guys it is October community day and Pokemon go and we haven't posted a video in a while but the Pokemon go grind has not stopped in fact we have a little bit of a problem we've gotten ourselves into let me explain so the problem we're having is that community day starts in honestly about an hour now and we only have fifty maybe eighty pokeballs to our name which is not near enough not near enough and the reason we only have that many is because we have almost 1200 rare candy each over 2000 rare candy between the two of us we don't know what to spend it on so we just keep saving it and now we have no bag space it's easily been probably a year since we've spent rare candy so we're just spending it all right now as quick as possible and then we have an hour to fill our bags up with items that we need for Community Day and then we're off run it the last few days leading up to spending this rare candy we have been trying to hatch as many 10k eggs as possible to hopefully get new and useful Pokemon to dump our candy into pana has one final batching right now last chance to get handle it wicks or something like that to spend our candy on what ya know run finally hatching Hey please no well yeah yes crazy catch max I'm definitely doing a lot of like my candy that is for sure I cannot actual everywhere okay let's see oh my god happening [Music] oh wow again good but not what I wanted that was all of them okay all right so good I did get a really good luck definitely doing even more love economy than I thought I was because I already had another lightweight Clemens anise Pokemon go teased on Twitter lit wick for their spooky upcoming spooky October event so it's guaranteed we're gonna probably have increased ghost bonds including lit wick but since he is such a strong Ghost and fire attacker now it's still not a waste of rare candy in my opinion even if we're gonna get more spawns of them and we still want to dump a lot of you this one is probably the best but then I also have this one yeah the other the other one yeah I mean yeah sure but I'm not gonna evolve anything right right the last thing the last thing that might determine what I dump candy into is I have my seven-day breakthrough if I get a you know of a stone that I'm for sure gonna try and lucky trade for a little work going we've done like six or seven of these between the two of us you know it's Todd yeah I feel like I beat Pokemon go alright shiny flower crown Eevee you know this changes everything alright so I am sitting at 1126 rare candy I'm gonna try to dunk most of it I want to put some into a Mewtwo I'm just gonna do 3 happy okay so there's 300 to mu-2 300 cities ladies Ellen oh yeah I don't know I'm probably gonna regret something later but I just have to make these snap misogynist 300 the limit I'm gonna do like 150 I'll do 200 cuz I do that one okay okay awesome okay so I don't have a Salamence yet we totally missed that Community Day so I'm going to put a hundred candy into a bag in in the hopes of maybe getting that community date oh come on counting of them bringing back Community Day because we didn't miss quite a few okay for me things just got interesting because I'm sitting at 1,150 for rare candy and I just got a you know Bastogne which changes everything earlier this week I caught a lip wick on my brother's account I've already talked to him he's fine with me doing this I am going to attempt to lucky trade his lip wick to me again this might be a waste because we're gonna be getting a ton of wet wick over like the spooky Halloween event but we don't know that for sure and also I just want it we have to exm you to raids to do today and this would be a supreme counter the best counter I can have so please special trade of the day Zapdos is still a really relevant electric fighter so I'm hoping this becomes good and of course I want that lucky love way No no no it's not I'm gonna trade Hannah Hannah has had two really good ones she has one that's not good that was caught in the wild she definitely doesn't want to waste candy on that so we're going to attempt to lucky trade it to me she has already used her 10 lucky trade so if I so we're just gonna trade it for a 2016 Pokemon and hope it goes lucky okay I think I'm just gonna do this porygon okay just from it's a really good one but well I don't think I'm safe from that yeah okay I'm just doing it alright I went a lot he's got lucky he's suspense is killing me I'm looking no it's not there yet it's not lucky no way this is like the fifth or sixth july-august trade I've done in a row that has not done lucky and it's terrible stats it actually crushes me to have a you know bestowed but not be able to spend it yeah all right don't okay all right all right and maybe don't put very much rare candy and no no I still AM all right mu 2 mu 2 and rayquaza are both such good Legendary's that I'm definitely just gonna dump a bunch of candy anything you hatch or catch a name normal raid non-weather boosted is level 20 and it takes 248 candy to max it out from there so I'm gonna put yeah 275 and mu2 let's just go with that rayquaza I don't have any so well do - I'll do 248 just so that if I want to max out a new one I can do that okay and then of course I'm going in to let wick even though all I have are terrible it works but seriously I'm not hatch to let okay 411 oh my gosh I'm already out hey Chan do you know all right down to 239 I don't really have a super amazing one so I think I'm gonna do like just enough to evolve him and then I'm gonna keep walking him as my buddy I think I'm gonna put a little bit into bagging again we're counting on getting outrage back in December it's giving a 125 yeah all right there we go down to only a hundred rare candy and we've got to go fill up our bags now we have 45 minutes okay we just got downtown to where we're gonna do community day at least for the star Hannah is sacrificing one of her good ones that she hatched realistically she's not gonna get to you Nova stones for a while so but just watch it go from a three star to a one star again this is not guaranteed I'm gonna do my absolute oldest Pokemon I have which is a legacy hitmonchan this one was valuable dude that's all right okay double check it's the right one it is the right one sorry max attack oh man it's good stats okay sorry you ready are we sure we want to do this we're gonna do it let's do a trade confirm please I'm gonna instant access so bad no no is it any good no I mean that's so sad okay you know what this means I just created a baby account the other day I have seven 10k eggs this is my last chance this does have guaranteed lucky trades so I am going to incubate them all today all right this is my last chance these seven 10k eggs if I can somehow get the hatch rate for let wake that Hannah has I might be able to end this day with a lucky let wake at this point I honestly think I could become lucky friends with someone and still not get a lucky Pokemon out of the trade it's crazy okay we have less than three minutes until the madness begins three hours of trapinch spawning everywhere hopefully now I'm going to test out further test out that increased SHINee rate theory where if you buy a clothing item you get more shinies we're gonna test that out right now because I'm going to get something and Hannah is not going to get something and then we're gonna see who comes out with the most Chinese what should I get I'm getting this Charmander hoodie I'm gonna put it on we have a one minute 60 seconds here we go till it starts let's see if I get more Chinese than Hanna does [Music] absolutely insane we just saw all spawns pop up and I just clicked on my very first pok\u00e9mon of Community Day and it is a shiny new traffic this is this isn't good for not good for a theory that's crazy I'm off to a great start [Music] yeah just about a20 trapinch later i got a second shiny [Music] I guess I didn't take into account earlier that I could just hatch a let with myself let's see if this 10k is a lip [Music] for the first time ever Hannah and I are SHINee twins we both got our third we both cut our third shiny and it was the same one 315 315 CP and all right three three we'll see who pulls ahead in the second hour we have just completed the first hour of community day [Music] [Applause] [Music] I think Hannah's phone filled so we might not have a screen recording but she just got three shinies in a row right there three in a row all right a quick update on a very frantic community day I am currently at five shinies on my main account and I think I caught three on my baby account but I have since logged out of that what are you and we're coming up to the two-hour mark it is 1250 at 1:00 p.m. I have an e X right here with my account and my brother's account and so that it's gonna be a shadow ball Mewtwo much more valuable than trapinch so we're gonna do that right and then we're meeting some friends at another e^x right and we're going to do another one right after this and then hopefully we'll have a little bit of time left to do community day but we might not we'll just have to see this is my last chance at a lit wick before the first DX raid matching 110k on my main so be the only one that hatches pharisee it hurts okay let me see let me see we have another 10.3 kilometers we have three minutes I gotta go the x-ray it hatches in five seconds I did manage to get enough distance to hatch my last 10k the x-ray is hatching right now your TV alright I'm going in on you two here we go [Music] got it [Music] don't click honey check on my brother's account [Music] 2317 great no signing on mine 23:48 mine might be okay but overall not what we're looking for nonetheless the Shadow Ball Mewtwo we can always trade it although I don't want to risk trading with how it's been going for us okay cut it on mine we'll check it it's a CPA like his shadow ball oh it's not bad 13 attack 11 defense max HP okay exp to number 2 so I'm gonna be straight honest I got it you Nova stone this morning and I attempted three trades with lit wicks between the accounts no Lucky's nothing good like I literally want to cry I was using 2016 Pokemon and none of them Sony tech going no shiny nice I got like mid stats oh that's good all right we just finished Community Day it is time to count up the shinies are you ready for this here let me let me go first my baby account whoa I got seven on my baby account or no no seven on my main I got the phones mixed up seven on my main six on my baby account [Music] dude considering me like realistically played maybe two hours and a less ideal spot that's pretty good alright so now you have two hours after the three hour event ends to evolve them and get a special move that it can only learn during Community Day so we're going to spend like an hour trading for Lucky's and appraising and transferring and then the next hour the fifth hour doing all of our evolutions we'll get back to you guys in a bit okay we were just headed back up to our car and I am hatching my last chance at getting a let work to evolve I'm hatching a batch of seven 10ks on my baby account my alternate it does have guaranteed lucky trades so if I get something good I can trade it to my main this is my last chance we have tried everything jjt knee in the first give all or something larvae tar it's another good one to get candy for but also not super exciting number three come on and I can guarantee a lucky trade register it's my first one on white it doesn't matter its appraised it anyway Oh it's a 98% 14 15 15 no this was so binary this was so easy if I hats when I'm here and my lucky trade it no matter what no why why is this so hard okay I want to see that the other eggs are maybe will have made me laugh a little bit maybe will hatch another Loic and then you can keep the 98% so number I forget I lost count four or five bailed on them yeah oh yeah we got this next day it's gonna be another Loic please please give me a terrible little Hey no a third larvae tar in the bat so we're still sitting here trading and appraising getting ready to evolve and we just got a lucky trade I wasn't recording while we were trading but check this out no that's that's not that's great I wish it was better than my a better Pokemon [Music] okay walk with me all right let's hit it fine this it's my final 10k the last one I possess and my last chance at not having to sacrifice basically a perfect language please be a little [Music] yes it went lucky I'm gonna praise it right now I already know it's not a fund oh but that's not bad it's 13 and 14 and 12 that's gonna put it in the upper 80s not in the 90s but I will take that let's go ahead right now confirm it what it's going to be a pretty sure it's upper 80s which is still I'm more than fine with maxing that out yeah we are at 87 it's time to max this bad boy out [Music] [Music] level 40 and Sandler there it is it was a painful long day they get to this point [Music] [Music] you", "ylEz13gkGhw": "everybody featured that's enough back with another video crayon whoa check this out look at how thick this is look at how nice it I'll say how nice it feels but well you they can't really feel it but if you guys could feel it you would you you feel that build a rock-hard hundred layers of crayon wall now you guys have probably wondered does see why is it on a shelf well the reason for that is the same reason why that shelf is also bending right now me and Travis wait it wasn't 150 for 150 250 something pounds it was a it was a big deal I'm gonna give you guys a couple seconds to comment down below how many crayons you think it took to make this wall and if you guys get within a thousand I'm gonna give you a heart and you know what guys I would love to tell you that you know I just melted some crayons together put them in a thing in put it on the wall but well that's not exactly what happened here's how it went it's sort of like yeah a great idea I'm gonna make a wall entirely out of crayons so I went and bought 11600 crayons and then it went all the way down in New York to pick them up and I I almost I almost burned my house down this is my floor and that's my oven it's still like that actually then I spent the next 14 hours melting the crayons but finally what was made [Music] [Music] this time here we go blades what are you doing you know I remember what happened last time then we broke down I actually don't here we go what we've been trying to increase the safety on the channel lately you just take this from me I'm gonna go get something softer for all you guys that are gonna come man well there's a piece of wood behind it Dustin that's cheating see this giant gap right here crayons don't bend they just shatter and break so it's as if there's nothing there it's just to hold up the weight that being said I kind of want it to help it but it's just not gonna help okay I see it doesn't matter what color a play-doh you use it will be all don't work Travis won't see damage no I think that's that's damage damage now this should usually be the point where someone says say hello to my little friend in the ironic way and then they bring out the big one this one's actually small you're actually gonna keep that part yep I missed the first try but got you on the first try yeah I see this you know what this flag is it's a Toronto Raptors flag right here comment down below who you guys States gonna win Golden State or the Toronto Raptors I said there was the most satisfying to throw it in this beats that look at that so we can go in okay that works Travis you'll see this right here hitting it or strike ready yep ooh all right I didn't hit it but see that I can't even I actually I can't I was I don't know what I was gonna say but I was I was gonna say I actually didn't think that I hit it but I hit it wait see this though it repairs itself and just like that it's back new weapon I I actually don't even want to use this item Han let's try it on the wall oh it actually worked see this yeah yeah yeah yeah don't we just do it again more damage with it oh my god check for damage would you hit right there right there any damage I don't think so things did more damage to my soul than it did that take hey why'd you throw her to me yeah everyone take it out of you if Daryl was fun you know it's funny blades big couldn't wait cannot look maybe like a frisbee anyways damage assessment I mean look my fingernails have crayon and give them see look at damage damage I don't know where else there is damage and by the way guys you see these little like bits here that's because I got lazy and it was like 4 a.m. and I was getting sick of it so I just melted them inside inside their wrappers hmm I was being honest because I'm honest with my audience because they love me and I love them and that's why if they had a channel I'd smash the like button so smash the like button continue be honest I'm scared about this one you're scared about this one yeah very scared about this one sorry Sam Peter Peter no it didn't break so we can go a bit harder well we just move on to some better here we go oh yeah Travis I want you to answer this honestly what's the greatest xbox game of all time probably heroes wow you're gonna get that one Halo whatever whatever whatever Hey look two brothers ah one ones original Halo 3 3 let's get it ah people these chunks oh yeah Oh looks like your green cheese yeah look he's doing damage but not like a crazy amount like it gets in the like I think the insides harder you know let's try slicing yeah shaving the wall you know that shape in the wall what about what he's called cat claws it goes now claws no Liberec have it better whoa tell me that's not the most satisfying thing University guys get a close-up on this ready oh my god that's so satisfying ASMR I'm just a calmer person that you know what I would even want to destroy things anymore I'm calm now there's nothing worse than a mosquito indoors I was calm now Madigan now with the new and in with the og here we go this stronger than you thought thought I was about to have a four-minute video yeah why is that breaking oh you know where they come up do you have to pass the restaurant they're like huh would you like a little Parmesan cheese and then say when okay one okay enjoy your meal sir you know I'm real scared about this one bunch we just tee up and go at it give it a shot give it a give us swing uh yeah I want to swing harder but if vibrates so bad that kills your hands is it breaking though oh just like mashed it all in it kind of actually made it stronger very repairable sharp sharp we need damage assessments not on the wall but on the poles how did you break the pool very strong what you know what luckily this poles got friends no major damage now one thing you guys don't really know about this or maybe you do if you watch the earlier part of the video is that there's a lot of layer to this okay so right here is you guys can see underneath what colors that it's bread it looks like red and orange and so we know we're getting pretty deep but below that there's blue there's lack there's purple just like a jawbreaker let's work our way down to the next color you don't maybe the right thing to do is just keep slicing it or maybe keep digging dragon play times oh look at that look at that that's a couple layers down looking like shave it that is flying alert I'm just making a mess aren't I yeah oh why do I keep using these it just hurt my hands all the time let's just take these and set them aside even there forever this might be my favorite blade this is the crumpet No maybe I like to think of it as like a philosoraptor cloth you know like velociraptors don't make that's how much I think so they're more like like that yeah I might I might actually end up calling some Raptors over here and although there are other deal right now I'd like to defeat the wall myself shaver oh my god wow wow wow wow pretty good damage assessment we're out Travis we're doing a surprisingly a lot of damage here but you know I'm realizing no matter how much we cut this it's just like little surface wounds you know like we're just we're not doing enough damage deep so I think we got to get something sly sigur yeah BAM it's kind of like a big Khurram bit I think we've never used this part mmm look at that it's a new part ready keep punching it yes oh yeah see the blue we're down to blue okay it's a big deal little wrapper in there little blue okay yeah we got the old and the new I never realized how similarly similarly just similar how similar these are until now look at this this is the old you know we got the Scimitar then we got the new let's give this a shot you know maybe we're going about this all wrong so satisfying though I wish all you guys at home can experience this twelve thousand crayons made into a why would we just shave the top we just spent like three hours shaving it we don't have that kind of I don't know what I'm gonna go get but everything's this way I'll be back all right we tried a lot of things okay I've been holding back on this but now it is time they have a duty Robbins we got this thing the twisty the twisty one see that yeah they see that that right there is solid and I supposed to drop it but well that's not what I want to do see that skull right there with the thing that means business let's get it okay oh it's twisty damaged look at this it goes inside it's like twisty Oh why would you screw it look we can just screw that's so satisfying look at that oh we just stay here and just screw it maybe we'll get through look inside look inside look inside second job breaker you see all the layers mine lie pretty cool what about this end that's more of a it's really next what I'm trying to say that's the blunt force trauma clean boobs I like where you're going with this forgot the most favorite the most important weapon Oh the mallet I mean Thor's hammer Thor's hammer nothing so solid I skipped over it because I was scared that it would break in anything I think no that means are harder like that oh yeah we've never done this before first person mallet throw three two one oh did I miss I was looking for the camera it's not my fault it again I'm so sorry it just move on truth be told I'm really afraid of it my name same issue as the as the thing see that not a lot of wiggle room oh well you know what they say when there's not a lot of wiggle room just don't wiggle I'm cutting my nothin do like this with the layers yeah yeah watch this pow you guys see the green you see the green right they see the green aren't you as excited as I am green okay go deeper you don't like green yeah good fine green blue that's fine you only get two blue yes I'll get the blue let me do this anymore you know Travis if you want down to the blue I'm gonna have to use something that spends most of its time in the blue you get me you get them saying blue like the deep blue sea lotion we got a heart I should be quite a sight you know you're sorry that let's try to get some blue yeah I think it's deep underneath blue hey just you can't see the cuz the holes too small let's give it another shot hmm oh yeah it's blue it's blue see if we just go in here we just dig it out is there a little blue a little little blue watch the blue you see blue oh yeah blue screen aqua aqua blue screen right yeah this is a good time to publicly apologize for one of my other videos if you guys don't know what I was talking about it's because I said this was my keys from the Ninja Turtles I said this was his weapon definitely not his weapon this is Rafael's weapon I played myself at Leonardo's my god here we go I don't even know if it's blue on that oh wow that's a nice ball blast radius craters see this oh yeah not bad oh you see that just like going back and hit me in the ear pieces we should probably wearing a protection but I forgot those at home oh that's that's really sad this is solid steel you know what they say when you break one side if I have to we're gonna have to use well sure I just did there that's cool I wasn't thinking but it worked out maybe that's a thing you want things to work out stop thinking pieces everywhere I think there's crayon on the ceiling case you're wondering when everyone's gone I do the the cleaning you know what miss you just make doors out of crayons Lego houses with crayon doors you guys want me to build a Lego house with crayon doors you know what it is comment it down below and guess what guess what might happen they go clear in do it I just might do it you'll do it we're getting somewhere let's get it okay what you got there try an elf in your other life what is this an elf yeah they like the Lord of the Rings guys they have the double get with that I'm not gonna lie it kind of scares me what do you yo ya guys say welcome back trav I'd even take that in my man's back from his euro trip you got the Tang going okay and apparently you learned how to use a staff knife thing okay okay [Music] chopping cheese it actually kind of looks like you're chopping cheese to be honest I love cleaning cleaning is just like I might I might start a cleaning Channel comes apart I forgot about that we got two blades don't even try to juggle those that's whoa Wow yep yep try stabbing that's not the best stabbing Travis pieces everywhere you gotta lost something in your hair buddy little extra cheese yeah it's still there you what's happening here it is sharp it's just not a sawing Knight and creating some jawbreaker later yeah leverage tearing that bad that one in my mouth Travis can barely you just I think you're just making a mess look at this oh my God look at that guy's to prove that this is solid crayon there's your proof I liked it better when it was a one yeah me too maybe we should get something kind of similar to that but different bigger bigger stronger Oh Travis I just realized you skipped over our time oh my favorite thing damage as you guys could see we chipped out an entire crayon straight out of here it's effective iTunes notes now but I might make it yeah are you gonna swing around yes like my target zone wow that kind of worked out you want to make a clothesline I'm starting to think we can use like really tough stuff man this is surprising me this battle axe is battle tastic I see anything wrong with it what's wrong with it not a lot wrong it's just a little bent okay geez judge much but look if I can't bend it back that means it's solid we're good to go cheese are you really that good Lisa's honest Wow Lola wait I never notice those look like flowers to you guys love it we're about to cut those flowers found another crayon I once watched a show they go top and bottom top I think I made this way too thick Missy there's a lot of crayon here isn't there battle-ax was fun though other battle-ax but not with this one fact not with that one do this well you know what you wanted right blue it's a lot of blue even more blue what's your guys favorite color our crown orange blue blue lay out I never liked this weapon let's just use it you know who you've never given a shot at it [Music] here we go he's afraid he ran away he's good the mace will do it we did he's off the side that we got to break the middle the sides too easy see the layers these are the layers I was talking about look at that papow we're getting somewhere good into anymore here we go look he's starting to cross not all the way through though yeah it's still solid more trauma here we go spear time this is gotta go through oh so close did it really almost all the way through let's whip it all right guys getting closer your mind over the wax if this is all the way through I'll be so happy ready I think we're just gonna have to completely obliterate I think I got the right thing okay Jack's usually here we go right oh my god you think it went all the way through maybe I don't know it's not at the Woodman check the inside you I'm finger assessment it's a blue there's a little blue you went through all the way though I don't know blues not the last layer though it only counts it only counts until it falls off sledgehammer time now I'm not sure but looking at this eat me crack a lot of damage there's a fault here see if we can dig Travis yeah I think it's ready I'm ready all right now I'm ready to give this thing a final blow but guys you know what but you guys know this video took four days to make happen so I think that deserves a like and I have a huge reveal happening on my channel next week that we've been working on for even longer so get those post notifications on and let's paint train the wall that is a huge mess and I'm gonna I'm gonna clean it and I'm blending it boom boom there are my two latest videos if you guys love me please click on one of them and you guys know what I run through cram wall

toxic waste you're gonna get destroyed we're gonna play a game of would you rather I'm gonna be given two prompts just like this would you rather be a superhero and be hated by everyone or have no arms or legs but be loved by all if I pick the least popular answer well that means I have to take a barrel of toxic waste so for this question I would rather be loved by all because love is powerful arms and legs and be loved by everybody why not what this was a demonstration round so obviously that's the least popular answer that means I would have have to take in the the one the not one chip challenge I feel like this is even worse so all right so let's let's get started shall we let's do it question number one would you rather toilet paper a house or egg a house hmm this one's kind of hard I just want to pick the most popular answer I feel like a lot of people who want a TP a house just because it's fun like throwing it like a toilet paper and then seeing a roll and unravel so I'm gonna say toilet paper house is good dude this is the only the first question I got wrong you would rather throw eggs at a house you don't have any chickens that is a lot but then toilet paper you know how many trees you know how many trees all right well I guess we'll get straight to it so it looks like this this is pretty sour if you have ever had a warhead it's pretty bad but this is like

yeah it's got my little pony my own always be in my heart my little pony my teeth are so dry it can squeak here like that is wild like all that toxic waste made my teeth so dry if I grind my teeth it makes a sound it's like wild dude it's weird oh just a life fact it's pretty cool too when you eat toxic waste you can prank your friends cuz your teeth are so dry that yo watch yourself I can crack my nose but you're actually like destroying your teeth so it's not it's not worth it okay we're moving I would you rather die slowly but not much pain or die fast with a lot of pain I feel like if you die fast you just don't feel pain yeah I would die fast huh does it I don't get it I mean I get it like would you die slowly like what if you die slowly for like an hour rather than you die fast in like 10 seconds like oh come on come on all right you know what that means another barrel of the toxic waste so there's like different kinds of like time limits here if I put it in my mouth and leave it there for 60 seconds I am a full Toxie head here we go whoa Wow I did it it was so bad I feel like I lost two teeth doing that how my teeth oh wow I feel you got worse bro I can crack my ears look

you will find your place meditate do your thing and then when you get back you're just a new person same with jail though - I'm not saying I want to go to jail I'm just saying there are benefits to going to jail I'm a live in the mountains you're right there you go see oh yeah yeah I was like the lights are freakin out see look 3232 percent of people agree with me they probably thought the same

sucks cuz you can't really sit on a chair you see this your knees look like this alright so I don't know honestly I used my knees more than my elbows cuz I'm always walking so if I'm walking differently that would affect my whole upper body where my elbows only affect my arm so I would rather have my elbows facing the opposite direction good job alright let's keep doing this would you rather eat only buffalo wings for the rest of your life or drink only buffalo sauce for the rest of your life well I would I mean honestly I would rather eat the buffalo wings cuz who would want to

strong gotta get this dub man we got some good sleep last night it's gonna go far yeah bye every hour i'm gonna lay a strip of tape and block off your circle and whenever someone gets out we go back

how about my can of beans i'm gonna go home bye guys carl what happened did you like i lost that's what happened tariq bye [Music] this video of a baby biting another baby's finger has 875 million views and i would argue what we're doing is better than a baby biting a baby's fingers which means this video should get over 875 million views and thus resulting in the winner getting over 870 thousand dollars for winning now i'm not saying that's gonna happen but i am saying this is way more entertaining than a baby biting a baby how many challenges have you been in every one that's ever happened except for probably like five of them and how many did you do you think you won enough did you just say enough no i said not enough oh i don't know man we heard enough i'd be lying if i didn't say i was getting a little bored i would take all the winnings from this and give it to my parents i'm not quitting this challenge no matter what second time in the last leaf challenge another

someone's gotta get out what do i do uh smaller circles we're all standing there all right there we go my legs are wobbly right now this might be confusing but that's his new circle that's his new circle and that's tariq's new circle it is now much harder guys my feet hurt i just wanted to put that out there knees are hurting my arms are weak mom's [Music] spaghetti [Music] that feels amazing wow is it harder now it's slimy i hope you understand how much better this position you have to stand on eggshells [Music] i don't know what to say he's out why'd you push me i didn't push you if carl pushed him that's sabotaging chris's end but if carl didn't push him and chris is out you can't put your hands on the ground let's review the tape did you push him i don't think so oh yeah i've cost you a lot of money thank you for costing me money you've cost carl well over two hundred thousand dollars in challenges so it's only fair he takes a hundred grand sorry mom i love you it sucks that i got out that way but mom there's gonna be other challenges i promise you it's coming for you final two me tariq this was our plan the whole time but it shouldn't have taken four days because i'm tired i'm really tired knees looking a little wobbly this feels weird bye wait chandler [Music] he didn't wait don't let their hard work go the ways please watch this video a bunch of times so we're still

guys a candy wrapper craft we are going to be making candy wrapper link jewelry the folding and weaving method used to create these is more generally known as the gum chain-link but you can make bracelets or necklaces and that looks real cool over my hair or earrings but I have a separate video on these basically you just need a bunch of candy wrappers and I know a lot of you have been asking me why people send me candy wrappers in my mail videos and why I save candy wrappers it is because I like to craft with them um that's pretty much all I want to intro first you need to choose which kind of candy wrapper you're going to use I use starburst wrappers and most of my projects that's why you see more of those than anything else but you can also use gum wrappers dumb gum wrappers Tootsie Pop and now ladies and tootsie rolls starburst wrappers work really well because of their dimensions and because of their consistency it's kind of a waxy paper II mix crinkly plastic wrappers like this will not work paper gum wrappers will work but they will fade quicker and probably ripped more quickly than other types of more waxy wrappers if you're using a really big or really square wrapper you might want to put a starburst wrapper on it and cut it to the exact size of that now ladies are about the same dimensions but the same with Tootsie Pops in tootsie rolls you want to cut those down to the size of a starbursts wrapper for this bracelet you'll need a lot of links so there's a lot of folding to do I used to be a bad kid a little rebel and I would fold these in class secret secret seriously this is a good thing to do when you're just sitting around maybe talking with your friends or if you're going on a vacation and you have a long car ride my wrist is pretty small so it takes me about 24 links to make a bracelet that fits me well with the safety pin closure as you can see the one in the middle is a lot brighter than the other two that's because I wore the other two a lot and they do wear out over time but I wore them a lot so you get good use out of them and you know they're really cheap and simple to make a small pack of starbursts has 12 candies inside so you may want to buy large bags and share them with your friends because a lot of you ask me if I eat a lot of starbursts and no the answer is I don't really like candy I make people eat them for me and save the rapper's the folding process is really simple start out with a flat candy wrapper fold it in half to find the exact middle unfold it and then fold both sides to that middle crease and over like that then you're going to repeat that step to make it even skinnier by folding over the edges to the middle again make sure that your creases are very sharp so push down pretty hard when you're folding these then fold this in half at this point you want both ends to meet push down open it back up and fold the ends to that middle crease like that and then you fold this in half and you have a link as you can see every link has four layers or two loops they kind of look like little hearts very cute these are actually old links that I took off of this bracelet because I'm going to be showing you how to finish this off a newly folded link like this won't have as prominent of loopholes once you have enough links you're going to start weaving them together take your wrapper and stick the two ends of the next wrapper into those loops in you're going to alternate which way you stick them in to get the zigzag effect so I stuck the green one at the top of the pink I'm going to stick the blue one through the bottom of the green then I'll stick the pink through the top of the blue doing the same thing every time just putting the two ends through the two loops and then you're just going to continue doing this until you have your desired length of chain to finish off your bracelet you need to poke a hole in the end you can do this with a safety pin you have to make sure to get through all four layers of your wrapper one person commented on my starburst wrapper earring video a long time ago said it would be really easy if you have a sewing machine to just put these wrappers under the needle and then you can turn the knob and the needle will do all the work for you so try that and then you're going to poke a hole on the other end as well so you can join it together if you're using a safety pin this is all you do and then you're done but I'm going to show you how to add jump ring and a clasp jump rings come in different sizes there are smaller and bigger ones than these you can get them in the jewelry making or finding section of any craft store and sometimes places like Walmart and Meijer have craft aisles as well and I like to have two pairs of pliers to help me open these just place the pliers on either side and open up like so then you take your bracelet and feed the end through the hole once your jump ring is through all four layers of the wrapper you're going to decide if you want it to be a toggle clasp or a type of lobster or spring ring clasp lobster clasps are my favorite so I'm just threading this on and then I'm going to close the jump ring back up to complete this bracelet all you have to do is add another jump ring to the other side thread that through the clasp of choice and then you're all done and you can wear it whenever you want I know I said I don't eat a lot of candy but I just thought it would be a fun question to ask you guys what your favorite candy flavors are my favorite dum-dum flavors are blue raspberry and cream soda my favorite gum is cinnamon by far and also extra dessert delights and then my favorite starburst flavors are strawberry cherry and blue raspberry fries I don't know if you can still get that but it was so so good thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you end up making your own starburst or candy wrapper link bracelet or jewelry piece then post a picture

video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but

asmr videos subscribe and turn on the notification go chat with me on discord because i am really lonely right now but yeah bye", "nCq0WpkdA7Q": "today's video is sponsored by kiwico we're not satisfied with the so-called world's largest gummy worms so we're going to make our own that's a lot bigger so we have some stuff today ah i like gummy worms gumballs are pretty great i know a lot of people like gummy worms gummy worms are probably my family's favorite snack to have on the long car ride but it just could be bigger you can already buy bigger versions of gummy worms this right here is like a three pound gummy worm and i gotta say this is a good step up but i think we can do better here's the basic idea using the gummy candy recipe that we've shown you in the past we're going to make an enormous gummy worm almost four feet long i'm eating this and it's sour it's just making me salivate it's hard to talk i'm just letting it happen following the trend of the three pound gummy worm we're going to take things up to over four feet long and so here you can see we've got a piece of corrugated pipe and this is where we're going to be making our gummy worm in so it'll be about four inches tall over four feet wide did you dip this in extra malic acid malic acid is a sour powder that's often used in sour candies oh you actually tried it yeah i didn't think that was gonna happen i was gonna take one for the team to try it but he just went for it oh wow that's sour guys real sour all right so here's the idea we're going to prep our corrugated tube yep then we're going to start making our gelatin candy and we're just going to fill we're going to do the red and blue variety so we've got some red jello some blue jello our corn syrup and we've got some gelatin we're just gonna be making the normal recipe and we're gonna fill the two sides with the red and the blue we've got some domes these were like christmas ornament make your own christmas ornaments come into handy so many times we actually use these in uh the giant skittles they're a great size they're just gonna fit right on the side here we're going to use hot glue to attach them which should be great this recipe works really well if you're trying to get a very clear pour on stuff by just letting it sit removing all the bubbles skimming it and if you really want you can like pour it into a glass and let it cool down and cut off we don't actually need it to be perfectly clear none of these gummy sour worms that we have are clear so if it has a little bit of opacity to it that's not a problem for us all right while we're getting that gummy cooking we want to show you some crates that we got from kiwico guys these are amazing kits especially if learning at home is better for you now these kits come with everything that you're going to need for the month's project so you're not going to have to have any additional runs to the store to get supplies guys these kits are fantastic my niece and my nephews absolutely love these and they build them every month i've put a few of them together myself and i gotta say even for me they're kind of fun stuff to play with guys kiwico makes amazing holiday gifts if you want to get your first month free head on down to the description and click the link there or go to kiwico.com [Music] tkor [Music] [Music] i like it all right this is fantastic and it's a lot of heat so we're gonna just let this cool until tomorrow yeah we did it it's been overnight this is set it's nice and nice and solid gummy i mean it's squishy but it's solidified squishy not liquid squishy all right let's see if we can actually get this to peel apart yeah [Music] oh my gosh this is ridiculous yeah [Laughter] gummy worm gummy worm oh no oh yeah oh that looks so good oh my god what color variation we have the malic acid we gotta make it sour this is ridiculous all right i'm very happy with our results of our gummy worm i admit we could have gone with something to add opacity to it and then it would look more like it when i first thought giant gummy worm my thought was like the clear gummy worms that aren't like the sour ones i was looking at the giant ones i was like oh they have like a sour giant one that's even better so i got that we didn't change our recipe for that but i'm still very happy with it it is a giant gummy worm that's fantastic i want to do taste tests oh well that surface acid it's not identical but it's similar it really is pretty much the same as like normal gummy worms the clear kind of boy matt flower gets you it will right about now it's so good well we've got our giant gummy worm and we need to put it to a couple tests for strength so i want to grab one end of it and just spin around in a circle and see how well it holds together first i want to see if we can both like how far we can stretch it oh it's so oh the malic acid just dissolves gooey outside i don't think we'll be able to hold on to it well enough to tear it let's try i don't want it i just want to see if it's oh it's straight it is stretching and my hands are like just sliding down all right you want to just swing this thing around i do i do i want to just okay we've got a tear right there so well that might be where it tears oh 21 pound gummy worm here goes [Music] no no no no no no no no it's gross wait i'm gonna try this side i actually don't think i can lift it that way here this part's gonna tear off and then it will weigh less there it is and it's covered in grass now yeah all right the only way i can hold on to it was by digging my hands into it stabbing it yes that didn't work so well yeah [Music] i want to see if we can swing and smack the pieces of gun like a sword fight oh your your weapon's falling apart if i can tear to an inside part i'll take a bite out of it i can't and it's covered in it's actually remarkably tear resistant there we go that's just inside part it's bite resistant gross it's hard to bite your injury you're right high five yeah i hated that i'm gonna try and toss it do it oh it worked kind of thought it was just going to stick does if i do a little toss it sticks okay i think i'm i'm tapping out it's getting stickier i can't i'm dressed i'm done i'm i'm out here you go cow no no thank you again for today's sponsor kiwi code guys if you want to get your own kiwi coke kits head down

however do not burn at a constant rate so you don't know that half the rope burns in 30 minutes or that X percent of the rope burns an x percent of the time the problem for you is how can you measure 45 minutes by burning the ropes now some of you may have heard this problem so in this video I'm going to pose a variation how can you measure 50 minutes by burning the ropes give these problems a try and when you're ready keep watching the video for the solution so it takes a little bit of ingenuity to measure 45 minutes I'm going to explain the steps first and then I'm going to show you how it works in a little animation the key is we start by lighting the ropes in three different places at the same time we'll light one end of one rope and both ends of the other rope the rope which has two flames is going to burn two times as fast as it normally would so it's going to burn up in 30 minutes at this point the other rope will have 30 minutes remaining on it so you then light the other end of that rope and that will give you a rope which is burning two times as fast as it normally would so that remaining rope will burn up in 15 minutes so if you add up to 30 minutes and the 15 minutes you get a total of 45 minutes from start to end so let's see how this works we start by lighting the ropes in three places we light one end of one rope and both ends of the other rope now we'll let the flames go the rope which had two flames on it is going to burn two times as fast so at that point thirty minutes have elapsed at exactly that moment you want to start a flame at the other end of the other rope so this rope which should burn in 30 minutes with a single flame will now burn two times as fast because it has two flames so this rope will burning in 15 minutes 30 plus 15 gets you 45 minutes from start to end so now let's tackle the next problem how can we measure 50 minutes we already know how to measure 30 minutes we light one rope at both ends this rope will burn up in 30 minutes so the question is how do we measure 20 minutes the key is that if one row burns in 30 minutes when it has two flames the same rope will burn in 20 minutes when it has three flames going so how are we going to get three flames going well we're going to use a little trick we're going to like the rope at one end and we're also going to light it somewhere in the middle the flame in the middle is actually going to split off in both directions so that's how you're going to end up getting three flames on this rope so this rope which would burn in 60 minutes with a single flame is now going to burn in one-third the time it's going to burn in 20 minutes with three flames now two of the flames may end up meeting and I'm going to show you what to do in that case you actually just like the rope in another spot but if you do this correctly you're going to measure 20 minutes and then 30 plus 20 is equal to 50 so let's see how this works so we start by lighting one rope at both of its ends we already know how to do this this is going to measure 30 minutes exactly when this rope burns out you want to light the other rope in two different places you light it at one end and then you light it somewhere in the middle so three flames are going to come from that now if what I showed you just happened where you have two of the flames meeting you're only going to end up with one flame remaining on the rope so what you then do is you repeat this by lighting this somewhere in the middle now that middle flame is going to split off into flames so you keep on lighting the rope so that you always have three flames going if you do this in the limit you're going to measure that this rope is going to burn three times as fast so it's going to burn in 20 minutes and therefore you have 30 plus 20 which equals 50 minutes did you figure it out thanks for watching this video please subscribe to my channel I make videos on math and game theory you can catch one on my blog mind your

"yAeWaBFs5PM": "[Applause] I'm solid still worried I almost always hurt myself in every video but not this video I almost did but I didn't anyways like I was saying we got a hundred pairs of solid steel ball here this is basically like really let me just show you I got these aluminum foil sort of they're not aluminum foil it's like really thick sort of sharp metal here that could probably cut yeah so I wore gloves when I did it I can explain how I did it or or I can just show you so let's show you I got presents for parents or parents or parents or parents and brothers I saw by my brother the money the press would be calling my blessings up to 30 is back tell me I'm puppets and public deciding that's why I call it bone impression the solids I wanted to fall in affection at some because checkup eleazar eleazar eleazar eleazar eleazar eleazar sabor my brother them thick thick to to see Stipe thick you know how I said that in another video but I don't know if you guys all got it now yeah the layers are like on top of each other usually I do like a crossing pattern for this song I just found later and then put it straight in with gold I'm really afraid to getting cut this video one like equals one prayer that this isn't Facebook but I like what damage was you guys to see right here we got ourselves a little bit of damage okay not a lot of damage like this isn't gonna get through this let's get discovered next up we got the ninja throwing sorta a kunai not cool oh cool you don't know anything about this do you know then watch out what I nicked the bottom of it it didn't split I kind of hot out of its but anyways next up we got these what are these called can claws hand claws forget nails on a chalkboard your this there's a faint little oh my god look at that I made like I don't know if this is like a pencil shaving but metal a metal shavings middle do you think that that would make sense but Lucas you know those movies were like Catwoman or superwoman not superwoman Chris doesn't have cause like Catwoman when characters of metal claws claw through and like they miss like attacking some guy's face and going like that yeah myth tested factual I mean what do they call it when the myth is busted well the other one myth confirmed confirmed confirmed all right so for this next weapon we're gonna continue to stay on the ninja theme okay you see this you guys guys know what this is they probably can't even tell cuz I'm flicking the cameras off it's a ninja blade we're gonna throw it just realize that it's not a throwing star it's a throwing knife it probably didn't go in because I dishonored it that kind of went in it well my god these work I'm throwing another one like is there any way we can edit that and make it seem like I hit the wall impossible you know we'll just thought we'll just cut that part we'll just tell ya closer here into our little you know damage assessment we can see that there's a hole through one to a couple there's not the whole thing but a couple there's you know what let's actually do some real damage with that but stop talking we're throwing for once comment down below how many you think are gonna go in if you get it right I'll give you a heart three two one [Music] none like this there's gonna be a whole lot of zeros in the comments see it now alright now maybe just cuz you know the throwing knives they just didn't have enough weight they weren't big enough see this you know what this is it's a really big throwing knife we're about to throw it it's huge it's actually kind of like it scares me let's get it wait the Veco through a ticket did no I literally thought like legitimately just went through it completely blew through turns out it didn't even go in it it just put a dent in it and my knife made me a broke it did the tip is uh but the tip has seen better days then I reckon fix this I don't think alright you know I'm starting to think ok we kind of use projectiles but we didn't use true projectile so let's get a true projectile here we go three two one you can't see it do my finger is pitching the skin actually actually I actually don't know how to get this off what I do Oh am i bleeding no oh I just pinched the skin but it's red but it's red and you guys know that means it hurts I gotta have the worst aim of my other words yeah so we shot a hex bolt not this sort out of was this cold no nuts isn't that I don't even I don't know either here we go hit right here and put a dent in it and there's a dent damage not even close identity come on dance dance damage again it's not damaged eggs nother okay let's make some damage make some damage you know I think we're going about this all wrong if the wall is metal you know why it conducts metal a lock conducts metal I can have you know what I like what electricity metal conducts electricity that's what I meant but we got electricity I don't I don't like these things I make me part mosquito I just get us why isn't working what if it's like barks fire if I touch the balls why why okay you know okay I'm being a little bit of a baby it didn't hurt that bad it was my finger you know like when you get like I need like a ruler slapped on your finger or any thicker it's kid hurt my inside let's just move on back to the basics we got a flail there used to be three balls on this flail but well this is not one of my favorite weapons it's awful in the flails breakout I'm scared here we go you yours hurting that I didn't even know where you were silent there's damage though right now I don't even see where I did is that worry no it's not no it's not it's not I actually don't think it is alright I can't tell where I hit so I gotta hit it again that's weird right yeah yeah okay so look at this okay there's some serious damage it's definitely not all the way through but uh okay looking good looking good find more things that are clearly laelia oh not clearly it's not it's uh well it's kinda it's not like a flail but it's from the same time as a flail I don't really know this is just the next weapon that was in the bin that I saw let's hope it does let's why did I tie it to my wrist I want to get rid of this not hold it let's just try it do you hear that oh my god did it do any damage the top where thank you this is it no it's not this is like a bent lasagna tray right here you know what I'd like to call that damaged but I'm not too sure and I'm not willing to risk using this thing any longer let's just next weapon you don't want okay maybe we were actually onto something with the whip because it's like rope and it swings you see what I'm getting at I see ropes rope swing not a grappler running swing this is actually one of my favorite weapons is from the 5-star versus once there are Amazon weapons let's give it a shot here we go by almost hey you can also edit that out right yeah I can I'm being honest that might have done some damage but the Rope burned my hand who actually uses these ninjas that's who I thought I could do that I couldn't I'm not a ninja okay I'm a little bit of a ninja but not not that kind of ninja come over Spartan but he'd hate like sideways I didn't need the sharp-tipped first so we're gonna make a sharp tip hit first three two one I didn't do it I go flat yeah you know maybe sometimes Spartans throw underhand it's that way okay nice and slow Spartan training right here three two one please something I didn't hit sideways hits it sideways did it do damage kinda this OH we're just putting little holes in everywhere but we're not getting all the way through no I'm starting to think we it's part enough the layers may just shatter and go hit the floor you know think of it I mean yeah you know I think it's time to kick it back to the basics so we got the og back what did I say you look at that don't lay oh no people have been calling me a baby in the comments I'm not a baby it hasn't hurt my fingers not bleeding let's let's hit it again look at that he's the best thing about these battle cameras is oh my god doesn't your best bro kid get a new one I do have a new one first of all but this one how does a special something to it cuz look when it hits it actually scratches as well yeah and you can also stab oh I should get the new bat yeah get the new bus get the new battery got the new bat ah too bad the new bat house veteran I'll give it that Thank You vit that too hey thank you guys there you see this you know this is what since when do I throw a weapon and then tell you what I did I tell you what I do that all the time actually I yeah I do so well let me just do that then I'm gonna throw it and tell you what it is I was gonna say that's a mace but apparently it's a boomerang why does everything hit sideways okay who's not blunt-force trama wasn't worth it look at this like a car wreck it's just like bending all the back it's still not broken in any way whatsoever what if we are this is like a basically a boom you know I'm talking about a wrecking ball a wrecking ball Jeremy is risking life and limb let me just uh this is my guy Jeremy he's on camera today Travis is in Italy and uh well I just I almost broke broke this guy's face you're it um yeah yeah he's all right yeah all right well show him some love one more one more there's no damages there next weapon ain't no hammer time like sledgehammer time here we go wow you know that's really not how people normally swing sledgehammers they don't like vault them well I don't know throw them like that but it's pretty effective are you starting to think we're just compressing it we are well let's compress it some more then now the only thing that would make this sledgehammer better is if it was a line-x ledge hammer yeah see that new [Applause] [Music] we need to find a way to fuse those two we do we do damage assessment yeah yeah as you guys could see here we got a little bit of Dan but whose voice is that somebody talks like it's the same we talk like that who well we're starting to get a whole lot of damage the layers are starting to separate here but well there's a lot more in there than you think and you know I'm supposed to pain train this at some point yeah it gets weaker is it ever gonna get weaker I don't even think so oh geez maybe you need to take care of things yourself that's not working let's try again oh not a good idea you know feet and kicks are one thing but just don't punch metal walls just don't do it if you were thinking about it maybe just don't I don't think anyone who's thinking that no no all right now it seems like we tried you know everything on this wall we tried short things and one things and I even I've attacked it myself and you know what I'm starting to think maybe we eat something that's been through what this walls been through in order to break it I wonder if there's anything like that in here that's right we got the unbreakable box more clearly it is breakable if you pour liquid nitrogen on it and beat it for a bunch of hours or if you use a tank against it or if you drop it on a giant Thor's hammer off it from a 45 meter tower I'm ranting because I sent this box to a billion people and and we'll most of them broke into it but just know we're working on a stronger one and we may be sending it out to more youtubers coming soon but for now the box is a weapon that let's break the ground but wall looking a little curvy a little curvy mmm okay we're getting somewhere I think it's time to try something different time to get serious no more of whatever that is let's get back to regular weapons somebody you don't know I totally thought I was gonna miss but I'm really close close let's get some of this more accurate tomahawk that felt pretty good this is gonna feel better it's axe time did the sharp side hit or did the blunt side hit I think the blunt side either way bigger axe no let's actually swing this one who is right oh I plug this here in swing I said this was gonna go through and did it come over here with a bigger ax apparently the size of the axis doesn't doesn't rip doesn't really matter but what I wish you guys saw his face is deer was in his eye here but what if that act has two sides and it's a rated a five-star weapon on Amazon huh what dad find out oh no oh no no no this axe is literally like a hundred dollars oh you see that yeah part of the axe may be broken part of my ear drum may be broken but as you guys could see here see that we're in deeper and deeper we're in deep trouble is what we are in because that's not enough damage for me to run through this what we're gonna do I don't know they remember earlier when I jumped off the wall and threw the thing inside like Spartans better yeah that was like baby Spartan oh god I can barely carry that this is like real I'd imagine this spear would like no way it weighs as much okay maybe it did weigh that much and they were just super jacked super big Greek people but I'm gonna give it a shot here we go it hit it sideways again they did how we're through like a solid how many layers you think that is that's like five layers huh I see it down I think it's five you think it's free we're gonna go three her why not why not Jeremy yeah what do we do if I don't even know well definitely not the same weapon same same move the same weapon same same result that's yeah that makes sense okay now you know what I'm starting to think okay we need to try a weapon on these walls that we've never tried on these walls ever before a weapon that we know works really good I'm talking about the heart food three two one oh my god here we go three two one it wasn't loaded Oh almost almost oh it definitely put a hole in it you think you can even get through one layer I'm gonna separate this layer it separated let's try that again they get through a layer but today it didn't really do the fish cookie pop thing you know I think it's technically on the harpoon underwater I'll bug the ground you know what we call this what a javelin ah it's better than her first time food dragon blades here we go you know what this is doing like little damage everywhere but my hands are in just as much pain there's no handles on those you know what I think the next weapon is right in front of our eyes we got the table it cook through that room via prom bedrooms it right I think Wow okay this is sure see this okay maybe maybe that's a really strong section looks like the monster logo yeah it does ah Jeremy yeah I actually bent my wrist over the big grommet I believe it's going through it sharper here we go oh I'm pretty deep it did swing harder but is there any point anymore we're just moving may as well make bigger holes do this anymore okay if I'm gonna go out up with knives I'm gonna go at it with my very best knife we got the twisty knife twisty twisty see that yeah this thing is scary this is like a $150 knife I got I don't even know where I got it here we go just saying the most progress we've made all day I'm also just saying my hand hurts nobody cares I love this look at the type of damage it does hold see that like a triangle like yeah we're making shapes here making shapes here geometry that's is that cool yeah yeah I love geometry comment down below if you guys loved y'all everybody loves yummy one like it now from the creators that brought you this spinny night we got the spear not a spinny spear but it's really solid and it's really sharp I think this is going through here we go ready I wasn't a Spartan before I'm Spartan now ah I just destroyed my vocal cords Jeremy yeah can you see through there oh I see through there see through it yeah oh you know what that means right you can break it a little you can break it a lot ah nothing is better than this Wow look at that you see that Jeremy sees that it's diamonds a diamond you're right think I see some other things over there they may go through his wall I had to do that one last time you know what that's fair besides this metal fire it's just gonna heat it awesome this weapon has never failed me against a safe or any wall time for pickaxe is it through budget it's the roof it is through that is what I'm talking about we're going straight through why because well this is a pickaxe and never fails here we go again oh yeah oh you know movements exactly like this one it makes you realize I love my job and you guys make me able to do this job so you know that means they know what that means they know I love you guys now if you guys really thought we weren't gonna get through this wall do you even know me [Music] I cut myself up like crazy now if you guys like this video if you want to do well boom boom there to my lady's video click one of those in this video is gonna do a whole lot better I love you guys and whether I'm patron or not I always like sleep on a high note love you", "gRa-zgjSsuk": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

an interesting one that's what happened with sue for example her best friend has a little gift for her today that's so sweet thank you pinky we have to open the box now that look doesn't bode well is this another prank from pinky it's all beautifully packaged but this paper will have to be removed to get to the most important thing the gif wait there's another layer of wrapping and another one pinky's having a lot of fun don't be nervous it won't be long before you find out what the gift is what wouldn't you do for a fancy gift from a friend even sit for an hour unwrapping those rustling layers of paper how many of these are there a hundred the present has sure gotten a lot smaller when will it end yay sue did it she finally freed the gift from the cocoon of wrapping paper come on pinky are you serious a plastic bug sue really doesn't seem to appreciate the gift presentation or the gift itself pinky is upset she tried so hard to be a stinker sue is determined to teach her friend a lesson a 100 layers challenge yeah for 24 hours we'll solve all conflicts with this challenge oh that's a serious dare pinky spends at least an hour a day combing her hair sue isn't thrilled about that everything around her turns into a graveyard of fallen hair they get everywhere even on the tangerine ugh pink curls are gorgeous of course but they just don't taste good it's time for decisive action let's take out that sign hopefully a hundred rubber bands will tame your hair pinkie's not happy about that but it deals the deal oh there's a whole collection of cute colored rubber bands let's start with two ponytails nice hairstyle but pinkie doesn't really like her maybe put on 98 more and you'll feel better using that many hair accessories is no joke hair tie after hair tie it's taking so long [Music] finally the last rubber band how do you like the result yeah well you definitely have 100 rubber bands in your hair no effect but pinky kind of looks like she just escaped the circus also it's not very comfortable sue is happy though not a single hair will fall from pinkie's head now this burger looks delicious i'm about to go in on it eating your lunch while your friend is hungry and lurking around she doesn't want to share either oh yeah what about our challenge that's right you are about to make a 100 layer burger right now yeah sue gets to work no big deal just a 100 layer burger she's so hungry she need an elephant a bun a patty a piece of cheese some salad and keep going until the burger tower grows even pinky is hesitating this tower won't hold up on a plate she'll have to help her friend and sue is already at the very top she covered her burger with a hundredth bun lunch is served we can finally eat this girl clearly has a good appetite pinky is very proud of her friend wow to build such a tall burger they must have just set a world record is soup really full okay you can finish the rest on your own wait that's not fair this tower needs a little support sue's dressing table is in complete order all the brushes and makeup are in place sue is so neat but as soon as pinky trespasses into this territory chaos follows her there she goes leaving a trail of destruction in her wake pinky is too late to cover up the crime the mystery is solved the punishment won't make you wait 100 false eyelashes on your eyelids and not a layer less that's cruel sue but the girl is relentless you'll have to do this crazy beauty experiment the false eyelashes look so cute but what will happen to pinkie's eyes a little later after 100 layers at this rate she'll use up her entire stack of false eyelashes very quickly but she has to serve her sentence that's probably what they call luxurious length except you can't see anything at all help someone lift my eyelids for me let pinkie have her fun with false eyelashes and sue's having a home spa treatment right now but how can you relax with pinky wandering around it's the 100 layers challenge remember the false eyelashes girl you owe me 100 layers of patches what a cruel revenge but sue has a whole jar of fresh patches at her disposal they make the perfect moisturizing face mask great 99 patches already in place the final touch the lip patch it's not a punishment it's a gift such a relaxation for the skin it's time for a warm bath what's a spa without water treatment sue's nails are almost done she spent forever making them look nice great here comes pinky she's not a friend she's a hurricane oh look at those nice nails they look fresh out of the salon oh no my nail polish it's still wet pinky you ruined everything honey you know what punishment you are getting 100 false fingernails have mercy hiding those beautiful nails under the tip is a crime but sue's adamant tears won't convince her here are the nails and here's the glue let's go nail by nail layer by layer and gradually the charming manicure turns into a beauty nightmare you can't go on a date looking like that and by the way 100 false nails are so heavy he's like a sledgehammer how do you take it all off now zoo's been on the phone with her boyfriend for an hour and pinky by the way has an important business here she seems to know how to take her friend's mind off the phone the 100 layers challenge specifically 100 layers of screen protectors on your phone here's the film you're welcome well you know you can't say no you are the one who came up with the challenge the test has begun turns out zoo is really good at putting safety glass on screen everything is perfectly straight but it's a very tedious task even decided to take a nap but it's time to evaluate the work that's right 100 layers a futuristic smartphone so original it's still thinner than phones from two decades ago but there's a bigger problem the sensor doesn't respond a touch how do i answer the phone now or sue but a challenge is a challenge pinky sometimes forgets her manners her gum games and constantly bursting bubbles are very annoying but today sue has a chance to teach her friend the rules of good behavior pinky the waxing paste is waiting for you since you love anything sticky you are going to love this punishment 100 layers no pinky does not love this punishment still she'll have to go for this beauty torture she has agreed to the strange rules of this multi-layered game one two three layers pinky already has an impressive mound of waxing strips on her arm and now it's time to tear this miracle off her arm oh it hurts so bad are you happy friend no no get it away from me zoo's going to keep her distance from those sticky strips the eternal problem so many clothes and nothing to wear sue has been standing in front of the mirror for so long but she still hasn't decided what to wear to go to a cafe with pinky and pinky's getting impatient but it looks like it's going to take a long time i can't wear this or this or this so stop i know what will stop this fashion rain the 100 layers challenge sue put on a hundred layers of clothes yay outfit problem solved but for some reason sue isn't happy with pinkie's intervention so the makeover has begun pinkie's not just going to stand by of course she'll help her friend it's so hard to put all this on all the clothes in the house come in handy you have to think about style tops and pants and of course you need a hat it's chilly outside today 99 100. that looks good on you sue you look killer kind of like billy eilish maybe it's just a little hot and it's hard to breathe fine you can go take it off it happens to pinky too she can't pick a pair of socks to go on her walk in the park stripes that's the question girl hurry up it's time to go it's so easy to choose socks but for pinky it's an insoluble dilemma there's only one way out of this situation the 100 layer challenge 100 socks on one foot now oh no oh no we are going to be late at least we don't have to think about what to wear you can just take all your socks in a row yeah pinky's got socks for every taste uh-huh okay just one sock left oh done even a book cast would look more elegant than this how do you expect to walk in the park looking like that she's gonna need a little help from sue did you like our multi-layered challenge let us know some other challenges for pinky and sue in the comments be sure to give this video a thumbs up subscribe to

Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. It's time for the pulley episode. These are like my favorite\nthings in the whole world. I bought this one, it looks\nlike it goes to a boat or something like that. Pulleys are one of these things that everybody knows about. They know that somehow, a pulley will give you mechanical advantage, but people don't really understand it. We all pretend like we do, but the person that really shows up,\nand is really clever, and they arrange it in the perfect way and they just make things work, that's like the smart person\nthat everybody wants to be. So today, on Smarter Every Day, we're gonna make a video about pulleys, and we're gonna slowly\nwalk through how they work. And specifically, I wanna introduce you to my favorite type of pulley,\nit's called the snatch block. They're really fancy, they can do tricks. Okay, let's start by picking\nup these cinder blocks. My kids are gonna show you\nhow to pick up blocks, right? If you have to pick something up, you have to pick up all of\nthe weight of the thing, and, whether you know it or not, all of the weight of you. How you doing, good?\n- Good. - You can put it back down. How hard was that? Not that bad? The magic of a pulley is\nreally the magic of a rope, because a rope is always in\ntension, you can't push a rope. If you pull on this side of the rope, that force transfers all\nthe way through the pulley, so you basically can redirect the force. That is the primary function\nof a pulley, redirecting force. (child grunts)\nThat's pretty good, how was it? - Hard. - The pulley changes the\ndirection of your body weight, so you can use your own body weight to help you pick something up. Very good, was that hard? Not as hard.\n- Not as hard. - Not as hard as what?\n- Just picking it up. - Okay, so it's easier to\npick it up with the pulley because you can kind\nof lean into it, right? - Yes sir.\n- Right. - So this is the part that\nstarts to confuse people. If you can change the way\nthe pulley are arranged, you can make it even\neasier to pick this up. Do you want the normal\npulley, or the snatch block? - The snatch block.\n- Snatch block! There you go.\n(pulley clacking) Go for it. So you split it apart, don't\ncut your finger off there, there you go. So this is the magic of a snatch block. We can put a pulley in\nany place at any time as long as there's a\nrope, and the snatch block is big enough for the rope. This is the part where\nwhen you see it happen, you're like, \"Oh yeah,\nof course it's easier, \"because of pulleys.\" But if you don't stop and think, you won't really understand\nwhat's happening. So slowly pull, is it\nreally easy this time? - It's a lot more easy.\n- A lot easier, okay. So, this is what's happening: the tension in the rope right here is being redirected by this pulley because that's what pulleys\ndo, they redirect force. But down here with the snatch block, we're doing the same thing,\nwe're redirecting the force. But you have tension in the\nrope, and tension in the rope. So all you do is you put\ntension in a rope somewhere, and then you add up as many\nropes as possible on the thing, and that's how you get\nmechanical advantage. So in this case, how much\nforce is on the cinder blocks, do you know? - Two. - Two times the tension. I don't know about you, but I\nunderstand things a lot better if you can work with it with my hands. So I 3D printed a bunch of\npulleys and snatch blocks, and we're gonna rig these\nthings up and generate a model of how we were picking\nup those cinder blocks. When I pull on this rope,\nthat tension transmits itself all the way through the\nrope to the very end. Wherever the rope is,\nthere's also tension. If I pull here, think\nabout the word pulley, it pulls on the rope on the other side of the pulley right there. That pulls on the rope\nthere at the bottom, which then pulls on the\nrope on the other side of that pulley, which\nultimately pulls against that hook at the very end. All of the ropes are in tension. Now, if you look down\nthere at the cinder block, you'll notice that there are two arrows pulling up on that pulley. That's why we get twice the\nforce on the cinder blocks. But what if we wanna pull harder? Can we just add more ropes and tension? Yes, we can using this. It's basically a double pulley. Some people call this a block and tackle. Instead of two ropes pulling\ndown here, we get four. Just a little bit of force\nhere, even with my pinky finger, that's like 10 pounds of force by just barely pulling at all. This is the same number of ropes, and pulleys and everything,\nit's just flattened out so we can see what's going on. So, I've got a scale. I'm gonna attach a scale\nto the input of the rope, and remember, if we put input tension, that tension goes all the way through. So as I pull here, I have\none, two, three, four ropes connected to the thing we're pulling. So if I put two pounds here, look at that, I get eight pounds on the output. That's awesome! I'm getting four times the force, but I'm only moving it 1/4th as far. How far do you think we an go with this? You think we can double it again? So now we have two blocks\nwith four pulleys each, which if you count all those up, one, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight, we have eight ropes in\ntension on that block. So as I pull here, look\nat this, that's nuts. That is a little bit of\nforce, and a lot of output. That is some serious mechanical advantage. Look at this though, the\nropes over close to me are moving a lot, but\nthe ones over near you aren't moving as much. Let's break this thing apart again, and see if we can\nunderstand what's happening. This is so awesome!\n(board clunks) Oh man, that's a great shot! Okay, so here's what we got:\nwe've got one input pulley, let's count up the tension again, one, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight. I put two pounds here on the input. Oh, that is a lot of force on the output. Do you remember on the block and tackle, the ropes we're moving at different rates? Well, think about this. On this side over here,\nthat rope is tied up there. It's not going to move. On this side, I'm pulling the rope. It has to move as much as I pull it, and the same is true for this one, because it's just redirecting that string. But after that, everything is affected by how much this moves. So, just playing around with it here, you can see that these\nropes move a whole lot more than that one over there\nthat doesn't move at all. There's a lot going on here. Not this is the sort of thing that, yes, you can probably explain it with words, but if you have a\nfundamental understanding of how this stuff works, and\nyou just know how to use it to your advantage, you can get yourself out of some really interesting situations. For example, the other\nday, the driveshaft broke on my buddy, Jeremy's truck,\nand we had to figure out how to get his truck up\nonto a flat bed trailer without a winch. Snatch block! We rigged up a pulley\nsystem so that we could pull his entire truck up onto the trailer using only ratchet straps. We figured it out, but because we were trading force for distance,\nit was taking forever. That's when a nice guy\nnamed Jeff showed up. He drove up, offered to help,\nand instantly understood our pulley system, and knew\nwhat to do with this truck. We disconnected one of the ratchets, put Jeff's truck in it's place, and pulled this truck up until\nthe rope hit the trailer. One thing I love about Alabama\nis nice people like Jeff just stop and help you,\nand the instantly know what's going on. For example, watch how\nquickly Jeff figures out all the mechanics once I tell him we have an extra snatch block. (engine idling)\nOh, I'm so excited, we're gonna do a double snatch block! Oh, this is great! Is I'm gonna put that one--\n- It's locking on the block? - Yeah, yeah.\n- Okay. - If you'll point that direction. - Yeah, I'll do it. - [Destin] I'm gonna level with you, Jeff is the kind of guy I\nwanna be when I grow up. Watch how he just picks up a snatch block and starts working. He just knows what to do. Also, his hands are just amazing. Watch this man work. (engine idling) Snatch block engaged.\n(Jeff chuckles) How many snatch blocks you got? - [Jeff] About five. - [Destin] Dude, I'm a\namateur, I only got two. (Jeff laughs) - [Jeff] I got a triple. - [Destin] You got a triple? Like a--\n- A wooden triple block. - [Destin] A block and tackle? - Yeah, that'll work.\n(chains clang) - Oh, dude, that's a thing\nof beauty, my friend! Any day you can use a\nsnatch block is a good day. So yeah, snatch blocks can get\nyou out of a hairy situation, knowing how to use them\ncan help you make friends, thank you so much dude, and they can also be a ton of fun. Zip lines are basically\njust snatch blocks. You have the ability to\nbreak apart the pulley and you can insert a cable into it without having to disconnect\nthe cable from either end. That's essentially the\ndefinition of a snatch block, a pulley where you can insert a line without having to take apart your line from whatever it's hooked to. Snatch blocks are amazing, and where else can you get amazing views\nof the rainforest canopy like this without having a snatch block? (fast forward zip lining) (pulley clanging) Muy bien.\n- Amigo. (metal clanging) Can you hold this, then?\n- Si. That's awesome!\n(girl chuckles) (Jeep engine roars)\n(grasses rustling) Okay, so you can do a\nvideo about snatch blocks without getting a Jeep\nstuck, so let's go do that. Let's say you got the Jeep stuck. You might be tempted to\nfind the nearest tree, pull the winch out, and pull the cable directly to that tree. What do you think, Jeremy,\nwinch is the way to go? - Winch is the way, well, a\nsnatch block is the way to go. (men laugh heartily)\n- Good answer, good answer! If we pull that winch out\ndirectly to that tree, we would only be able to pull the Jeep with the force that that\nwinch is able to apply. Snatch block! We're gonna snatch block\nthis bad boy out of here! What you actually wanna\ndo is put the snatch block on the tree side, then take that hook, and you hook it back to the Jeep, and so you have twice the pulling force with your snatch block. Alright, you got the winch, right? (engine idling)\n- I got the winch. - [Destin] Okay, here we go. Cut the engine off and put it in gear, and just see if it'll pull the Jeep. - [Jeremy] And like drag it, okay? - Yeah, see if it'll just pull it. - Ready?\n- Yeah. (cable motor running) Oh, that's scary. That's a lot of force, dude. - [Jeremy] Yeah, man. (cable motor running) - That's good. Dude, that's a lot of force, man. - [Jeremy] Yeah, man! - Thoughts?\n- Alright, man. Snatch blocks are awesome, man. (men laugh) - There's a type of pulley system we haven't talked about yet,\nit's a compound pulley system. You remember the block and tackle, we had an eight-to-one\nmechanical advantage? Well, this has the some\nmechanical advantage, but it does it a different way. You remember we add up the\ntension on these ropes, and we have one plus one is equal to two? But if we have two plus\ntwo, it's equal to four, and four plus four is equal to eight, we can come up with an\neight-to-one mechanical advantage just like that with less pulleys. This is fascinating, and\none of the first people to come up with this concept\nis a guy named Archimedes. To learn more about Archimedes, I went to make local\nlibrary, and got a book by a man named Plutarch,\nwho mentions an interaction between Archimedes and\nKing Hiero of Syracuse. It's a really interesting story, but it's gonna be even\nbetter if I tell it to you with this flannel board. So it goes like this:\nArchimedes writes a letter to King Hiero of Syracuse, and he's like, \"Yo, King Hiero, I'm really\ngood with pulleys and stuff.\" And Hiero's like, \"Why\ndon't you prove it?\" And Archimedes is like, \"Well, I will \"if you give me a war ship.\" And King Hiero's like, \"Yo,\ndog, here's your war ship.\" And the Archimedes is like, \"Yo, dog, \"I hear that you like pulleys. \"I got pulleys on pulleys on pulleys.\" And the Archimedes does something amazing. Under his own physical strength,\nhe pulls an entire war ship out of the dock, which\ntotally impresses the king because that's what happens when you know how to use pulleys, you impress people. So people have been using\npulleys and snatch blocks for thousands of years,\nand they've been impressed, all the way back in the\nday with Archimedes. But they're gonna be\nused for thousands more. That's why you need to know\nhow to use a snatch block. Don't take my word for it though, I'll let Veteran Astronaut\nCommander Chris Hadfield explain it from his point of view. - The biggest difference\nbetween being on Earth and being in space is\nthat you're weightless, and when you're floating\naround weightless, like on the Space Shuttle, it's\nreally hard to get leverage. You can't dig your feet in, you can't use the weight of\nthings to hold 'em in place. So having a way to hook on one\nend and hook on the other end and apply a steadily increasing\nforce is really important. And that's why on board the Space Shuttle, we have snatch blocks. They're part of normal equipment. In fact, there's a special\nstowage block for them that contains a couple, and\nthey get used pretty regularly, both inside the ship, an\neven outside on a space walk. You're in a problem, you have a load, you have to pick it up, what do you do? Snatch block! (metal clanging) (Destin laughs)\n(girl laughs) It's kind of funnier when\nit doesn't work, isn't it? Snatch block!\n(metal clanging) Snatch block! That is exactly what you want. You wanna be the person that knows how to use the snatch block, understands mechanical advantage, and gets your team out of the situation. Snatch block! Snatch blocks are amazing. I wanna tell you something\nelse that's amazing, and that is the sponsor for\nthis video, which is Kiwi Co. Kiwi Co is like having pure\ncuriosity mailed to your house to ignite the mind of a child every month. And recently, I got to take\nmy boys to headquarters, and we got to meet the\npeople that design the kits. The boys gave them feedback\non what it was like to build and play with\neach one of these kits. In one case, my oldest son\ncollaborated directly with Rebeka whose a kit designer to\ntroubleshoot something she was working on. - But you pull this up, and so like, the plane that hits that\ninstead of your hand. - [Destin] In a matter of seconds, she prototyped his proposed solutions out of toothpicks and string,\nand they tested it out, and it worked. - Yeah! - This was a really big moment in his life.\n(Rebeka chuckles) It was super fun meeting these designers, and seeing how they come up with all the different ideas for the kits, and how they make these\nreally clear guides that go in the box so the\nkids can make these things. These kits are incredible. They teach kids all kinds of subjects, like mechanics, optics, geography, art. There's a specific kit\nthat is an ideal match for any kid in your life who you love, and you wanna inspire to be\nmore curious and creative. I love this company, I'm very proud that they're a sponsor\nof Smarter Every Day, and they just have a lot of heart, and I think that's very evident if you meet Sandra, the Founder and CEO. Can I ambush you in your office? - Absolutely.\n- And ask you some questions? - Yes.\n- Let's go. Where's your office? - My office?\n- Yeah. - I don't have an office, I have a desk. - Can we go to your desk.\n- Sure (laughs). - Okay, you don't have an office? You're the boss. - We have an open office environment. - [Destin] So why did you start Kiwi Co? Now, you're an engineer yourself, right? - I am an engineer. I grew up making a lot of stuff, and once my oldest two kids got to a point where I wanted them to start making stuff, I started to compile materials and ideas. And one of my friends was\nlike, \"This is so much fun. \"You should start a business around this.\" Yes (chuckles)!\n- So you created this company as a fusion between parenting and the desire to have your kids tinker? - Exactly, I wanted them to be hands-on, I wanted them to see themselves as people who could create things. I hope these kids grow up not only to be scientists and engineers, but people who do make a\npositive difference in the world. So I think that has been really great, and hearing about the quality time that people spend with their kids. We want kids, and families, and parents to come away from the\nexperience with Kiwi Co, and just be like, \"Whoa, awesome!\" That discovery, excitement, fun, wonder, hopefully all that packaged in a box, (laughs) and that gets delivered to your door.\n- Literally in a box. - Exactly. - [Destin] Thank you so much for making this company.\n- Yeah! Of course, my pleasure! Thank you for your support. - [Destin] Oh yeah, do you\nremember how we started? - No.\n- You don't know how we started.\n(Sandra laughs) I called the company before you\ndid anything on the internet and I asked if I could\nsell your products online, before you had ever worked with\nany influencers or anything. - We so appreciate that. - [Destin] It was really good, it was really good.\n- No, we really, really appreciate that. - Do you know what the promo is? - Yeah, you get a free crate! - You get a free crate?\n- Yeah! - [Destin] That's awesome! - That's what you get. - [Destin] KiwiCo.com/smarter, right? - [Sandra] That's right, and\nwe'll send you a free crate. Any line you want, you pick. - [Destin] And people get to pick, and you're gonna send it to them yourself. - Abs, what?\n(both laugh) What are you signing me up for (laughs)? - You're gonna have the team do it. - We will send it out to you. - There you go, KiwiCo.com/smarter,\nget a free crate, pick out the line that's\nbest for your child, or in the case of a Eureka\nCrate, what's best for you. So, that's awesome. Thanks for your time. - Yeah, absolutely. - Thanks.\n- Thank you. - I'm Destin, you're\ngetting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one, bye. (speeding traffic) There's a road crew on\nthe side of the road repairing the guard rail\nwith a snatch block. (speeding traffic) Thanks, man. - Yeah, man.\n- Have a good one. - [Crew Man] You, too. - (chuckles) It was kind of\nweird, I pulled over and said, \"Hey, can I check out your snatch block?\" (laughs) And they we're like,\n\"What are you talking about?\" (laughs) Pretty cool, though. (speeding traffic) I should get back in my truck.", "oGgCaFTcbHk": "this is a very very simple a pulley setup that you can set up for your kids I for this project you're just gonna need some simple carabiners you just happen to be those who say do not climb on it they don't have to be super strong but you need them to be at least these the metal type and you're also going to need some string some rope this is just some paracord I had now it doesn't use true pulley so it's in a true pulley system but it's the same basic concept with the carabiners that I showed you a second ago you can tie your rope to one end of your carabiner just one carabiner here you take it you take a second carabiner and you need something nice that supports real heavy this is an old sawhorse I had to put a couple nails in for one kit bearing a carabiner up let me put the Rope through it first put it up here put the other carabiner and what I have here is a nice heavy pink can give it a tug now this is this right here is a super simple setup because this way is 10 to 15 pounds you're going to be pulling roughly 10 to 15 pounds down to get it to lift it up let me show you another way to make it even easier for the kids taking care of being are off that's tied to the rope and you want to hang it up here now you have to they will say two carabiners hanging up there you take a third carabiner put it through the Rope get it down here to your paint pane [Music] it's a personal stake then you now give it a good tug and it's so much easier to lift up reason being it's because now that you have to support these supports are roughly each supporting half of the weight so now if this is ten roughly ten to fifteen pounds this would be roughly half the pull needed of that weight to get it up in the air now doing this you will create a lot more rope you have to pull but it doesn't really matter as long as your kids are having fun right they're gonna love to see how much weight they can put on there and lift up or you have fun playing with your kids now", "w7dJFUg-LAA": "hey that's my colleague said he is Chelsea candy toilet there's a big candy Pizza one we did the little life Howard football great the big pizza and if they know that we can share it one no we got to have normal sized pizza I got to get this our chakra fire pup Alex wants blue I think Jesse's gonna want pink I got Chelsea Isaac cotton candy or watermelon flavor no it's just color flavor perfect oh you want to eat one of these that has a bug inside [Laughter] okay so we've tried this blog balls have you guys done smog balls yet okay so we're going to get a packet smog balls to say if not write them yet we got to try some of these okay first tennis ball flower gumballs they look like tennis ball Sally

present bob was expecting to see what does he do now we have to follow the rules the weather outside is great the friends are taking a walk in a park and sharing the latest news hang on what's here oh a challenge they accept it who can blow a bigger bubble and it's bob's first try not that good what do our judges think about it this is definitely not what they were expecting to see jane is our only hope now that's much better you can't argue with the judges 5 out of 10 points bob isn't going to accept it he's very serious about it and losing wasn't a part of his plan what a start whoa with skills like that you can easily become a professional bubble gum athlete whoa bob made a dog out of his bubble the judges love it they have never met such talented people before it definitely deserves the highest point hang on there's a catch bob used a regular balloon you're disqualified um with a talent like that he's only good for a circus what about a little tea party hey bob has a snack whoa

grinder the rules aren't broken and you can share with friends it must be really easy to make patties out of it the guy should think about it a bubblegum burger can be a hot trend of the next season yay time to try it why is jane so surprised ah bob has a totally different approach jane is busy with a new hairstyle did a comb get stuck maybe it got tangled oh no now she's gonna know that a comb made from gum isn't the best idea ever take a lot of white gum heat it up and shape an oval roll it out so it's thin enough then put on a paper brush template and copy the shape following the contour decorate the piece you got with gold edible pearl dust so it looks perfect great what do i do now can bob answer this question whoa calm down first off you need to chill a little literally how much time is it gonna take jane can't wait any longer just a little bit more what five minutes there's nothing you can do did it work oh jane is so disappointed bob is trying to comfort her will some tea be helpful even if it won't it wouldn't hurt and it would be better to throw this away so it doesn't remind jane of her big flop hmm what a cute dog bob loves his dog he doesn't leave it for a second even on such an important day like a job interview this is why he put on his lucky jacket it looks so touching but how is bob supposed to go to an interview when he's all covered in fur thank goodness there's a lint roller here take big gums and melt in a microwave put the mass on a silicone mat roll it out and cut out a diamond attach the piece you got to a lint roller awesome with this device all your clothes become clean within seconds whoop bob tried too hard to tell the truth he should have thought about changing his wardrobe a long time ago what is jane doing here ah what about a little prank microwave gum and shape it into a circle then press it down in a mold that is shaped like soap and whoa it's almost real sleepy bob isn't suspecting anything a morning begins as usual for him but what's gonna happen next this soap won't moisturize your skin for sure on the bright side bob is actually awake now our jane always keeps up with the latest trends whoa what gum will she pick out this time put a square gum on a plate print app icons on sugar paper and place them on top coat with decor gel to make the paper stronger and glowing and here's our perfectionist chef the diy is done

cereals and milk are exactly what you need to get an energy boost whoa bob is starving jane has never seen him eat so fast she wonders if her friend can chew everything you might as well choke jane thinks this situation is shocking hey that's too much what is he doing microwave gum press the mass you got in a spoon mold use a knife to make a pattern coat the spoon with silver edible pearl dust so it looks plausible done jane is trying to copy him but how ah bob's spoon is made out of gum despite the fact that summer is over you still have to stay in shape jane should learn a lesson from this young athlete she's daydreaming about something come on can't wait to see your plan and the guy is good too but jane isn't doing as great it's really easy to get tangled in a gum a lonely boy is taking a walk in a park hang on she's hiding that's a rex what is a girl supposed to do in a situation like this there's one very nice life hack blow a bigger bubble and he won't notice you a bubble

dressed up and here's bob he was in a rush and for good reason she prepared a drink for him but that's not the only surprise jane takes out a jelly mold whoops another card with a challenge jane accepts it and the mold can stay here for now jane has other plans make a pattern out of a gum using a heart mold and a knife attach a side to the piece you got and pour jelly in it refrigerate it till it hardens and spread icing on it using a pastry bag you can decorate the jelly like our chef did it the guys took such an adorable picture on the day they met is the snack ready hmm what a smell bob will definitely like it he wasn't expecting it whoa the surprise is great oh gosh this is so delicious the guys can't keep their hands off it hey what is jane doing bob should try it too jane followed the rules of the challenge so even her mold is edible and really delicious the best part is that you can blow bubbles the anniversary was a huge success the guys look so great together jane decided to renovate her apartment a little bit how do you hang pictures when there are no nails jane knows an amazing life hack a gum is like liquid nails the picture fits in perfectly miss monroe is ready to keep company the place looks much cozier this way but what's that the chair got broken did jane decide to use this life hack everywhere it could be a great decision unless one thing jane

illegal it's a hair accessory good morning my love welcome back to today's vlog so today i knew i already knew going into today that today was going to be wacko today was not going to be a regular shmugler ass day because last night i had a crazy stream and i'm going to tell you all about it but first i do want to mention that um i was going to do like this cute little video that i saw a bunch of other youtubers do that was like eating candy from the decades 1920s candy 1930s candy and i was like i want to do that so we went to oldtimecandy.com not spons and i ordered so much [ __ ] candy and i was so excited i did this little layout i did this spread i started vlogging it was honestly really professional except for the [ __ ] fact that i wasn't recording but other than that everything else was professional like the way that it was set up like the ankle the sun was shining in and i was just like oh i want to rank this of a taste test and then i i opened it all on camera i showed you guys the packaging i did some uh like this [ __ ] you know what i mean and it just was the best thing ever and then i look at the camera and normally there's a red dot in the corner and i can see no red dot at the corner so i ate all that can't even nothing but we still have like i would say 90 of it that we haven't eaten so technically it wasn't that big of a fail no big deal even tiger wants to join us but i do want to tell you guys about my dream before we get started because it's so uncomfortable this dream was honestly one of the weirder dreams that i've had and normally i have nightmares that are really intense of like you know my front door is missing there's a home intruder there's all of these crazy things we're getting dead bodies shipped to our house fedex to ups to our house we open it up dead person you know like i have those types of dreams but this is by far one of the creepiest dreams i've ever had so my fiance and i we went hiking that's at the end i'm kidding we went hiking at the la river which i don't know if you can even go hiking there i feel it sounds like something that you can do in l.a so we went hiking but this time it wasn't like dehydrated la it was like a lush la like the river was flowing it was massive like there were rocks everywhere and then there was like this nature trail and we were like let's go hike on the nature trail and everyone before we went hiking was like hey you need to bring a weapon because there's gonna be like coyotes there there's gonna be wild bears there like you have to protect yourself and so instead of bringing something like pepper spray or a taser or anything that i would normally bring i decided to bring one chopstick and i don't even think it was my best chopstick which like what a branding moment that could have been but i bring one chopstick and i'm like yeah this is gonna protect me from coyotes until we go hiking and i randomly went off the trail a little bit and this panda this real panda approaches me and it's trying to [ __ ] fight me and so then i'm like oh my god this panda is gonna kill me today so i grab my chopstick and i just go like this at the panda and it goes up the chin of the panda into the pandas head and around that like the chopstick was already in the head my fiance runs over and he's like are you getting attacked by the panda and so he body slams the panda onto the ground but in the process of that i guess i was holding on to the chopsticks anyway any which way any who anyhow panda's decapitated that's what i'm trying to say in my dream the panda's head is here the panda's body is here and we're just looking at it like what the fork do we need i pick up the head put it on my head and that's how mr mango butt came to be that didn't happen in my dream but in my dream we're like okay what do we do now like we just have this dead panda and i was like okay well if i tell everyone that i killed this panda from self-defense nobody's gonna believe me right and he was like right so we dump the panda into the flowing river the body and the head separately because decapitated so we dump the body i'm thinking the body's gonna sink because the panda was real that comes doesn't sink it just floats and then a gathering appears and everyone's like what happened to the panda and so i told everyone like yeah it was in self-defense and everyone was looking at me and was like did you know that china just bought part of the l.a river and i was like what does that mean and that's what i was like oh [ __ ] there's like going to be chinese authorities that are just like looking at the river and then they're going to see a dead panda and somehow they're going to tie it to me because my chopstick's still in there probably and they're going to be like where do we get this chopsticks fandroid.com that's crazy they're going to know that it's me i was so worried that chyna was gonna execute me i'm gonna go to mister for killing a panda yes absolutely would they really execute me for killing a panda i don't know if they will execute you but i mean panda is the national treasure so so we're going to eat these candies yeah yeah okay so we're going to eat the candies again can you show me the jelly beans of the butter popcorn can you show me some of these so these we already opened we already taste tested so this one's so cool because if you listen to it does that not sound like a beer can to you you pop it open and then inside of it are these mini little jelly belly bags these are so cute these look so high-end why was candy so high-end back in the day now it's just like bags of chocolate back in the day you're creative look at this show them this he thinks this is really gross i grew up eating push pops this is the way that it works you open it up you stick your finger in teaching kids yeah and then this comes out and then you set got it and then you're like wait a second i gotta go to class okay put it in your pocket the gross thing is we both licked this like 20 minutes ago and now he wants me to lick it again lipstick lipstick no he can't it's young it's a lipstick honestly it tastes pretty good i just think like think about it how unsanitary this is did you guys grow up with this chocolate leave it in the comments if you guys ever grew up with any of these candies because some of these are from the 1990s and the 2000s so don't be [ __ ] acting like i am like the oldest bits in the game i don't know why i got so offended these are push pops i used to love these you can still get them at gas stations and then this one he had no idea what this one was i told him to give me his finger because it's a like a jelly and he this is how little idea he is he goes okay i'm like no your finger and he goes and i go no i need your finger and he goes and then i smeared it on and he was so grossed out by it he absolutely hated this one what did it taste like and then we have another icy this one is a spray this is my first time having i feel like i've had some sort of squeeze i don't think it was an icy brand this one is very interesting it's like a lysol spray like a disinfectant spray but you just and it sprays sour juice straight into your mouth this is what he was so amused by our cinnamon flavored toothpicks this is his favorite thing you can't even eat him i just got them because he loves toothpicks i'm still too young to use toothpicks but he uses toothpicks and then we have these cocktail jelly bellies these are just the ones that we've already opened because i thought it was important so these have margaritas strawberry daiquiri pina colada okay have a mojito okay i'm gonna have a peanut pilaf mmm i'm toasty popcorn this one i can't eat because i gagged he loves it he says it tastes like harry potter so it's a popcorn box you open it up it tastes just like butter freaking jelly beans tastes just like popcorn just like popcorn magic it's like when you bite into it the buttery popcorn porn oh candy necklace show them the necklace my favorite thing and just in the world so i pulled this out and he goes oh it's just like the pancake necklace that we have in china so in china they like to wear do you like it i feel like i'm going to like coachella and i'm on drugs because that's the only way that you can be 20 something and think that this is a sanitary meal put on your neck can you show them how you eat it i can't eat it anymore i have to eat it that's so cool this has got to be the funnest candy and then they came out with um candy underwear i remember shot off like is it an adult thing or yeah it's like a thong but it's candy but apparently i think they stopped it because it was giving a bunch of girls yeast infections what exactly is it i think it looks like a thong oh it exactly look like this oh that is so creative do you like it or something no i just think it's funny [Laughter] so now we have champagne jelly bellies that came in this bottle which this is like the og sugarfina because if you guys know sugarfina does like the green juice bottles of just gummies or bellies or jelly belly you get it jelly beans and it's like a bajillion dollars i can't even open this this was okay it tasted like sparkling water to be honest and now we are back we've got some cigarettes we talked about my favorite pixie stix that he absolutely hates for some reason cigarette is not good cigarette is not good it tastes like corn starch yes okay this i know because my grandma used to have these around the house all the time i don't know why my grandma was so obsessed with it they're called charms candy sour balls i don't even remember what it tastes like but i remember seeing this everywhere and then after we ate it all she would clean it out and then put other stuff in here like she would use it wait a minute what i think i know this is this come with like white powders outside the candy boss that's sour and inside sweet wait wait wait give me one oh no the ones we have very similar but they're all coated with the white powder and those powders are so sour and inside sweet it's like our sour altoids back in the day oh god i missed it those are so good we call these just charms candy sour balls and my grandma was obsessed with these had them all over the house i hated these why they're just like not that fun so when you were growing up are you into soft candy or hard candy i feel like i only liked hard candy right but now i hate hard candy i know like now if you give me a lollipop unless it's a tiny dum-dum like you know the little ones that we get at heidi lau i don't really like them and we have this i used to be obsessed with these these are chocolate roses they taste like this one is actually wrinkled but they used to sell these like at most stores and you would just buy chocolate roses is this the one that they give away in high school like you buy one for someone or no i don't know we did v-roches so who do you buy this thing for for like your lover no like your boyfriend did i say i guess or like your girlfriend is it milk chocolate or black chocolate um that looks nasty oh my okay open it whoa oh it's not even dense on the inside that's pretty good oh baby bubble balls these are my freaking favorites i love this so much more than push pops have you ever had a baby bottle pop before i think you have found me this before okay so here's how you do it you take the lid off oh yeah you dip it and then you suck it and dip it again right and then you gotta ah to get the nasty and then you dip it oh my god i am so glad they discontinued or you can even if you're really good oh my god this is so nasty and then you flip it back oh my god and now it's coated in white you put it back on ah this should be illegal and then you put it back in oh my goodness lord have mercy oh my god this usually my favorite so if i do the same thing you just did can you still eat it you know i am a very sanitary person i am a class act i'm a classy person i'm a tumblr these are called cry baby tears and it's extra sour candy i've never had this one before you press here these boxes are just genius it's a teardrop candy so please have one so we're gonna cry yeah i mean i have a really good tolerance for sour stuff though cheers not even shower oh it gets my shower at the end he's crying i've never met someone who makes more sour faces than you this is him being the most dramatic okay this is how he does it ready where are you going oh he's spitting it out this is him every time he takes a sour pouch this is it one sour patch but he likes to look around like are y'all seeing this [ __ ] like it's so sour he's such a drama queen okay next i will let you choose one this big so this is called a big cherry i think there's another chocolate yeah that's a chocolate i hate fruit and chocolate you gotta give it a go i can't do it just bite it it looks like a pile of poo poo do it do it how does it taste mmm do you like it there's nuts in the chocolate yeah that's nasty nuts and fruit actually no the aftertaste is weird it's not terrible but not my not your style okay so this one i'm really intrigued by because look at this packaging it says ice cream it looks like an ice cream there's a cherry on top and it just says twist and lick another one of those wait what seems like they spent a lot of money on the packaging twist oh my gosh it comes out the candy just squeezes out doesn't it it's giving me like tryptophobia okay go ahead push it and then go ahead go ahead go ahead get it get it yeah don't do that i don't know what do you want me to do how to do this i see why this is discontinued i would be really alarmed if i was just walking around and i saw a bunch of people just doing this [ __ ] in public i feel like we're missing something oh oh my gosh oh my god look at this it just all came out whoa here you want me to lick it you don't have to lick it you just taste it did you see that it just bends like jello i thought it was gonna be like hard candy it's some sort of liquid it's some sort of gel it's like hair gel all right let's get rid of this one oh he's trying it that one was wild okay so this one is called boston baked beans i don't know why they like the baked beans i don't know why this is like this one's 25 cents look at it can i see the beans it's not a bean it's a peanut not my fave oh gosh no my favorite off not my favorite it's not bad but i feel like i've had better this is 25 cents really it's not bad i don't know why i feel the need to stick this up my nose but i just feel like it would be the perfect ergonomic structure for such a thing so this one is red green and yellow and it says specialty candy store edition 50 larger wow we're lucky today it looks like they just filled it with the syrup and then waited for it to harden and then just tied the end because i mean it's it just looks like a frosting bag you just pull out the the sword yeah grab the handle and pull you do it you do it pull it out it won't come out what is all this white stuff like literally i was wondering where all this white stuff's coming from taste it while he does that the inappropriate stuff i will be going into a bazooka i don't know how to open this though look at this look at this door you want it or no it tastes like plastic it tastes like plastic now like nothing much tastes like sugary water that's hardened yeah okay so this is called original bazooka it's gum you open it up you take out whoa there's only six in here can you believe it unbelievable maybe that's why you shouldn't have friends because every time you open out your gum case like you take one five friends that's it oh it smells yummy it's hard it's so hard i can't bite into it oh my god my dentist said no you sure you don't want this candy no more i saw you juicing [ __ ] candy that i haven't even done to you i don't want that candy okay all right i need to trash this can you trash this it's not looking good bazooka is probably one of the worst things i've ever had in my life yeah it doesn't matter did you see there's stuff in here i didn't even see that there's inside the packaging there's a cartoon here it says hi pesti hi joe did you get any bites yet no i don't think my worm is really trying fortune you are anxious to achieve something very important you will succeed tell that to a five-year-old this is good it's hard as a rock that's so good i like it how do you like that so we've got a couple more snacks we've got this one which is called scented gum this one looks like it's from the 20s there's so much gum what about this it's juji fruits okay i feel like juicy fruit was taken by the gum so they're like let's do juji it's such a saturated market be careful once it touches your tongue it becomes a parasite these are stuck on your teeth oh look how pretty we've got camo jelly beans made in the usa it says freedom isn't free jelly belly charities will donate 10 cents to support u.s veterans and their families for every one ounce camo bags sold 10 cents every one ounce yeah one of these is 10 minutes which is nice but i just don't like the fact that they put freedom isn't free it kind of ruins the whole like laid back candy aspect where you're just like you know what i'm having a [ __ ] day let me just grab a bag of candy oh freedom's not free [Music] you know it's a little a little sad what is it is this jelly beans again how many jelly beans did i eat today vanilla that one's toasted marshmallow i am good honey i'm good on the beans these are dots they're poppable sheets i love that when you peel it off half of the paper comes with it so you're just eating paper i think maybe that's why i was discontinued don't eat that one let me try to get you a cleaner one nope this one's all paper too yeah let's skip on the eating paper show of today we've got bits and pieces bubble gum so this is from the same makers of hubba bubba i believe it's called bubble bubble america's original bubble bubble and you just press on this press and pull out and then you just it tastes like when you're shampooing your hair and accidentally get some in your mouth you don't like nothing do you i'm sorry i love all of the modern day candies this one is called six let's chocolate candies this one i think is from like the 30s i believe it just comes in this bag it's good oh sugar wow this is called cup of gold does this not look like a giant bc species let's try this there's supposed to be some cream in there do you think reese's pieces copy them oh there's some white stuff in there huh look good i realized maybe the packaging's not that great i think this is supposed to be the same thing it's called mallow cup so is it marshmallow on the inside so far my favorite you know which one's my favorite butter popcorn no there's one thing i find it very fun you find it fun the necklace look no the push pop the punch is your favorite shut up yeah that is not your favorite i'm saying this because he is such a stickler for things like this he thinks they're nasty he thinks this is actually tastes good and it looks so cool this is him right now it looks so cool is it so good that you would keep this one yep okay so this one's called chuckles minis this reminds me of [Applause] sir thank you licorice oh [ __ ] i'm gonna try a different flavor i thought it was gonna be great they're just nasty i was literally about to say i can't imagine paying money for it but then i realized i paid money for it this one right here is called a niece naturally flavored fat-free gluten-free old-fashioned hard candy that's not what i was expecting it to look like just bright red balls whoa did you eat one or two one oh it's a big one oh no there's licorice again why i'm gonna go with this we're gonna have a bubble blowing contest so this is just you know nerds wrote honey do you like nerds bro no but you know what nerd rope is right we had it for a mukbang oh okay i know what it is but now imagine just a stick of gum this is overcome this is all gone eat the whole thing why would they soak up like this what's that [ __ ] [Applause] it's so much [Laughter] oh you could literally knock someone out with it you could honestly you could oh my god you know let's do it i see why that one failed i feel like today is an episode of understanding how candy companies made weird ass products that didn't last the test of time so this one is a butter rum lifesaver i got it because i was like you know what if they have anything in harry potter it would be something like this what is it it's a butter rum flavor ah like butter beer like butter beer right like butter beer oh this is good this reminds something i used to eat kind of caramelly caramel scented chewing gum it's not licorice but i don't know what the fork that is eight pieces chewing gum fragrance that refreshes after eating smoking or drinking it tastes like eating cologne doesn't it taste like when you accidentally spray a perfume and then you walk into it and then you get some in your mouth holy [ __ ] oh my god let's try turtle bites that sounds good oh it's a turtle it's a squirtle what's that just chocolate caramel what the [ __ ] is that is that chocolate pipe is it chocolate or hard candy or soft candy what is that i don't understand it tastes like rubber i don't it's nasty dude i don't know what it is but i do yeah let's see the princess candy oh they're jelly beans oh my gosh how many jelly i'm so done with jelly beans how many jelly beans have you consumed today which princess did you have it's actually just berry blue basically this one is called cherry mash didn't we have a cherry thing earlier i guess the 20s were full of cherries would you like to try not good not good lucky so this is called turkish taffy here's the issue the paper is stuck wow it looks like the things like stop signs are made out of ready let me see straight up don't do that i'm trying to smack it it's so sticky it's like a banana laffy taffy the worst flavor of fluffy puffies this one's called a curly whirly there's um no information about what that might be is it chocolate is it gum we don't know how much did you spend on these candies yeah give this video a thumbs up for my stupidity the curly welly was weird all of these are um getting a little bit weird at this point so we're going to try a mamba what is that will you open that another gum i don't know what any of these are this is called a chicko stick this is crunchy peanut butter rolled in toasted coconut what does that mean i want to try it that sounds kind of fascinating that's inappropriate this is so good no kidding right this might be one of my favorites [Music] i hate it i'm so sorry i think that's gonna be it okay honestly besides maybe like four of these i realized why the rest didn't do so hot or maybe times were different back then you know i will say though everything's not as sweet as candy today which maybe is something right a lot of jelly beans yeah like nothing's like crazy sweet nothing's crazy sour nothing's like crazy chocolatey like there's a lot of chocolatey stuff but i don't feel like it's as like crazy as these days no what if this year halloween candy this is the way you give out actually there's no trick or treat so yeah but if i did i would assume that our house would get egged almost immediately the parents oh my god remember give it to me and they'll be like do you want to come over for dinner one day we can reminisce about the old days and i'll be like hey nobody got time for that all of our neighbors are relatively old so we would fit right in do you think our neighbor would remember a lot of

hi I'm buddy Lee your personal jump rope training coach parents I'm going to teach you how to teach your kids the right way to jump the right way is low-impact and safe and a lot of fun jump rope is considered to be the perfect exercise and the building blocks of fitness is simple and expensive portable to get started all you needs a jump rope some guidelines and motivation step 1 choose the right spot a wide-open space for the flat surface that has some cushion to absorb impact and as an alternative you can use a driveway or the sidewalk now this is a good spot as open space as North struction and it's great for jumping step 2 choose a rope that you can customize so that you can adjust it to your child's height the way you do that is by taking the rope stand on the center both feet be just right for your house pull the handles along the side until the top of the handles extend past the shoulders good job kill step 3 now it's time for the correct jump rope posture have your child stand upright look straight ahead while jumping relax the arms to the side at 45-degree angles and thumbs facing out and balancing their weight on the balls of the feet as shoulder width apart this is the correct position for jump now for shadow jumping let's teach them how to take off and land properly ready jump just push off the balls our feet are straight head and make small circles with the wrist turn that risk turn that rest turn turn turn turn turn turn turn shadow jumping and clues turning the rope to one side of the body and simulating the jumping movement teach them how to coordinate the rope swing for the perfect jump step 5 when teach a child how to swing the rope drum goes on top very good rest of rope behind the knee practice swinging the rope to pull the knife's even on there you go repeat this movement for timing and rhythm to coordinate the rope swing for the perfect jump jump no pain no gain that's the making of a champ name now let's put it all together body position there you go and jump nice kid get better remember Prince the key to jumping is one step at a time kids make a discourage but with practice patience and perseverance they'll be jumping in no time hey you doing it [Music] you", "CZRIuBKn-Ho": "[Music] hi guys we're back with another race the rules are not [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "rJfp2EgFF-M": "hi I'm Helena from AEG and in this video I'm going to show you just how easy it is to replace the door seal on an Ag oven cooker or steamer now your door seal can become damaged or maybe perish with time so if you find out your ovens losing heat from the front or perhaps your foods taking a little longer to cook it may be time to replace the seal now you'll find that there are two main types of seal there's a rubber seal and then there's also a material or woven mesh seal so the very first thing you need to do is make sure that you get the correct seal for your particular model and in order to do that you just need to know your ovens product number your product number can be found on your rating plate and on an oven the rating plate can usually be found just around the inside of the door now the product number is always between nine and eleven digits long and it's different from your model number so I'm going to show you how to replace both of these seals but before I do that just going to remove the oven door first to give myself a little bit more room it's really easily done on each of the hinges you'll find there's a little clip just pop them down and the door should just slide straight off now the rubber door seal comes as one complete loop which either has little clips in each of the four corners and it simply clicks into place like that or like this one here which doesn't have clips but simply slots into a groove all the way around the side of the door so to replace it you just pull the old one out and simply slide the new one back in making sure you push it in really tightly all the way around so that it's nice and snug now the material or woven mesh seal comes as one long strip which has hooks all the way along the length that simply slot into place so to fit it find the middle first of all and then you start from there by popping the clips into the holes all the way around let me show you just by pulling out the bottom here so here we go here the clips and the little holes that they go in to do make sure you get them in a new wait for a little click because otherwise it'll just be going along the gray and that's not good say pop them all in and then when you get to the middle this just tucks in neatly like that there we go so if you've removed your oven doors now's the time to just pop them back on again so there we go it really is as simple as that door seals for most models of Ag oven are available on the AEG website thanks for watching", "e1ow4_C90jI": "we do in front of us we have a hot tub and we also have 600 pounds of ice made dryers so normally people call this a hot tub but I guess today we're gonna call it a frozen hot tub pool to cool tub cool it's a tough

Want to win the prize? Knowing a little math is the key to winning\nthis popular contest. You will need A jar filled with spherical\nor oblate spheroid candies Calculator Tape measure Vernier calipers (optional) and computer\nwith internet access (optional). Step 1. Ask for or estimate the total volume of the\njar as best you can. Convert the volume to milliliters. Convert to liters quickly by typing \"convert\n(your original units) into liters\" into a search engine. Step 2. Determine whether the candies are spheres. If they are balls, like gumballs or jawbreakers,\nthey're spheres. If the candies are round, but longer than\nthey are wide, they are \"oblate spheroids.\" Step 3. Find the volume of one candy, also in milliliters. First, find the radius of one candy, either\nmy estimating, using a tape measure, or by using vernier calipers, which will provide\nthe most precise measurement. If your candy is spherical, use the formula\nV = 4/3\u03c0r3, where r is the radius of one candy, in centimeters. Round pi to 3.142 if you don't have a scientific\ncalculator. If the candies are oblate spheroids, use the\nformula V = 4/3\u03c0a2b, where a is the longer radius, and b is the shorter radius. Step 4. Calculate the percentage of the total volume\nthe candies take up in the jar. Calculate 64 percent of the jar's total volume\nif the candies are spheres, and calculate 66.5 percent of its volume if they are oblate\nspheroids. Step 5. For spherical candies, divide your estimate\nfor the size of one candy into 64 percent of the volume of the jar. For oblate spheroid candies, divide the average\nsize of one candy into 66.5 percent of the volume. You've got the answer; now amaze your friends\nwith your guess! Did you know Did you know?

store and in this game there's two versions of the game there is learning color game and there's also learning numbers game today we're going to play the second part of the game which is learning numbers alright let's open our box and pour out all of our we got it spinner over here some instruction some candy jars ooh a bunch of pieces of candy here and this is our game board you need to put together [Music] here we have it okay so here we have our candy chart we have yellow and pink purple and blue what color do you want princess mm-hmm I'm gonna go with the pink one today okay I think I'm gonna go with the purple one today oh how do we play this game well we play by putting pieces of the candy in the middle of our board and we need at least 20 of them I'm just gonna go ahead and put them in now and you want the candy side up like so and then what you're gonna do is you're going to spin the wheel and you're gonna move your counter around accordingly so let's say we got four you end up on plus four so this plus means you take four from the middle uh-huh and the minus means you take away from your jar oh but it has to be perfectly done which means that if you have let's say four here only but it says to take away five and you don't have that mount then you just move on okay got it how do you win the first one to have ten perfectly filled in here with oh don't easy let's get started hmm so how do we determine who goes first oh I know let's play rock-paper-scissors okay okay okay Paper Scissors rock paper scissors ah I go phase okay so I'm going to spin the wheel and I got number three so I'm gonna take my counter where is my counter oh here it is I'm gonna put it anywhere on the board I'll put it right here I'm gonna go three times one two three uh uh it says minus two I guess I'm not going to do anything cuz I don't have any pieces to take away all right I think I'm gonna go on this one here the - to start right there I'm gonna spin and I got three so I'm gonna move one two and three I got plus two so that means I get to grab two pieces of candy here take this one and this one and I'm gonna put them both into my jar right it's my turn I need to catch up hope I can get plus by don't get one oh I got five alrighty so let's move one two three four five plus four not bad you get more pieces of candy so I'm gonna get this red one that's one two three and four I'm gonna put it in my candy jar right here so I got one two three and four I got one that's not bad cuz I get plus three that reason I get to add three more candies to my collection I'm gonna get one and I'm also gonna get a yellow one and an orange one so I have one two three more all right it's my turn [Music] I got number one woo it's a +4 or a positive 4 that means I get 4 pieces of candy let's go with this red all right and let's go with this gummy bear let's get another gummy bear mm-hmm and let's go with ok let's move over to our jar and add our 1 2 3 & 4 whoo that means I only need one more to get 10 oh no you lean one more to win and I need 9 mover to win here and that's a lot 9 plus 1 is 10 okay I gotta make sure I get a good number now then I got one and that means I get plus one here so I get one piece of candy I think I want this pink one here it's a cute little gummy yeah move over here and put it on my board yikes the only way I could win this game is if I get a positive one that's kind of tricky let's see what I get I got number three so we're gonna move one two three oh I got a negative two so that means I have to remove two candies from my jar all right you're gonna go here one and two bye-bye candy all right it's my turn the wheel and I got number one I'm gonna move this purple piece one space and that's plus two so I get to collect two piece of candy I mean at this blue peppermint one and this pink one here I'm gonna move over here and put this pink one here and this purple one here oh and this blue one here all right let's see what I get this time number five so I'm gonna move two three four five oh I got plus four that means I get four pieces of candy hey unfortunately since my jar can only hold three more pieces they don't get any candy and your turn again oh well hopefully I get some candy all right I got number four so I'm gonna move it four times so here I go one two three four oh no mine is one you got to put by one piece I guess I'll just put the blue on back because it doesn't match all right I can get a plus one all the way to a plus B 3 and B good I got number two 1 & 2 ohh oh my god ohh negative 1 or minus 1 so I guess gummy says you're down here by yourself you gotta go back to the middle of the board by 1 alright it's my turn got number 5 and I'm gonna move my pink 5 times 1 2 3 4 5 oh I got plus 3 I'm gonna get 3 pieces of candy mmm I think I'm gonna collect the purple one this time I'm gonna get 1 2 3 purple candy and we're gonna go over here to my board I'm just gonna put on here 1 2 & 3 I think we're tied at 6 pieces of candy more these will do okay come on this is my chance I got 5 let's see 1 2 3 4 5 yeah I got plus 3 that means I get to get 3 pieces of candy this yellow can here this green one here and last but not least let's get up come on let's go to our jar put 1 2 & 3 oh yeah I need one more I need four more okay let's get a good number I got number 5 I'm going to take my piece to move it five times Oh one piece 1 2 3 4 5 oh no I got minus 3 but I worked so hard to get these three pieces of purple candy so we got 1 2 3 and it going back to the candy in the middle I buy candy game is hard I think I need a one two six six six six six six six oh I got a 3 so 1 2 & 3 I got a minus 1 so I'm gonna put one of my candy back into the metal here all right so all means are + is coming up so

out of the shed and those other two strands over there work perfectly but this one this one won't turn on and I don't know how well you can see this but it flickers if I shake it just right so in this video I'm gonna show you how to fix a misbehaving strand of Christmas lights okay so you can see I've kind of spread this strand out across my work table because I'm going to have to start checking each bulb in turn and I want to make sure I don't get lost and go the wrong direction down the wire but before I do that I want to see if this strand is even worth trying to save and the way I do that first is by plugging it in to the power at this end and then at the other end I plug in one of my other strands that I know works and as you can see that strand is lit up like it's supposed to be so this tells me I've got a good circuit running through this set it's just that the individual bulbs are not lighting up so that's a clue that means this strand is probably worth trying to save but it does mean that I probably have broken connections inside one or more bulbs so I have to start at this end of the strand and start checking bulbs okay so the first thing that I'm going to do to try and isolate where the problem is is unplug the power because the first test I'm going to do is just a visual inspection and I'm going to inspect every single bulb it's time-consuming and tedious but it's the only way to check to make sure the bulbs haven't failed obviously on this particular style it's an LED string with these decorative cases on the outside you just pull to pop off that decorative case and then just use a small pair of pliers or wire cutters here to gently grasp the outer edge of the bulb itself and pull straight out they just slide out and there are two little metal posts on each of these little LEDs and you just want to make sure that those posts are firmly attached don't wiggle them too hard don't twist them don't bend them just make sure that they're attached properly and then look down in the receptacle and make sure there's no corrosion or other nasties that are hiding down in there if that looks good go ahead and replace the led make sure you pay attention there's a high side and a low side so when you put this in you want to make sure that the high connector on the light matches the high connector inside the receptacle you just push it in finger tight and then pop its case back on and now we can move on to the next bulb well I've already tested this strand I started at this end and got all the way down to this light right here and when I pulled that light out here's what I found you can see it's led has a connector on that side but it's completely missing it on this side there's no connector there at all see that now luckily this strand of lights came with replacement bulbs but of course they're the wrong color I have a blue LED that I'm going to have to put into that space so I'm just going to go ahead and put in that replacement LED now and put the cover back on now that I've replaced one that I know was bad I'm gonna try plugging it in again to see if this lights up and look at that we've got the first half of the strand working the other half of the strand over here is still not working so I'll have to do the same process there of checking each bulb individually until I find the one that's not working and then replace it okay so now to figure out where the bad bulb is in the second half I need to start where it goes from one half to the other you can see this bulb is lit but this one is not so if you look carefully at the wiring of these lights you'll see that back here in the working section most lights have only two wires that come into them right here that will change when the lights are sectioned off so at the very first light in the Strand you'll actually have three wires that go into the base of the plug then most of the others will have just two like this but then you'll come to a point in their strand where you'll have two lights next to each other that each have three wires going into them and that's where it is broken from one section of lights to the next section of lights so I'm not real clear on exactly the Voodoo of how these are wired I believe that the LEDs over here that are working are all wired in series but then when you get to these two you get a brief parallel connection to another set that are all wired in series and so all you got to do is find the last bulb that's lit and the next bulb that's not and you can take all of these lit bulbs and set them off to one side because they're in the loop that's working so we'll separate these a little bit on the table here so to find the next bulb that's not working I have to search through each of these bulbs individually so we'll first unplug the power and do the same process again so this one appears to have also failed so if we look at this slide I just pulled out you can see one of its connectors came off right in my thumb when I gave it the slightest of pressure so I think this bulb is potentially our culprit let's try replacing it and see if the rest of the strand works now [Applause] so it's easier to tell where I was plug it in and see what we got hey that was the one alright alright well that turned out to be a pretty quick fix and I'm really glad that I was able to save this strand to reiterate all you have to do is start at the power end unplug it from the power first and then check each individual led until you find the one that's got the broken connectors you may have more than one broken LED in your strand so if the first one you find doesn't fix it keep going until you find them all in my case I only had to check seven or eight on the first section of the strand and five or six on the second section of the strand and and I was able to get them all going again so the only real question left is who's going to come over to my house and put these up for me because I don't really want to climb up on the roof anyone out there no one all right I guess I'll do it myself so if you've enjoyed this video and you want to see more you can check out some of my other projects up here or

"Om Nom is back! But this time he's traveling back in time\nto meet with his ancestors who also find themselves being teased with candy dangling from a string. Cut The Rope: Time Travel is the third installment\nof the popular Cut The Rope franchise and with six brand new themed settings such as\nAncient Egypt, the Renaissance, and Ancient Greece, the 90 available levels are sure to\nkeep you occupied. The creators ZeptoLab, known for creating\ncute but addictive puzzle games, have seen huge success with their previous titles Cut\nThe Rope and Cut The Rope: Experiments. The original has over 100 million downloads\nand Zeptolabs has developed a successful brand identity, similar to what we see with Angry\nBirds by Rovio. As a huge fan of the previous games myself,\nI couldn't wait to get my hands on Time Travel. For new comers to the Cut The Rope franchise,\nthe object of this physics-based puzzler is to release the candy into the little green\nmonster's mouth by cutting the rope with simple swipe gestures. This causes the candy to fall from midair\nand will either land in Om Noms mouth or miss completely. As you dive deeper into the game, feeding\nthem becomes increasingly difficult as you must avoid obstacles that get in your way. You can direct the candy with objects around\nthe level like rockets, bubbles, or warp machines. The goal is to collect all three stars with\nthe candy prior to feeding the two Om Noms. There is a super power mechanic if you are\nhaving trouble with the levels which makes it easy for you to collect all the stars without\nthe harm of falling or running into damaging objects. Time Travel differs from previous titles in\nthe series by tasking the player with feeding two Om Noms instead of one. Strategy comes in to play as each monster\ncan only stomach a single piece of candy. I had a ton of fun playing the game. It was exactly what I was expecting: cute\ngraphics, fun music, and simple but engaging gameplay. It was easy to pick up if you've played the\nprevious titles and keeps you coming back for more when you have a few minutes to spare. This time around, I felt that the game catered\nmore for the younger audience as the puzzles were not extremely challenging. There were only a handful of really tricky\nlevels, but nothing where I would spend a significant amount of time trying to figure\nout. All puzzles were stationary within the screen\nspace, whereas previous games incorporated extended surfaces within a level which added\nto the difficulty. With the understanding that this is game suitable\nfor all ages, it is definitely enjoyable. Just don't expect the same level of challenge\nthe previous games provided. The game promises more levels down the road\nand gives the player an option to be notified when these become available. I am definitely hoping to get a bit more of\na challenge in upcoming stages. Zeptolabs also incorporated \"Om Nom Stories\",\na series of animated shows that compliment the game. These will be released over the coming months. Overall, Cut The Rope: Time Travel is a burst\nof fun and is sure not to disappoint their dedicated fan base. The game is only $0.99 in the App Store and\nGoogle Play for both mobile and tablet devices. Cut The Rope: Time Travel offers enough of\na variation to enjoy a new experience and a good amount of puzzles to keep you brain\ncircuits running. Thank you for joining me for today's review.

I'm gonna put it in for 30 more seconds and then we'll see what it looks like after okay so this is what it looks like after 30 seconds I guess we'll give it like 30 more seconds so it's like nice and light drippy so I don't know Yolo let's give it 30 more seconds okay actually I put it in for put it I put it in for 20 more seconds I think that looks good yeah all right so what you want to do now

three two one so be honest I'm not mad with it the only thing it's that it's really sticky and I feel like if we were to use more nerds then like it wouldn't be as sticky like all the little pieces like all the little like gummy stuff would be covered but I mean for two dollars it could either go right or wrong of course the microwave could explode it because of the spoon but we didn't die and it was good it tastes good I mean oh my mom like comment subscribe share this video to your friends I mean why wouldn't they make these little nerd ropes plus it was only 2 dollars and 20 minutes of your time literally so yeah guys see you on the next one bye", "5o99_lEdORw": "hey guys so today I am here with my sister you're not even in the frame so we got our ears on yours look cuter than mine I like yours touching me you wanna be accountant ah I'm a cowgirl yeah else we good those goalie I like that it goes my mine yeah this dog here I actually love these hmm oh my god I got one formation I'm just like hella cute it's like hot hold on I forgot about it I love this scene y'all see my face you can't good this all on Twitter I asked you guys what's your favorite candy no what's your least favorite candy so I asked everybody what Halloween candy do you absolutely despise can't stand and I went I not bought all of it and that's what I'm gonna be handing out for Halloween today just kidding we're gonna be trying all the candies that y'all said you hate it so almost everybody commented candy corn I don't know why y'all hit on candy corn so much it ain't even that bad but you know what y'all did with your hate I went to three stores they didn't have candy corn and then I have to go to a Walmart and then they had candy corn itself y'all erased it from the stores with your hate of candy corn so I don't really eat candy I did this year though you eat dessert though I Hellas dessert and yesterday I played a game with myself cuz you know I don't have any friends that every time I died on fortnight I would go get a piece of candy and eat it and I shall I can do I'm sorry so most of these candies I haven't had them and some of them I haven't had them in years just like since I was a kid so we're gonna try this again because I think my tastes have changed I used to hate Snickers and I had a Snickers yesterday and it was like the best damn thing I've ever had I don't know when I was a kid I just never liked that feel like anything not like everything I don't like anything now all right so let's see in my box man we got a hell of candy here first one panda corn was lost I mean eye candy last night there's a bowl of Adele why y'all got a bowl of it that is like got a handful before I go to bed oh nasty so we got classic candy porn right here we're gonna do a taste test you know how I used to eat these it's gonna like the bottom first throw this away the marrow one time these are delicious I don't know how you couldn't like to you yeah I don't know why people hated me so much they're really not that bad obviously I can't eat that much and only like the bottom one I feel like bottom one is the best part I blow the tops of us this off is the sweetest part may move real honey honey is literally the last ingredient it's got more artificial flavor than it does honey okay honey it tastes like artificial flavor I literally have like 20 bags of candy right not only do you go like this so this is another one that I found it is a vampire cheese candy corn I'm pretty sure it's the same thing just different flavors I don't know why not you have to try it that's the video oops I almost put it in the wrong hole so they're like red and white they're not actually pretty good mmm mmm they're different flavor they just way too sweet though this tastes nothing like candy corn that's not candy corn may not have any form so honey in these ones house no ma'am the only titanium dioxide instead of body I don't know what that is but this is like strawberry kind of find extra flavor the blood is strawberry flavored my teeth hurt already what is there yes you know I went to this ice cream place in LA and they had pig's blood ice cream when you try it literally pig's blood in the ice cream you try it no I'm scared to drive their seasonal flavors because I have a lot of like crazy ass flavors during Thanksgiving they had a turkey and gravy flavored ice cream I could eat I was like oh I'm a mashed potato one I was like no I didn't even try the sample I was like another one personally I dislike the consumptive inconvenience induced by Milk Duds same though I never like Milk Duds they're just they get stuck in your teeth I never liked anything with that texture so we're gonna try it again I actually like milk does this time around so I just caramel my chocolate I am trying so hard not you guys stuck on one tooth there shall be no dog got stuck in my teeth no those caramel apple always pops to the ground go to my favorite I always buy those I wish to them one part got stuck in the back teeth uh-huh this ain't your guy swallow it ain't no swallowing it now it's cooked all over my teeth that was half a bite either horrible it's gonna be stuck in my teeth I need a toothbrush redhots are the worst so I actually couldn't find Red Hawks I think Hot Tamales it's like the off-brand of it because I kind of look like each other yeah they're both cinnamon they're both hot oh it's that gluten free and fat-free I wonder if people look at it and they're like oh it's a gluten free and fat-free oh oh my god must be good for you not our good friend music doesn't have a wheat in it which is like 99% of candies are gluten free I hate this I hate anything cinnamon flavor didn't write 100 the why I love cinema I feel like cinnamon gum and cinnamon candies otherwise I love you soon America New York peaked oh it's like if they tried to make hot cheetos into a candy yeah this ain't it let me wash out my mouth with some blood spray I wonder what it's made of aqua methylparaben does that matter oh why somebody set butterfingers a couple of people said Butterfinger we're their least favorite you know out of all the damn candy I won't even said payday huh I like payday not payday the other one what's the other ones profit on making baby Ruths yeah baby baby Ruths son but I love payday hey dudes my favorite payday and a hundred grand bars those are my favorite so back to butterfingers have y'all had butterfingers an ice cream cuz I never liked butterfingers until I had butterfingers an ice cream so bomb so I knew were gonna do butterfingers because I love Butterfinger and I want y'all who sent that Butterfinger look the worst to take a second and rethink that someone said that nasty popcorn ball group yes but unfortunately today I went to like three stores four stores actually and I could not find a popcorn ball they're probably all sold out all the grandmas but why did they buy them both I don't know maybe you could have been a Costco for them or something them old-ass lollipops that people be finding last minute I threw mine out I had a bunch of old lollipops at Kennedy from last year online hmm should i mixes it with the candy and then I tried some myself and it was really hard I was like no I wouldn't do this is anybody black licorice I do too nasty ones that are bad well this is also mostly nasty I got black wigglers now these aren't gluten-free so I'm gonna have to take my chances of this I don't think a bite is gonna make me safe but I love squid where's it sucks that I can't be I used to love licorice like my parents used to get dudes licorice packs I used boxes of like circle shape licorice I thought hmm you don't like them that's bomb I love licorice yeah baby I can't eat it the second ingredient is wheat look good okay the whole thing if it wasn't weak but that wasn't bad I don't think black liquor is just awful one time I got a tube of toothpaste while I was trick-or-treating you should thank the dentist or whoever gave it to you I mean that was a toothbrush yes it's got to be a census only dentist gift toothbrushes and toothpaste for Halloween but that's very nice and considerate because after you eat all your candy aren't you gonna go brush your teeth unless your own monster understand what just being mad that you get to face why would you get mad it's free toothpaste you literally have to buy it they like in this Ekron damn it they didn't give me candies how dare they ain't nothing nicer than eating candy all day and then brushing your teeth like that feeling of having clean teeth a little brush my teeth so it's all good I know me Josh to floss Oh doctor sounds better than all this candy we adults now ow almond joys a lot of people said they hated enjoy they hated anything with coconut in it I don't think that these are bomb my to love these haven't had one since I was a kid stuff we shall see I only eat the bite with the almonds like I like from the side side she's a little off but I'm Desai real coconut no it's fake coconut is fructose that's actually not bad strong a good texture I love the textures textures and best part I like foods of weird textures I'll sugar free candies both make you poop no I wanna make you poop sugar free no trans fat most things don't have trans fat but okay so these are like old people pansies I'm gonna get the green which one do you want these are sugar-free they're made of isomalt and citric acid are they good they're not bad actually pretty good cuz they're not so strong Oh y'all hate hot sugar food for this would be good if you bit into them and they were soft I don't think they are there no I'm sure that's I okay it's very I don't some local porn I suck these nasty afnc rolls I

Yeah, it's a little high\nup, sorry about that. Last one of you to get off the toilet gets a chance at one million dollars. - [Group] Yeah, woo! - [Mr.Beast] And as weird as this sounds, I'm actually being serious. Here's what I mean. You are currently watching the\nthird video of this series. The first video is last to fall and the second is last to stop swinging. The winners of these\nfour videos will compete in a fifth video for one million dollars. So we grabbed some toilets, we put some people on the toilets, and we grabbed a million dollars, and now we're here. In today's video's special, Chandler is actually\nthe coach of two people. - Josh and Brian. - And Chris is also the\ncoach of two people. - Jenna and George. - If you guys win, Chandler gets a hundred\ngrand of the million. Same with Chris. So they're motivated. Feel free to make them do anything. And you guys can't rest\nyour feet on this thing, they have to remain dangling\nbecause you are literally just sitting on a toilet\nand it can't be too easy. All right, it begins. (toilet flush) So you've been on this\ntoilet for about two minutes. How do you feel? - I feel nothing. - Same, I know. You've been on the toilet for\ntwo minutes and 20 seconds. How do you feel? - It's pretty comfortable. - They've both been training. (laughing) They spend a lot of time on the toilet. - You've been on the\ntoilet for three minutes, how do you feel? - I feel like a solid stool. (clapping) - Good joke. - How do you feel, it's been\nabout three and a half minutes? - I feel good and I've spent a lot of time on the toilet practicing\njust for this day. - As did I.\n- I was made for this. - So Chandler, which of your\ntwo people is your favorite? - Oh, he's gonna do that. - You could've just said both. (upbeat music) So we have a baby doll and a trash can. If you make it in the\ntrash can, you get nothing. But if you miss, we jack up\nyour toilet very slightly. - Starting off with you.\n- You're gonna wanna make it. - You got this.\n(clapping) - Sink it. Buckets.\n(fail beeping) - [Group] Aww. - Since you missed, we\nhave to call in the plumber and he's gonna move\nyour toilet up slightly. You won't notice much of a difference, it's only the first pump. How many did you do? Two. - So then we have to do two per. Do you notice a difference? - Nope. - After about 50, you'll\nprobably be literally hanging. Throw away that baby doll. - [Group] Ohhh.\n(fail beeping) - Plumber. There we go. With time, we'll go\nhigher, higher, higher. Here's a little sneak peak of what it'll look like at the end. (upbeat music) Yes. - He knows what not to do. (fail beeping) - Give him a crank. Your turn sir. (fail beeping) - Jenny, how you feeling? - Pretty good, gonna win it. - How you feeling right now? - A little softer, but still firm. - Feeling good, I am\ndefinitely ready to win this. - Here's a magazine, here's a\nmagazine, here's a magazine, here's a magazine. We're about to do an hour long time lapse and I didn't want you guys bored. (upbeat music) Here's a plunger, here's a\nplunger, here's a plunger, here's a plunger. Chandler, we have four bowling balls. - Oh, those are actual bowling balls. - What do you think we're\ndoing with these bowling balls? - Bowling?\n- No. We're gonna see if they can\npick them up with a plunger. First one to do it wins. - Is that possible? - Yes. - How far do they have to pick it up? - Just an inch off the ground. - All right. - There's a certain way to\ndo this, it's top secret. Okay, so whoever stops trying\nlast is actually the winner. It's literally impossible. You can't pick a bowling\nball up with a plunger. You wanna give us a countdown? - Three. - Go! (suspenseful music) - [Camera Operator] Can you reach? - Got it. - [Camera Operator] He got it, he got it. Was it not supposed to be possible? - You can't pick a bowling\nball up with a plunger. The challenge was whoever\ngot mad and quit first one. But you actually got it. You won in an unconventional way. How can this plunger\npick up a bowling ball? We're gonna give you some squatty potties so you can rest your legs. Something else help. Nope! I need something else. Here you go sire. You now get it for five minutes. So do you feel relieved? - Yes, a lot actually. It brings all the pressure off my legs. - Yo, we have the same hat. - Wow. - All right, what can I get you guys that will make it easier? - A lot of snickers. - Snickers. - Maybe a dog. - That's a lot more difficult than candy but I'll look into it. I guess if a dog will help me\nget a hundred thousand dollars I'll get her a dog, if\nthat's really what she wants. Alright, I got you guys candy. I'm working on the dog. I know you want some snickers bars. I think there's some\nsnickers in there, yeah. And I got gummy bears and I know you like the sour patch kids. You guys are gonna do great. - Alright. - Gonna help me out, let's do it. The doggo has been requested. Aw, she came right for you. Does that make things easier for you? - Yeah. - Aw. - Yup, I love dogs. - Does anybody else want to see the dog? Do you want to pet him? - [Off Camera Contestant] Absolutely. - Aw, that sucks, get a better coach. - Aw, Chris, like honestly, I'm starting to not like you at all now. - You know you have your\nfeet up, so it's easier. - I hate to ruin your pooping conversation but your five minutes is up sir, so we're just gonna, there we go. (upbeat music) - Josh, what would you like to eat? - Chicken nuggets. - All right. What would you like? - I want something that you\nrecommend that's from this area. - Why do they always do this to me? - I'm gonna get our food delivered. So I'm gonna give you guys the phone, y'all pass it back and forth. Get whatever y'all want, it's on me. (upbeat music) We got the Popeyes. We got some nuggies. We got tartar sauce and ranch. Who got tartar sauce? What's wrong with you? - [Camera Operator]\nYour coach got you food and Chandler didn't. (upbeat music) - There's no way. - That won't work. - [Group] Ohhh! - Oh my god! I will never hit that in a million years. - Turn the lights red. This is very serious. Take this plunger and do a plunger flip. You got it, don't worry. Any second now. - [Camera Operator]\nPlunger flip, plunger flip. - And if you land it, like that, you win and we'll put two squatty potties. If you don't, and you land it\nlike that, we do two cranks. This is a big deal. We're gonna go down the line, this is why the lights\nare red, it's a big deal. (fail beeping)\n- No! - [Camera Operator] This is gonna be hard. You ain't gotta do him like that man. - Here you go. All day. (fail beeping)\nExcept for today. (intense music) Just nail this and\neverything will be fine. - I got it. - I can't believe you just did that. (fail beeping) Oh darn.\n(laughing) Four times. He doesn't win these. (fail beeping)\n- [Group] Aww. - Too much back spin on it. (intense music) If you're ever in a Mr. Beats video, practice your plunger flips. - All right, you've had a couple\nof pumps, how do you feel? - I feel great. - You can take a couple of pumps. How about you? - Pumped up, got a lot of energy left. - Get it?\n(laughing and clapping) - Chris, we forgot something. - What? - Lights back to normal. - Oh, we did forget, thank you. You guys are gonna win and\nthen one of you is gonna win, I don't know who that's gonna\nbe but you're gonna do great. - All right Josh. - Senpai. - You've had a lot of cranks back there. - Yeah. - You leaning a little bit? (squeaking)\nSo, how are you doing? - I'm doing fine. - Good luck duck. (clapping and quacking) (upbeat music) - There is a million dollars on the line. What would you buy if you won? - A house, a car, pay off parent's debt. - Chris, with your hundred\ngrand, what would you buy? - A lot of food, like a lot. - Good, good. - Unhealthy amount. - If you won the million\ndollars, what would you buy? - A Pomeranian.\n(barking) - How about you sir? - I would buy my mom a house and I would put more money\ninto my YouTube channel. I need to buy my house as well. - Two houses, okay, okay. - I would definitely buy a house, probably pay off my\nmom's house and get a car and then just spend a\nbunch of money on my son. - Aw, that's sweet. Now I kind of want you to win. - I kind of want me to win too. - But only one of you guys wins! - I'm gonna get another car and then I'm gonna get\na really really nice car and probably an animal. (upbeat music) - Hey Chandler, you can flush\nall your hopes and dreams of winning down the drain. (heavy metal music) - Oh, what'd you say to me? Give me this. - Ah! Give me TP, ow! Don't you throw a plunger at me? - That shoulda took care\nof that right there. - Can I just borrow this sir? - I bought this for my contestant. Make it in his mouth and we'll\ngive him a squatty potty. - That's risky sir. - Oh!\n(air horn) Give him a squatty potty! - We'll give you your squatty\npotty when you're done. (drum roll) (fail beeping) - You hit her right on her shirt. All right. (drum roll) - All right, two people have one so far. (drum roll) Ah, two for two! Here you go, they both get them. You're welcome. (upbeat music) - We're gonna call his mommy. Here's your son, see. He's sitting on a toilet and\nif he's the last one to leave, he gets to compete for a million dollars. - Dame motivacion. - Baby suck it up. - I am. - Baby I love you, I love you. - Hey mom! - Hello!

"1S5mhxxN2hI": "[Music] hi I'm Travis Anton buck with LED source and today we're gonna talk about how to change the fuse in a GE rope light and do you have a rope light that's burnt well obviously you want to change the fuse in it because it's not gonna operate if you don't it's a very simple process right on the end of the plug is a fuse box it's a real simple slide open you may need a small screwdriver to pop that open good fingernails or a little screwdriver pop the old fuse out the replacement is usually inside the box with the other fuse there's usually two of them in there if not you may have to go and find another one but usually the extra ones in there pop your new fuse in use a small screwdriver or something to push it down and make sure those contacts are making contact slide the cover back shut plug it back in and that's all there is to it now you've got a nice bright rope light again and since you're using LEDs you're saving energy on your decorations or on your exterior Christmas lights or whatever you use them I'm Travis with LED source and that's how you do it thanks [Music]", "P8hNo840LdQ": "one two three four five six seven 200 what's up everybody um today's a

got the the stick which we're going to be sitting on to or holding on to you know in lion king yeah was it lion king yeah but they all meet up before the fire and they're going the river the pond of whatever it's called it looks like it's all dried out yeah they what's it called a water hole no but in lion king it's not called that the water in hole oh i'm gonna ask the whole of the water the serengeti jumanji no so we're trying to find a spot where we came the other day we found a tree that was kind of perfect because it goes you need to be like going off a swing out into like off an edge

located in the desert which you will need the boss to be repaired to get over there it is initially locked and requires the school key to gain access you can get this key by a reach in the bottom floor of the original mine there is an infinite number of floors or levels in the school cabin similar to the mines you can advance from floors by finding a ladder on each floor either by mining rocks or defeating enemies but you can also sometimes find a shaft or a hole which makes it possible to skip 3 to 15 floors at a single time but dropping down these shafts will cause a small amount of damage unlike the mines there is no elevator to save progress each visit must start again from the very first floor every 10 floors you process down the chance to find iridium or will increase significantly the monsters in the cavern also have a chance to drop or and iridium bars exploring the cavern with good look will increase the frequency of all veins item drops and the appearance of ladders and holes okay so now you know some general information about the school cabin let's get straight into the preparation and things you'll need and want before and during your time down there [Music] before you even hesitate to take a trip to the school cavern you are going to want to make sure you're mining and combat skill levels are high the reason for this is simple the higher your level of these skills the stronger and more efficient you are down there getting the higher level in mining isn't really a muster this will just help you find more gems and ores and also increase their value depending on what profession you choose which makes your time down there more worthwhile but having your combat skill level high or maxed out before the school cavern is very very important reaching level 5 and 10 in the combat skill will allow you to choose a special profession for example if you reach level 10 in combat you get the option to be a scout or a fighter if you choose the fighter you can pick either the brute profession or the defender profession brute making you deal more damage against enemies or the defender giving you more HP and if you choose to be the scout you get to pick either the Acrobat or the desperado profession making your critical strikes deadly against enemies or calling down your special moves these skilled professions are so important to have against the monsters down there there is no best profession to choose from it is all down to your preference and your play style are you an attacking person or defending person [Music] okay so I'm going to tell you guys what you are going to be facing and what you are up against in the school coven firstly the big and main problem is the time of course time is on your side just like it is all over the game but it's more of a problem in the school cavern because your progress does not save with having no elevator and you need to start from level one every time you enter and the deeper mines are the floors you want to be on for the big rare items so to fight the time you need to be fast don't take guitar mini ones don't hit every single rock inside and collect everything you see and even fight every enemy just focus on finding them stairs to get to the deeper floors and then you can take your time using anything with a speed boost will help but I will be going through the best things for speed later in this video so stay tuned but another thing you're facing all the enemies of course the main monsters that are in the school caverns and the most powerful that you need to look out for are the mummies and the Serpent's mummies are 260 HP and deal a big 30 damage but you can't kill these enemies with just a sword they need to be finished with any type of explosion after being knocked down with a weapon and the serpents are the biggest problem down the cavern that I find these are very very fast monsters as they are flying they have 150 HP and deal 23 damage but it is their speed that is deadly so using a fast weapon with big speed and good knock back is required for these monsters there will be some other monsters you'll bump into as well such as slimes and bass but they're the least of your worries [Music] now let's talk about health and energy things you'll need to keep you alive firstly you want to try and focus on collecting as much or if not all of the star drops a star drop is a special item that permanently increases your maximum energy by 34 points there are total of seven to find obtaining there many ways from the star D Valley Fair the treasure chest on the floor 100 in the mines to get you one from your spouse when you're at full house there is other ways to get them I won't be going through that on this video go into the school cabin with a lot of stamina will be very handy but not as important as food and health you will be up against some strong and fast enemies and you will deal and take big amounts of damage so replenishing your health is a must in the school cabin and I have got a few recipes and meals that I'd recommend to take with you to help you with this problem the first one being the roof platter you will unlock this recipe at combat level 3 and the ingredients are one cave carrot and one winter room a very easy dish to make the roofs platter will give you 125 energy and 56 health once consumed now this meal isn't that useful for health regain but it will give you a bonus plus free attack against enemies for a duration of 5 minutes and 35 seconds making you deadly against enemies the next meal you should take with you is the pumpkin soup this recipe will be unlocked and sent in the mail by Robin once you are seven hearts with her and all you need is one pumpkin and one milk to cook this recipe this meal will replenish 200 energy and 90 health at a time but the most important thing about this meal is that it will give you a +2 look and applause to defense for a 7 minute duration which is perfect for protection and a higher chance to find rare items [Music] the last cooking dish and in my opinion the best one to take with you I do it all the time it is the crabcakes now you can find this recipe on The Cooking Channel in fall you'll need one crab one wheat flour one egg and one oil to make it a bit more tricky to cook but this will replenish 225 energy and 101 health once consumed which is brilliant if you have a few of these with you but also crabcakes give you a +1 speed boost and a +1 defense boost for a duration of 16 minutes and 47 seconds which is so important avoiding and defending yourself against the enemies [Music] so we have covered what you'll need for boosting health but now let's talk about protection from helping you not lose health firstly you need to think about armor things like boobs and rings these are both important as wearing both of these clothing items will give you benefits such as defense and immunity from the monsters the best boots you can get in the game and definitely a must-have item with you are the space boots these can be found from a chest on the level 110 floor in the basic minds space boots will give us for defense and a plus for immunity from all enemies which will protect you massively and the best ring to wear whilst down the school cavern other iridium bands you can craft these yourself once reaching level 9 combat another reason why the combat skill is important or you can find them by fishing for treasure chests iridium bands will give you lights from the globe it will attract items like a magnet and also give you 10% more attack damage amazing right bolt you can actually wear two of these bands at a time doubling your attack by 20% and giving you a bigger glow and a bigger magnet area I will definitely recommend to have two of these rings to help you down the school cavern mind now let's talk about weapons what will you need to fight these powerful enemies well the best sword in the game is of course the galaxy sword dealing 60 to 80 damage with a 0.2% critical hit jams and an amazing +4 weapon speed boost perfect against the serpents you can either buy this for 50,000 gold in the adventures guild or exchange a prismatic shard and place it under the three pillars in the desert but if you do not have this weapon you can also take the lava katana which can be found once reaching the bottom of the normal mines now this weapon won't give you as much damage but it will give you more critical power and a defense boost perfect against the slimes also surprisingly using slingshots is a great way to fight enemies to use an explosive ammo is very effective against mummies killing them for good but if you use gold all four amination this will deal substantial amounts of damage against all strong enemies try yourself [Music] [Applause] okay so on to the speed topic like I said this is very important down the school cabin you need to progress down the floors as fast as possible also avoiding the enemies as much as you can if necessary don't fight them run and avoid them to help with the speed boost take a lot of coffee with you easy to produce and giving you a good plus-one speed boost for a few minutes you can also use the speed boost from a cookie meal at the same time as the coffee boost giving you an even bigger speed boost one of the thing you can do to progress faster is use explosives you can craft these or buy them from the dwarf these will destroy enemies easily and also destroy rocks and stones in your path making you find ladders and shafts a lot faster but also easily finding you lots of resources such as iridium or to gather these items quickly use ring magnets to collect them instead of walking to each item the magnet ring will attract and click them up whilst you are running but the main important thing to do for speed and faster progression is to craft staircases to get down to the lower floors staircases can be used for rapid descent or skipping troublesome floors since their cases do not stack it can be more space efficient to bring plenty of stone and craft the staircases as you need them by doing this you can easily get to level 300 cloth in one full day so fill out your backpack with stone and find your own ladders okay finally one last thing to do down the school cabin if you find yourself in big big trouble either the time is really late and the day is nearly over or your health and energy drops to near death point and you need to make a quick exit then use warp totems or your return scepter to get home as fast as possible to avoid this emergency you can craft warp totems yourself or purchase them from the casino but bring some of these with you it will be better than dying and losing items and money okay so that comes to the end of this video guys my very own personal score carving guide which I go by every single time and it's the most efficient way I have found to master the school cavern and progress a lot further I've experimented with this many times and it has always worked I hope that this guide has helped you in some way maybe you didn't know some of these tips and you got some useful ideas

the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you

careful uh let's open it up and see tons and tons of candy super fun let's take a look at this big opportunity first it's a huge half of skinny and it's super cute - yeah giant these are oh my gosh I'm gonna try this pink one oh my gosh delish these are the candy these are giant gumballs oh they are so big oh my goodness so awesomely delicious now let's give this a try these are called lightning bugs gummy candy half of these things I've never even seen before oh my goodness so there's a little clamp in here and I guess you're supposed to clamp the candy clamp the little worms and eat them so let's pull this out oh there's a little light on there okay so I guess every time you grab a candy okay let's try grabbing this one so I'm thinking to every small tiny grabby candy it's going to light it up okay hold on let me turn off the light and see [Music] okay that didn't work out too well because once I turn off the light I couldn't see what I was grabbing so here we go okay so you can sort of see the light inside here oh my gosh how cool is that how oh my gosh so you can eat a worm how cool is that hold on let me turn on the light and we'll clamp another one so I can see what I'm doing so that was the yellow gummy worm let's try to clamp the red one and we'll see [Music] super cool right oh my goodness you can totally eat these in the dark how cool is that okay now I have to give us a try okay that tasted a little bit strange I think it's because these red ones are supposed to be strawberry and these are supposed to be lemon but that one tasted almost like a strawberry lemon but I was expecting to taste strawberry and it wasn't and here is a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sword I think the lights up hold on really quickly ooh look at that this is totally bright you can use this as a flashlight and you know let your little gummy worms and find which one you want to eat and eat it super cool so let's open the tip [Music] this is a plastic over it so that means that if you're not done with it you can actually save it so I'd even check the flavor of this hey let's give this a try this is surprisingly good it tastes a little bit like Apple not sour at all I have a spoon to be like a lemony line flavor but it's not so if you're not done with it you can kind of put it back together and save it for later here are some Harry Potter Bertie Botts beans and my goodness too scared to try Harry Potter can we see the flavors on the bag oh okay so we have banana black pepper a blueberry booger ill candy candy for this chair Oh Mike it's dirt earthworm earwax grass green apple marshmallow rotten egg sausage lemon soap tutti frutti vomits and watermelon oh my gosh no way no way I think I'm gonna pass on shiny but that way you guys know that there are such flavours for jelly beans huh here is an icy squeeze candy this is blue raspberry flavored oh my gosh imagine just eating this entire - that would be just too much too much so I'm just gonna squeeze it in here so you guys can see this is like liquid candy oh my gosh [Music] it's almost like toothpaste to assure you guys look at that and there's so much more left inside here so I guess you can squeeze whatever you would like and eat it I guess squeeze it right into your mouth here is something called two tarts smart choice spray candy and it's sure free with vitamin C how do we open this here pop off ooh okay and then you just spray it oh my gosh it's yellow in color so I can imagine almost orange house our this would be here's some it teenage me a ninja turtle candy and it says on the back that these are watermelon shell sours so mMmmm so the guests are supposed to taste like watermelon they actually look a lot like sweetheart here is a baby bottle pop and the flavor is berry blast oh my goodness this is one of those sour powders oh my gosh these are way too sour for me okay so give it a lick dunk it in the powder and oh my goodness lick it off this is too too sour oh my goodness so what else do we have here it looks like we have how about this one oh my gosh toxic waste slime a liquor sour rolling liquid candy and oh and strawberry okay strawberries my favorite flavor so let's see how we open this okay I guess you just turn it oh my gosh it's like a little roller and you're just supposed to roll it oh my goodness okay how am I going to share this okay so I'm showing it on my hand and you just kind of roll it around and I guess you're supposed to like roll around your tongue oh my goodness this is surprisingly yummy and I can totally see why they would say it's toxic waste because I don't really know how healthy any candy is is for you but this is very interesting and actually tastes pretty good especially since it's strawberry here goes more sour staff sour dippers sweet berry lollipop and sour cherry powder so open this up okay this is another one of those honking ones oh my gosh okay warheads yeah you're going to war with your taste buds so tear this off [Music] sweet berry and lollipop okay so I'm going to try the lollipop without dipping it first it does taste very very like but I wish it were strawberry here goes the dunking powder oh no hmm interesting it's not as sour as this baby bottle one that I opened earlier this one was really really sour this was actually okay it's not too sour I was expecting it to be more sour hey this right here I've been wanting to try I want to see this is Tabasco by the way Tabasco jellybeans I wanted to see if this really tastes like Tabasco sauce so let's see how do we go oh my gosh it opens this even the lid is just like a Tabasco a jar of Tabasco sauce oh whoa I think that's me so I'll just take one oh my gosh definitely there's enough heat in here I think it might be even more spicy than Tabasco sauce oh my goodness I'm not that spicy man-eater but oh my gosh and here is an icy cherry spray candy see how this one works oh so it's almost like the other one this one right here spray candy and I guess you just spray it so let me grab another cup so you guys can see so this is how it looks and I will give this a try just to let you guys know if it actually tastes like icy barely icy to me has always been kind of sweet this is quite sour actually but it would be interesting to try just so you know the difference and then here is some hubba bubba bubble tape and it's called the triple treat strawberry blueberry and watermelon look at that so colorful and you can tear off as much as you would like and clamp it close and it will cut a piece of bubble gum for you super-young but I still like the original pink

"hello I'm Alyssa the crotch a ginger today I'm doing another macrame plant hanger this is another beginner project we're doing this one right here you can obviously make it longer depending on on your needs for how long you want it to be and I think these look really cool in a series so that's why I'm doing four of them together because they look really neat if you hang like at least three of them four of them together so for this project you're going to need three 16 inch rope and I buy these big spools which have 1,200 feet this is from not in rope supply comm so I like to measure it while it's on the ground and you just simply like this spool is kind of getting low but usually you can kind of just pull it around so we're going to need three body links that's one two and you can kind of get enough flow where you sort of just like move the rope around the spool like that that's three and then you cut it for this one we need six pieces at three body lengths like that we're going to need some extra for the gathering knot at the top I cut two there's a gathering not here and the gathering not here so we need two pieces for that this is about three-quarter body links so you can see I went one and a half I went half and then 3/4 so we need two of those and other supplies include a metal ring like this you can get these at just a hobby store and I am using this is the 3 inch ring metal ring and a pair of sharp scissors and a pot obviously with your plant in it so the first thing you're going to do is obviously cut your ropes and then find the center point this is the center point you're going to put all your ropes through the loop just like this so there's one tail of it and I'm holding on to the center so I know where that is and I don't have to remeasure it so there's the center and you have six pieces of rope which equals 12 ropes hanging down okay now you're going to take your other piece that you cut that was 3/4 body links and you're going to point it toward the sky you're going to see I don't want to do this okay I'm going to wrap it around my hand like that sorry this one's a little bit different because of okay wrap it around your hand like that and then I like to go left you're just gathering all of these ropes together making sure your tail and staying out so wrap it around however many times and I like to tighten it as I go okay so have about seven wraps here and then I'm going to put the tail of the rope through the center I think I'm going to do one less actually so I can fit it through there there we go I showed this in my other video the first plant hanger also okay now pull up on this rope and then just kind of resituated so I don't have a rope sticking out that's too short you know I thought about incorporating that piece in you know just leaving it really long but I don't want an odd number so I want an even number these are really easy knots we have the gathering knot we have a square knot left and right hand so I'm going to do I'm going to drop down a little bit do a left handed square knot and then a right handed square knot and then for this pattern we're leaving a little bit of space so I'm going to leave like maybe an inch in between each of the square knots so these are kind of sticking out like that it creates kind of like this chain look and if you need to let's say I messed up and I came down here with my square knot and then I looked at my other pieces and I realized that I needed to move it up before you move on to the next piece you just kind of pull on these right here and that'll tighten it up for you and then pull the tails so I'm trying to get it as even as possible let me see how many I had seven I had seven that's three four okay now we're at this first one is already done so we're going to turn this around and we'll work on the next four you're doing the same exact thing left and right handed square knot so you'll have three arms of this plant hanger and you want them to be symmetrical to the the others okay now we have the three arms of our plant hanger done now we're going to incorporate these strands together so we have three we're going to take two from one and two from the other and we're making another square knot we're going to do it maybe like five or six inches down from our last knot there so and we're doing how many square knots do we have two four six so this one you're creating what I'm showing here on this piece which is just square knots all the way down and that's the support for the pot so you're just going left right left right if you lose your place you can kind of you know backtrack by seeing like see when I do a left handed square knot this ends up on that side and I do a right handed it ends up on the other side so let's see how many sets we have here and also a completed square knot will kind of create this little V so we have one two three four five six let's just do six four now see how that looks okay now we're going to turn this and do our next two so you can see that again we're incorporating the strands together so their first set okay now we have that all completed now we're going to grab that other piece that we cut at the beginning and we're going to do another gathering knot so same process as before oops point that one up wrap it around your hand and try to get these ropes like a little bit you want them to be pretty neat so okay do one more and then put the tail through that little loop we created pull up I'm going to cut this piece off here you can see we have you know quite a bit of rope left here so you could probably get away with doing let's see we had three body links you can probably do two and a half body links now I'm just going to trim randomly and i'ma leave that other tail piece out because I don't need to that will just be part of the bottom and I will unwind this eventually oops I have too many kind of seam height there just try to get them a bit more random there we go okay and let's double check that our pot fits in there I'm going to use this for the one so this one's actually a little bit longer than its original brother over there so there you have it and kind of arrange your leaves in there this little guy needs some more sunlight and I did this one longer just because this one was pretty short the bigger pot of course makes it look shorter because the ropes are going out wider so there you have it another beginner macrame plant hanger I hope you enjoyed this video if you'd like to follow me on instagram my name is crafty underscore ginger I'll post other links for the videos in this series I have another one here that I'll show you how to make which incorporates all the same knots except and we have a half hitch diagonal half hitch knot and some beads so these are all beginner projects and I encourage you to make you know more than one so it looks nice hanging in your window or wherever you're going to put them thanks so much for watching I'm the crafty ginger Melissa bye", "P96FH20GHaI": "Wow which is breaking everything this video all right boys boys boys today's gonna be a fun day ladies and gentlemen I hope you guys are ready for this

The car had passed through\nhere last night at 1 o'clock. No sir, I have not moved\nfrom here since last night. This car didn't\npass through here. They passed through the\ntoll, but didn't reach here.. ..then where did they go? Sir, sir there is a path that\nmeets the highway up ahead. That's it.. that's it. yes..

Look, I have a solution for it. Eighty percent ours,\nand twenty percent yours. Twenty percent mine.\n- Yes. Do you agree or should\nI send the message. Give me the phone, I\nwill send the message. If I wanted only twenty percent.. ..then what was the need for\nme to compromise with you. I would have told the\ngovernment about the 100 million, and then I would have\n20 percent officially. And then medals, and then\ninterview in the papers.. ..and televisions. Should I send the message? No, no.. I have another solution, 60-40. 60 percent ours and\n40 percent yours.

Your justice is only while\ntaking money, not when giving. When you had to give\n6,000 for the headlight.. ..at that time you were one unit. And now that you have to take 6\nmillion, then you are two units. There will be only three shares,\nhis, mine and the both of you. Then how much money will I get?\n- Quiet 1 million, that's all. How 1 million, 1.5 million! We will not take anything\nless than 3 million. Are you being stubborn?\n- Yes I am. What do you mean by that?

But..\n- No buts, I don't want that money.. ..apart from the 1\nmillion 5 hundred thousand. Okay keep it.\n- What do you mean? Boman, when your father\nkicked you out of the house.. ..then I paid your\nrent, leave that too. Adds upto 1-1.5\nlaks, count that too. If you are adding that,\nthen add the 80-90 thousand.. ..the money that I\nspent on your merriment. You are so cheap. You have\nshown your true colors. You are not talking\nof majestic yourself. You are the son of a cheapskate. You called me the\nson of a cheapskate! You pushed me! You friends are fighting\namongst yourself. To hell with friendship! Yes, to hell with friendship!

Please forgive it.\n- Please forgive it! We are coming in your shelter. We are coming in your.. quiet! We don't want to die,\nwe don't want to die!

And Bomans car that\nyou had wrecked.. ..you will pay for\nthat too, wont you. The car is Boman's\nfather and not Boman's. I want that money. Uncle, take that money\nfrom Boman's share. You had wrecked the car why\nshould I alone pay for it? Then who will pay for\nit, it is your car? You three will pay\nfor it, who else.

statistics about 1 million cars are stolen in the u.s. each year the biggest targets are Toyota Honda and General Motors vehicles according to the thieves themselves this is because these cars are a little easier to steal and their spare parts are in high demand well I don't know about you but I'd like to keep Grand Theft Auto in the video game realm so let's see what tricks car thieves are trying to pull these days and most importantly how to protect our cars from theft as soon as there's some public gathering a big party or even a busy day at the mall these criminals have an announcement made over the PA system that a particular car chosen by them of course has blocked their vehicle in and they can't leave as soon as the owner comes out to move his car a group of guys often armed are ready to jump in they assume and for good reason that the person is carrying the key to his car so they make the victim get in the car with them this is pretty easy if it's a gunpoint as for the outcome this can have that often depends who so to prevent such a situation from happening to you don't immediately rush out to your car and certainly don't go alone don't go directly to your car check from a distance if your car really is blocking another one if you've confirmed that you're really preventing another car from driving away check if there's a driver in the car you've blocked and please be very cautious when coming up to your vehicle watch your surroundings number two we live in a world of constant technological development that's why it's no surprise that new generation car thieves are using gadgets to steal vehicles criminals are hacking into the latest keyless systems to enter the newest models several thieves hold special radio transmitters near the doors windows or walls of the car owners house these transmitters intensify the sig coming from key fobs which are obviously kept inside but often close to the front door the thief's transmitter mimics the car key and pings the car's locking system the locking system automatically responds and sends a signal to the key and the key is supposed to pick up this signal and respond to it the transmitter of the first thief directs the locking system signal to the transmitter of another criminal standing close to the house and this second transmitter in turn forwards the signal to the key fob the key fob sends back the right response which the transmitter amplifies and sense to the first transmitter is then passed on to the car's locking system after all this complicated signal painting the door is opened and the ignition is started and you can basically kiss your car goodbye now how to protect your car from this not the kissing but the theft if you have a car with keyless entry look into getting a special radio signal deactivation option it can prevent this abuse of the key signalization don't be hesitant about special devices that can protect your car like a kill switch for example this is a device that stops power to the engine making it impossible to start the car until you disable it the only problem with kill switches is that it's not easy to install one yourself so if you don't have the best wiring skills you probably need to see a mechanic even if these guys do break into your car you can outsmart them by having a removable steering wheel sure car thieves are good drivers but even they can't control a car without a steering wheel yeah you might look a little weird walking into the business meeting or a date with a removable steering wheel in your hand but there's no shame in it you're just protecting your baby now number three here's the latest car theft scam that would give computer geniuses a run for their money criminals copy and reproduce your car's VIN to organize a huge fraud scheme the VIN is literally your car's ID number so by copying it thieves create a sort of clone of your car how do they do it there are two ways first the VIN is unique for every car so thieves copy the VIN from cars and parking lots junkyards car dealerships or even from the internet after that they prepare all the necessary documents and fake plates then they find a similar car and steal it once they replace that cars original VIN with the one they copied they're good to go the car won't be considered stolen with its new identity and here's the second way criminals can use this vehicle identity scam one thug rents a car then they spot another car identical to the one they've rented and copy its ven the rented car gets this new VIN after that the criminals offer the car for sale on the internet or through a newspaper presenting it as the car whose VIN they've stolen an unsuspecting client buys the car some days later the criminals steal the car back to return its real VIN and take it back to the rental at the same time the cars whose VIN has been borrowed is reported stolen its real owner gets arrested and can be sentenced to five to ten years in prison for a crime they haven't committed whoo and I'm just over here wondering where the heck these bozos get all this time on their hands all right what can you do to prevent this easy keep the VIN on your car covered up and don't reveal this information unless you absolutely need to number four another way car thieves get close to your vehicle is by posing as for example mechanics they start working in a garage a dealership or at a car wash as soon as they notice the model they've been after their work is done they have the key they don't even need to break in what else can a car thief dream of the only thing you can do here to prevent this from happening to you is to surface your car in trusted places don't go back alley just to save a buck number five if you live in an apartment building you really need to pay attention to this next scheme thieves set the alarm off in your car in the dead of night you as a polite and conscientious neighbor feel uncomfortable disturbing and waking up others so you disable your alarm and that's exactly what the thieves want now nothing is stopping them from picking the locks starting the ignition and driving away with your precious car not to get caught in this trap again removable steering wheels and kill switches are a nice choice or just pretend to be deaf and ignore the screams of your alarm sorry neighbors I kind of like the James Bond ejection seat option myself oops there it is number six now we've seen some pretty intricate convoluted and let's just admit it pretty ingenious scheme so far well this next one is probably the simplest yet most dangerous so listen carefully some thieves will hang out around grocery stores in major supermarkets and stalk their prey so to say they'll wait for a lone shopper to walk to their car with all their grocery bags sneak up on them and either demand the keys and drive off or abduct the car owner and who knows what else after that there are some effective steps you can take to prevent this avoid going to the grocery late in the evening or at night this scheme is almost only used when it's dark out try not to go to the grocery store alone these guys target the most vulnerable victims do not park your car far away from the stores entrance if there are no spots closer to the doors keep circling the lot until one opens up your safety is more important than your time number 7 and finally there have recently been some heated discussions on the internet about this new trick being used by car thieves and that's the trick with a coin they slip it into the space between the door and the door handle when a car owner thinks that they've locked the door with a remote the vehicle is in fact still open the coin prevents the lock on one of the doors from working soon as the owner walks away from the car the thief has no problems at all opening the door and driving away I can't say I've ever tried this one I'm not that big of a bozo now do you think it really works comment down below I'd love to know if this trick is real so have you heard about other scams car thieves are using nowadays tell us in the comments spread this knowledge

digging for gold oh cool can I come totally hop on it we're going gold digging Oh awesome a mega giant gold bars these are super sized you these gold bars are so heavy - I wonder if there really is real gold in here it says that Luck's will have a one out of two money for a chance to find gold on the inside digging for gold we can open up the gold bar and oh there it is right there oh it's so giant so here is our very very very sandy gold bar mmm gold on the top and it's a very very very thick thick thick like super compressed sand inside of our gold box well here we have our gold digging tools we can hammer it up or dig it out and then use the little paintbrush duster to kind of dust away to see if we found anything oh I just put it in water that way we can get it out faster so we'll just think our sand gold bar into the water alright let's here we go take our gold bar and sink it in it's just absorbing all of that water [Music] reach the top now we can take a little scooper picker and look at that look at how much easier it is now to scoop out the sand totally just give it a scoop like that we should be able to find the gold in no time keep on going we found the obsidian stone completely solid black in color well it's not dulled but it's pretty cool oh I love it it's really cool did you know that obsidian stone is created from volcanoes what did stone write he was created from a volcano mm-hmm from its lava when lava came out of the volcano and it cooled very quickly it's more of a volcanic glass instead of a stone cuz if we were to break this it would get really really sharp edges Oh yep back in the Stone Age these would be sharpened into arrowheads okay that is cool yeah oh yeah you can definitely see right here how this has the look of glass kind of with these rings right here and it's very very very smooth I can easily see how if you were to fracture this obsidian stone it could easily turn just as sharp as glass all right well we've got another gold box now sink it into the water right that water is absorbing it's absorbing it's making the sand SuperDuper soft time to dig the gold out all right lux there you go be careful standing on top of there it's gonna start getting mushy okay okay there we go Oh careful lux careful I'm Castle keep digging keep digging all right be careful cuz you're gonna be hitting that stone any moment keep digging well Lots careful alright it may be safer if you hung out right here okay let's see where is that stone at where is it oh no now the waters starting to get all mushy oh there it is I see it right here scoop it out and we've got a really pretty round stop weigh me it's kind of red mm-hmm you can see that it's got all of these different color layers going through it that is going to be the rainbow stone Wow you can see lots of different colors just completely banding through it these Downes are pretty cool but I wish we would've found gold because gold over here check it out Akbar can only the candy wrapper is all golden we can open it up and there we've got white chocolate bar and it's got surprise blind ads on the inside this one is a super-duper sour lemon it's so sour and this one is oh no no it's super sticky it's a gummy honey it's a bottle of runny honey and then that gold gold no if you want gold you got to get a treasure map and fight off pirates and and in skeletons and then find the key to the treasure chest that's what you gotta do if you want gold you go on a treasure hunt okay we can go on a treasure hunt to the car oh wow oh we've got a golden ball what is inside of the golden ball and crack it open and which golden shopkins to be fine Oh [Music] Rocsi ring oh that is a blinging ring a big jumbo golden perfume bottle okay that's pretty sweet all right khaki pants I hope you guys enjoyed this video so we didn't find any gold inside of the gold bars but we didn't find these golden shopkins and cookie fans have a heart of gold they sure do look at your guys as mega mega sweet sweet sweet comments thank you so much for all of your SuperDuper kind words and of course I'm obsessed with your guys's amazing fan art I love this amazing drawing from

But just because some of us complete challenges\nwith ease, Doesn\u2019t mean others can too. Enter: Julie What\u2019s wrong with this thing? WOAH! Did I do that? Lets spin for our first Tik Tok Challenge! Nothing like a bold red lip, right ladies? Lookin\u2019 good, Julie. But freshly painted lips pose some problems. No one\u2019s watching right? No smudging here! And the same goes with eating. Don\u2019t touch the lips! Nice Oh, Julie. GAH! What was that?! Hannah? It\u2019s a rubber band for the next challenge! Try to get it off of your face\u2026 Without using your hands at all. Just your facial muscles! Man, you girls sure look funny right now. C\u2019mon, rubber band! Move! Julie\u2019s rubber band is actually moving! But it\u2019s caught on my lips! Julie\u2019s in the lead! But sadly, her beauty was compromised. C\u2019mon Hannah, you can do it! You\u2019re so close, Julie! If I could only get it over my bottom lip! Almost there! Yes! You got it! Can I be done now? I\u2019m exhausted. And that, my friends, is how it\u2019s done. Uh, Julie? Oh yea. Yep, she has no idea. Time for another Tik Tok challenge, ladies\nand gents! Think you can balance a small cup of water? Seems easy enough. But can you balance it on your head? Then lower yourself to the ground, Butt on the floor, Then get all the way back? And one more thing: You have to grab it with your knees like this! Steady\u2026 Yes! That was pretty impressive, Hannah! There\u2019s more?! You\u2019re gonna drink it too?! Wow! Job well done! I have to give this a try! After all, Hannah made it look so easy! Ooh!! Here. Must\u2019ve been a fluke. There we go! NO! Third time\u2019s a charm. Seriously?! Why is this so hard for me?! Okay\u2026 Now slowly go down\u2026 Not too fast\u2026 Nope. Are these trick cups or something? All I have to do is lie down, right? I think it\u2019s working\u2026 I was so close!! I think I\u2019m getting the hang of it\u2026 I actually did it! And now for the knees. Let\u2019s tighten the core\u2026 I think my legs are too short for this. GAH! Come on, legs! We got this! I hate this challenge!!! Water? You\u2019re on your own, girl. Okay, water coming in! Julie, perhaps it\u2019s time to finally give\nup. At least she doesn\u2019t take no for an answer,\nright? Gah! It got in my mouth! I did it! Hannah! You\u2019re not gonna believe it! Huh? AHH! What\u2019s her deal? Why does my face feel like it\u2019s on fire? One more round, coming right up! All besties have a handshake, right? But this one\u2019s pretty intricate. Now spin it around! Careful! I\u2019m awful close to the pool here! I don\u2019t wanna fall in either! Buckle up, Julie! Julie\u2019s pinky strength is imperative here. Channelling\u2026finger\u2026strength\u2026 You\u2019re up next, Hannah! Round we go! Woah, this feels really unstable. I can\u2019t hold on! I\u2019m slipping! NO!!!! HANNAH!!! TELL MY MOM I LOVE HERRRRR!!!! I\u2019m going down!!! I\u2019m alive!! That was a backwards belly flop, for sure. I\u2019d better get outta here\u2026 I wonder what the next challenge will be. Are you ladies ready to break a sweat? Then grab your eggs and let\u2019s go! And one, and two, and three and four\u2026 Take a deep breath in! And let\u2019s work those triceps!! Don\u2019t forget to breathe, ladies! Put down those eggs so we can get to the real workout. Don\u2019t roll that thing over the eggs! I dunno if my core muscles can handle this! Hey, I\u2019m good at this! Wait, now what do I do? OOF! These eggs are so disgusting! You think they\u2019ll leave a stain? Cuz this outfit\u2019s definitely ruined. Look like neither of these girls won this\nchallenge. This could\u2019ve been breakfast. Why isn\u2019t water coming outta this thing? Come on! Woah!! Didn\u2019t anyone tell you never to look a hose\nin the eye? At least you know it works! Whoops! Let\u2019s keep going, people! See this T-shirt? I\u2019m gonna put it on while standing on my\nhands! With these guns, I\u2019ve got nothing to worry\nabout. First, I\u2019ve gotta get my legs up. Yikes! Careful, there. Should\u2019ve taken that down first. GAH! Why\u2019s there so much stuff in here?! Let\u2019s get all this junk outta the way. Yep, those too. Now that we\u2019ve cleared the space, I can totally do this. WOAH!! OOF! GO Julie, GO! Nope this isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m passing the baton. This can\u2019t be that hard, right? Up go the legs! And now I can slide the shirt on, one arm at a time. Don\u2019t forget the head! And it\u2019s on, people! Whew! Ta-da! Like my new hairdo? Just kidding, it\u2019s your next challenge. This is gonna be trickier than the T-shirt. You have to get it down your entire body! Did you take tips from the Hulk or something? That\u2019s some real deal strength! Don\u2019t I look pretty in this?! Ooh, I\u2019ve got one more outfit for ya. Hey, these are pretty cute! This jacket\u2019s gonna be a little tricky\u2026 But I think I can handle it, see? Ooh! I saved the best for last. Wait, it\u2019s just another cotton T-shirt? We know Hannah can do that! This thing\u2019s tight! There! What\u2019s so funny? My shirt? KEVIN?! Oh god\u2026 Buckle up for one last round! Fancy meeting you here, Hannah. Hand it over. What, my shoe? Kinda weird but okay. Here. Things are about to get interesting. For this challenge, Julie will lie on her back with her foot up, balancing the shoe on her foot. Did we mention she has to roll over? Yep, all the way around! This is where things get complicated. But Julie\u2019s clearly got this! Yep, I\u2019m pretty awesome like that. Now it\u2019s your turn. I put my foot up like this, right? OW! Let\u2019s try that again, shall we? GAH! Why can\u2019t I balance this thing? NO! Okay, Hannah, c\u2019mon, focus! Nope! GAH! OOF! My nose! Okay, steady, now\u2026 WOAH! ENOUGH! Hmph. Thank you for allowing me to fail at this. Huh? But my shoes! Bye now! Um, okay, uh\u2026 Thank you? Um\u2026 Have a nice night! Think the mall is still open? Cuz I need some new kicks, STAT.

places every single time I don't know so let's go and appear 34 more candies left there's one there let's go to this side of the graveyard like I'm kind of talking through it all because I don't know if there's like I don't know if they're in the same spot every time so there we go that's all that was in the graveyard there's one up there though how do we get that okay so we can jump up here wait no we're gonna have to figure something out oh I know fly hahaha yes perfect 31 more pieces of candy left - fine alright guys so we are flying on our shadow dragon to locate the other pieces of candy I'm just gonna go into the neighborhood like cuz I just where did they they like they're around the Adame island so I don't ghosts have taken up residence in the haunted house would you like to catch some for some free candy we're just immediately being thrown into this next event what is this you guys oh my gosh look there's tons of candy over here by the waterpark so let's go ahead and collect this there's one there one there one there one here this is not nearly as hard as the candy high-end royal high that's for sure so there's one there we have spooky apples oh my gosh they put some up here too which I just kind of think is cruel because I don't know how you would reach this without a without flying mechanism but yeah those were those were there oh I also see candy up here if you guys don't know how the way you get up here is you take this balloon this weather balloon and then you can collect some of the candy we have quite a few left and we still need to do the haunted house oh our dragon pet actually wants to do the haunted house that's so interesting okay so let's go ahead and do that grab that and grab this one how many I found 30 Katie wait how many are left though like I'm not seeing that so there's one up here as well I don't know how many are left oh and this is what you look like whenever you ride the dragon it's kind of like a fun little gliding motion nothing too wild I'm gonna go over to the campsite because I'm still looking for the other pieces of candy Oh see okay here's some so how many more do we need so there's one 15 more oh my goodness well at least they're pretty bundled up so after like we do the campsite we should at least a lay of like ten more maybe there's 11 more is there one in here do not put one in there okay good they didn't put one inside the cabin oh there's one over here I can't believe I missed that one oh there's someone at that bridge as well okay so oh my gosh you guys this is this is a lot to handle so here's one up here once again not sure how you get that like without a flying pet but then there was also some down here so I'm gonna stop this ride and we're gonna swim to go get these little pieces right here and then we should only have eight more to find which is really not that many there we go there are eight pieces of candy hidden around better start looking well I have been looking so the last eight pieces are kinda tough and the thing is is I don't know if they can be inside of buildings they're not too hard to spot whatever you do see them but I don't know if I'm even looking in the right spots like I don't want to go into the haunted house yet cuz I'm trying to do one thing at a time you know okay I'm gonna forget the candy for now that might be a separate video let's go check out this haunted house you've arrived now catch those goes for free candy there's five ghosts remaining to catch Oh what okay so this is still normal like this is still like kind of the school right so none of the ghosts are in these rooms but okay so do we come up here like I'm to school Oh one okay so candy how to start no way I'm doing this okay so four ghosts are remaining creepy oh my gosh of course our shadow dragon wants to go camping oh my gosh there's multiple ways we could go what's down there I think eventually we are gonna have to go down there I don't want to die oh no there's three more ghosts remaining there are so many different ways to go how am I not gonna get lost in here I'm just following this path all the way down and hoping it leads me to a ghost uh oh my gosh am I like in an endless loop am I lost I think I'm lost what is that no I'm not hanging out in here no no no no okay come on we gotta fight we got to figure this out shadow dragon okay so we're walking back we're gonna actually go up here and I said oh my gosh it's dark like it is so dark what is that I just I'm lost let's take one of the other paths oh my gosh there's the room with the spikes that's what was below me so I basically went the complete wrong way let's just go down this way oh my gosh shadow dragon did you just save me I got $20 what okay guys so if you try to go there you might fall okay guys I am back to where I was the beginning so that was not a fun trick didn't like that so I'm basically no Oh life hack just click exit haunted house to go back to the beginning there are 40 pieces of candy round better start looking what is it making me start over I guess that's fair but not start over on the ghost there's still only three more ghosts for me to find now I gotta be way more careful see that that's a false floor right there see right there where's my dragon honey the unicorn I'm gonna need some help with this oh heck yes okay I feel like I just cheated but it had to be done but there's also this chest here which I don't think I can open so let's just our rat let's just fly fly honey the unicorn over here cuz there's a ghost right down here as well okay so there's one more goes remaining where could they be well there's three suspicious rooms right here I'm just waiting for one of these to jump scare me well that's not gonna work maybe I stay go high up here I will I won't get scared guys I just don't want to be jump scared you know let's go in this room oh okay sorry didn't mean to interrupt oh okay let's let's check this way oh here is he

worried about that so let's turn all the way down here at the bottom so they've got some fluffy stuff spiderweb cotton candy empty six hour apples so it's supposed to look like spider webs and it's sour apple flavored so they've got some gummy body parts for two dollars they've got a lot of candy that cost more than I don't wear now so they've got this body parts monster activity kits they are cookies they've got two cookies and for three dollars 99 you build your own so it includes I'm Stine one or the Frankenstein Frankenstein my bad they've got some more of the body parts right here at our 99 and then right here they've got the sour patch swedish fish they are for $2.99 cookie mix 25 treat size bags so I'm not sure that's a good flavor or not but they're like little parrots they've got little hook so I'm not sure if that's what they look like inside or not but then they've got these turkeys dextrose schools of bone so they're like the chalky topic and yet that I say I don't like so they look like skeletons or skulls losing losing like what that doesn't sound like losing is candy artificially flavored so they are assorted Julie flavored marshmallow there's blood berry which is strawberry bruised berry which is a blueberry and then grape grape which is great right here then they've got these little nerves and they look really cute Frankenstein took a little candy box and there's mummies as one right here there's a money that's backwards they've got these peeps marshmallow monsters they look really cute they're Frankenstein as well they look really cute I like I'm whatever some peeps for Halloween before but I guess they have them now and they've got these um 22 count to find the eyeballs for a dollar that's a good price I remember those were there last year do I got them and we've got these same skull and bones candy at the chalky kind I always say I don't like they've got some $18 and worth the gummy eyeballs mini carnival pops they look really nice look up there like swirly pops like though he doesn't eat one so click this and it's a 7 of them for a dollar I think those would be good not for trick-or-treaters about for your children and they've got this mixed candy for $5 monster munch mix so there's 124 count in the bag and let's see double crisps cool it's peanut field pumpkins pumpkins double crispy monster mutt money and fudged fudge and they've got these M&Ms white pumpkin pie that sounds really good honestly I've never tried those before but this I'm good at the Dollar Tree I think it's the same it's not one actually it's the bloody bites glow-in-the-dark plastic things with using candy blood bags while I'm on flavored so they are the plastic fake teeth and then they give you the ruling candy jewelry supposed to be like a bling so there are 16 pieces it's about bracelets and rings and I think that's also a good class for those over here they've got three fully flavor bubble-gum fireballs Oh spooky I'm scary that's about 40 I think that's 40 I'm not sure if that's a 40 but I think there are 40 pieces truly sour bright bats cats and rats same thing at the Dollar Tree not the same ones and then two more of these and then bubble gum eyeball same thing they've got some more bloody bites then some more eyeballs and then they've got these same things as an onion at the Dollar Tree they're they're 13 counts tongue painting bonbon boom pops and they have bubblegum in them and they've got the Dollar Tree has like the black ones and like different kinds and then they've got these cute they're the dead like sticks candy treats what they're like sticks and then a chalky kind of candy in there as well and then up here they've got the different kinds of activity cookie kids they've got the monster the Katrina the Halloween pumpkin and I think that's it guys are all the same and those are for three dollars so no actually no that's not on every other section right let's go at that one this is they have so they've got these school candy rings doesn't so much but 3.8 ounces so I think that's quite a lot looking for a dollar is not that bad so they look like the packaging is the dated dad to skull and then they've got the Rings and then and they've got these Halloweens ago lollipop strips so there's two strips and orange in a lot and I don't know how I mean lollipops on popsicles 14 this is what they look like the actual lollipop so there's and there for a dollar they also have the Day of the Dead wrapping around them or packaging and then here they've got some small little bags of candy they've got the bats cats and rats as I showed you guys I've got sour vampire bats that sounds interesting they're sour but they don't have like ghostly gummies these I guess are supposed to look like pumpkins and ghosts they're all the horrible brand and they've got the brush I think this is called batch right batches classic candy corn that's a small bag for a dollar honestly I think you can find it for like a dollar and some sense that Walmart or somewhere else probably cheaper because they're bigger bags remember last year I got like a very big bag that was six ounces or even more than six ounces because this one is only four ounces so it's probably like three times as big as that so probably somewhere around a pound for a dollar but who knows it was this this year or so this is all of their candy that they've got so hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did please give it a thumbs up subscribe and tell me which one you're excited for or which one you want to try and I'll see you in my next video bye", "04E3o568KhM": "[Music] all right guys it's week two taste test tuesday i'm with danielle and carson today we're going to do razzles which is a candy that turns into a gum they originated in the 60s they were originally called razzleberry and are now made it's an american product they're now made by the tutsi corporation and they have a bunch of different flavors so there's the regular package in the blue it has lemon raspberry grape orange there's the tropical it's got pineapple strawberry banana etc and then there's sour version which is also lemon cherry lime orange um when i first got these in i love gum so really wanted to bring in lots of gum to the store and when i first got them in danielle was like oh 13 going on 30 and everyone and their brother were like 13 going on 30. which meant nothing to me i've seen the movie but have a horrible memory so what what is the association so the the red one which was the original flavor uh makes your tongue very red and they they check your tongue to make sure it's razzle red so if you haven't seen the movie this is uh something you'll remember next time you see it so carson have you tried razzles before i have tried them and i've also seen 13 going on 30 and yeah have you tried them before i have not okay i'm excited i've tried them before when they came in and uh i thought they were really good but we're going to try them again today and kind of give you guys an overview of what to expect in a razzle so we'll start with the regular one we'll make it kind of quick here we sanitize the table all is good so they look like sweet tarts little hard candies if you will they crunch like a sweet tart but they do turn into gum personally i find it's gonna be a really bad video because we're gonna have lots of gum personally i find the flavor's a little dull a little quick big big burst of flavor and then it becomes almost a piece of gum probably not going to last that long but we have not tried tropical yet me though so we'll try tropical um same idea a little dull but very flavorful at first i do like tropical over the regular i have tried sour and i will tell you it's good so there's some sour they all look the same the star ones get you right away much more flavorful because of the sour i do enjoy the sour what do you guys think i like the sour if you like sour things these are really good yeah i really like sour candies i think i like the sour the best not even that it's just there's more flavor but i feel like it lasts longer i've already lost the taste of the other ones um out of the tropical pack though i had the pineapple one and that was a pretty good flavor they had the kiwi lime and i didn't know what it was i had to check what the flavor was on that when it wasn't overly identifiable um yeah i'm with the sour the sour is still going still quite tart flavorful these are a fun a fun candy for sure not the kind of gum you'd want to chew to freshen your breath per se but definitely if you like hard sugary candies and gum it's incredible out of 10 carson what would you give it um for a whole i would give them probably an eight but just the sours alone i'd give a 10. um as a whole i'd probably give it a six the sours i would give a s eight um as a whole yeah i think i'm going to agree with carson about an eight but the sour ones definitely are ten i would that's the one i would buy if i had a choice that's a big hop from last week's five which i much prefer this all right so we're gonna let uh our videographer do the averages and pop them up on the screen because i just don't know what that equals we were kind of all over i think we probably gave it a pretty high score actually which surprises me compared to chocolate um so anyway razzles i think we've decided on our great kind of candy slash quick little gum chew because i'm already done with this i'm ready to move on but they do come with probably 20 in a pack 25 something like that so you could probably eat a whole pack in one go if you're anything like me you know spit it out take another piece spit it out take another piece sounds really bad anyway check us out online uh bubbles toy and gift.ca we are downtown galt we have a full selection of candies easter gifts lots of toys for the kids and a ton of chocolate and fun stuff to eat thanks a lot guys see ya", "3MQmN6nJqDM":

okay see you later [Music]", "EpPi2baJnyA": "we're live sorry about that that was a rough start but we are live and this video is trying sour candies or not sour candy sorry trying weird candies live so as you can see behind us we got a whole bunch of really weird candy some of them are more well-known than others but yeah right now into the shop sorry i was just doing the technical stuff for a second but yeah what we're going to be doing is we have all these weird candies behind us behind us we have all these weird candies and we're going to be trying them and seeing what they taste like so yeah i've only tried a few of these before but most of these are ones that we've never tried or heard of before so this should be really fun all right so we've got two people already watching three people hey guys what's up hey riker's watching hi riker all right i like her which one should we do colton [Music] um wait the middle first round let's see okay so uh you guys comment what candies you think we should try first i think that we should start with these snow cups or snow caps what do you guys think let's just start with snowflakes no that's okay i don't know [Applause] hello sir what did you get you got the piano bench yes these are small i didn't just break these i don't think these are going to be small i thought they were going to be like goodly sized why is it so there we go there we go all right so don't eat it yet i'm just going to do these should i eat that okay we're having some trouble sorry about this guys we're figuring this out come on there we go finally got it okay so everyone watching everyone like this stream let's try and get to five lives so oh these are tiny i know they just taste like chocolate chips with these little balls on them don't they oh that's literally what they are not very good chocolate chips so kind of gross yeah okay um so what do you rank it like one to ten what do you guys drink it one to ten um out of a ten i'll give it a two well well actually i'd give it an edible it's not bad but it's not good so i'll give you i'll give it a four no i didn't throw up on it five i'll give it a five do it i'm gonna give it a seven i'm gonna give it it's just a chocolate chip and i'm gonna do five as neutral if it's below five it was gross if it's above five it was better but this time i'm giving you that neutral what do you mean you keep on eating a ton of them you love them i think usually like a 10 out of 10. no i think i honestly think that you could probably just buy like a bag of chocolate chips and get more for less yeah you know and because those things don't add any flavor to them at all yeah and all right next what do you guys want to try okay wait carolyn can you sit down here for one second let them see what about the okay guys so this is our mountain of candy you can come over by me everyone comment what candies out of these you want us to try we got all these and some of them are very weird we got brunch right here we got what are these juicy fruits yeah we've got count we're saving these three for the very end because they're the weirdest we got cow tails do the one in the middle first the brown one how about the caramel things the caramel thing oh the that one i know if you sing wait which way which one was the brown one i think it was this one yeah the snow caps we just did the snow caps and then do you mean how about the caramel things and then colton says fruity pebbles okay so we'll we'll do the caramel ones in a second what we're gonna do okay so we're gonna try this is a fruity pebbles candy bar honestly [Music] they look like the white chocolate hershey's candy bars what's like okay here we go three two one i can't eat it i have bands in they actually don't taste that bad it actually tastes pretty good i actually have fruity pebbles for breakfast today he did i'm a witness of that it seems like pretty comfortable yeah it just tastes like fruity pebbles no chocolate i think yeah honestly 10 out of 10. for me i give about seven i don't think i can actually probably get eight point five they have the exact taste of fruity pebbles but the texture of a

people that i could drink a couple of cinnamon oil and so i like went around and i don't know it's like five bucks from every person and anyway people are saying that shouldn't do it but and then i wouldn't do it but you did it i did it was the wrong person to give that to them because of course you can handle it oh i made a hundred bucks man what yeah why would you drink cinnamon oil well because i wanted money and yes it was it was hot but it wasn't any hotter than having just the cinnamon stick because you know once your mouth is on fire it's on fire what difference does it make yeah and so but i could not taste anything for three days oh wow i totally wiped out my taste buds i wonder if that's what it's going to do to me with that i don't think so that was not that bad was it bad so far nothing nothing to me wow and i actually have some oil that i you know on my tongue every once in a while why because it kills coronavirus basically new live message tetris theme place but

doing we can do runs raisinets pixie stix um these you can do and then you've been going for an hour and 15 minutes all right guys we just got four more things if we can get how about if we can get to

at that two days and 47 minutes wow i wonder how much you bribed that person for for real or he just accidentally turns me back okay guys it's going way quicker than the other one did yeah 70 hours versus like three days versus two days in an hour so far i think it's because the most people that are on it the less of a chance that they rack up in their head that they're gonna actually win yeah probably okay guys come on we can do this let's get to 35 likes and we'll try one of the weird candies behind us that jayden hi jayden what's up dude okay so in this video we have a whole bunch of

me out the main parts are the stand the swing arm and the fulcrum the swing arm pivots on now the swing arm has a weight at one end and a sling at the other and here are some important relationships there's a relationship between the long part of the swing arm and the short part that's 3.75 to 1 and the sling wants to be exactly the length of the long part of the swing arm if you get all that right apparently this thing throws farther than just about any other medieval weapon of war the real lawn shot will be getting a full sized trebuchet to work with only duct tape to hold it together so

you may hear secret locations and say ah I know all of them well I have to tell you guys that's probably not true there are probably secret locations out there that you don't know about in this game if you're someone like me you're the type of person that whenever a new video game comes out you like to explore the map try to go to the outer reaches try to find things that almost break the game or at least find places that no one else has ever been to pub G Mobile is the same way and there are secret locations in this game today I finally had the time to make a very special video I've had on my list for months now I have compiled five of the best secret locations that exist in the pub G maps and I wanted to present them to you all in this video just as a little side note there might be a bonus one at the end so don't click away and make sure to stay until the ends with pub G mobile being a year and a half old now there are a lot less secret locations in this game and the developers are very active they are continually patching locations each and every day they also ban people for using glitches in this game so the five technically six secret locations I'm going to show to you all in this video are not glitches but rather just secret locations that you won't have to worry about getting banned from wind trying outs that's the nicest thing about this video you can try these out to your own leisure because they will never get patched because they never need to so yes my friends I'm very excited to be making this video today super happy and it's been on my list as I said for months now so today is finally the day that I can show you guys these very special secret locations make sure to leave a like if you like secrets in pub G mobile and if we get enough supports I can do another video like this in maybe a couple months from now and subscribe to my channel for more pub G mobile contents I have like 4050 videos on this game tons of different tips and tricks tons different glitches gameplays funny moments and more you're gonna like the content that I post on my channel so I guess with that being said without further ado we can jump right into secret location number one alright guys so for secret location number one we find ourselves in arendelle the original map in military base if we scroll all the way down to the southern island you are going to land at these clusters of buildings rights here and this will be the most well known secret location of this video there are quite a few people that probably have heard of this but here's the thing it's probably better to start off with the easier ones than the best ones we're saving those for the ends you're gonna drive over to those clusters of buildings get as close as you can doesn't really matter where you drive your car and here's the thing you really want to do this secret location when it's of most value to you in a circle like I have right here where I have 89 people alive 88 people alive and there's a dotted line already on the mini-map directing me away from the place that I'm at it's not going to be of much value to me if you can manage to find one of the final circles at this spot right here then you can actually come into this room go to those clusters of computers or this cluster of computers right here simply climb on top of them and then climb up on this ledge that I bet many of you didn't even know was there then you can either Crouch or you can go prone if I can manage to do that and you can hide in this spots and no one will know that you're there again as I said it's fantastic for people who actually have this spot in a final circle because otherwise in a circle like I have here I'm going to have to immediately leave after I do this but the only people that are gonna find you are gonna be the bots that are literally programmed to find you so it's a fantastic secret location next up for secret location number two we find ourselves in Miramar now Miramar has some pretty cool spots about the map and one of them are these unmarked mines that you can see in the map right there I have marked the best location to go into one of these mines and as you can see it's not that well mark on the map even when you actually start to fly over it it just looks like it's a little Canyon nothing much I'm actually going to do a little speed run showing you everything that I got from this little loot pile because it's actually a fantastic place to Lutz in this game you're very rarely going to find other people and you can find some high-powered scopes six times eight times you can always find some sort of sniper like an SKS SLR stuff like that maybe even an m24 if you're lucky and then you're always going to have many different types of smg's rifles and all the ammo you could possibly imagine it's a very nice place to Lutz where the only people you're going to find are going to be bots and you're not going to have to have tons of other players sitting there killing you the second you lands in this map so again if you are to run towards this area it looks like this on the entrance not that well noticeable it just looks like it's a canyon and this is all the stuff that I gots pretty decent amount of stuff for about a minute of looting and I highly recommend checking this place out every once in a while for secret location number three we again find ourselves in Aran goal and we're going to travel all the way down to that southern island to this hill right here if you are someone who's landed at military base before maybe you've seen this big tower and you've tried to land on top of it now if I were to do that myself as you can see I can't my character is just going to sit there because for whatever reason you can't actually remove the parachutes whenever you land on something like that so this is what you're going to do you're gonna find one of those supporting beams and slowly get your way all the way up to this spot right here you're going to jump and climb up here and this is a way to basically get up as high as you normally can get on this antenna you can actually get on top of this little circular I don't know what you can call that part of the antenna but there may be ways to get higher I'm not going to say that's completely out of the question I would just recommend going there maybe lying prone and then you actually have a very good overlook over the entire city of Nauvoo all of those crates where all those other players land ends it's a pretty decent spot that a lot of people wouldn't originally expect you to so if you're looking for a nice place to just snipe and camp out at this would probably be the place to go to for secret location number four we come all the way over to school to these apartments right to the rights of its of course in the map Aaron go you're going to land at this apartment right here and you're going to be focusing on the tree that's right next to this actual building it's best of course when you actually have weapons maybe a sniper rifle maybe some sort of rifle so you wouldn't want to do this right at the very beginning unless you're really focusing on hiding was that an enemy right there I swear I saw an enemy just flying over huh okay I guess nuts here's the thing if you're a lower level and you try to do this and a bot the bots gonna be the only one that's automatically going to see me but simply climb up there jump there and you can actually get onto that tree be very careful you do not want to move at this point in time because the second you move your character you're going to fall off the tree and take some damage but hey if one of the final circles is here and you just want a place to hide and see if enemies can't spot you no one's gonna expect you to be in the tree you're like the monkey of pubsey mobile you're in a really cool spot and it's fun every once in a while now for our last secret location this is a very special one that still many people don't know about there may be some people that have watched some older videos on YouTube but this is the most ultimate secret location of this video it's going to give you by far the best loot and within 30 seconds of jumping out of the plane you can already have military-grade lutes the best weapons possible and you'll be set for the whole rest of the game so I'm proud to present to you all the most secret location in pub G Mobile my friends I'm proud to tell you that this next secret location is probably one of the coolest secret caves just north of povo Stowe in V candy a lot of people have heard about this in recent times but a lot of people haven't yet I don't actually know if the snowmobile works for this I guess we're gonna test it out it's actually a hidden secret location a in secret cave that you wouldn't normally be able to get to unless you actually interacted with it by breaking down a barricade that's blocking it as you can see right here there's a road that just kind of goes into nothing and if I were to try to punch this rock obviously I'm not going to be coming inside so I can take my snowmobile my u-az any other vehicle that I would like to and as long as I get enough speed I can drive towards that rock that's blocking the entrance and break right through is that not the coolest thing ever talk about that for being an interactive experience in pubsey mobile so at this point in time dude you can start looting up this area it is a very very good looting spot Envy candy and I would go as far to say that it is the best looting area Envy candy and when you actually come inside the main area as you can see well you have airdrops galore look at this this is like eye candy for anyone that plays pub G mobile and I mean you know you could get two m24s because why not go absolutely excessive with some of the stuff you can get in this game so I'm gonna actually do a little speed run here you can see all of the stuff that I can manage to get in a very short period of time of looting this area now as more and more people have heard of this place here you're going to have to expect that more and more people are going to land here because look at this there are actual air drops in this cave you don't actually need to wait for the plane to fly over the map because you're gonna have stuff right there and it's that simple to get things like the Aug like any other weapon that you would normally get from an airdrop in pub G so this is what it looks like the secret cave inva candy probably one of the coolest spots I've ever seen in pubs eMobile with a super high ceiling and it's a fantastic place the best place for lutes in this game but wait here we are I want to show you guys the two bonus secret locations of this video before you click away this first secret location I just want to say good luck trying to find it because I did this once a couple of days ago and I've never managed to find it since I was basically exploring the cliff area right on the boundary of Miramar because I realized that these cliffs are gonna be pretty glitchy at times and coming down to this spot right here wherever this is on the actual cliffs I stumbled across a secret cave a much smaller secret locate nonetheless one that would have actually allowed us to go inside if it wasn't on the boundary of the map I'm so disappointed because I'm literally only blocked by that invisible wall and it looks like it keeps going down further now I don't know if it only goes down a couple of feet but this is really freaking cool to find a secret location like this and I'm pretty sure no one else has ever seen this before so this is a secret location that I can confidently say no one else has seen before but for a secret location that you actually can get to pretty easily we're going to climb up to these selections of rocks which is right next to El Pozo on the map it's a little difficult to climb up here and it's a lot easier if you were to just land by actually jumping out the plane near this area but if you come over to this spot that's right around right here it's again another secret cave right here to the south of El Pozo on the map you can actually find this location first off probably by just taking a plane but look you can shoot people like this right and then before they actually spot you up on the rocks climb inside this cave and what are they gonna do in order to get you they have to literally climb all the way up to the spot where you are and by that point well you can take them outs get a lot of cool kills in this really cool secret location so with that being said that's it for today's video those were the five secret locations plus the one bonus secret location that I had to share for you all in today's video this is a very special video and a video I have wanted to do for months now and I really hope you all did enjoy it the main points of today's video was for you guys to learn something new so if I successfully did that then I know this video was a success if you did enjoy this video I would greatly appreciate it if you left a like rating down below if we get enough support this video as I said in the beginning I can do another video just like this in just a couple months from now as more secret locations are found in this game subscribe to my channel for more of the best pub G mobile contents on YouTube and with that being said that's it thank you all for watching guys again try these out at your leisure they're not going to be patched so you can try these out whenever you want they're awesome thank you for watching and I'll see you all later", "uRqU7yuXnGk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "woOFaDnZtJI": "I am NOT a licensed or certified electrician nor do I play day one so in this video I will remove the top plug and then I will shorten the set of lights now the reason why you may want to do this is because I'm working right now working on a crack project where I want to insert all these lights into a small object and the hole is only big enough for these lights to go through it's not big enough for this entire top plug and this is now the materials we'll need in this project your Christmas slides handy wire cutters and some electrical tape so the first step is to unplug your Christmas lights all right so now we're going to start our project I am going to take my wire cutters here and cut off the top plug here so you just want to remove the top plug this is simple way of doing it and we'll see what we have here and there we go all right we're back so this that was part one was removing the top plug now part two I'm going to show you how to shorten these Christmas lights now the first thing I want you to notice about these Christmas lights is I don't think the manufacturer intended for us to shorten them to begin with first step is that I am going to unplug these Christmas lights alright what you'll notice about these Christmas lights wall specifically the top Christmas light which is different from all the other Christmas lights it's that it's got two wires going in one wire coming out and then there is another wire that runs the entire length of the Christmas lights so these so you want to keep these separate to start unraveling this specific wire from all the other wires until you get it down to the Christmas light that you're going to shorten it to all right so let's do that right now so I'm going to take off one two three four five Christmas lights alright and then I'm going to essentially keep the top Christmas light and then make it my new top Christmas light just to it just to keep the tube the two wires over here to the one wire alright so we've got our single wire that we are going to clip right now and then cover up with a bit of electrical tape I'm going to use two pieces of electrical tape to keep this well covered we'll notice that there are two wires going into the top bulb and for all the other bulbs is one wire going in one wire coming out so what we will do is we need to and then there's one wire that also runs the length all right so we've already clipped off the one wire that runs the length and does not connect to the top of the Christmas lights so now we are going to do the one that connects from wire from Christmas light to Christmas light so I want to make my top Christmas like my new shorter top Christmas lights one two three four five and I want to start right here all right so now I'm going to clip this wire here this one I know this one goes from light to light so I'm going to look for another the other wire that goes from light to light and cut it right here okay and now I'm going to splice these two wires together and I'm going to tape them up with electrical tape now I have unraveled the second wire that goes into our top plug and I will clip that wire and then reconnect it to our top plug now I will splice the wires and join them together and I'll put some electrical tape so now the top plug is still the top plug and our light set is just a little bit shorter yeah and let's plug this in see how it works there we go so now this is our new shortened light set without the top plug thank you very much for watching", "pt0KBU2deKI": "[Music] okay", "fa3PR_ryhJ8": "welcome back to my channel before we get started who's gonna chain meditations give me a huge thumbs up today a mob daddy daddy dad hey guys Oh daddy daddy dad today is pretty crazy serious video guys what's happening a game master has been hacker 18 us guys hacker

Powerade (\u25cd\u2022\u0305 v\u2022\u0305\u25cd) I will have the blue rope jelly first I'm into this these days Small candies are tightly stuck on it You need to be careful when you eat it because the candies might drop Inside has a chewy red jelly At first, it tastes sour but then you can feel the sweetness as well Especially I like the sound of the candies crunchily breaking \u2605 I recommend to people who like sweet&sour taste Earth gummy Squishy squishy~ Inside is full of sweet blueberry syrup I sprinkled a blue sugar that I made on its outside so it has a good texture when you chew \u03a3(\uff9f\u0434\uff9f;) OMG \u0f3c;\u00b4\u0f0e\u0eb6 \u06dd\u0f0e\u0eb6`\u0f3d My mouth and hands all turned into blue!! Please understand...T.T Blue geode crystal Crunchy texture I had put blue syrup inside to make it moist Outside is coated with chocolates so I get a good feeling of taste whenever I chew it If it's too hard, inside of your mouth can hurt when you chew, so I tried to make its texture to be a soft-crunchy texture I could've had this more often if it took not long to make (\u2741\u1d17\u0348\u02ec\u1d17\u0348)\u25de I like sweet foods a lot If you want any other color, please tell me Hongsi~ I will try making it (^\u03b5^)\u266a Jello cup Feeling so squishy Blue lemonade taste It's solid but not hard and it's an elastic texture (*\uff9f\u2207\uff9f*) I really like this distinctive jello texture Sparkling Powerade Cheers~ OMG! So cool that I actually drank in that hehe (\u0e51\u02c3\u0335\u1d17\u02c2\u0335)\u0648 The cup will be going straight into my mouth \u203b Be careful when you eat jello just in case I usually shove big bite into my mouth and I chew for a long time hehe \u2665\u2665My favorite Peeps marshmallow\u2665\u2665 I'm sorry for them separating apart... Goodbye talk Mmm~ This is it! I eat marshmallows only from Peeps these days It's sad to just finish off here I get the feeling of air going out from the marshmallow every time I chew Really fluffy So delicious Eyeball gummy Looks like a fisheye It feels like jelly+marshmallow It's sweet because it has jam inside Shark gummy I bought it because of its unique look It's a hard type gummy It doesn't stick on your teeth but you need to chew long With courage, this time~ The texture of chewing on both sides of mouth is great! Next time I will use my hands hehe Eventually, the candies dropped Aquamarine Sapphire geode crystal Because the color is pretty, the taste feels sweeter I matched the syrup color to feel like an ocean Crunchy crunchy \u266a (///\u2207///) It's an unusual texture so it feels fresher Careful careful (\u0c20 \u0325\u0306\u2006\u0c20) The outside of the jello is really slippery haha I would never normally use this cup but, eating like this is unique and fun I should've had the sugar to be dried more after I colored it I will eat with a stick to prevent my hand from going blue Dice gum Cowardly throwing in case it will fly away (^\u25bd^;) There's something inside A yellow bead? It's a lemon taste It's crunchy at first, then it turns into a gum when you keep on chewing I made a balloon with gum and it turned into blue... I will blow it next time hehe I will finish off with a rope jelly I wish here in Korea they sell more variety of colors of this product It will be prettier with a variety of colors Too bad T.T I washed my hands with soap and the colors disappeared on the next day~ Dropped candies~ I'm so happy to eat a dessert of my favorite color (\uff61\uff1e0\uff1c\uff61) See you next time again with
