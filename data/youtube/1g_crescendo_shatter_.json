{"Q-TODquI1B0": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis strain review so today we are going to be reviewing crescendo by colorado grow company now if crescendo is new to you like it is to me let's go ahead and talk about this straight so this is a sativa dominant hybrid strain this is 70 sativa 30 indica there's a cross between three powerhouses chemdog i-95 and mandarin cookie so i am expecting this to be sweet piney diesely it should have a little bit of everything um so before we get into it i'm gonna go ahead bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we're gonna go ahead and take a look at it together okay so what do you guys think of this crescendo by colorado grow company i am honestly i thought it looked really good but i want to go ahead pop this jar open mandarin cookies is coming out so loud in this straight and i'm a little stuffed up today but i will tell you this smells like cookies with a little bit of citrus there underneath all of that there's definitely something from the gassy and piney side but mostly the cookies is what you guys are gonna smell when you pop these jars open and wowie wowie wow this stuff i just got a new flashlight here you guys and i kind of wanted to compare it to my old one as well which is running a little low on batteries i like the white light on my old old light a little bit more so honestly i'm gonna probably continue to use this light um oh my god this stuff is so crystally it's so white the hairs are in such great proportions like this is just great looking bud in general i mean here's the nug you guys that i'm sitting and looking at right now i only got a gram of this stuff unfortunately great bud uh structure of this let me get the hell out of the way of the camera here and see if the camera might want to focus on it maybe it does maybe it doesn't but wow i'll tell you i mean it's just beautiful looking stuff i'm not sure that this could have been done any any better um wow and the smell is there like this is not one of these strains where i'm like oh my god there's a major lack of terps there's a major lack of terps not this strain you guys this stuff the terps are kicking just and again i only have a gram and i wanted to go ahead and today because i only have this gram left i figured i would actually just grind this up uh this nug up in real time for you guys so there was you know the rest of the butt i had one other small little bud that i put in here so these are the nugs that i'm going to be grinding up today um to puff on and honestly i am guessing so here's the deal too this stuff is really dense like oh my god and i just touch it to my fingers and it's stuck to my fingers that's a good sign when butt is sticking to your fingers and the resin is so fat on it those trichomes are so fat that it's sticking to your fingers like you know the blood is going to be potent this stuff is testing out at 23.1 percent thc you guys of course it's going to be potent wow this smells awesome honestly i'm not going to lie it's like cookies but and which is funny because i'm not a huge fan of the cookies so let's just see you guys there was the let's do another one of these inspector ganja is my boy who likes to see that test see how that buds just sticking to my finger like that after i ground it up he does that when he rolls his js and i love that like the stickiness test see if it passes the stickiness test um but i'll tell you so what i was gonna say was i'm not the biggest fan of cookies okay so this is a full bowl right there i got that thing filled up now like the cookie strains just typically don't do it for me like the cookie fam sherbs and you know cookies in general is just not one of my favorite strains in particular but this mandarin cookies and mixed with the i-95 and chem dog i'm not familiar with i-95 but chem dog i'm very familiar with like this stuff here's the dog you guys here is the nug just sticking to my finger right there let's just see let's see what kind of hang time this thing gets look at this the bud is still hanging on my finger you guys i don't know how long it's gonna hang there for it seems like it's there i mean my fingers are sticking together that is good bud and it's not super dry either that's the other thing i wanted to mention to you guys is this this bud is like perfectly fresh um i would say it's perfectly cured it might not be as fresh as you might be used to like the fresh chest but boy is it fresh um and well cured so god i am so excited to try this crescendo especially after grinding some of this stuff up and getting that smell um so today i'm going to be enjoying this crescendo out of my arizer extreme q desktop vape i've got this bad boy set to 375. i know it says 377 there but i'm going to go ahead let this come to temperature and then i'm going to go ahead and let me grab my scientific inhalations piece and then we are going to get this party started okay so i apologize about that normally i have the piece ready to go right here but apparently i was so excited about the crescendo i didn't put it next to me today so i'm gonna go ahead take my whip plug that into the bowl end of the screen uh excuse me the end with the screen on it into the bowl i should say uh the other male and that's going into the scientific inhalations triple filter bubbler i've got the second chamber with some brand new distilled water the third chamber with my organic cotton filter and the first chamber i've left empty that actually sits in the down stem there and holds carbon prevents ash from getting in the water but you guys know we're vaping and there's no ash dirty enough mucking up my water so if you guys are ready to puff down let's go ahead and burn some of this crescendo and see what it's all about wow that was oh my god like a sugar cookie or something like i taste the cookies i taste the sweet not really much of that citrus um it was a very subtle rip there wasn't a whole lot of vapor as you guys just saw so the flavors just started to develop let me go ahead and dive in for the second one and see how this flavor develops oh my god okay so i'm still blowing on hook or vapor i should say that about 80 of the way through i felt it coming in my dome like you guys can see i got a big smile on my face my mouth is covered with a nice sweet cookie flavor it's just like it's not overwhelming or overpowering um i'm trying to find some of those citrus notes a little bit here but they're very subdued like very very like the citrus only consists of a tiny little part of this i do taste some of that pineness but again kind of a small portion of this the star of the show is that cookie sweet flavor um i can't wait to finish puffing out this bowl and see what uh kind of effects full effects i get out of this stuff so while i am doing that i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of a 25 times macro lens to get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this crescendo so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the crescendo by colorado grow company and wow this stuff looks just awesome it has that light lime green on the base dark green kind of covering it you guys see like it's it's literally like a 50 50 blend of that light green with the dark green it's mostly on the leaves you guys can see them up towards the top kind of that evergreen or dark green color and it is riddled with these beautiful orange hairs now they're not super super bright but they are just like what i would think is the quintessential color of orange and boy oh boy is this stuff frosty i mean perfect proportions of crystals to the hairs in my opinion they trimmed this butt great those leaves trimmed right up to the butt overall this is just great looking stuff oh my god you guys wow wow that's all i can say out of this vape i tried some of this while i was out in durango uh colorado and i'll tell you doing this actual full review oh my god it's an old other ball game like out of the vape out of my setup in my pieces not with the packs my portable piece i'm used to using like honestly i'm blown away with this strain like this was not what i was expecting like it this is so far in from left field like i i'm not joking you guys i am just getting ready to rave about this crescendo and somebody hit me up like oh i thought it would be better i thought you'd like it more whatever you know oh yeah like dude i'm taking some of my words back like i thought this was good no no no no this crescendo by colorado grow company is great like this weed is [ __ ] great you guys it's got it all like it has it all and i am so caught off guard by this like i may make the trip back up there just to go pick up scoop more of this like that's how good this ganja is oh my god i didn't mean i only got a gram what a freaking nerd nudnik i am oh so i just want to get into it because there's so much i want to talk about it was like this [ __ ] caught me so off guard like in the flavor it changed it was like oh my god oh my god okay so let's go ahead and i just want to get right into it here so because i'm really excited you guys i'm very very excited here here is the deal okay i rate all these strains on a scale from zero to ten zero being the worst ten being the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency it's that simple i'll assign up to 2.5 points each in each of these respective categories and then i'll tally up the total at the end and give you guys my final rating and rundown on what i think of these strains um overall as a whole so i want to start by talking about talking about the look bag appeal or jar appeal of this stuff so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen for you guys one more time and then we'll go ahead and get into my final rating on this stuff okay so you have seen it multiple times i have talked about it i i wish i had a bigger nug um i wish i had gotten more i apologize about that um you know i wanted to try a sample i wasn't sure what the quality was going to be like i couldn't look at any of these buds prior to buying them either you guys so that's something that you should know but i mean what i see here is just picture freaking perfect huge trichomes nice tight bud structure very dense buds i mean it's packed very nice these orange hairs are beautiful to the naked eye they are just freaking gorgeous there are some thin ones there are some thicker ones but they're all there and i mean the trichome coverage is great and you know it's going to be a 2.5 out of 3.5 for the look now you guys see the size of the nub in there a tiny little popcorn nug right it wasn't a popcorn nug when it started but this jar reeks of cookies there's some sweetness uh citrusy sweetness below deep below that and even farther below there's some like cushiness now uh like the pine flavor okay kind of gassy so the smell is so complex and intricate and there's so much going on there below just the cookies that it combines to create this like it's a musical performance you guys it's like we've got the cookies over here and we've got the you know i'm like the string section and the brass and boom you know that's how i think of music like a symphony and this is a song it's beautiful honestly it's going to be a 2.5 out of 2.5 when you have terps this loud a tiny little nug we can't get that doesn't happen here in arizona if i have a tiny little nug in a jar like that it's rarely gonna stink up uh you know a full full jar uh it's just that's just this is the brakes i'm sorry you guys this is the this is the situation as i'm smelling some of this i'm getting even more versed you know it's like damn all right this is what loud terps are like like i i forget because you know i remember what they what they were like when weed in my opinion was back in its heyday which is like you know early 2000s and stuff was out of control quality wise and terps were like never an issue the terms were always loud the terps the terps were an issue because they were too loud and you had to quadruple bag stuff because the smell stunk so bad that was the problem back then you know so now it's rarely an issue but honestly the smell is going to be a 2.5 out of 2.5 it was perfect so complex now the taste let's get to the taste i was like oh it's two it's just that cookies taste it's that cookies taste nice sweet subtle cookies yeah it was to start and then the citrus came in and i'm getting notes of citrus for a little bit with that cookie flavor and then even farther down the bowl it was a gassy cush piney i'm like oh my god it had it all i was coughing real deep real hard it hit me fast like i had the fast come on i'm like oh my god this is what like a good strong sativa is supposed to be like this is happy joyful uplifting i'm like a lot of just optimism and uh my body is definitely still a little bit chilled out not as chilled out as it's going to be with other indicas and other strains but definitely chilled out a bit and i mean god this is like your daily driver for somebody who's like got work to do and you've got to focus or you've got stuff to do i mean listen i'm ready to kind of go work out right now i i would personally i'd want to like go use this go kayak and go hiking go run get creative make some music you know whatever uh longboard what you know whatever it is that you do for fun uh that's active you know that's what you should do go take your dogs out for a walk you know the taste went from a two minute review went up to a 2.0 it was so complex just like the smell it was literally exactly what i was smelling happening in the flavor and the flavors were changing just like perfectly in sync when i wanted them to change the flavor held throughout the entire bowl it was smooth as it gets and deep deep cough now potency here's the deal this stuff came on like a freight train even after the second rep you guys see i have my eyes are cached but like my eyes are still very like you know i feel like i'm like kind of buzzing um wow it's not just good it's great this stuff is a perfect 10 i can't believe it i think we've only had three perfect tens this crescendo at 23.1 so that's the deal you guys oh we talked about all these percentages and [ __ ] if you're getting true bud that tests out at over 21 22 that [ __ ] should be smacking you it should be the problem is you're not getting bud that's 21 and 22 and the testing is just is [ __ ] or if the other thing too is the cat uh cannabinoids might be hitting you differently but like if you're getting true buds that are over 20 it should be hitting you every time i'm just convinced that these tests are freaking bunk and you know you see these strains oh you know 26 27 35 42 i saw the other day you know and i did hear that stuff was absolutely insane but that's the deal is if it's over 20 should be smacking this is a perfect 10. pick up this crescendo by colorado grow company if you are in durango colorado i don't know if they have other locations i'm going to certainly look into it but i will tell you what this stuff is awesome wicked great job colorado grow company perfect 10 is so amazing and other people who want to learn how to grow the perfect 10 find out where this you know crescendo how they did it what was what was their method what did they do you know what were the nutrients what was the lighting schedule what was how long did they let the plants go for whatever all of that stuff but you know i'll tell you this is how it's done you guys 70 indica 30 sativa if you're looking something for something with cookie flavor little citrus that packs an atlanta a little bit of piney and kush flavor to it there and that packs a gas to you know uh something that packs a punch this is it for sure scoop up some of the crescendo by colorado grove company but do you guys think this review is fair if you guys have tried this crescendo by colorado groco let me know in the comments below and then let me know if there's something you guys want to see me review as well but until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon peace", "6BIlfkf2464": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis drain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing crescendo by local joint now crescendo is no stranger to me i have tried this strain before from colorado growco and oh my god it knocked me off my seat but if this is a new strain for you let's go ahead and talk about it this strain is a sativa dominant hybrid strain that is about a 70 sativa to a 30 indica that is a cross between chem dog i-95 and mandarin cookies it was bred by ethos genetics and look at the size of that bud i can't wait to get into this so before i do let me bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we are gonna go ahead and take a look at it together okay so what do you think of this bud let me know in the comments below i will tell you that my first experience with crescendo as i was just saying earlier was out of control it was a strain that literally came from left field and was truthfully i'm just gonna be honest with you guys i know that that strain review so today i'm filming this just so you guys know i'm filming this on january 1st 2021 this stuff was harvested on 11 5 so we're about you know six seven weeks away from harvest so it's starting to get a little on the um you know overly cured side but honestly anywhere between that one to two month period should really be perfect but what i was gonna say was when i tried this crescendo or originally tried crescendo from colorado grove company when i was out in colorado visiting there a couple months back it just really knocked my socks off that review um is dropping or has dropped on the 2nd of february i'm gonna probably have to have this review drop after that one so you guys get a true feel for the crescendo prior to this one um and try and do it you know subsequently um or subsequently rather i don't even know am i making up words [ __ ] put it down if i am um but anyways here is the deal this is a strain i'm excited about and i i'm literally like i'm i'm starting this year off with this particular strain because it was one of my absolute favorites that i had in 2020 so let's get the top off this jar i'm gonna get my flashlight and stuff ready here and smell this okay so i'm gonna i'm not gonna lie the flavors are a little bit subdued and not a little bit subdued like terpenes are really lacking in this um what i am getting though is i'm getting some sweet and creamy and a tiny bit gassy flavor in there and let me look at this bud oh my god that light lime green color with these bright orange hairs a couple dark orange leaves this stuff so it's funny because this nug of the batch is a little bit on the larfey side underneath when you're looking at it it looks a little bit leafy that's not really due to anything they did wrong with the cultivating it might just be a little bit of a leafier bud the other ones weren't quite as leafy as this but i gotta be honest even this bud is covered in trichomes on the inside and the outside yeah again a little bit larfier than i would typically like but that's not the nug that i came for today i came for this nug that won't even come out of the jar it is so freaking big how often let me ask you this you guys how often are you buying nugs in eighth jars that fill up the entire jar and that look like that because this to me this bud looks unbelievable that light lime green covered in trichomes um you know dark green leaves some purple leaves that are interwoven throughout there the bright orange hairs i mean it it's literally just picturesque looking bud um so frosty it's just it's literally it's it's unbelievable how beautiful this nug looks it's just such a shame that the terpenes are lacking in this jar but i before i got started with my review today and opened this jar i went ahead and threw this jar on the penny pinterest test to see if there are three and a half grams in this jar like it's printed on the package here so let's go ahead get to the penny pictures test now and see if we can catch local joint pedi pinching okay so the time has come for the penny pinchers test let's see if this crescendo by the local joint weighs three and a half grams like it's printed on the jar you guys see we're still sealed up here so let's go ahead and get our scale turned on i'm going to go ahead and put a dollar bill on the scale to make sure that this is weighing one gram that we're all calibrated any discrepancy will be accounted for okay perfect so we have a .02 gram discrepancy which means whatever i put on the scale today is going to be 0.02 grams heavier than it's actually showing on the scale so let's go ahead we've got our measuring cup put on there i am going to tear that out so that's not affecting the weight let's open this jar and dump the contents inside and see if we are at three and a half grams this big nug doesn't even want to come out it is literally so big you guys it barely fits in the jar there it comes oh my god 3.66 grams let's just say you know what let's say 3.65 grams that's what it seems to have settled that so 3.65 grams for this crescendo by the local joint way to go passing the penny pinchers you guys okay so that is how it's done three point six five grams in this jar that is so awesome and to be honest it's like i just love getting jars that are heavy because rather than like some of these companies like growth sciences gives you 3.7 grams in their jar globe cannabis gives you four grams in their jar and like they printed on the label and on the package we're giving you you know this much extra which is great it's very appreciated but when they just say that they're giving you 3.5 and they actually have you know an extra 0.15 in there it almost feels better to me than like knowing i'm just getting a little bit extra it's very weird i don't know what the mentality is behind that but like local joint big ups on weighing these sacks heavy and it's like it doesn't take away from my allotment that's another thing i don't like about the four gram eighths and the three and a half point seven gram eights it [ __ ] up my allotment so like if i buy four gross science eights it's 14.8 grams which actually [ __ ] up my allotment because when i go like i need that extra like point eight so that i can get like another eighth or another gram or whatever and that's one thing it's like it [ __ ] up the allotment even in their smalls bags that give you 15 grams and i love the extra ganja for sure but it kind of [ __ ] up the allotment in my opinion but regardless i'm really excited to try this even though the smell was lagging i'll tell you that after the grind the smell really did come out it was nice creamy sweetness a little bit gassy um now today i'm going to be enjoying this crescendo by the local joint out of my arizer extreme q desktop vaporizer i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see right there here is the bowl that's sitting right on top of the heating element looks just like that oh my god sweet it's creamy there's like the little piney and gassy oh my god it's everything that i smelled after the grind coming out so well in that bowl now the end of my whip which is basically just the silicone tube that gets the vapor from the vaporizer to me the end with the screen on it that one's going into the bowl that's sitting on top of the vaporizer you guys just saw that the other end is going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler i'm only using two of the three filtration chambers today the or uh excuse me distilled water in the second chamber i've got an organic cotton filter in the third chamber that'll filter out any potential impurities that did not get purged and flushed in the final stages of growing first chamber sits in that little ball right there and that actually typically holds carbon to prevent ash from reaching the water but because we're vaping today that's ash is not going to be a problem for me so if you guys are ready i have been dying to try out this crescendo i'm so happy i found it again this is how you start the new year off right so let's see what this crescendo by the local joint is all about oh wow so that wasn't a huge rip you guys just saw but my mouth is already starting to be coated in terpenes like sweet almost the fresh cotton linen like clean linens taste as well a little bit of creaminess in there i'm diving in for the second rip i can't wait to see how this flavor develops oh my god straight to the dome sweet creamy that is full on goosebumps all over my arm hair is standing on end oh my god that just wrecked me i'm like still trying to catch my breath oh my god more goosebumps back again oh my gosh i'll tell you what if this bowl finishes out as good as this is i'm literally getting in the car after this review is done and i am going to pick up more of this bud i am not i mean two rips in here and like that's how much i'm liking it already flavor more sweet cream it's like a creamy sweetness but a bit of gassy um and that's heavy it's kind of piney for sure oh my god i'm telling you i'm kind of like nervous about finishing out this bowl like seriously i still have goosebumps this is the kind of bud that i have been going in the dispensaries to find oh my god okay here's the deal i gotta go ahead and finish this bowl while i am doing that i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of a 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff so here comes the crescendo now okay so you are looking at the crescendo by the local joint and oh my god this stuff is just absolutely gorgeous that light lime green coloration is so beautifully offset by these neon orange hairs and they are in perfect proportion to the crystals this bud is covered in trichomes no excess leaf material at all all of the leaves have been trimmed right up to the bud i love these little offs you'd see in the left corner there those purple hues on a couple of those darker leaves that are still on the bud oh my god i just can't say enough good things about this crescendo by local joint way to go on this bud you guys okay so how often do we get back from a sesh and my eyes look like this like i feel like these are devil eyes straight up red heavy i mean my body feels like it's straight up floating my mind is like in the in the clouds and just oh my god i mean this for me and i mean i'm not gonna ruin it now because i am gonna wait to put the strain review out um this is just one of my favorite strains like of all time like for me i just i don't this coming across crescendo to be honest was like miracle alien cookies or the grateful breath that we're just like these are on another level this is another level and i will tell you ethos genetics mixing the mandarin cookies which they are known for i-95 and chem dog these strains came together so unbelievably well i can't say enough good things about this ganja i'm just being honest um you know there were some slight areas maybe one area for opportunity in this bud but god the effects and just the way that i'm feeling and and how it hit how fast it came on um it's leveling off now very nice man i know this is sativa hybrid you know 70 30. and like anybody who says sativas aren't supposed to hit like this sativa is hitting harder than most indicates hit um even though i'm a little energized and not not a little energized i feel real good and like i feel just joyful and positive and thankful for this but this the first session of 2021 for me this is it like i'm so this is it we're not [ __ ] with any of that gross ass weed like no more [ __ ] no more [ __ ] dry aids and [ __ ] like no it's gonna be like i'm waiting maybe it's just literally i'm like i wait to hear about strains to review them that are just like the top dog strains because i hate reviewing bad strains i got to be honest and wasting my money and going the dispensary and just this is a game changer though for me this when you find a strain like this like for you whatever that train might be for me it's crescendo um it just reminds you how like lucky we are to be a part of this community and to have medicine that makes you feel like good and it enriches your life and just god i'm i'm so thankful and i want to get into the review i know i've been kind of just chatty kathy here but how i do all of my strain reviews is out of 10 i rate these strains on a scale from zero to ten where zero is the worst ten is the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency it's that simple i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end i'll if it's a seven or above i'm gonna give it my day thumbs up approval if it gets a seven or above i'm going to tell you if i would recommend this strain or not you guys don't even have to honestly watch until the end i've pretty much already done that and given this like the canopy stamp of approval um but i want to start by talking about the looks bag appeal or jar appeal of this crescendo by the local joint so let's go ahead bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys so it's fresh in your mind and we'll go ahead and get my final thoughts okay so here is the deal let's talk about the looks you know it's just very rare that you get jars like this that um you know it's one nug like pretty much like and it wasn't one no it was actually one nug and then two nice smaller size not smaller size nugs but like nugs that were the size that i was showing you on this one so it's kind of like two of these little guys um and i i had one already the one that i thought looked better i saved the big boy i didn't even touch anything off of this one i just had to show you guys uh for the review it's just it's exceptional i mean you know covered in trichomes beautiful orange hair some you know light green on the the the undertones of the leaves covered with these bright again the bright orange hairs but like then you've got these dark purple leaves some darker green leaves they're just beautiful it's a beautiful looking bud it's a 2.5 out of 2.5 for me um in the looks now let's get to the smell this just sucks it really sucks because smell is just not there out of the jar when you grind this stuff up oh my god does the smell come out sweet cream with a little bit of gas it's got everything it's got everything um i love the smell after i ground it up but it took me grinding it up to bring that smell out and for me that means it's only going to get a 1.5 it's a one point reduction just for that and boy is that going to hurt this review now i'm going to say that the taste on this particular variety of the crescendo is between a 2 and a 2.5 it didn't really coat my mouth the way i wanted to coat my mouth and the flavor range wasn't quite as diverse as i would have liked it to be i would have liked a little more of the gas there was some of that pine for sure um you know i just would have liked a little more of a dynamic range but i gotta be honest that just smoking it like it was hitting so hard it was so clean it was so smooth like between a two and a 2.5 i'm gonna go ahead and give it a 2.5 i really am i don't you know i don't know that it's quite there it really you know compared to the colorado grow co that's what i'm going based off of is that one because as you'll see that review you know that was a 10 out of 10 and i don't find 10 out of 10s very often but that one it was a tiny little nug stunk up the the jar just the one little nug um you know so i have a full eighth here and i mean you know again maybe some of that has to do with the freshness of this not having the double seal which i i did you know uh say in my last local joint um local joint review about that double seal in the jar having another padded seal right here on top that you have to peel off that for sure would help um but that's all right um it's still going to get a 2.5 in the taste for me let's get to the potency the potency is just it's a 2.5 it hits so hard it's a sativa though you guys it's a sativa dominant hybrid which means you're not going to get that hit really hard and then you're down it's a hit really hard and then you're like ready to go ready to start your day ready to get going you have that pressure on your head but your body will also be a bit chilled out um you know because of how fast it comes on it does die off a little bit quickly it this again it's between a 2 and a 2.5 i think only because it's not maybe the most potent crescendo i've ever had but it is still so potent i don't even think this stuff i think it was like testing out at maybe 23 to 26 and that just goes to show you when you have a true 22 or 20 or above like that should really crush you and this stuff just absolutely crushed me i wish i had those uh you know statistics i thought they would be printed on the package here but they're not for the percentage of thc but regardless i'm going to give it a 2.5 out of 2.5 so if you've been following it's a 2.5 in the looks a 1.5 in the smell 2.5 in the taste and a 2.5 in the potency it's a 9.00 they only fell short because of that lack of smell and i'm telling you if they have that double seal i bet you that would have took it taken it to a 10 out of 10. um crescendo for me again i'm trying to leave these reviews unbiased but like you know as maybe just a bias this is an unbelievable strain 9 out of 10 i would highly recommend you go pick some of this up now mind you it can easily be argued that this is an 8 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 because it really could have went a half a point either way in some of those and i went and gave the benefit of the doubt in both i probably should have only done that in one category but that's okay and probably if i had to give him the benefited out in one it would be the potency if i had to take away a half a point it would be in the taste like put the taste at a 2.0 po keep the potency at a 2.5 but for all intent purposes i think this butt is a nine um this is i'm just i can't say enough good things local joint thank you so much for this unbelievable herb and a good great buying it actually it was a great experience when i was in this last time um they really made up for the first experience which just wasn't quite as good for me and it wasn't really quite as much with the shop as much as it was um you know the bud that i had ended up getting and you know how old it was and just a couple other issues the bags not being sealed there's a lot of things but besides the point this stuff's a 9.0 if you tried the crescendo from the local joint let me know in the comments below and then let me know what you guys want to see me review in the next video but until then take care of yourself and one another and i look forward to seeing you guys again soon [Music] peace", "zdralLNTJg8": "Oh [Music] what's going on guys welcome to the channel my name is Jay and today we're gonna be checking out true leaves newest indica flower Christine doh before we get started this is the medical marijuana patient review slash channel if you're not 18 years or older go ahead and about farming pre say that let's go ahead an get this bad boy pop open guys oh the smell is so good very very earthy super gassy I don't know it has a lot of pine to it they're good though it's like in the bud structures are very cushy style most of my images up on the screen for you guys super super good looking buds though I mean it's gorgeous guys all right guys let's go ahead and check the potency on this bench we're coming in at nineteen point nine percent THC 0.0% CBD 0.0% CBN zero point six percent of CPG zero point two percent THC V for a total of twenty point seven all right let's go ahead and get this bad boy broken down so we're gonna do a bowl check first to get the full flavor of it and then we're gonna smoke a joint of it that way we cannot give some accurate entails of the effects and I'm gonna read a couple user reviews on there see what the people got to say about it guys packed up let's check this flavor out I use a hint wait for the flavor guys always super tasty guys Wow I don't know how to explain it it's like thanks like that drill you got back in the day it's some good [ __ ] though very very good very similar to Skywalker when you smoke it in my opinion extremely pushy so I wanted to read up a little bit of facts about it though guys I started looking online guys and on Leafly they have it as crescendo RB x1 and it says it's bred by ethos genetics no surprise to that so it's a cross between Tim Dogg I 95 and Mandarin cookies very very good so to say that Gibbs on a sweet cookie dough flavors I can't see the cookie dough but I can definitely see the citrus aromas and the gas eNOS and the cookies it is a little sweet and it does have like a more prominent type of pine smell to it and taste to it very very good though so we're gonna read off a couple of reviews and see what some folks got to say about it alright guys let's go ahead and jump into this joint while we read off a couple other reviews super-good at 22 guys very good rolled up I see it could be in good one tweak to probably want some overs out there so let's move on to a couple of these reviews guys first one is felt obligated to give this training proper review and just started getting on my mister truly if you're in Florida now that we have medical this is hands-down my favorite indica strain me and my wife are both indica people that tastes the smell and everything tens across the board awesome awesome says he likes it better than nine pound hammer guys not bad not bad alright jumping over to the second review we got this is everything you could want him more the smoke is as good as it looks and smells I will grab it every chance I get now that's a bold statement that's awesome I'm loving it guys the effects from it are super relaxed guys I'm like she would want to lean back on that couch lock mood oh man it's so similar to a Skywalker guys it's insane super tasty oh I love it what you guys smoking on today and have you tried crescendo let me know down in the comments also we're gonna go ahead and jump over and knock out this last review so picked up this morning from truly another one got it from truly you've got it in a distillate syringe filled my bait pod up with it smooth creamy smoke tastes like sweet cookies very physically relaxing high it is it really is it's really good stuff oh man so it does come up as a highbreed if you look it up online but I mean that's gonna differ on phenotypes are things like that growing circumstances and all that stuff I I definitely feel like it is that nicka though it's very very chill I don't feel like I'm gonna go to sleep though I just feel very very Mel very nice I love them really really digging this one so I'm not gonna

cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "aLEB5ss-VNA": "[Music] hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review excited about this one today this is one of my favorite companies um so we've got another one by ignite which is uh dan bilzerian's uh i think he's one of the partners of this company here so this one is called crescendo i've been meaning to do it for a while but i wasn't able to get my hands on it uh but obviously i do now this one here is sitting at uh 21.8 thc crescendo is a well-balanced hybrid strain bred from crossing chem dog i-95 and mandarin cookies it features a gassy cushy sweet cookie dough flavor shendo is said to have an earthy citrus aroma the buds are dark green and purple with a layer of trichomes dominate terpene profiles in crescendo are carefully limonene and myrocine crescendo is bred by ethos genetics and grown and hand crafted by atlas growers in edmonton alberta one gear was packaged august 31st so super fresh and i believe they're gonna have a two-way humidity pack in here as well so they do a really really good job and if you're looking to invest in ignite they're under the parent company ignite international brands ltd and the acronym is bills and we'll have that on the screen okay so let's have a look at it here it's got the boveda pack in here really nice to see really pungent smell right away um really nice looking buds too we'll get you guys a good look at that okay so now that we've learned a little bit about crescendo by ignite last thing i got to do is test it out for a rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] all right everyone after testing out the crescendo by ignite really impressed with these guys again i don't think they can miss so far in my opinion so the taste on this was really good the effects on it were great it was very smooth the burn on it uh was was good i guess my only knock on it if i had to if i had to find one uh the ash was not was not like super white um it wasn't really dark either it was kind of somewhere in the middle but it burned really well so it really didn't affect it so again really impressed with these guys i'll definitely be getting this one again on the effects were uh because people have been asking me to kind of mention this it wasn't like super overwhelming it was kind of a it's a nice kind of like 50 50 hybrid so um you know you're definitely getting the sedated feeling um but at the same time you know for someone like myself who is a kind of a um experienced smoker it's something that i can uh kind of smoke during the day uh really enjoy it feel the effects but still you know kind of go out in society and function uh so i really liked it a lot and it's cosmetically beautiful so i'm gonna rate this one at 9.1 out of 10. until next time guys", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I would up y'all there's a little bit of controversy on the field of lyrics from my song top down off the lg bomb let me break it down for y'all cookie fan provided the genetics for

named him and biscotti and I named gushers not only did I select them and name them I went on a worldwide campaign with the [ __ ] and popped it off I rapped about it in my songs I brought it to the artists to athletes to the elite smokers and you know influences in the world I was repping biscotti so hard I almost named and Scott Storch is my witness the big pescado biscotti like literally almost named to my album biscotti and I rapped about it in so many songs and trust me I really campaigned hard Frodo's and on transe is this without getting into too much detail this doesn't even

serial mo yeah chopped liver the floor London cello cheetah piss a whole nother right about to hit the market a whole new flavor profile everything from mints which is you know by sea junkie shot to see junkie from the runts crew yeah from grandiflora some powers up from cookies big menus coming new flavor profiles coming all work is all worked a new work that's the new work so the same way we ran it up you don't run it up again cookies now one more thing purple punch look no disrespect to the breeders a purple punch to the growers of purple punch what's going on in California right now is a bunch of people are growing it they're packaging it on the REC market and then renaming it a hundred different things and after buying 15 different styles of weed named all kind of names and all being a purple punch it was played out to me I said but punches so Blanc you can have it now some of my friends go purple punch some of my friends actually bred purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "0a12CpJ2cnM": "all right everybody I'm going to be doing this small vid on the mini extractor from best value backs as you can see it's tiny and you really don't need that much dry ice I've got the dry ice sitting you know I got that sitting in there and then I've got more in here which I'm going to bury the collection tank into here we can get it super super cold before before I pull a vac on you know on it and before I actually fill it with the solvent so like I said go ahead and get her super super cold because the colder you get the better the vacuum and you know the UM the salt go in there a lot easier and I'll get back with you as soon as it's cold enough and I put the vacuum on it and then we'll fill it all right it's okay you in a second all right just a quick tip while you're letting your tank um get cold get really really cold sub-zero before you pull vacuum in and fill it you're going to be you're going to want to pack your little tube you know on the mini or or even on the other one you're going to want to pack the tube so go ahead and save the caps that they send with it so you can fill it you know you can fill it down to the cap and then you don't have to worry about material falling out you know at either end when you feel it's just a little tip I know it sounds ridiculous you know but people get so excited when they open up everything they end up throwing these away so like I said it's just another tip and I'll be back with you after I'm done back in this alright back again I know it was really quick especially with this vid but anyways now I've got this under dry ice got my line hooked up to the vacuum pump I'm going to go ahead and pull this to full vac it probably won't take much time at all because I mean it's tiny so let's go ahead and see what it does as you can hear that change really fast I'm going to let it sit for a few more seconds but you can hear the Machine change really quick because there's just nothing in there you know the poll of back nine you're polling atmosphere out and there's not much value for that mr. Italy of course you guys understand sand but uh oh and for all you needs there's my sock is gone now I've got the carbon filter up there ha ha thank you no but anyways uh huh now you hear it come and go you know it's at fullback otherwise to me you know the pump would be making a lot more noise now that you hear the noise change go ahead closer off oh sure go ahead and close it and then you can go ahead and turn off the machine and get ready to fill it and then you'll be putting your other part of your mini back in the dry ice while this is you know after you're done filling this you're going to let this you know warm up the room temp um I mean you could cool it a little bit faster but isn't it's not necessary go ahead and let that warm back up and then like I said while you're letting that one back up you go ahead and have put your other one in here get it really cold for full backing and I'll show you that in just a second now see this little red cap in here this is how I fill um without the can tap it just works better for me you guys can use the can tap or this but like I said this is what I use I just find the right nozzle as you can see it's already sub-zero temps I'm going to take it outside and go ahead and fill it up and then I will be back sorry about the pause and start I wish I had a you know a little hesitation in between but I don't feel like editing all that so but anyways I'll be right back alright back again now I have two lines um when you guys go ahead and order your your your units I know they usually come with one line I would go ahead and spend the extra and get yourself another one and the reason for it is just for this fact okay you want to pull a vacuum on your tank on your column but you also want to pull a vacuum and pull all the atmosphere out of this line learn that from the kid old Bret maverick himself which makes a lot of sense you know pull all the back I mean if there's not much of anything in there but since this unit is so small you want to make sure all the atmosphere is gone just so it runs better and that's the same with the bigger units so I've got this open running to that and that is closed that's going to stay closed you know it's just going to but I want all the atmosphere out of this line out I've got my other line up DUP to the tank so when I pull into the pump and to the vacuum pump so when I pull the vacuum it's going to pull everything out of here out of the tank everything out of the column you know it's packed it's a packed column but it's still going to pull all the atmosphere out of tank ah the column and out of the line that you know you're working line all right so I'm going to go ahead and start the pump here how it sounds now just listen and then the change in the pump you've also got your gauge you know on something's on the older units they didn't have the gauges but on this one you got your gauge and it's already dropping really fast because like I said this is a small small unit there's just nothing there to really pull out the atmosphere yeah I mean there's not really much atmosphere in there to pull out now I'm going to go ahead and pull this vacuum then I'm going to go ahead and let it then close my vows I'm gonna let it sit for about 10-15 minutes and then I'm going to pull the back in one more time just um really really make sure that I mean you can hear this thing is so small it goes so fast I'm gonna be amazed that you know I'm just coming to be curious and on a lot of things on how much I get back because I mean I'm only running trim and I mean this is a 45 gram tube so I mean I can't expect much and I'm only using one and of you teen in this room so like I said I can't expect much but I'm still curious to see what kind of outcome you know we're going to get four small personal runs hopefully I think this one is going to work out excellent please but I got a quick rambling and yeah I'm going to go ahead and turn off this valve all my vows were really tight all right now you know there's should be of a key in this line going to the solvent hand now it's still pulling vacuum through here and in the tank so I'm going to go ahead and turn off my other valve now you heard the change in the machine all right I'll be right back all right now I've got the the unit disconnected from the vacuum pump as you can see right there Rep full vacuum and I did find out um that one of my gaskets was kinked so it wasn't holding pressure so I had just had to change the gasket out there was nothing it was my you know user error I probably kinked it when I put it on there uh but and I've also got it all that mystery or out of the line and you know got the tank over here now since it's so small I don't have to throw it up on the ladder Tech I don't know all that stuff you know for those of you who seen my other videos I can pry it you can probably wait for it to warm up just a little bit more and you probably just hold it and turn it upside down I you know don't have somebody else to help me so I'm going to have to go ahead and you know cut it and then turn it and go ahead and start my extraction and then I'll you know get right back from you but this is you know this is pretty pretty decent everything's going really fast and the extraction process is probably going to go really fast too but I'll be right back oh and um right now like I said you're just you got this column packed full of material you've got your tank under vacuum this under vacuum this under vacuum that is all full of a solvent ready to go like I said you can turn this upside down help it out a little bit or you could even you know do the long process just put that in a warm water bath and have it chase you know chase it but like I said it's so simple you guys can you know figure out if you want to turn it upside down or what you know is it small enough you guys can do all that but all right I'll be back with you once I've go ahead and run all this through later all right as you can see I just propped it up on the corner table just for safety not really safety but just I just push that up against it it sits there fine but the can it emptied like in probably four or five minutes if that but I'm going to go ahead and let it you know let it do its thing from at the most ten minutes you're probably done but uh alright I'll be right back alright as you can see uh this thing is you know really light fits in the palm of your hand I mean this is a mini um I'm gonna get ready for the extraction process probably took you know before I start recovery mmm maybe at the most ten minutes if that um so if you had one of these you had a whole bunch of them tubes now I won't even get into all that but anyways I mean that was really quick I'm not you know why again you're not running much I'm only running trim so I'm not expecting much but you never know but uh this emptied really quick so I'm going to go ahead and take this whole thing outside disconnect my lines and then reconnect the line back to UM over on that side on that port for recovery alright everybody and while you can um while you got this out go ahead and take your empty or dry ice back into your cooler and then get once this is empty and everything and you know with all the pressure and the little leftover of gas um then go ahead and you know put this back on dry ice in vacuum so you can go ahead and do your recovery all right I'll be back with you and I get the warm water bath and all that you know ready but yeah it's so far so good alright alright I'm back again um everything you know I got everything hooked up for recovery as you can see it's off of the column on the tank lid line going into your recovery tank which is at full vac on dry ice this is in a warm water bath and it's it's really good I should say a lukewarm water bath because it's only about 80 degrees but uh it'll be it's just going to be a little bit slower but at least it's warmer than what it was when I was all full of frost but I'm going to go ahead and open my recovery tank then I'm going to go ahead and open the work tank and you can hear it already filling into this one and remember the your solvent is going to run from the heat and chase the cold again it's going to run from the heat in the warm water bath go through here and then chase the cold and then it's going to turn back into liquid blah blah blah okay sorry about all that but it's just like I said a lot of people you know and it's just a really basic you know the warmth chases the cold and like I said we'll see what we got I mean there's just a little bit of trim in there I'm not expecting much but I'm gonna give her hmm say 20 minutes go ahead and check you know did check and see where I'm at uh and maybe change the water I don't have to wait that long but I'm gonna do it in a little bit of colder temps because like I said I'll it'll take me a few tries to really see what you know the times and the water temps and stuff like that cuz that's so small I don't want to get warmed up too quick and then have most you know have a actual muffin starting in inside my tank you know I just um but like I said who knows I might even get this little itty-bitty thin layer oils like across the bottom of the can that's barely scraping because there's just not that much material in there I don't know yet but you know we'll see you know I bet you there's going to be enough not for a pore so everyone don't expect me to you know crank out a nice little pore with this can I mean come on now you're not you're you just don't have enough material to run through it that with n enough but anyways um but yeah I'll get back to you guys and girls um here in a bit and uh I don't know you guys can stop here take a siesta whatever you know whatever you can do but uh I'll be back in probably ten to twenty minutes all right everybody all right everyone I'm back and as you can see there we go that's the product all right I can try to pour but it's probably going to make more of a mess here we go all right everybody I'll talk at you later all right everybody um I just thought I'd come back and show you guys you know um I got this left in the can I could probably scrape a little bit more but that's just I'm gonna go ahead and clean it with some Everclear and uh I just keep a a clean thing of you know a jar of Everclear full of what I clean out of the can and later on you know I can I make some winterized stuff for like that there's quite a bit down there still uh but and there's what we got in there you know it's for trim and a little anyone can of ute that you get back I mean yeah um I'm kind of impressed of course it's not deep waxed and anything but I mean if if these little things actually took off you know that could be something you know that we could look into is getting a little uh a little dewaxing spool you know to go on the inline filter you know if that's what you know somebody want to do but they got to remember you know you're already got such a small yield as it is when you go ahead and ink all your lipids and waxes out you're gonna get even smaller but like I said I am I'm pretty impressed uh this little mini is just yeah well like I said I'm gonna go ahead and clean that with some every Claire and I would just put the Everclear right back in the bottle um and then like I said later on down the road you know after whenever I feel like it basically you know then I put it through the distiller and you know go ahead and knock it all down and collect the winterized oil but uh yeah all right all that stuff is gonna eat on the round on these edges are gonna I could probably warm it up then get the rest of that out but I don't know we'll see alright sorry for the rambling", "xp8aue8SXSw": "[Music] look at this it's a nice flower of something I've never tried before it's called crescendo and it's from THD THC design and I've been using it

special guest and today we're gonna be reviewing the thc design crescendo strain it's coming in at 38.36 total active cannabinoids so it's a super potent product we got this from market run delivery over in the orange county area irvine norwalk all this east l.a socal vibes you know what i'm saying uh it's a beautiful jar though purple clear branded with the little thc molecule jazzy why don't you check it out and read some of the information and then we will dive in to the one hit one joint all right so on this jar says crescendo um 32.28 percent thc wow .6 cbd and 35.36 thca okay so activated thc is going to be really really high on them um and i like that they put terpene information here it's got three of them there is that what i'm saying yeah mercene lima limonene mm-hmm and that carryover so spicy earthy hops fruity sweet citrus pepper spicy so it should have this citrusy fruity gassy earthy spicy all of the above is what i like to say it's like all of the it's like the ultimate crescendo of all the weeds that must be what they're going for very nice what are your thoughts on the packaging i love the colors because i'm just really sick of seeing black i feel like you would wear that color i would definitely this is definitely my next color all right well let's give it a crack and let's check out the smell of the nugs and then we'll dive into this joint that we have here in this nice vibes paper hand rolled by jazzasaurus yourself so on the smell i get this light earthy it's like like earthy plants peppery earthy sweet everything that it said let me get another so on the nug we've got some good nug size here this is about the size of a you know nice quarter is pretty dense and then the nug the smell oh it's gassy it's super gassy oh my gosh oh yeah wow once you cracked it over the nose on this is insane very excited to check this out oh yeah super gas this is going to be wonderful i'm excited oh i don't know why i'm putting that in there oh part of that ponytail all right here we go so we've got this joint you know how we light it right yeah i always fail at it no no no you're pretty good it's just important to twist you want to twist get it nice all the way around and then we think of s'mores lighting a joint is like roasting a s'more and the first hit was kind of papery so let me get a second real hair all right y'all so first hit lots of flavor lots of flavor don't really get much of the citrus or the or the berry you really just get that earthy spice it is gassy gasoline [Music] what do you taste it's so smooth oh man these buds are potent man i'm so excited to smoke more of this so when it comes to the actual bud structure we've got nice dense buds the if you look through it these parts here are pretty dense the leaves are super sugary and crystally it could be a little bit better trim job i mean there's some crow's feet inside here but for the most part this is something that i know if i were to get this if i were to get any strain that looked like this i'd be pumped i was coughing a couple times and i'm already pretty stoned from that i really like it and i i love sativa so this is surprising this is on that indica side i feel like i feel like this is something i wouldn't like and i i think it's great harvest date september 15th package date october 27th is still pretty fresh cbd point zero six percent total active cannabinoids again thirty eight point three six percent this is some of the most potent weed in all of california just purely based on this total active cannabinoids yeah that's actually the highest i've seen during my is this the most potent weed flower that you've ever smoked according to a number that you can remember yes and i mean i'm a new bedtender and i haven't seen anything closely i haven't seen since i've known you i don't think we've smoked anything that was just flour above 32. and even then the stuff that we have smoked that was usually higher thc always had distillator terps or something it was like an infused joint some hash some keef i wish it was more citrusy but that's just because i love sativa can't hold it against the strain exactly i'm going to give it a 9.5 ooh you think it's good this is one this is your highest rated indica the high the puts i mean i only took a couple pups and i would just stop right there my my only so i love the purple and pink the crescendo i love that there's terpenes listed i love that there's the total cannabinoids the thc i love the jar the custom jar purple lid the custom style of purple they went with this pink the little logo there in the jar i really enjoy what i'm seeing my only issue is i don't know what genetics crescendo is so although these terps give me an idea of what kind of high it is i want to know more info more info about the crescendo genetics i think that's pretty standard and then i know that if this weed were to sit on the shelf for a period of time it would get light degradation because it's a clear clear glass and there's a lot there's a lot of window right yeah they could even make it that light like or not light but purple is the dark black or even this color of purple or the color of pink just something to give a little bit of light filtration to filter some of the damage away the flavor of it is pretty decent in my opinion i think the ash is a little bit darker unfortunately creating a slightly harsher smoke which is why we coughed um i'd recommend in a pipe better because i mean that's the thing is like i don't smoke pipes so i'm not going to recommend anything in a pipe i smoke joints and i smoke blunts and i rip bonds it just feels like it's hard towards just the middle it could be getting it could be getting resonated the more we smoke yeah i mean it also is a high thc this is 32.28 this is not supposed to be it's too harsh for my throat and you're still out of 9.5 no i think i want to change it is that allowed i mean maybe what are you thinking i think i am allowed because i should be able to base it off smoking the entire pre-roll it's your review all-star what do you want just halfway and it's just so harsh what do you thinking nine a point five deduction nine flat from jazzy i'll be honest when you smoke a lot of the most potent weed they're not easy to smoke they might be smooth but the flavor the gas how potent and terpene is definitely typically make it not an easy thing to smoke with that said i'm gonna give this no you know i was sitting up there around a 9.25 9.5 and like i said i really want to see the genetics i really want to see the genetics sorry about that and um as much as i like the glass jar i just feel like you know as a former bartender myself i just know that it's gonna dry out because of the light degradation and so for me you know as close to perfect as this is this is a 9.5 for me uh out of 10 i think the potency the color the taste the smell what i recommend there's a lot of information on here the presentation the appeal it's all right there i make a small pivot to a colored jar to save the uh to save the light damage on these beautiful nugs i think you're both really stoned yeah i mean that's the thing though the potency if i were raiding all the we just in the potency then a lot of weed would get 10 because they [ __ ] us all up but that's not what contributes to the holy spirit sure so 9.5 is where i'm falling great work thc design the crescendo strain jazzy said it here first i think we're [ __ ] up yeah let us know what you guys think in the comments give her a follow on instagram at jazzasaurus j-a-c-i-s-a-u-r-u-s this is your boy joey jp here i'll see you all down the road oh smash that subscribe button love you guys peace", "pByZ7-rMtzc": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 all right hi everybody how you doing out there today hope everybody's having a good day good night good afternoon good morning whatever time of day you're watching me if you guys haven't subscribed and you like what you see hit that little subscribe button right there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know what you guys are smoking on we got a review of some truly sherbert shatter coming in at seventy five point three percent THC alright first of all let's get into lighting something up we find it lighter than all this mess hmm there we go alright what are you guys smoking on I'm smoking on some leftovers for those of you who knew that's just roaches mixed up with whatever flour is dry and leftover ice mix it all together also threw in a little bit of the last of my paradise awaits THC a almost out of that but I do got some more different strains there'll be some reviews coming up but I will say that snow is really good in a joint especially like I said I'm smoking leftovers witches roaches mixed with flour so it's not the best tasting sometimes you can sprinkle just enough of this on there to kind of flavor the whole thing all the way through so it does help with that alright let's get into this alright I've had this for a minute it's got some CBG in there 3.2 percent THC V in there no CBD I really like the strain and the concentrate a lot more than I did the flour the flour from truly I thought was okay you know it had that more that skunky taste which was you know it's fine with the taste the effects was okay it was more of a kind of blah hi for me to be honest with you it doesn't really stood out in there and this like I said I got a little bit left in there this the shadow really stood out it improved my mood a lot better the high was a lot better and I know some of you saying well you're comparing shatter to flower but I mean the effects a lot of times you know like if I get an independent flower it usually does the same thing in an indica and shatter it's just more potent you know I mean this the effects really felt different to me like said the flower was just more of like a okay hi this was a really really liked it hey see if we can get a hit of it here real quick it still had that lemon flavor to it which like I said I think all the true leaves shatter and crumble have that now this did sit out in the garage for a while so it is going to be a little whatever you want to call it nucleate it sugar it up so it's got some little dirt for my fingers in there but like I said all in all a lot better than the flower ever was the effects was nice and uplifting I believe it helps with my mood a little bit we can get something off of there for doing dab real quick and we rehab so we got some on there little glob because a new concentrate pen um actually it's not new had this for about six months I just opened it up you guys remember that 4/20 giveaway I one that had the stash logic case in there this was in there too and just never got around to trying it out pretty impressed with it so far I'm probably gonna do a review on it on Saturday since it kind of fits with that you know she had her days now it comes with this little thing so pretty much makes it just like the yocan pretty similar but it also come with this water recycler which I'm really diggin on it's like I said we will have a review on it later if we can get it in frame there here we go guys his rig is nice and quiet make sure I didn't move it on you guys we'll get another one right there is that good do notice it does take like a poll or two to get it going with a recycler on it to get the smoke up there like I said we will do her a full review on that on Saturday it'll give me a couple days to test it out see what I like what I don't like about it hmm but I've got a lot of concentrates to review I'm also got a few vape pens so get away with something besides flower for a while we've been having the same strain of the flower so it's kind of hard to keep reviewing the same one over and over again they do change like the flavor and the THC and all that but overall the effects are pretty much the same on the flower so it's kind of gets a little tedious doing them over and over so I did get a bunch of different concentrates and like I said I can stock up on concentrates anyways where I couldn't on flower because of our limits so I figured it was good to break this thing out see it there it does come with a nice little base on its own it won't stand with the water eggs but in the base it will it's still a little bit kind of heavy but it just spilled proof - so you can lay it down and it won't spill out it's like I said I will do a few full review on that on Saturday we'll either throw it in with a shadow review or some kind of wax probably chrome ball got a lot of crumble seems like that was the only thing available so like I said we will you do it by itself or throw it in with one and do a twofer I'm probably going to do another video I got a box on Monday this is Thursday so it's sat here for three or four days and I'm kind of chomping at the bit to get it open yeah and plus it kind of goes along with you know the concentrate so we gotta bust out this week anyway so we either do an unboxing tonight or another one tomorrow morning something like that so hopefully everybody's having a good time a good night we'll make this a little short video and hopefully we'll see you later in another one hopefully everybody's token on something good out there you can see it's shining a snows melted in up there on the tip it's even a little sticky all right hopefully you guys are toking on something good and until next time keep on talking my friends", "uz4hfUiGDY8": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughout studios now welcome to cannabase ecstatic oak shatter tabs and wax today we're going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on

or get in a dispensary yeah this is something they have in and I went to the st. Pete location st. Pete clear or location and picked it up no they didn't have it our dispensary in Tampa so I had to go to a lot of Spencer you picked it up we are gonna break a little bit of this off in this right here and yes guys I am doing this from another part of the system I usually have like three or four different recorders today I am using a little small recorder let's get this in an area that's a pretty thick and I mean Oh guys this is actually thick not then I mean it's a thick glob of shatter I mean that's a thick glob of some good shatter so we're gonna break some off we're gonna put in a little vapor system and we are gonna smoke it I mean it's liable enough to play with it but it is some think I mean I think glob of sour dee I've had this in bud form I've had this in vape form I have never had this in shatter form or in a clear gel form because I mean their review it was let's reverse it so there it is right there pretty good so let's hold it off of it get modern paper you know yeah I have a true system gotta get all replaced broke every part of my unit I'll show you what it looks like inside the unit pretty dark in there from being used a lot but there's the shatter inside oh we see one of the lights flashlight any guys see there was a shatter inside the container and there it is right there and sour dee I picked up some dog walker og in a syringe and true clear I had some super Lemon Haze last time into review on it but uh there it's gonna reflect back anyway we're gonna flip the camera and we'll get off of that flashlight I guess we can't so let's go flip it back and flash itch sorry about that guys I just also container not pick it up now it's okay all right now second guys and we are gonna put the cap back on it and we're got a vape on it we're gonna give you a flavor taste a test and you know how my flavor taste go so it's a little tricky to get the unit together I'm using a different unit today just before a review you know me and my little either way I have a true clear system truly system this is the truly system I just put on a bigger battery to do this vapor for the sour D so the button right here will turn red and there's three colors this button is a red a pink in a blue and it's four different products first ones like a hyena fights to run real quick time the first one was just tough blow out you know it goes you get a little bit of the Trump eating flavor through the Sour Diesel you could taste it I mean it smells like it it ain't a one-hit wonder I mean you hold it in for a couple seconds blow it out and by the time you're done blowing it out your eyes are completely shot like this and you feel good so I mean it's a very very very good product I like this one too I have tried a lot of the shedder and this one is on one of my top lists and would be bought again I kind of like the UH the way they're making this cheddar note is because you can leave it out on the table in the bag form like this on your table as long as you don't have any kids in your house be very careful if you have kids in the house please put it on the bags that they gave you well if you don't have any kids in house you can leave this on the table I have left the I had this I had the space bomb last time left it on the table for three days and it didn't even get soft it stayed in the shatter form like that so yeah this is very good I give it a good 55 thumbs up and I went to st. Pete Florida truly to pick it up which one of the guys from Tampa was there I don't know doing something he was there for a couple of days came in shook my hand I kind of told him in so many words that I would put the video out and didn't tell him what time I do the video tomorrow guys I will do a review on the dog already do a redo video on the dog walker og on the other channel along with

good get for those of you wondering yes I overpaid like a [ __ ] only got a half a gram I hate four dollars plus tax full grams or 80 no brakes except on saturdays ridiculous but and I never pay it but because i can get decent honeycomb crumble for forty nine dollars a gram you know down the street at the local dispensary the closure dispensary foot and this is the first time I like I came up and saw the shatter and I was like [ __ ] I want to have that so I got them I had to have him you know I sacrifice some of my flower to get this happen and my wife so I'm gonna try to enjoy it but anyway love in pcl um usually I'd have a vape to go out with ma'am but honestly I'm 2 inches so should I haven't even been vaping today I don't know one line is right now so you want Marshall a piece", "OgTM7UlNWLE": "how you doing welcome to dan's boot of bodega where today i am going to review mac number seven so let's just get right to it [Music] all right now mac number seven or miracle alien cookies number seven is a sativa heavy hybrid that crosses alien cookies with starfighter and colombian all gray strains in themselves i can't wait to see what it's like when you put them together but first let's go take a look at it all right this is a loud strain meaning that when you go to open it up you're going to be hit with the overwhelming odor of skunk as far as looks go i mean it looks decent it's got decent greens some hairs you know not as much teeth as i'd like to see but how it's cresco right the only other thing that i really had a problem with was that when you broke it up it still turned to dust enough talk let's smoke when i was doing my research on this strain one of the words that was used to describe its flavor was spunky which kind of makes me nervous you know because when something tastes a lot like salt it's salty if something tastes a lot like smoke or like it was smoked it tastes smoky so what am i supposed to think when i hear spunky i mean i try not to put anything described as spunky in my mouth i mean maybe on the face and the hair but never a direct deposit anyway let's try to find a better word for this flavor nostrovia slanted cheers salute froze here we go okay so right up front very sweet citrusy but then it goes but then it gets a little earthy not bad though a lot better than i thought it was going to be just from that uh one description whoa all right and it appears that the 28 thc is doing its job so what do you say we give it a little bit of time and then i'll get right back at you all right guys i've given it some time and the effects of mac number seven have their ups and downs meaning that the initial head rush is pleasant and energizing and that builds and builds until you're in a state of calm comfortable euphoria which is nice and then on the back end you're crashing it leaves you feeling exhausted drained burnt out hung over whatever you want to say now it is a decent daytime strain however because of that back end i would probably smoke it more around late afternoon maybe right around dinner time so that you do get that that pleasant euphoric boost but when the back end comes you'll be ready for bed anyway this is a good strain if you're trying to fight depression uh lethargy i wouldn't i really wouldn't go with this one if you're having issues with anxiety so if you're smoking to fight depression uh lethargy and stimulate your appetite this is a good strain for you so if you see it on your menu go ahead and give it a try alright guys well that just about does it for me here i'd like to thank all my friends family viewers subscribers lovers haters thumbs up or stump sounders uh i'd like to say how grateful and thankful i am for the steady increase uh in subscribers it's oh my god

shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called now the names of concentrates usually refer to either the extraction method or the consistency some people refer to all concentrates as wax but we'll try to get into the details because it can be confusing and there's no dictionary definition on some of these yet so you will hear people using one term for multiple things for multiple terms for one thing so when i first started buying legal concentrates in colorado in like 2014 like 95 of the concentrate options were shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called and a lot of times all three of these would be called wax or having a sale on wax it would refer to any cured resin that they had so most of what i would get was bho but all this is ethanol extraction and they're still using these terms because we can still come out with these consistencies and it's interesting because this crumble in my opinion is uh more waxy or buttery than the wax and the wax looks a little more crumbly than the crumble it just goes to show you that the terms aren't exact not all crumble is a hundred percent the exact same consistency not all waxes it's just general terms to try to keep them categorized like shatter for example shatter usually refers to as the lighter clear stuff that you can feed through you can't really see through any of the other ones in this one i go to break off a piece it should snap off but there's different types of shatter i mean i've had glass like shatter where it doesn't bend at all it's not malleable in any way it snaps when you try to fold it there's shatter that's called pull and snap where it's a little bit stretchier you can kind of stretch pieces off and they snap off eventually it's still shattered but it's a little bit more malleable and then i've also seen really sappy shatters where it looks like this but just a slightly melted or a slightly warm version shatter is probably the most popular out of the three of these and most people would think that this is the best it can have higher thc percentages but sometimes that means lower terpene percentages now these these two the crumble and the wax are very similar consistency a lot of the crumble that i've been getting in florida is really really dry sometimes crumble ends up looking like that where it's just really dry kind of powdery this video is brought to you by boom head shop the loudest online head shop they carry all kinds of bongs dab rigs vaporizers accessories cleaning products and more check them out and you can save up to 20 off with the cupid's code that's boomheadshop.com when you're making shatter you usually spend a little more time purging out all the fats and lipids when you're making that butter consistency sometimes you'll whip it up while you're purging it so as far as differences goes they're all very similar they'll have similar tastes they'll vaporize basically about the same it's just how they're handled now i don't really like crumble and shatter that much they're my least favorite they're the hardest to handle concentrates in my opinion if you get a really hard shatter it'll break off when you try to go get a piece or crumble sometimes it's really hard to handle really hard to scoop it's super dry sometimes it just smears all over the container and you're trying to get it off and there's just a thin film of it on the inside so i'm hoping this video gives you a little insight on the consistencies the terms aren't too literal they can mean a variety of things there's a bunch of different things you could call shatter a wax or crumble that would fit the criteria or fill that category when i first got into dabbing shatter was my favorite i thought because it had the highest thc percentage that it was going to be the best one oh man biggest numbers in this one but then i learned after several incidents of handling it losing some it was my least favorite to deal with it's usually the least flavorful out of the three there so out of the three i would say butter is my absolute favorite crumble and shadow are [ __ ] i hate those consistencies they're the worst anyway if you like this video

concentrate correspondence over the last few years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb

from sir Tara it's from their float line of solid concentrates and flour I'm gonna see what the stats are it's the Blackjacks train I've never had that one before it's 66.1% THC and point four one four percent CBD let's get a look at it see what it looks like one nice big ol dark amber glob of wax in there are shatter I should say there's not much smell to it no much smell to it at all I mean I don't really smell anything let's see what it weighs and tear out that paper well that's nice alright see make sure this is chaired properly yeah it looks like we got one point 1 1 8 1 point 1 1 7 grams so that's cool there you go cut a little bit over can't complain about that keeping it some better looks at it so as you can see it's a very clear but dark amber concentrate it is it is clear but it's dark so I'm not sure exactly why I don't know if that is because they use alcohol I don't know if they use co2 I'm not sure there's no okay well there you go it shatters do that again nice and it's got that same consistency that I liked out of the other sort error shatter that I got and that is that it's like was it pullin snap or you can pull it and snap it really convenient for dabbing as you can see I can work with it with my fingers and not worry about it getting totally everywhere you just take these little bits off by rolling it around on your fingers well then I'd say now all we can do is get some of this stuff vaped up what I like to do is take it and break it up into little dab balls that are ready to go see I'll get a few of those made up get a couple decent ones that's pretty good the last time I did this I think I made four of them and I only ended up using three of them that's a nice one right there so you see how easy this is to work with compared to some I've had shatter before that's so dry and it's not pliable it just flies everywhere and this pull and snap consistency is just awesome I really like it so working with it with my fingers it's not sticking like crazy you can pull it apart and make little dabs out of it very cool I like it let's give my dad machine over here ready to go I guess I won't need this see if I can pull this off here we'll get this done all right I think I'll start out with bigger ones looks like a decent one right there all right nice people hit a vapor off of that there's not much flavor to it it's got kind of a just this nice flowery flavor a floral type flavor to it but not really intense and it doesn't really stand out that much the dab itself was pretty smooth though like it didn't leave me gasping for air and you know hacking my lungs out so that's pretty cool let's give another dab a try oh man hmm whoo that won't hit me a little bit harder holy cow dang definitely feeling that one whoo-whee I need that cleaned up a little bit all right let's give it another dad oh I think that's probably gonna do it for me holy cow that's pretty intense feeling it on my forehead behind my eyes eyes are watering holy cow you know interestingly it's not making my nose run as much as some strains so let's see blackjack is a cross between black domina and Jack Herer by sweet seeds Jack Herer is one of my favorite strange now that's kind of disappointing to know that the jacker air is a parent of this and it just has almost no smell to it but the effects are nice really like the effects so far I actually might finish that one you know it's a pretty clear headed medicated effect here like it's not really cloudy it's not really like sedating feels nice so I think I will go for another one a little bit bigger justice just a pinch just a smidge I make it just a smidge bigger that's just a little bit it was a really small one at first all right let's get it up still not much flavor but nice dense paper really decent effects um this is definitely what I would consider more of a daytime stream it's not it's not like that kind of couch lock effect I guess it's what you'd expect from Jack here I'm not sure well what a black domina is I'm not sure if that's you know the sativa or indica but nice effects from it 66.1% it's $60 a Grand Master Terra and pulling snap consistency that's really nice to work with you can snap it you can pull it you can do lots of stuff with alright thank you guys for watching I hope you have a good one", "oP3IWpBhSUU": "hey again everybody this is can eccentric films and i am back at you with another flower review today we've got some crescendo from nature's grace and wellness aka ngw this is a three-way cross of chem dog i-95 and mandarin cookies and away to the categories we shall go this bud has pretty coloration and is pretty tricky overall and seems to be trimmed with nurture and attention to detail honestly the trim is what saves the looks here in my opinion these are more leafy and less flower abundant nugs by structure at least and you know with that a tad bit dry on the outside but still relatively squishy and fresh feeling overall again pretty well manicured buds um but a grow that likely didn't reach its full potential in my opinion i'd give it an 8 out of 10 for looks with all that considered being that it is still visually pretty stuff and they made the most of it this stuff gives off a bit of an earthing herbal floral aroma before the breakdown and upon grinding the nose is met with a really complex terp profile this reminds me quite a bit of some standout chem dog cuts i've tried in the past which makes sense with kemdog being one of its three parents but the most concise description of this aroma i could come up with was pungent sour blackberry like and floral gas i'd give this a 9 out of 10 for smelt a really strong funk coming off this stuff and i'm a big fan of it this is for the chem dog fans for sure this is a super smooth smoke but it's void of much flavor that's okay though my lungs did appreciate the smoothness of the smoke with all that considered i'd give it a 7 out of 10 for taste i did try to find you know some fine degree of flavor even by uh vaping and by trying it in a joint and not too much at all just kind of a smoky generic weed taste um no issues with the smoke which by the way ash is super bone white it was just quite flavorless to me you might feel like you want your money back about three minutes into taking a few hits of this strain it's not as instant of an onset as one may hope for upon deciding to go the you know smoked flower route for their medicating but about seven to ten minutes later a really stony buzz creeps up and i found it to be sedating but also quite clearing of the mind this helped my restless leg syndrome a lot also helped me feel comfortable sitting still like focused and watching movies made me super interested in many external media you know music visual art films i'd give this high a nine out of 10. it's really nice to help you relax and be in high spirits even if you've had a long stressful day that's going to give this button 8.25 overall this is some very unique stuff a good sour floral funk really reminds me of kentucky bluegrass from revolution and smell but honestly i prefer this smell it's danker in every aspect the nugs were not quite at the elite level i prefer but it was a smooth and effective smoke just a little about the name if anyone is a musician and has ever studied in any academic setting you know crescendo is actually an italian word and a lot of like classical music has markings and italian words and crescendo is the one that means gradually increase in volume so i think that applies to this high a lot one other comment i want to make is that overall i've been really impressed with the two natures grace flowers i've tried so far double durban cush and now this crescendo it's kind of like middle of the pack in terms of quality i think of the cultivators in illinois but i think it's really solid stuff and they've both definitely provided me good medicating buzzes one potential little criticism i would point out is that i don't care for these stickers they slap on the containers they have three letters and they're sometimes misleading this one crc anyone who has experience with like extracting concentrates knows that is a somewhat controversial means of extracting and color correction basically it's called color remediation correction some people frown upon that in the concentrate industry so it was kind of a mental block to see crc but also they have a chicago blue dream as well and they label it cbd and that's just really misleading i don't think it has any cbd content in it all i could be wrong but i don't think it does that's just a little complaint i'd have let me know what your opinions are on nature's grace flower and stay safe everybody", "al6-nQkbQXk": "it may be the color of honey but the high you'll get from this cannabis concentrate will be anything but sweet if you over consume shatter can contain 80 to 90% THC but what is it and how is it made find out on this episode of Wheaties II by the growth up you might have heard of shatter a potent cannabis concentrate made from butane hash oil it's one of the many forms of butane hash oil or BHO in league with wax and cannabis oil used in vapes shatter is the solidified hardest form of BHO earning its nickname because it's transparent and can shatter like glass it's highly potent containing 80 to 90 percent THC according to Health Canada and its effects come on quickly and can last for several hours for that reason it takes far less shatter to get you high when compared to cannabis flour which generally contains up to 30% THC but how is shatter made and how do you consume it firstly shadow is made from the trichomes of the cannabis flower click the letter i' in the top right corner of your screen to watch our video on trichomes and learn just how critical they are to your high to make shatter the trichomes of cannabis buds are separated from the flower using butane and extremely flammable and dangerous gas once separated the trichomes are collected and heated to remove the butane the new substance is mixed to a creamier texture and then solidifies into shatter making shatter is very dangerous and it's not recommended to do it at home people have died or been seriously injured trying to create shatter and this is definitely not something you should do I this is because making shatter or any other BHO involves using butane gas in the process in the extraction process butane gas becomes a liquid and then evaporates when heat is used to remove it from the concentrate since butane is heavier than oxygen after it evaporates it can fall to the floor creating a very hazardous situation especially over a hot stove top this is not the only risk when it comes to BHO though any form of BHO weather shatter or otherwise is highly dangerous to consume orally there's the real risk of poisoning here so shatter and other be a chose shouldn't made into edibles that's because there's a possibility that not all the butane was removed when creating the BHO with all that said shatter can be a pleasantly potent concentrate if used correctly and with care shadow is consumed by heating it and then inhaling the smoke you can consume the shatter by adding a small piece of it to a pipe bomb hash pipe vaporizer or dabbing rig be cautious with dabbing rigs however because they can reach temperatures as high as 400 degrees Celsius and should be handled with care and keep in mind that while shatter can be baked it might be trickier to do so and you might prefer vaping another type of BHO very potent and not for the faint of heart shatter is one of many concentrates available from the cannabis plant and likely better suited to more experienced users

over what we do here at johnny's green extractions uh we're the manufacturer and the builder and designer of this green machine stand here that does uh does the open blasting extraction with butane and uh if some of you aren't familiar with this uh apparatus kind of does i'm gonna go over it with you guys so here we are um i got three different models set up here but actually it's one it's one unit it's just set up um the way i sell it i i uh i sell it for a 12 inch tube like this i sell it for an 18 inch tube and a 24 inch tube but it's it's just one machine it's a machine that we make here like this um it's adjustable so i have it set up at all i have it set up at the three different sizes right now so 24 18 and 12. so that's how we arrived different uh sizes out of it so um you can buy this kit off of johnny's as a kit with the tube the stand and a couple little trinkets that come with it or you can buy just a stand in no tube um it does accommodate other tubes also like i'll show you here in the past this is a cute little tube i don't sell these tubes you guys but they're out there they're just as much money as the big tubes it seems with this little guy here um you could put literally like a half an ounce in here or something like that and do a quick little blast but how i had to accommodate this for my machine is i ended up finding a sleeve that fit this nicely and then it fit in my machine just as well like the 12 inch it still is a 12 inch tube it's just skinnier but with the sleeve on here it seems to work and then i've even had these ones which are a different diameter than uh the regular two inch tube it's like an inch and a half here but i have also had a rubber sleeve on there to make those work in the machine and see here's another skinny one longer one so there's there's a lot of different tubes out there at johnny's here uh we sell the 12 we sell the 18 and we sell the 24 inch tubes we got we've got a lot of stock of tubes right now and all the trinkets you need to kind of get it going um this uh this extraction is a good extraction the the open blasting it's hydro hydro carbon is what blast off the the triclos so it's it's a it's a good extraction it's just that you got to make sure that you you put it through a process where it's it's safe to ingest or inhale you got to get rid of the butane through a couple different steps but as far as the old days we used to have to take a tube i'll show you we used to have to grab a tube and literally take a canna used to have to take a can of butane at one time and then stand there like this and blast it and one another can and however many cans it used to be and it's like you know if holding it like that if anything ever went off it's more likely you're going to burn yourself so i came up with this idea here just to make it easier and safer to do just add your can put your product in there push down on the mechanism and it'll start blasting you can you can walk away at a safe distance just to let it do its thing so uh i got lots of stock right now in hand with machines and stuff i sell as far as selling it we sell we sell pretty much all over the place quite a bit to the us way over here australia mexico we send it all over the place who's ever interested in it so um i'm gonna i'm gonna do a demonstration with you guys outside of course and uh show you show you how this works and what you get out of it remember this is this is very unsafe to do make sure this is done and outside where there's not no chance of sparks or flame or cigarettes in your mouth or joints or anything and and uh be safe when you're doing this i mean you're working with butane it's it's highly flammable so let me take you guys outside and uh we'll get one ready and we'll we'll do a demo for you okay stay with me hey you guys before i take you outside and do a demonstration i just wanted to show you one new product i just got in it's a pair of um they're they're a uv glass for in your grow room they're supposed to be for metal halide or leds they come with they come with uh you can show this a little closer if you want man i'll show you guys a set of these i have these the blue lens is for the the high pressure sodium and then they come with a they come with the green lens also for the um the led lights i i tried one on i went in my room with the with the blue lenses on and uh it ends up it ends up making it look like um sort of a whiter light instead of yellow so it's kind of cool and there's they're supposed to have protection on them too so um you don't hurt your eyes or nothing the uv protection on them i want to show you one more thing too that i got here for something new you guys like looking at your uh you like looking at your crystal before your plants are done to see how your the color the color of the milk on the uh the crystal i got um even for inspecting bugs anything i got these nice these nice little um they are a basically a magnifier they're all metal body they're nice they they have a blue uh i guess you gotta you gotta take the thing out for the power but they have a blue light and also a led white light for look looking at stuff close up these are 40 times the power they're well built they're nice very nice i thought i'd share that with you so let's go outside let's do some blasting and see how these things work all right let's go so i want to prepare the i want to prepare the tube here with the herb in it come and have a look i got some i got some herb here we're going to use it's uh all the kind of crumbs and stuff that you end up at the bottom of the bag but it's nice little bud it's got lots of sugar on it and stuff so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to grind that up and um i use i use a grinder like this it's like an old silver bullet that's what i'm going to use so i'm going to take this i'm going to bust it up a bit and fill the tube so i fill it up myself that's kind of what i do let me plug this in just just enough to [Music] break it up you know okay and then i then i add it to the tube okay let it pack itself a little okay so let me let me fill this up and i'll show you once this is full so so so it's loosely packed in there okay it's not it's not all tightly packed down or nothing so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to put a filter on there you can use um i mean preferably un uh bleep unbleached instead of these white ones but right now it's all i got to show you guys for this demo so then i put a clamp on it so what some guys will do also is they'll prepare their tubes like this and then they'll put them in the freezer and cool them off because the colder the colder the better extraction you get so now we're going to install this we're going to install this in one of the green machines this is a 14 inch tube not a 12 but i have the machine set up for a 12 inch so like i said it accommodates it accommodates other other sizes also so we just check on the height yeah we're good clamper in okay one other thing you want to know is you don't want to you don't ever want to jam these these tips just directly in your glass tube you always want to make sure you have a plastic tip in there because some of these things are metal and if you stick metal on glass it's it's not a very you can bust your tips sometimes or your glass so always use it always put a tip in there a plastic tip so this bad boy is ready to take outside push the button down we're going to collect the juice and we're going to evaporate it either and make it into honey oil or we're going to put it on some kind of a slick pad or parchment paper and we're going to put it in the vacuum oven and make shatter out of it so let me get this set up safely outside somewhere and i'll show it i'll show you what it looks like extracting okay all right guys we got it all set up out here now so i'm gonna hit the button i'm gonna let it do its thing okay i'm gonna let you watch [Music] [Applause] do [Music] [Music] said it was about a sound let me tell you honey that's just what you found [Applause] all right you guys i ended up grabbing the bowl of juice there it is and now i got it sitting on this this heating pad here at uh a hundred so i want this all to evaporate until there's no more juice left in there or till the juice is all down to like a pasty kind of paste and then we'll take it from there so just let it evaporate be nice if it was a hot summer day or just sit out and evaporate but um here i got to add some heat to it because it's so cold out today but i'll show you what it looks like once it's finished evaporating okay okay guys so i just came back from outside i just finished showing you the juice your tube here that's got all the waste in here make sure you get this outside and dispose of it outdoors because this stuff's still full of fumes coming off here it's still very ignitable because because your pulp here is holding butane so make sure you don't just throw this in your garbage can and uh forget about it and throw your smoke there or something so always make sure you get rid of it okay i'm taking this outside all right guys so i got it down to this much here it's not completely all gone that's still butane in there in that but what i like to do is at this point here i like to i like to pour mine into some parchment paper like this and let it finish evaporating so i don't have to scrape so much out of here so whatever evaporates in here i'll have to scrape out and put in there yet also so i'm just going to let this evaporate now there's not much left there so it's won't take very long so once this is evaporated and i scrape that off put it in here i'll show you guys it going in the vacuum oven to make shatter okay you can pour this on a slick pad also that they sell and that i sell with my kit um i just i just like parchment paper that's all versus slicks pads some people like slick pads more so it's all just preference and choice okay stick with me i'll clean this up and we'll go from there so we we uh emptied out the the bowl this was uh corning where it um what's the pyrex is it's all the same pyrex corning were pretty much the same just glass but anyways i scraped it out and poured it out scraped it out this is what it looks like right now so i decided i'm going to make this into a batch of shatter so this now has to go inside a vacuum chamber with some heat i'm gonna take you to my vacuum chamber and put it in there and show you okay stick around [Music] [Applause] [Music] so here's that extraction we did with the green machine okay it wasn't a very big batch it was uh i don't know what i used maybe an ounce and a half something like that so it's got to go in this vacuum oven now i got it set at just below 36.8 which is below 100 and uh we're gonna put it in there with the vacuum pump going so i gotta close this chamber up open the valves turn on the pump and close the air all right you see all the vacuums going up here starting to suck vacuum now you got to keep an eye on the inside you got to keep an eye on the inside because because you got to watch those bubbles don't get too big they're going to start to rise in there a little bit i guess you could see that pretty good with that light on it so we'll see what happens you see how they're starting to react already in there if they go down that's a good thing say sometimes you get such a big dome in there it can hit the sides you can see at the back of my oven that i've hidden uh hitting before back there see so see how it's starting to puff up now well that that puffing up when you got a lot in there that puffing up can get so big that it'll hit the sides of your oven you don't want that but the little batch i got in i think it's just going to rise up so high and then fall back down [Applause] we'll see what it does it's almost on full vacuum see the needle here [Applause] just about a full vacuum and if you look inside look at that bubble as long as there's room for it to expand it's okay but if you run out of room in there you gotta you can give it some air like this i'll show you watch that bubble it'll go down when i give it some air see that so you want to try to keep it closed if you can sorry look at that this [ __ ] all this [ __ ] all go back back down flat once uh once it's been in there a while pancake will go down and it'll all start to look better and smoothen out and look clearer it's still still a pretty big puppy right pad right now see that but it is slowly working its way down already as you can see slowly and it'll it'll clear up more and more so we're just going to let it go like this now for until till tomorrow morning and then i'll check it and uh i'll flip the pad over tomorrow morning and let it go a little longer so i think it's absolutely clean okay so i'll uh catch up with you guys soon i'll show you the finished product once it's done tomorrow sometime all right guys thanks for coming back so uh whole night's gone by now it's been uh it's about 17 18 hours since i've had this in the vacuum chamber and uh i'm going to open it up and let's have a look at this okay so i'm going to release the air the pump's off already i've had it sitting with the pump off but under [Music] pressure you guys i want to stress once again you know when you're making when you're making any uh honey oil or or shatter here or crumb or whatever you want to call it make sure you give it long enough and you get all that butane out okay because it's not safe if you're going to leave butane in the product after you extract all right so there's that uh little slab it's kind of hard to touch right out of the oven i had this sitting at about 95 uh for the temperature so um yeah i don't know what else to tell you but hope this was uh helpful to you and you're gonna do extracting make sure you take it outside and do it safe you're working with butane it's dangerous so um order the machine from johnny's the green machine and you can do it the safe and easy way and you can end up with some nice product like that so take care thanks for watching i'm gonna run you into my crop and show you the final crop i got it at the eight week mark i thought i'd let you have a little peek at that so come on with me so i ended up that i'm just about done this crop here i'm i'm flushing it right now it's been it's over eight weeks um i i don't want to say it's you know it's an average one i've done better i've done worse and that's the way she goes you know it was cold cold conditions i was dealing with i have had some of these damn bugs these little aphids and they kind of played with me for quite a while here but it's coming to an end things are getting nice and fat some of these buds are beauties besides a little bit of bugs and stuff but they're nice and ripe they look good you know like i said could have been better i mean i was also fighting this crop with my ph level for some reason that usually stays pretty level with me but i had to add so much ph down steady all the time it's but it is what it is so uh yeah i'm gonna flush this for i give it a full two weeks of straight water i i i go for about three days and then i put new water in again i go for three days i put new water in my ppm in the in the reservoirs right now is at about 200. so it's getting down there from from food strength that can be anywhere from a thousand to fourteen hundred so i'm down to 200 right now the water i start with is always usually at about 30 ppm on the ppm pen so it's still got a little bit of food in there i'm hoping one more week and it's it's pretty much flushed out of it that'll be two full weeks then it'll be cut down cure it bag it and enjoy it so thanks for watching guys keep the green thumbs up and we'll talk to you soon take care check out the grow room sunglasses and the eye loop magnifier you can find these two items and all your extraction essentials at www dot johnny's green extractions dot ca she looks like [Music] that's just what you found [Music] [Applause] boys [Music] sliding", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope you enjoyed the video, and thanks for joining us .We really look forward to seeing you again.", "bYQ48pJqLuQ": "hello everybody welcome to another great episode of strange city um today sorry madam today we're gonna be smoking on a good little variety here of this concentrate and I just I like going over concentrate because it is a new thing and people really know about cannabis already they know about the flower they know about weed and what it all is but not a lot people know about concentrate and concentrate is just like if you're gonna take an olive and squishing squishing squish it and get olive oil out it's the same concept except we apply heat some solvents and sometimes it's solvent Liss so it just really depends on what you're getting what type it is and that's what I'm gonna go over this but people you know not in Colorado and not in a legal state that can get this kind of stuff or even knows what it is that they can be careful and that they can they can understand what this is and that it's not crack it's not heroin it's not anything like that and I kind of get the sense that people think that because sometimes you need a torch to smoke cousin just no concentrate and you don't really need that we've got our email set up which is an electronic mail a lot of people know what these are some people don't it's an electronic mail it has a titanium coil and it wraps around a titanium nail let's see if I can get these separated here so yes this is my email what it is is a type this is my titanium nail and what it does is this part is wrapped around a center see if we can get yeah you guys can see where that little hole is and right in that ring where there's not the hole is where I put my mic concentrate or you know my man I like to call it my medicine because I actually do smoke for medical purposes so one by one will slowly go over what these all are I have wax I have shatter my co2 so this is gonna be I'm not sure visit I would call this an oil so I've got an oil or shatter in a wax so without further ado this wax this is gonna be a wax now wax can be anywhere from clay light consistency to a buttery like you know play-doh like consistency you know from a hard clay to a really soft play-doh so this one right here specifically is platinum blueberries so the color and the name don't really correlate all the time but that kind of shows you guys kind of what wax is like it kind of has a see if I can get a good it's kind of it's kind of chunky I tried to break some rock but that's not gonna be able to see that too well so we've got a wax that's kind of buttery like and kind of play-doh like consistency alright and this is this is really good for like bait pins anything like that I enjoy it butter and stuff more in bait pens and stuff I don't really vape at all of them so this is gonna be another wax just to kind of show you guys this one's a little bit harder consistency and a little bit more grainy but you guys can probably get the gist of what I'm talking about a little explaining it correctly so those are waxes I'm gonna move to a shadow which has a more glass like consistency to it and a shinier and is more solid I guess in a form so this is shatter and this is very beautiful shatter at that this is another name is cuz my favorite critical mass that's what it is it's my favorite strain this is very good for pain this is a very high CBD count compared to other strains so I'm honestly gonna be taking a DAB to this first - tbh you guys but this stuff is really really beautiful I'll go ahead and give you another little there's through the song but I do enjoy all different types so chatter is more glass like and more and more hard I guess a more hard and harder my girl might be so mad right now and then harder and it's consistency and it's glassy that's the best I can put it is pretty much like glass or like plastic you're gonna snap it it's gonna break so this stuff it's in a syringe and a syringe dumping needles crack down on all that chronic crap so this right here is full of you can kind of see it's got a shim not shimmery but it's kind of an amber e color mmm this right here is a used one obviously but it only comes with a gram of concentrate in it and this is made with co2 so the difference this is an oil so if I if I do this with it it's gonna this little string of oil come out and that's in that soil so you've got oil which is really runny now we've got shatter which is glassy and hard and we've got wax which is play-doh light consistency is the best way to put it so that is a run around of all of not all of the types but a good mix of the types of concentrates the consistencies they don't really change like live resin can be shatter YX come you know oil it can be all of those so the the main ones are gonna be oil wax and shatter until you get into like the crystal lines and in the crystal it and that kind of stuff so that's a that's a crystal and I would still call that shatter at that so with that being said we'll take a DAB for you guys what do you need to mean you need a ver Cheers oh well guys I appreciate you watching enjoy", "ot5mau5VYSY": "[Music] all right what's going on you guys so I stopped by a cure leaf earlier today and they finally came out with a product that I've been waiting to see for them for a while now shatter so I was pretty excited to see them come out with this product a lot of the dispensaries are still you know working on getting you know to where they can sell shatter and stuff like that they have to apply to this date it's a whole fun process right now but they finally have shatter on the shelves in select locations here in Florida and you should start to see it on all the shelves and the cure leaves here pretty soon so we're going to vape some of this out of a rig and if you guys don't know what shatter is you sure will by the end of the video so stick around and let's check it out [Music] so it looks pretty good I mean I see maybe a couple of plant lipids in it that is causing that grainy effect it will cause some of the THC molecules to bind to the plant lipids that's left behind and so not bad for their first run though looks pretty nice [Music] all right so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna weigh the shatter and see if it's all there I've got it out of the glass jar if you guys would like to know how to get it out of the glass door like that I've got another video on that but let's see right now all the shatter is here all right we're already out of gram so it looks like we have a little bit extra 1.2 total awesome stuff so we have some extra there that was really nice of them so we have a little bit extra so let's try it out you guys this looks like some pretty good product for their first go not too bad and just so you guys know the shatter is totally safe to smoke like this this is simply THC a molecules binding to some of the extra lipids and fastest in the shatter some people actually like when the shatter Sugar's up like this because it tends to give off more flavor sometimes and I've actually noticed myself that this seems to happen more with sativa streams here let me show you guys a picture from truly this is a picture of super Silver Haze shatter from truly [Music] one reason this can happen is that some strains are just naturally higher in lipids and other strains and will eventually tend to sugar up alright so let's go ahead and dab some of this it's been a really long time since I've had strawberry cuffs so I'm pretty excited to try this strain got a nice dab here it's about the size of maybe two pieces of rice or so [Music] all right you guys so everything you've seen so far was filmed over the last couple of days and I enjoyed the cured leaf chatter so much that I went back and I got two more frozen check out the Strawberry Cough is really good and I got another strain here for us to check out I picked up another Strawberry Cough but first let's go ahead and take another hit of this stuff [Music] it's sweet with a little bit of earthy flavor to it the first time I smoked it it was like literally inhaling strawberries but this is a concentrate and you know you get some different flavors out of concentrate so but I was really surprised by was how much it actually reminded me of Strawberry Cough the first time I had it like ten years ago it's just it's very similar to that strain that phenotype that I had a business strawberry cause so like I said I got another Strawberry Cough that we'll check out here and just compare it to the other one that we had and I also got another strain first 48 this looks really nice as well - this actually looks like some of the shatter you can get it truly the numbers are a little better on it - coming in at a total of seventy six point three percent let's check it out [Music] all right so that looks pretty good now let's check out the Strawberry Cough we got and compared to the other so what is shattered well shatter is a canvas concentrate known as a Pho extract which stands for butane hash basically they use butane to wash the bud and stripping of the THC in the terpenes it then undergoes refinement processes to give what we know as shatter co2 and ethanol it can also be used as well to achieve this process that looks even better than the first batch so I'm gonna try some of this first 48 out here this looks really nice I like the color on that some nice shatter just breaks apart real nice too [Music] [Music] Wow duh orange blossom really shows through [Music] the first Fortier is a mix between the white and orange blossom trails which really shows through in that shadow you can really get I get orange II and earthy this is some pretty nice shatter I mean this is actually really good and I'm enjoying it just as much as I would something from truly which I I just didn't really expect from pure leaf you know I I wasn't really a big fan of some of their first products and I haven't gone there too many times I didn't go there once a while back and I did get some distillate though that was actually one of the best distillate I never had and I haven't seen him back there since then but I got it one time and that was it his stuff was literally crystal clear I mean clear like water it was as thick as you know any other distillate that you'd get anywhere but it was as clear as water and it was some of the best distillate I had ever had you guys ever find that stuff I definitely recommend picking it up it was a ninety percent a hybrid I believe she's really good I'll take another dab of this I really like it I I know I like it better than the shatter from like I haven't been back for the shadow firm move since the beginning of the year now I love all of moves other products except their shattered there's just some about there shatter that is it messed with my lungs that every time I did get I got four or five times and it was just kind of heavy on my lungs and I would didn't care for it so I just have been back for their shatter so I definitely like it more than that [Music] so what did you guys think which one of these would you smoke let me know down in the comments below you can pick this up at your local key relief for $60 a gram I hope the video helped you guys out and we'll see you next time [Music]", "nYoCyCch2t0": "[Music] extracted marijuana concentrates have become one of the most popular forms of ingesting cannabis at the clinic we primarily stock three forms of BHO or butane hash oil produced by our expert extraction team at the lab these include butter shatter and live resin batter let's take a closer look at these three forms of concentrated cannabis products butter is a form of BHO that has an opaque warm taffy light quality this concentrate is created by extracting the cannabinoids and terpenoids ride and cured it is an oleoresin which following extraction is agitated over low heat to allow the solvent to evaporate creating a wax like non transparent extract this agitation causes THC a which is solid at room temperature to precipitate from the rest of the oil and crystallize butter has a reasonably high terpene profile as it is processed using low temperatures to preserve these sensitive flavor compounds shatter is a clear glass light concentrate that contains no bubbles and snaps at room temperature it is difficult to make due to its low heat requirement and length of time required in a vacuum oven to purge it of its solvent in shatter the cannabinoids terpenes and waxes are all mixed together in one phase and in a way that allows light to pass through the molecular structure the terpene content is typically lower in shatter as heat and vacuum contribute to the evaporation of compounds however the visual appeal of the product tends to supersede its flavor life resin batter is a terpene rich concentrate created by freezing and extracting the whole cannabis flower immediately after harvest this process preserves all the cannabinoids and turpentine the plant because the cannabis has not been dried or cured prior to extraction fewer terpenes have a chance to evaporate or degrade as a result the end product has a much stronger flavor profile because live resin contains higher levels of these liquid terpenes the final extraction tends to be more viscous than butter or shatter if you're curious for more information on cannabis concentrates or which extraction might work well for your needs please talk to your friendly budtender at the clinic today", "AVeX6kRJQqA": "[Music] hey you welcome to my cush review at juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with bc king white widow shatter so let's check this out and do a nice big dab and give it a thorough review of the look taste and account so it's my first time actually trying the bc king kind if you can't see over there i've done a lot of the hug and every other kind so let's check out the bc king look i ripped it open like a monster can't even be civilized all right so let's get it out of here so it looks like it's really sticky i must it must have been stored in a warm area my bad but it still smells delicious and it looks good so it just melted all over the wrapper that was probably my fault because i waited so long to review it but it's all good check it out so i can't hold it up too much or it's going to fall out looks like a slime note so as you can see it has a really nice orange texture to it texture it looks very nice it has a very nice strong smell very strong pine smell to it actually so i've had a few other shatters that smelt kind of piney and they tasted very good so this one hopefully will as well got me nice and still himself let's light up the bow and take a nice big dab and then give it more of a thorough review there we go we got a nice grab on there hopefully you can see it let's light this up got the torch make sure that it's hot enough don't want to waste it though it should be good let's get it so just like the smell the taste is really citrusy it tastes really lemony but it tastes very good so it does have a very good taste so if i had to store it i should have put it in the fridge next time i put it in the fridge it's my fault how i stored it but it is still a very good shatter and it says the effects is happy uplifted relaxed and the flavors earthy woody and pungent i tasted more citrusy kind of lemony to be honest but i kind of do taste the earthy woodness a little bit but i find more of like a citrus taste to it but it is a very nice taste very nice shatter i do feel pretty good just off of the one hit i have to be honest so the taste i'll give it a nice four out of five for taste because it did taste very nice it's little i got it a little messed up like i said i think it's the way i stored it but that's on me so i'll give the bc king concentrates white widow an overall rating of four i just got to be careful of storing it next time so with that i guess i'll leave it there i hope y'all are doing good and have a good night and i hope y'all got some good [ __ ] to smoke at home y'all have a good one peace", "cusrXgscKvY": "hello senior stoner fan just a real senior stoner back at you and this afternoon I want to get back to business today we're gonna talk about concentrates we're gonna talk about things that are stronger than regular flour things that you could add to a bowl things that you can put into a joint things that you can dab with we're gonna talk about all those things how they affect us and the different things we can do with them let's take it away let's go with something that we know this is THC distill it runs about 99% pure when it's clear like this you need to get it to be clear like this translucent not opaque you don't want it to be brown you don't want it to be you know where you can have like a color to it you want it to be yellow or clear THC distill it can be used a number of different ways we can put it in our dab machines we can put it right on top of a bowl in a pipe we can roll it in a joint I like to line the inside of a paper with it this is THC distill it runs about anywhere from 40 to 90 dollars a gram that would be a thousand milligrams that is THC distill it the next thing and this is not an order of my favorites or anything I'm just picky enough to talk about this is THC diamond THC a diamonds which I have contracted for me in large quantities and these are very special these are gorilla glue number four and you've seen these before from me and keep them in large quantities because I use them a number of different ways obviously use them in add a break either the puffs go peek the Carta or now the new hora I also use them in an electronic pen I also use them not on a bowl but sprinkled on top of the joint the Jimmy joint includes THCA diamonds the next thing I want to talk about is something that I got from mrs. stoner sativa shatter this is more of a sauce than it is a shatter not a hard shatter smells pretty good let's take a look at it I think the strain is called penny wise but yesterday I made mrs. stoner about a dozen Jimmy joints sativa and I took this on a DAB spoon and then spread it onto the paper kind of like you spread fudge inside of a baking pan or something like that so this is shatter okay next on our list we're gonna talk about something I already mentioned to you all and this is dosey doe THC diamonds very nice smell and a darker color some of the extraction methods that the growers and the producers use yield a darker color there's more impurities in the darker color then there isn't a lighter color we'll see that shortly you saw that minor yellow golden these are kind of brown let's go to a set of Cinderella gram of Cinderella 99 by slam pig extracts these are pretty you might even be able to see the crystals glistening on these lighter color not an orange color very pure I really like the way they came out slammed pig extracts and the strain is Cinderella 99 next this is make America glob again make America glob again Girl Scout cake live rosin one to two PO full-spectrum hash Rossum County cultivators is who it's made by let's take a look at it oh it smells tasty really smells like sauce like my THC diamonds and sauce it's not gonna be as harsh rosin tends to be less harsh when you smoke it then the diamond is do well I've had this before but let's take a look at it again this is sugar wax called Wonka burry buy organic goods a very very top-flight supplier in Maine Wow look at this now it's a darker okay the darker keep that in mind a lot of this sugar wax is darker you're gonna get sugar wax that's Blonde Redhead brunette but you're not gonna get the white you're not gonna get this from sugar wax not gonna get that color and you're not gonna get this glistening this you can watch the shine you can almost reflect off of you on these diamonds look at the light how it hits it in that incredible - shame I'm light on diamonds these days but it's really only the ring I'm light on because I'm rolling Jimi joints with all of this in it I'm really taking a full spectrum approach to my Jimi joints so hope you liked this discussion about white diamonds about make America glob again about THCA diamonds about dosey doe live resin diamonds about sugar wax about Wonka burry sugar wax and about distill it message me if you have any questions a lot of this can be put into edibles I talked to people about this you know what the suppliers I deal with them their opinion is it's a very expensive way to make edibles they're saying this to me and I'm sure they're saying it from a commercial perspective but this certainly can go into anything and I am going to start experimenting with the diamonds let's say small amounts in edibles I'm going to decarbonise them but right now I want to convey all this nice information to everybody I hope it helped this is the real senior stoner everybody have a great day out there and keep on smoking", "WsLW4rqgs50": "what is up guys I am the 4/20 gamer and today we're gonna be reviewing this clear shatter from Queen of Hearts it's a mimosa clear shatter here is a wonderful budget product that I got locally and today we're just gonna be reviewing it giving you guys a good idea of what you get with this purchase

chin so this chatter comes in a basic glossy envelope with their logo a queen of hearts in the front with that gold foil for the crown and also for a little girl so almost like a holographic yukio card on the back is that Queen of Hearts logo and a sticker to tell you exactly what you're getting inside very basic product we're gonna go ahead and open this so inside get a parchment paper with a concentrate in the center as you can see I used a lot of it so this is not going to be a blind tasting I've been really liking this product thought I share with you guys first thing you notice when you open up this parchment paper is just how clear this concentrate is it's a nice light golden color and I'm like on the yellow side it's very stable and almost glass like exactly what you expect from a shatter and in terms of looks this thing gets a solid 4.5 out of 5 pretty decent looking product let's talk about the genetics and terpenes mimosa is a cross between Clementine and purple punch this hybrid is known for its fruit punch and citrusy aroma the three main terpenes that you would find in mimosa are mersin pining and limonene so I expect to smell and taste something herbal piney and citrusy we're gonna go ahead analyze the smell a little bit yeah because it's so stable like in cold in here you can't really smell it so I'm gonna go ahead and warm it between my fingers a bit release some that smell you get a hint of the citrus and a little bit of the sweetness but overall you can't really smell it too well so in terms of smell I'll give this thing a 3.5 out of 5 pretty decent smell let's go ahead and taste this thing now you see I've broken off a pretty healthy sized dab I'm gonna be using it out of my puff go peak on the green if you don't know what the puff peak is it's a portable electronic dab rake one of my favorite devices that I own [Music] in terms of flavor first thing you notice is the sweet citrus taste of the strain very typical of what you expect from a mimosa very good very delicious vibrant in terms of taste I would give this strain a 4.7 out of five mimosa is definitely one of my favorite tasting strains of all time and this mimosa is definitely fair emoji so in terms of effects I give this thing another 4.5 right away you can definitely feel the tension in the back of your head very classic of a sativa type of effect here's something that is perfect for that mood boost that you've been looking for this strain is good for like depression and good for daytime activities just going out doing something you want to be two days there stun and this would be a perfect product for that situation so overall this little s that gets a 4.7 out of five it is definitely pretty good and if you had the chance to try it I would definitely try this one this is the Queen of Hearts the most clear cheddar that wraps up the string review portion of this video now I'm just gonna talk about what I have in store for you guys you

that we would combine both the YouTube subscribers and the we tube subscribers and call that the goal honestly let me tell you guys the true reason why you know I haven't revealed myself yet the true reason is honestly because of privacy being a Asian person I'm Asian in this community brings with it so much stigma we were taught at a very young age how to think about it what to think about it so that's basically why I'm like deathly terrified being judged basically specifically my family I'm really afraid of being judged by them thank you guys so much for watching my video this has been a quick sesh and review of this Queen of Hearts the most shatter definitely something pretty cool pretty worth it if you have the opportunity to try this product definitely try it and please come back

just got a larger what's your name water soda bottle but you need water don't worry I got it so we already went ahead and made a hold inside the cap so the whole point of this is to put this in here like so like so so that way when you push it down in the water you just like take it out and right now we're putting water in the larger in the larger soda bottle and we're gonna give you a review

there it cut in half off and doing it like that within their pool doing that was pretty dope but we heard it by the maker of raw and so we were like we're gonna go ahead and try it well it's definitely tities citrusy you could taste it I taste the citrus flavors definitely that comes through like definitely tell it's burning funny Oh so it's burning a little funny so we're gonna have to

me and you take advantage man weed of use medical marijuana purposes only I'm a licensed card holder for that gotta go all right guys it's dad time serious session time we're definitely getting medicated um I've got some serious dabs it's down here in corner better Spencer in Bristol Connecticut 135 East Main Street um I happen to be screwing on the menu and I'm like holy [ __ ] there's minute series dad's in there a good selection of concentrates right now um if aunt scrubs happy to talk about the whole bunch concentrates on their plate dumped awful which concentrates CPS dumped off whole bunch concentrates and it's kind of where it's at right now but there's a decent amount of concentration if you're looking to do some dabs I happen to go with an advanced grown-up strain which is a very high power indica which is something I really need honestly but my last couple days I mean Laura is stressed out it's just been some of things and I honestly was slacking on the sandakan which I probably should have been putting my body Oh Oh a few days ago to be honest with you um so what I doubt was the Starkiller strain I think it's called the indie call H as far as the CTAP name goes but it's a star killer the star killer is the Skywalker og across with the rear dankness number two so we can Skywalker og across ridiculous time to superpower at full indica I'm really good for like anxiety and stress and all that good [ __ ] and I mean I said I'm actually a much better state than it was a couple days ago like it wasn't good but yeah I was smoking a lot of weed I was [ __ ] doing my dad's I was in a shitload of that brick Simpson oil so I'm kind of really bumping the mood off and now alright the point where I'm actually enough these have to go present myself to the world and I'm gonna do some desk yeah so yeah here it is yeah yeah it's the indie call H but look at this look at the th she comes 91 percent THC that's why you knew she was gonna be some fire oh it smells like it's gonna kind of just lean down to rest inside this container it's bursting a hit my God why away it was literally like there was like a skunk just chilling alright so let's check this [ __ ] out together I'm Anna I'm gonna do miss Bev okay so here it is it smells local dad Matt and put the charade on here yes here we go advance draw labs we got the let me call each this she was just packaged on 23rd sauce relatively fresh meat was nothing to me there it is I should clean look at that and this [ __ ] so can you correctly see being invisible look good that's nice there's some real clean as [ __ ] Hey okay for example how clean there you easily read what's behind it we go for good so you know when your medications totally see it's really tight you can have some fine ass meds okay so this [ __ ] was like $30 for the half gram and again I always like to personally heat it up if I namely consistency sometimes he had this chatter enough in your fingers you can malleable you play with it a little bit stretch it out kind of stick yourself and then there's two other shatters which is black hard look you think this is and it is what it is okay so let's just kind of check yourself I mean I think pretty solid yeah yeah it's pretty solid so it's like that I mean there's a couple things you can do with it when you stamp off piece okay boom good snapped off piece now we can also do snap off your session well yeah cut that up a little bit now that's gonna be like to break it up hold back here they like to fatty super fatty babs this you can definitely snap off again and then I would say I could probably stretch Milo's to little chunks into to nice nap I'm gonna take this cat right here this little piece right here right I'm just gonna find a [ __ ] smear it on a little bit smear it up stretch it snap it play with it speed are they hmm you see I'm just a semi semi working here again I keep snapping it but snaps a little prematurely but see so now kind of what I got this little piece right there it's old dad shot the [ __ ] down piece over here it's up there shut that [ __ ] down so that's kind of how I do it so that's kind of like what I got as well down there they so bad there any little shirts are cleaning like I said you can do any way we want it's kind of what I do I kind of like pretty plain my whole life out and I kind of just set my dad's up you know what we're doing that's it so there's my two tabs that I'm gonna be at Medicaid mercenary shadow for later and I I like like shader do I wish you'd saw a bigger slabs like I think like better plant sound those ounce ounce containers a wheat I think it would be cool if they sold like like three and a half grams slabs and [ __ ] shattered Oh Joris been [ __ ] a couple bucks on something get a big old piece of shatter do some tabs like I am a Cpl people would buy that [ __ ] you know the price point but I think it would work so that's time to consider your pieces is shattered for us patients would be nice um okay so again I got these two pieces are yep it's stuck in my diver so your dad number one big piece right there oh there goes to have to warn the floor hey wait [Applause] all right so I'm let that cool down for a second but uh I do what I do want to address that uh eats pretty awesome right yeah weed man that's dis dad let me trying to work in this hole how long do you wait to do it day - and I can't forget a [ __ ] up what is with this Wow [ __ ] awesome there's a well it's really effective medicine all right that literally like gives you the chills for a second and then he kind of just freeze up and you gotta kind of like really kind of we kind of like consider what the [ __ ] was just going on in your life definitely change your day right around holy [ __ ] oh my god I love shattered she's so [ __ ] bone um again this is another fantastic strain if you're dealing with like like you need like instant stopping power made to [ __ ] stress coeliac oh that's just instantly I'm giggling and laughing instantaneously wicked medicated Oh something we should get big slabs of this [ __ ] matches little [ __ ] tiny pieces we need a big a slab this [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] we could have you on my body the taste was delicious was super hash and skunky you know the rear dankus always got that weakened weird odd flavor which you can definitely get a lot of in this and I just you feel it behind your face makes you wanna [ __ ] smile and giggle for some reason this is great oh we can we can affect the medicine this is a good good good shatter pack all right all right work that's all good now super-boeing indica so if you're looking for a really really high power nikka looks good like black in the couch making within that [ __ ] all night do that [ __ ] all night it's the break you might want to take it [ __ ] all night long trust me you need me you're not gonna want to [ __ ] I don't know about you is please okay Medicaid [Applause]", "k7Zryii5NIE": "this is a follow-up video on the live run so before I get started I went ahead and made some changes to this because I had the wire hanger go over the corners of this because the front plate like this broke off so I wasn't able to put a hanger through there but I did find a little tab on the back side that I could slide the hanger in front of it actually is removable but I need my players I don't really I don't think I have oh here we go but it comes out it's from the plate is removable so if this shorts out or anything I can change it easily just put some new plates on it all right so all right so I here I have just over a ground before you get started I always like to squish it through so it doesn't slide around when I'm pressing it so I'll just go ahead and before it's turned on it's not hot and the nice little talk like that might even just press these together [Applause] when I try and stick it these together and then I'm gonna turn this off after all right so what I have here is just some parchment paper make sure it's parchment paper and that wax paper all right so I got you squished together let me see what a good there we go nice and frosty all right so you want to make sure you got all the debris off of the parchment paper that'll be in your roster what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it on this side and then I'm going to probably squeeze it squish it about 2:1 once the two more times turn this on first I'll let it warm up and I will get back to you guys when it's warmed up all right guys I'm back and it's all heated up we're good to go so I just put that right there in the middle close to the edge and I want to put it all the way at the edge because I want to get you guys a shot of it through the side seeing all those good juices fall out so I wanted to do just realize I made a left-handed vise grip press all right so get it in there push it towards the back yeah let me see if I can focus into that all right you just keep pressing you hear some sizzling might that go on for a little bit you actually can see someone coming out right there it's bubbling all right and then release that was a good one and as you can see right there this works just as good as the real deal and I can probably squish this about once more looks like I got a lot of it so I'll go ahead and do that are you guys here I'm gonna do another close-up of the Rosen oops snapped this one's a little longer it's gonna sizzle and then you're gonna see some coming out on the edges squeeze a little bit more and then release there's really no timing for this I mean pretty much the school by ear line as you go if you haven't done this before all right so I'm gonna throw this in the freezer real quick and then I'll just try to get it all stuck together then I'll show you guys once it's a hardened alright I'm back again and I'll just show you this real quick a little close-up on this the Nugget that I pressed you can see some oil this is gonna be left behind you know can't really help that it's just a little bit though this is not completely done though you can actually probably press this one more time and after it's brown and decarboxylated you'll be able to you can just pretty much eat this like a chip grind it up put it in some coffee I mean look at a lake at least a little high depending on how much you ingest cannabis so I did go ahead and I threw this in the freezer for about 30 seconds and the dial on hot plates was about at a 10 to 15 so about half way you can see that this is a nice golden color this is right here is the first one and you can see how just [ __ ] gorgeous this is it is a bit warming a show it is still kind of gooey but I threw it in the freezer so I could hurt it a little bit when I scrape it this down here is the second round not bad at all for just over your grand all right so I am gonna scrape this and I will get back to you guys so in order to make this easier for you guys what you're gonna want to do is put a little bit of water and a baggie freeze it and then put the parchment paper on top of that baggie and start scraping it's going to make it a whole lot easier it's going to come up with ease thank you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed it and you any questions or comments comment down below", "uqw4zaca96w": "what's up everybody nobody can drop in our audio here I heard test another

with the crescendo symphony s1 version two and as you can see right here here is the box this is the 1500 watt mono block amplifier this is the version 2 and heard of the description this one is strictly made for bass we went over those details in the previous video if I remember I'll link it in the description below but I wanted to actually have a detailed gut shot of this one all this is the gut shot that everybody loves to see when it comes to amplifiers and the main reason is is if you can see right here there is significant damage to the back plate or the bottom plate and I'll get a close-up shot as best I can because I'm still getting used to wearing this head strap for the GoPro knowing which way to go and angles and all that but you can clearly see that rather than being a flush let me show you the other side how it's supposed to look that's how it's supposed to look and this hat actually looks right here now I have sent a message to JP at down for sound and as you can see right here I've got to go up or down up or as you can see right here there is a significant Bend and that back off a little bit maybe that'll help and there we go but I shouldn't be able to get my finger under there to flick that it's supposed to be flush and actually countersink is the proper term I should be using it should be countersink down in there but before we do the actual gut shot of this amplifier one thing I want to show everyone and this is something that is important especially if people want to go with oversized wire and most people that want 100 percent of capacity out of amplifiers doesn't have to be this one it could be any of them that have the insert terminals into the amplifier is zero gauge to whatever gauge that you have summer to summer for summer six summer eight and if they have these type of terminals these adapters are awesome as far as being able to get zero gauge to whatever gauge you need this one being four we went from zero to four gauge and I've already backed off with the Allen now to here's something else let me go ahead and show you this here's the allen keys that are provided you have the speaker lead allen for this and you have the power and ground and remote Allen here neglected to show that in the last video whenever I was going over the pieces and parts now I've already backed off one the screw itself the turn screw and let's go ahead and just show you that this inserts with ease don't have to force it there's a lot of slack see right here and wiggle it around try to get a close up best I can all right and then let's tighten this down and this is there gonna be the tricky part tightening it down and I'm not gonna try to get overly fancy with this but I want to try to give you a side angle of how this actually fits into the power station right here and how it's almost dang they're flush as far as its concerned now this does have plenty of slack to where you could instead of using this you could use a four gauge ferrule insert if you just want to use four gauge wire which is we're gonna try it both ways I ordered the four gauge wire got the four gauge wire in or cable however you want to say it and we're gonna use that and only order four feet and I've said in the last video it seems like that they gave me extra and they did add extra onto the footage and I do appreciate that I guess that's a big plus because cables and pieces and parts and what-have-you this stuff adds up more in my opinion in a lot of ways than actually getting the equipment itself I don't know how many people out there agree with that disagree with that but let's just think about it this plus the ring adapters that was like I don't know fifteen sixteen dollars right here for this the LED light ten bucks the top post distribution block that I bought forty four dollars and the this just goes on you know you cut the the cable you buy that the the big three upgrade hundred and ten dollars for twenty feet of cable ring terminals what-have-you which actually in my opinion is not a bad deal and the list goes on so yeah that stuff right there is like well yeah you got a nice amplifier now do you worn it in the car and do you want to work in so here we go let's go ahead and take this amplifier and very gently take these screws off of here and let me try to get the best angle that I can and yes I have a towel down because I do not want this amplifier to be damaged anymore scratched up scarred up marred up scuffed or whatever then it already is on this bottom plate so we have our just right screwdriver here Philips head is what takes these out and we're gonna actually remove these and it looks like my tip is magnetized there yeah it is so this is a magnetized little screwdriver alright so here we go and what we're actually gonna do since it's bent that should be easy to do pop this up like that which it shouldn't be easy to do and let's actually have a side shot of this Bend that's very disappointing actually I hate that that happened yes it's just cosmetic but it's just the fact you spend $300 on something and it comes in jacked up I don't know now I know I could take a little mallet and probably wheel because I I did send the message to JP and said look if I got to replace the whole lamp I'll just deal with it and that's probably what I'm gonna do because I can lay another cloth over here take a rubber mallet and tap this down and flatten it back out but once again it's just disappointing to spend this much money on something and so inside here I'm just going to use the point method we do have the fan here which is got a long wire I don't know if I like that look at this I don't know if I like that sitting over here against these on the side yeah I don't know if I like that at all cuz that's kind of that's kind of whatever that stuff gets hot on the sides that's the heat dissipation if that gets too hot what you shouldn't but if that gets too hot yeah it might melt that wire we might have to see about just maybe leaving it like that or something I don't know oh wow that's way too long crescendo what's up with that Korea what's up with that but here we go I'm not gonna get all fancy and trying to say I know the names of everything in here these are your caps they do have now we'll go over it if I can see it 85 if I can see the voltage on these these are 3,300 UF I can't see the voltage as I say hero a hundred volt here it is that something right here alright so hunter volt caps right here big old beefy coil right here and here so yeah the innards of this actually quite impressive as far as this amplifier is concerned he's got a red board on it I kind of like that and you know what I might actually take this see if I can have a template made I don't know how this would be or how much it would cost to do this but an amplifier like this I might actually have to go and see about getting some acrylic for this amplifier if they can't replace the plate see I don't know how difficult that's gonna be but here is the gut shot let's just enjoy it no more negativity about this little cosmetic effect right here but they have this glued down very well on both of these here and here yeah that's kind of over go looking down on the side of there man wow that's a lot of glue this ain't going anywhere for vibration say god yes that's overkill I think I'm just gonna leave this fan wire like that took to the side against this where it gets really hot I don't think that that's that's a good idea that wires way too long so crescendo if y'all happen to watch this that wire could be half that long just to plug into here now I understand if somebody wants to take it out they got a house lacking all that but unplug it first then take it out in my opinion screws on the outside anyway so that's just coming from a computer guy as far as cable management is concerned and all that that's where I'm at right now I'm just showing you as a computer person little critiques all right even like this right here I know that's probably got to be like that but you know the routing on wires inside of amplifiers sometimes I look at I was like why did they do that they could have went that way or this way or that way and anybody out there that knows me for computer bills knows what I'm talking about I like my stuff to be clean and yeah here we go so the Tiffany style RCA jacks what I was saying earlier about how most have the inputs with the wires coming out of them these do not this actually does not have that these are just blocks for your inputs all right for here and this is output so I'm assuming since this has input and output that these could be daisy chained and linked together so there you go like if I wanted to get another one of these and add it to the system you know left/right inputs here it's gonna give me a mono signal and then the outputs out to another app and there we go heck yeah I like that I didn't even notice that before once a game will give you a little close-up shot we have since this is a straight base amplifier it's gonna have you gained your subsonic filter low-pass from 35 to 250 Hertz and the bass boost which not really gonna mess with that zero to dine DB on that so there we go let's have another look at the guts of this crescendo s1 version 2 and I'm just gonna kind of rotate it around here slowly everybody gets some good profile shots of this yeah oh man I love it I love how heavy this thing is I mean goodness grab wish I had a scale I wish I had a scale to actually weigh it and I'm sure their specs online to tell us how much it weighs but I really love it it has got some weight and I'm sure most of that weight is in the actual body itself as you can see let's look at this angle right here the board sits up and it's got a lot of room in between here and you can see I don't know if you can actually see down on those dents but there's a gap in there and that also helps with heat distribution so very well done the board's not sitting flat against metal some of them don't put enough gap in their boards a you know as far as the heatsink is concerned on the sides and everything but crescendo well done well so now it's time for us to get this in the car now we have had a tropical storm blow through we were supposed to be done today this should have been in the car I didn't get this until late afternoon today and it is now Tuesday night I have to work super early in the morning weather permitting and humidity level because the humidity level is like 372 percent with 83 degrees outside which means you walk outside and you're instantly wet like you just jumped in a swimming pool no matter who you are so yeah we're not gonna be putting this in until the weather humidity level drops a little bit by Thursday Friday it's supposed to tentatively we'll get this in in the next week now that that's here weather is not working with us so not in a hurry but I'd love to see how it sounds and we'll do a sound check and I'll be sure and get some GoPro footage of before sound check at a certain volume swap over the amp and then get some more same volume once we dial it in and all that because I'm actually watch a few videos and refresh my memory on how to actually dial these in with a voltmeter there's a few things that you can actually do from the speaker leads and what-have-you from these motor block amps with the voltmeter and maybe we'll make a video on that so that I could share that same knowledge with everybody out there all right so I may edit there it's a craft of the mind go out there and have some fun everybody and if you like car audio like you like computers and gaming and all that stick around cuz I'm gonna have more woo", "klKPQT801aA": "[Music] what is going on everybody welcome back to the channel pines trees a 21 and over medical cannabis review channel out of the state of pennsylvania what is going on everybody back at it with part two of well yesterday's video i got two half grams of organic remedies shatter and this is the other one um yes yesterday's video or the last video i guess i should say we had tangie on the table it was pretty good for 30 bucks a half gram not too bad um the price is right obviously at 30 bucks for a half gram uh the flavor kind of light but it was there it was present it wasn't absent there was definitely tangy flavor um the effects were good thc was in the 80 it had terps so couldn't complain right so what do we have today today we have an old strain that they renamed it's like a rebranding or maybe they just couldn't afford i don't know the licensing to call it the actual name but today what we have on the table is organic remedies black widow sounds a lot like something from back in the day right sounds a lot like white widow one of you know a really good strain from the 90s and 2000s and that is exactly what this is this is white widow rebranded renamed black widow [Music] so let's get into the numbers and the terps and and let's take a hit and talk about it so potency we have thc 4.20 percent thc a 78.382 cbda 0.166 percent cbn six five 0.065 cbg three zero point three seven four percent and cbc 0.086 percent [Music] so that puts us in like 83 84 right that ain't bad 84 percent let's get into the terps we got karyophiline 0.593 beta immerse 0.819 beta pine [Music] 0.158 pining 0.262 lenovo 0.143 busy bolo 0.062 cumulene 0.203 and triphenylene [Music] 0.149 percent so it's got a little bit of terps not too bad not too bad as usual i had i opened this one when i opened the last the other one the tangy i uh been smoking it saved a little bit for the review and honestly i'm really happy that i saved some because it is snowing like hell outside right now i ordered stuff from the dispensary at like 7am when i woke up not even thinking and then it started snowing and boom all the dispensaries they're not opening today so literally i have this uh chunk i have like an ounce of delta eight distillate and i have some flour inside of here but like i'm i'm in like dire straits at this point this is this is the lowest i get like i don't i don't run out you know i don't try to go low so the damn the damn snow screwed me that's ridiculous so i'm gonna make this last so i might not do a huge dab still gonna do a dab still gonna feel the effects and talk about it let's give it a whiff give it a whiff i will say this [Music] it's got that lemony limey like you know lemon lime spready kind of smell very light on the smell [Music] same with the flavor um but the effects are good and we got this because it was an indica we got the tangie because it was a sativa you want to try everything they have or at least come close so without further ado let's get into it you guys come on over here all right let's get into it let's zoom go ahead and move you on down so it doesn't focus on my face look at that glob mob dab station you guys move that dz glass it's awesome little cap we got with a stand look at that glob mob station you ain't heady if you don't have a glob mob station that's all i'm saying let's check this out we got a nice little chunk looks just almost the same as the tangy did this one was a little different so the tangy was kind of like [Music] a drop it was like dropped into there in one single glob it was very snap and peel this is very rock hard like shattery not very snap and peel this actually came in like three or four decent sized chunks that look like this but like this is a little bit different in consistency see let's see how there's like those little flakes in there it's because it's more shattery every time i want to go break a piece off get some of that shatter kicking around in there so that's not a it's not a bad thing it's just not my favorite consistency and it just like you know shatter likes to fly around the room shatter likes to go all over the place tends to be a pain in the ass in my opinion yeah let's get into it let's hope i don't send this flying all over the place oh it's so hard to break a piece off because you know it wants to just fly everywhere all right there we go we got our nice little scoop on there there we go a nice little hit we're going for a nice melt shot talk about the effects talk about the taste talk about whether or not this stuff is worth picking up cheers everybody and get carp cap [Music] ready [Music] [Laughter] so [Music] so the flavor on this one it's not too bad i wouldn't say it's as pronounced as the tangie is i would say it's a little bit less than the tangy [Music] i feel like maybe it has to do with the fact that [Music] tangi has such a specific flavor that when you hit tangie you know that you know whether or not it's right you know you get tangy and you're like oh yep that's tangy with this it's like ah it just tastes like really good weed you know so it's hard to tell whether or not you're getting as much flavor as this has to offer because you know it's not like a very strange specific like noticeable thing so still got good flavor though still taste fire [Music] but it's just not as you know it's not as special as tangie is it's got good flavor though [Music] it's got a little lemon lime sprite type of thing going on [Music] it's got a little bit of gas to it so it's pretty good not too bad i honestly haven't smoked white widow since like 2000 and i couldn't even tell you what so it's like [Music] hard to remember whether this is on point as far as the flavor but i'm sure it is [Music] as far as effects it's got a nice indica effect to it um because these aren't live concentrates i don't think i would i would go a little heavy i would smoke a little bit more to achieve the type of effects that you get from a live concentrate but at the price point of 30 dollars a half gram and sixty dollars for a whole gram you can do that you can take fat dabs and not worry about blowing through a hundred dollars or more of medicine in no time because it wasn't a hundred dollars right so it's got its advantages it's got its disadvantages because it's obviously not as not as potent not as strong of a medicine right but if you're not a heavy dabber if you only do dabs once in a while you do dabs as a special occasion thing these are going to knock your socks off i mean it's the people who dab every day multiple times a day all they do is dab almost or like you know you dab more than you smoke flour it's gonna come up a little short as far as the length of the effects and you know you're gonna want to smoke a little bit more so what does it get one to ten let's talk about it looks looks good gold nice yellow gold color uh smells nice light on like a little muted like i like to say it's a little muted on the on the smell and the flavor um but that's to be expected for a cured concentrate shatter especially and a low end 30 half gram like what do you expect out of 30 half grams right so uh where does it fall it falls right where it's it's default it's probably head-to-head i'd say well actually i would say this is right below terrapin probably right above alera most of valera but uh right below terrapin right so as far as flavor and as far as effects go that being said though terrapin is hit or miss sometimes with their sugar you could get a really good sugar that looks great or you could get a sugar that looks like like green baby diarrhea honestly that's what i could the last one i got that was a sugar that was like really bad it looked like green baby [ __ ] so you know it's 50 50 hit or miss but terrapin usually kills it like their waxes are good [Music] their shatters are good i just wouldn't it's a 50 50 if you're gonna get a good sugar because their sugar looks very much like it's trim run and like they don't they don't care what they're running they're just running whatever and a lot of chlorophyll got through or something but the color's not great it's very soupy so it's it's probably head to head with that like organic remedies and terrapin they're head to head right now in my book um insa the one before the tangy by organic remedies that's above it's definitely above and a lower price so it's got its place right it's cheap it's decent it's nothing to write home to mom about but it'll get the job done and for the price it's nice um [Music] but there is cheaper better stuff out there like the ensa stuff that i had that was the gmo by insa that blew my mind the flavor on that was great so depending on what's in the store like i might pick this up if i'm looking for a low-cost cheap thing that i want to just do super big dabs of and not care because it didn't cost a lot because i like to do that i like to do like nice big crazy dabs i'll pull a nice stringy worm out if uh if the shatter is nice and pliable i want to have a nice worm or something but like i'm not gonna do that with something that costs 80 or 100 or even 70 dollars i'm not i'm not taking like a quarter gram half gram dabs of something that costs 80 bucks gram or 100 bucks a gram that's just crazy so this is like that party stuff you know that cheap stuff you buy take it to the party everybody can drink because you only paid like eight bucks for the whole bottle of vladimir because that's just cheap who even cares right that's what this is this is like the bankers club of cannabis i would say you know if you're going to compare it to something [Music] it's that cheap bottle of liquor that you take to the party so your friends can drink on it while you drink in the in the back patron you know it's that stuff you don't care about so as far as one to ten it looks good the looks are good looks looks on point uh i'll give it like a 9 or 10 on looks the smell kind of sucks not all there i'll give that like a 7 out of 10. the effects uh you know not as good as live but you're not paying that money so i'll give it like an eight out of ten but as far as like mid mid grade concentrates this stuff gets like an eight out of ten now don't consider that eight out of ten to be compared to say a higher end concentrate it gets a 10 out of 10 like like moxie casey jones jesus og this was a 95 gram or a 50 half gram and to compare these two things it's like apples and oranges so we're not even we're not talking that we're not even going there we're just talking like mid-grade low-grade stuff this is like on the upper end i would say i would pick it up but i wouldn't pick it up if i saw ensa i probably wouldn't pick it up if i saw terrapin chatter or terrapin wax you know but like if i was going out i wanted to throw a whole half gram into like a yo can or a g pen and just have it in there so i can hit it whenever i need to and whatever i spent 30 bucks on it yeah i'd pick it up you know like if i'm going to a concert or something and take a a vape that needs to be loaded with enough for the whole night yeah that's probably what this is because you won't care if it gets burnt up super quick or you know whatever happens happens it's no big deal so in a world of [Music] rating things and whatnot i would give this like a seven out of ten maybe an eight out of ten but on the mid grade scale so consider that take it for what it is um i got lit honestly stuff works uh you can feel it in your eyelids a little bit decent amount of pain relief and you know makes you feel okay so if you see it pick it up give it a try let me know in the comments what you think i know a bunch of people already have this let me know what you think in the comments am i right am i wrong is it better than i say it is is it worse let me know what you think i always like talking to everybody and hearing what everybody's opinions are because everybody's different something that you might like i might not like and something that i might like you might not like so it's all different strokes for different folks so if you like the videos hit that thumbs

medical marijuana reviews bringing you a move shatter this shatter is our apples it is one of their sativa marketed shatters now this is a sativa that I really like because it is actually very glassy the majority of it broke now I got down towards the end of it and it was a little bit pull but it had that actual snap at the end it broke off so it seems perched right it didn't seem very harsh it was not very hard so you can tell when your chatter is actually pure purged properly when you get nice big holes in it like this see yeah I can just hold that whole sheet up those are all your little pore purge holes god I don't want to say that right that's where the extract is purging out what you do not want to be a heat I have yet to get any shatter like this from truly it has all been a sappy blob that I've got this from move Oh amazing I absolutely love this our efforts i've already toured through almost half of it already i'll see this side how it's a little bit darker and less of that yellow to golden that can be where there's actually more of the extract still left and i may have kind of a problem snapping and tearing it apart on their packaging so THC was 780 milligrams so out of the thousand milligrams of shatter 780 milligrams or THC so that's 78% THC and then of course a little 3% CBD which is nice it's more full-spectrum than I've gotten from some of the shatter that I've gotten it truly this gram of shatter is actually 65 bucks which is five dollars more than what you would pay true leave the five extra dollars knowing that this product is perfectly purged as it is I'm willing to go there every time and get my shot this is one of their sativas that I actually feel like I got a pretty had high-end I have thoroughly enjoyed the medicated feeling that I've gotten throughout the day with using this product it is honestly some of the smoothest tasting shatter I've had I coughed so little off big dabs of it you know and that's not just because of the email either it deliciously made but this is our apples was fairly sour and it was delicious that is delicious delicious delicious chatter I feel great on it body feels great I felt like my digestion was helped

far i'm gonna pull this out we'll take a nice look at it first and then of course i'll do a nice big dab and explain how good it tastes and if you're going to do anything this halloween let me know in the comment section i'm kind of interested in seeing what you guys are going to go out as so i'm going to be honest with you i just opened it up because i was going to do a puff of it and i'm like i might as well do a little review and a little quick hey to all the people all my friends and stuff watching so let's get into it it is a very nice like orange color it has a very nice kind of like a minty smell to it but it is like kind of like has a nice like sweet almost like a lemony citrus type of smell but there's a bit of mint to it it actually smells really nice so let's put a little bit up on here and see how good it tastes it now we got a nice big glob on the scissors that should get us a nice big old puff so let's take a nice big dab obviously first we have to heat this up but yeah i need to adjust this a little bit sorry about that there we go like i said i hope you all are having a good halloween so far and i hope that you guys get some good candy or whatever you're doing like i said whatever you decide to dress up with or whatever let me know in the comment section i'm kind of interested to see all right i say she's good to go now let's get it listen so let's get it oh okay so we got a nice one there so like i was saying the smell it kind of has a bit of a minty taste to it as well but like i described the taste i mean like i described the smell the citrus a bit lemony i do taste did it quite a bit too but the mixture actually isn't too bad of a mixture it actually tastes pretty good together so sorry about the little skip there we had a little uh mistake there i guess a little bit of it fell off of the the scissors because scissors obviously ain't the best dabbing tool so i'm going to be getting myself a better dab and tool here shortly so my next video i'll definitely have one so they'll definitely be a lot better but my apologies we got it done though and i wanted to say happy halloween i hope you all are having a good one so far so you know

future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around

and welcome back to the busy\nbudtender the channel where I sometimes get high and then tell you how it goes\ntoday I'm going to be reviewing good supply's royal highness good supply is\nan aphria brand so for those who were not aware aphria was the brand that I\nalso reviewed last time they own broken coast this is their cheapest weed it was\nactually the cheapest cannabis that I could find on the OCS and I cannot wait\nit's literally like the no-name brand for cannabis they even have the yellow\nfor my Canadians out there you know what this means\nso this specifically was seven dollars and 28 cents per gram so like 25 50 ish\nfor 3.5 grams which is what I purchased from the OCS we'll see how it goes I have\nno idea what to expect with legal weed that is this price I've never tried\nanything this price before that come that came from a LP so I'm kind of\nexcited a little bit nervous the thing that I noticed as well with the good\nsupply packaging is they like to go for this bag which great because it's not\nthat much plastic but also there's not even like you know when you have like a\nbag content that like opens up at the bottom this does not I'm very nervous to\nsee the most flattened product I've ever seen but whatever I guess it makes it\ncheaper all right so let's get into the unboxing which is gonna be an\nembarrassing part again because I never know how to open these so of course on\nthe front we got our THC warning sign our big warning of rotating things that\nare bad and then good supply royal highness this specific one is eighteen\npoint four three percent THC and this strain is supposed to be 18 to 24\npercent so a little on the lower side in terms of CBD it's point zero seven this is\nsupposed to be zero to point nine nine percent CBD so nothing\nthat crazy on the back we have our lovely excise stamp the instructions which I\nwill definitely be needing and then the packaged on date over here which is July\n19, 2019 the interesting thing about this is that's actually not that far\naway I'm recording currently in September so it's not the oldest weed\nthat I've seen or reviewed I'm thinking it's because this is very rarely sold out\nand I haven't been able to find good supply that frequently so I'm assuming\nthat because of its cheap price it's just really in demand so it's nice to\nsee that it's relatively fresh alright and no turning back alright tear grip slide so firstly royal highness the strain\nthat we are reviewing is a hybrid so I'm expecting something in between a sativa\nindica feeling which I'm very excited about so those who don't know I really\nlike hybrids they're my favorite in terms of this specific strain we also\nhave five different main terpenes that are listed on the OCS yeah I'm going to take\nthis time to talk about something somewhat near and dear to my heart which\nis irradiation which is why I think that way less than 5 terpenes are gonna\nbe found in this lot so for those of you who don't know what irradiation is\nor gamma radiation or e- beam those are all different techniques that lp's do to it's\nlike a final kill step before they send out their product so they take all their\nproducts and they use radiation to get rid of all of the bacteria and bad\nthings that we don't want the issue with radiation or irradiation is that it also\nkills a lot of the terpenes so you're not going to get as complex of a final\nproduct so the reason that I want to talk about now is because based on the\nprice of good supply I'm assuming that they 1 billion percent use very heavy\nirradiation that way they don't have to deal with it there's a lot of LPS who\ndon't use irradiation or do different types of kill steps that are much more\nlabor-intensive and the reason that they do this is because they want to keep all\nthat terpene all the terpene profiles that are present it's obviously much\nmore labor-intensive therefore you're going to get a more expensive product so\nalthough I listed the five terpenes and I can go into all the different flavors\nthey're going to denote I very very much doubt that all those are gonna be\npresent today in the cases we find each of these terpenes here we've got humulene\nwhich is supposed to be earthy and spicy which is actually what was in noted\nmostly on the OCS we have caryophyllene again which is that spice that cinnamon-y\nflavor pinene which is pine my favorite then myrcene which is earthy and\nmango-e and then lastly limonene which is going to be citrusy in todays I\npersonally don't smell any of the spice that the OCS had listed what I\nmostly smell is sweet herbal and earthy my camera person\nover there said that it smelled like a freshly cleaned urinal I obviously don't\nknow what that smells like I think it smells fine but hey maybe \nyeah the smell is fine I will say in the bag itself the second I opened it it was\na very very very strong smell and even the bag still smells very strong I think\nit kind of stripped a lot of the smell it's not as potent over here in terms of\nthe bud qualities as you can see from the close-ups it's kind of smushed which\nis fine I mean I expected it frankly I thought was gonna look worse\nthey're super leafy or not leafy but like fluffy and break apart super duper\neasily in my little container I have like all these very very tiny pieces\nthat just keep breaking off so it's very brittle in terms of the actual terpene\nit's kind of hard to tell because they're all so smushed together from the\npackaging but let me break it off it looks good umm the color is a very light\nit's almost like a light yellow snow fall over this\nmost people look for white crystals but hey you know what for 7.30\na gram I don't really care what color the terpenes are also this is supposed\nto be hand trimmed or hand groomed sorry my assumption is that they handed\ngroomed very very slightly and then did mostly machine because that's how\nthey're gonna drive the price down and you can tell it because like some of\nthese have like really long stems or random other stuff it's so so so so dry\nit's not sticky at all which is fine it's also from the drying process and of\ncourse they're not going to take too good of care because it is the cheapest\nproduct they have so honestly not terrible kind of what I expected alright\nbut let's get into the weigh-in as you could probably tell if you\nunderstand the Arabic number is that was 3.5 1 grams so pretty solid that's a\nlittle bit over so I'm not gonna complain and now for what we've all been\nwaiting for the vape all right we have grinded this\nup and I set my vape to 370 so let's try this puppy out\nI need snacks... tastes like pine it can taste a little bit\nherbal which is what it did say on the OCS mainly because of the humulene\nI taste absolutely zero spice like not even a little note of it at all but as they\nsay different terpenes come out at different temperatures so we're gonna have to crank\nthis up a little bit it's a very very light flavor we're try putting it up to 390\nall right so overall the vape quality itself is fine it's not necessarily\nanything to me it's a very very very light pine herbal flavor but overall I\nthink that this is at least from the vape experience definitely weed that I\nwould not mind baking into something like I would cook with this weed to be\nclear I would make edibles with this I think that could be great because it's\ncheap and it's decently potent but the vape quality itself eh fine but\nwhat I would like to tell you is how the high is actually doing so let me sit on\nthis for a little bit and then I'll let you know six and a half hours \nexperience number one and maybe this is because I was feeling peckish beforehand\nbut I am hungry I'm not sure if it's because I actually wanted to snack\nearlier or if this is enhanced it but I think it enhanced it a little bit in terms\nof the high itself I'm actually really enjoying it personally I don't\nnecessarily like consuming things that are very very high in THC so 18% which\nis definitely higher but 18% is actually really enjoyable it's not too out of\ncontrol for me and I still feel somewhat clear-headed but I definitely do feel\nthe effects so Royal Highness for me is a very euphoric but lazy high\nso I think that's exactly what it gets between that hybrid where frankly I\nwould love to just sit down on a couch and chill for the next little bit but I\ndo still feel like being engaged in some way I don't just want to not pay\nattention to anything so it's a good mix in terms of the movie pairing I would\nsay you can pair this with something that you've either seen before but don't\nreally remember or something that you haven't seen before but it's pretty\nchill so for me that would be Mel Brooks's\nBlazing Saddles I think it would go well with that in a sense of I'm still\ndefinitely engaged enough to pay attention to a plot that I don't really\nunderstand or look through a lot of jokes in this case in a movie but I\nwouldn't do it with something that I'm very unfamiliar with because I think I could\nget some of that lost so yeah that's my pairing in terms of a star rating\nI'm gonna say for vaping it 2 stars it's fine it's nothing that exciting\nlooking at the weed it's not like oh my goodness it's so beautiful but it looks\nfine the taste is okay there's nothing bad about it the high itself is really\nfun so that's why I'm gonna give it two stars I will say though I think it could\nredeem itself if I make it into an edible I think that the high if it\ntranslates well into an edible form could be really enjoyable so two stars\nbut it could be better it is exactly what I thought for the price that it is\nin terms of the value it's fine if you're just trying to get into weed a little\nbit and you want to try something a little bit on the stronger end but don't\nwant to break the bank go for good supply it it's solid it's not gonna\nkill you or do anything bad it's it's perfect for the price considering it was\nthe cheapest weed on the OCS when I purchased it honestly solid if it only\ngets up from here then I'm happy if things that are more expensive are worse\nthan this then we're gonna have a problem overall again two stars but this\nis a good time so thank you so much for joining me I cannot\nwait to give you guys some more content and to see you on more videos but\nthat's all for me today so thank you again like comment subscribe whatever\nshare

said I wasn't going to include prices and stuff into my into my titles by figured you know other youtubers have prices and I feel like maybe the prices and titles didn't really affect my second channel from getting the lead is just a more eye appealing or eye-catching title when there's like the price in the in the title I just don't know why it just seems to get much more views basically this is going to be a comparison between two $20 waxes that I got from the club's recently you might have seen them in video it's already I don't know why I'm going to be uploading this but it's probably going to be after I reviewed those ones individually but the waxes in question are let's just see so I got two of each just put things so I mean you can see right here I have a gram of each well now not all of them are full grams anymore but as you can see I got two grams of each brand and they were both $20 so this is the reason why I am comparing them they're both the same price and we're just gonna see which one I like better I'm pretty sure you guys Brady know which one I like better but we're just gonna do it for this video as well so for the first one we got the quest go so we're gonna do the worst first I guess and as you can see right here that's you bet this is their strawberry banana which I barely have any left so please bear with me I'm going to try and uh zoom in you can see very sugary consistency and just show this one more actually hold that dot guys I am actually just switch my battery because it's low so this is the chunky diesel very sugar waxy twenty dollars this was and it is a live sugar so the consistency you can see very very stable and let me just take a hit of it he knows I'm just balance this a little bit my trusty utility in you guys already know the deal like I love this piece I really do black rings are [ __ ] nuts we're just going to get at this one we're going to say best strawberry banana I mean it's not like it tastes better anything but it's the only I barely have that much left of it so you know did I use what you have more even though it's not like particularly any good I guess alright but there's not too much flavoring and I think I mentioned it in those videos as well when I review them I mean the first initial taste was kind of second taste is all right but for waxes it doesn't really I'm not looking for a wax that gets better over time I'm looking for a whack that good off the first day [Music] like I said not too Pleasant in terms of taste or terpenes but not bad and you know I've had worse I'm had why's that you sleep under trash but this one's acceptable you know for 20 dollars I'm not too upset and it didn't taste all that great because you know like I said it's only twenty dollars if I would've paid thirty for this and it's trash yeah then I would be a little bit upset but all-in-all crystal is pretty good I just feel a little cheated because after I bought this I bought bear and it just blows out those out the park and it's the same price I'll be it you know they were at different dispensaries but they're both around the same price I feel like if fresco was that fee knows where I bought the bear stuff it'd be priced around the same maybe even lower I don't know when you guys know my history with fresco I wanted to try their cartridges and then they're basically douche bags to me so but this is not gonna reflect just like on the review it does not reflect what I think about their products you know I thought to you know if I didn't like if I really didn't care for them I wouldn't have bought two maybe not because at the time this was the best place to buy wax because everything else was in 30% off at other places so you know sometimes you just want to spend 20 bucks you don't have to even want to break another bill another 20 just to spend 25 on some [ __ ] you know now we got the good stuff we got there and this is botanical extracts and research labs guys and this is basically acronym but they use that it you know worked out it spells bear they got their right here this is their purple punch and I believe banana cream pie and these are full-spectrum boys full-spectrum for $20 you can't really like you can't really get that unless it's like I think bright Labs is full spectrum but the taste for bright Labs is uncompelled to this I'm saying when you just open these be these are running about be percent keeps the ugly it's definitely not bad you're just gonna so this is the purple punch guys this reminds me that the consistency that you would see in 710 labs like that very buttery a clean-looking butter eat look you know I'm saying my lewis [ __ ] and it smells phenomenal smells like purple punch for sure this is the banana the banana the bananas a bit darker than the the Provo punch and not as tasty but still nonetheless really really really really chirpy for for what it is you know full spectrum let's get let's get a double let's get it triple there you go hopefully you guys can see we'll take a hit at both you know they're gonna end the video here just a comparison video I do these videos to help you choose the best product for you at a reasonable price you know a lot of people complain that oh you only get them the Bunco leader or whatever it's like first of all we doesn't last meal what like it lasts me probably like hours just an hour or not even that long okay so what's the point in me getting like these crazy like [ __ ] designer strains that cost $50 an eighth and then I'm done with it for now you know don't get me wrong on the flowers it's probably phenomenal you know but flowers don't last me long you know and when I do get wheat I try to get a deal where I could just smoke out my homies because not a lot of us are buying weed nowadays and when we were craving weed it's when we're out in the city and we just want to smoke a joint you know but other than that it's just a waste of it's not a waste of money don't get me wrong but it doesn't last as long as wives get my drift this is the promo punch cheers guys god damn that's tasty that tastes like fruit spunk like no lie like if you ever see bear and you see purple punch get like I don't say that much [ __ ] takes me this is why we try to conserve this as much as possible but we're gonna take the hit of the banana cream pie now and we're gonna call the video just the video it's it's more of a side by side $20 wax I guess or I don't know if it was more of a comparison because you guys already know when my opinion was on all the B's and which one I liked better banana cream pie cheers this is my wake and bake as well guys so hopefully you guys are waking and baking with me Cheers all right guys [Music]", "hC1iiU2iiTE": "yo what's up with

it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I've got some chatter from sir Tara so let's check it out it's their hover shattered line from the float brand I'm not exactly sure what all of that means I don't know if it has anything to do with you know like sativa or indica or what but you know hover and float and then we have 68 point 68 percent THC and point four seven three percent CBD and this is till a book strawberry so let's open the sucker up take a look at it see what we've got it's a big old jar of uh concentrate there ooh pretty looks like a little cupcake mold there let's see if it has any smell to it hmm not really all that much smell and what smell I do smell is more like a lemony kind of smell like a citrusy than a strawberry but you know it does have a little smell to it see if we can get a good look at the color there it's like kind of an amber colored totally clear kind of shatter here let's go ahead and see if we can weigh this stuff up very easily see how much we got put this on there tear it out take this put it on there hopefully without losing any a product from flying across the room there we go there's a nice look at it I'll give you a better look after I weigh it before that scale shuts off so it looks like 1.06 three grams well now that it closed the lid it's down to 1.0 for eight grams so just over one gram that's all right we like getting what we pay for and I guess this is a PTFE not quite sure that's interesting these have like a nice rounded bottom to them it's pretty cool I don't know if you can see that on camera all right let's see if you can get a better look at this stuff then I gave you flip it over here there we go as you can see it's a clear amber put this sucker back in the container here before I lose a bunch of it so this will be my first time trying any shatter from sir Terra I'm pretty stoked about it you know we need as much competition as we can in the market right now and so this is $60 a gram which is what Trulia charges for their shatter and crumble um now I will say I'm surprised that it has that amber color to it I did I have seen that pure leaf has that same amber color I'm not sure if that's because of the process they use I'm not sure if this is a co2 extracted or alcohol extracted it doesn't really say on here so yeah all right see how hard this stuff is yep it is shatter it's shatter II I try to break it up it's very hard it breaks into chunks let me get it on my dad tool here if I can I generally prefer soft concentrates like rosin is my favorite but all they had at my location was the shatter so that's what I'm I go with today all right now I don't have an especially high dab tolerance right now so this will probably be a short video but I'm gonna head and turn this on this is the focus V Carta I had some trouble with the atomizer right after like probably two weeks after I got it and I haven't used it and so long because of that and I had trouble getting in touch with their customer support so that's not cool but they did eventually replace the atomizer with a brand new one and the new version the 2.0 version so this will be my first time trying the 2.0 version and we'll see how it goes I guess we'll start out it to maybe see how that does and away we go I think I'll try just dropping a bead in there actually okay this is amazing like I don't know why they call it strawberry because this tastes exactly like citrus farmer to me this tastes just like the citrus farmer string I love that string this is awesome all right here we go so this to me this has no strawberry flavor to me it has a really intense sweet ruby red grapefruit flavor I don't know if that's just me or if anybody else out there has the same you know situation but yeah I don't taste strawberries at all with the Tillamook strawberry chatter definitely grapefruit it's an intense citrus flavor see if I got any more now it looks like I got all of it so I'm gonna go ahead and clean that all and that's one thing about this focused Carter you've got to stay on top of it you know the maintenance and everything like that you got to keep it the bowl clean or you'll start having trouble with it the you know I mean the first bowl I had the version 1.0 I guess it just man it overflowed like crazy got gunked-up like crazy so I'm hoping that that won't be this case with the 2.0 the other thing happened with the 2.0 or the 1.0 is that cleaning it broke it so there you go all right I think I've got that thing cleaned out enough so I'm gonna give it another try break off a decent piece here don't need a huge amount because I don't have a really high concentrate tolerance right now some go ahead and let it heat up to two again because that seemed to do the job without burning it too badly I can still taste that intense um ruby red oh no oh no you just went flying guys oh here it is I found it wooo alright here we go absolutely 100% candied ruby red grapefruit flavor that's what's in there sorry I don't all you strawberry fans out there that's great food don't know what to say but that's what it is it tastes exactly like the citrus farmer strain and I mean maybe it is because you know they named it till the milk strawberry didn't I don't know is that their own proprietary strain it could be that they're just using citrus farmer and calling it don't look sorry but I don't know they sure do you taste the same I think I'm up for one more you guys down for one more - all right time to clean it up again it's one thing that's kind of annoying to me about these e-mails is that you know e rigs is that you just have to be meticulous with the cleaning man I mean you know I get it if you want to have a really nice flavor hit you know you definitely want to clean your dad rig right before you do it your now but the same time I don't have time for that [ __ ] most of the time guys I just want to be honest with you I don't know if you watched my other dad videos but you see that email I use yeah I don't clean that very often because in reality you know I got to get back to my life and what I'm doing most of the time I mean in the evenings I can enjoy stuff like that but oh yeah this is a lot more maintenance than an email and it also seems like it's harder to burn it off you know an email you can just burn it right off I'm gonna come back with a quick swab and it's gone I can't seem to do it very well with this all right I got a couple of a couple little dabs here I think I'm only gonna do one of them but we'll do one more thing I like this you know okay guys I'm actually liking the shatter for this rig okay so here's why normally I've only used rosin with this before and maybe crumble yeah but the thing is with rosin is you got to get it off of here somehow and I know they have those electronic dab tools but I don't have one of those so you know you got to touch it to the sides or something which encourages it to run up the sides so this is actually pretty nice you know just make a little beads of it like this and drop them right in see if you can look inside the bowl there and you've seen how much I've cleaned it right and I don't know if you can get a good look at there still you know there's still dark stuff in there so it is a kind of a pain to maintain but it's a quick little dab tool that's for sure get that up to - again - seems to be working really well on this 2.0 atomizer on the last one I had to put it all the way up before usually you get what I wanted out of it big bold citrus flavor specifically ruby red great from but like Candide it's got a sweetness to it man oh man I'm really feeling it so at this point I've had a few dabs they gonna put this one back guys cuz I'm doing pretty good but uh this is pretty good stuff like I said I don't have a huge concentrate tolerance right now mostly been vaping flour lately or rolling joints out of it but I am really well medicated right now I can feel it in my face like crazy you know I'm sure you can hear my nose a little bit runny you know all those nice indicators that I'm well medicated sure you guys will know what I'm talking about so there's a 68% THC and 0.47 three percent CBD in Tillamook strawberries shatter from sir Tara alright thank you very much for watching guys I hope you have a good one just wanted to say a little bit about you know how much I've been published in videos and or not been publishing videos it's been a few days since I've put one up and so I was having tons of fun man just making these videos and put them up every day and it really like I was invigorated for it and felt great but you know some things have changed and I can't put as much time into this as I was it actually takes a long time to edit videos I've found out and a man I about put the keyboard through of the screen a few times when I was learning it but you know it is a pretty big time commitment and when I committed to doing a video a day I didn't realize how big of a time commitment that would be and how all-consuming that could be just to make a short little video you know but uh it is a big commitment and I do love this and I'm having a great time doing it but like I said some things have changed so I will put out as much as I can I'm probably gonna have to do it mostly on the weekends now but you know try to do a batch of them so that I can at least get a few videos up for a week but I'm not I can't promise anything because you know life is what it is so but I really appreciate you guys watching and like I said I love making these videos so you guys have a good one and I hope you tune in for my next video thank you very much", "p62i-lwAn8o": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4/20 here today I'm going to be opening my latest haul from true leaf Panama City Beach dispensary location let's see what we got we've got some 9 pound hammer Rosen man 83.5% TCA and 3.1 percent of THC for a grand total of eighty eight point six and we've got some co2 oil this one we have a Skywalker og and this one gorillas grapes will see the Skywalker og eighty point three percent THC an eighty percent THC on a gorilla grapes last but definitely also least is the I got a little syringe warmer because you know I've been using hot water and all kinds of stuff like that for a long time and I just figured I'd give it a try seems like it might be more convenient let's take a look at the total here they actually forgot to put the warmer on the first time I use my trigger points they let me stack it for twenty percent this time that's the first time I've ever had them do that I don't know if that's a new thing or what but I was allowed to get twenty percent discount from my true liver points and so instead of being two twenty five that came out to 180 so that makes each one of these sixty bucks apiece 60 bucks for the co2 and sixty bucks for the rosin I think that's a pretty decent deal you make rosin at home you're gonna be paying probably forty to fifty bucks or so to make it grandma rosin maybe a little bit more depending on the strain and you know $60.00 co2 oil is just a great deal because usually it's their regular distill it that's at $60 price point and I don't really like the regular distill it that much I mean it's just not the same level as the co2 this syringe warmer right here is $20 normally with the 20% off that 16 bucks total and here it is so this thing right here what you will do is take your battery mod that fits a 5-10 cartridge on it and hopefully you can unscrew it I guess mine's a little bit leaky we have to well there we go whoo yeah that'll loosen it up just enough darn I can't get it here we go finally how'd you get a glove alright so yeah that's the problem is I've got a bunch of leakage right here so I need to get a q-tip with some alcohol on it and cleaning that thing out that can also cause your your mod to stop working I actually found this on the ground somebody just threw it out and this thing was all gunked up and so there you go now it works let's see if this works even though it's still all gunky you just screw in the syringe warmer on your battery mod see if I can feel it it doesn't really have any structions with it smells like it's heating up in there yeah you just take this sucker look how pretty it is I love how pretty the co2 oil is just take this and stick it in there I guess maybe you take off this cap I'm not really totally sure what you do I've never used it and there's no instructions but see if this does anything hmm wonder how long this thing takes there we go it's certainly heat up right here I don't know it might be easier just to do a lighter guys seriously like what in the heck maybe I gotta try it like this take this thing off it doesn't seem to make much sense to me but I'll try it when the heck was that oh there's a spring I don't know the here is like a spring weird okay let's see this is holder for ten seconds to see if that doesn't so the video cut out there right after I held it down for ten seconds but yeah it does it does heat it up you know it's not as fast as a lighter and you have to sit here and hold it so mmm if you don't want to mess with a lighter I guess it could be worth it but yes here we go there it's all it's all melted now it really doesn't take that long you don't get sick all over it you don't have to worry about using all your butane there you go you can just keep this thing plugged in if you want really so it looks like that works pretty well I didn't get any flour because I'm all out of my flour recommendation you know I got caught up in the one plant slash three boys farm ordeal and so I spent my recommendation on that now I mean I'm not regretting it you know it's like it was a really good deal hundred twenty-five dollars for an ounce so 250 for two ounces that's pretty awesome I mean a quarter pound for 500 bucks you know medical grade pretty awesome but you know I I do miss the variety I wish I had I definitely wish I had my recommendation open when I went to the grand opening of this truly Panama City Beach because they had a nice selection of strains they had like four or five strains that day and they also had all the cups I'd use all the cups I got I went back and I only had there yesterday it was just cups of what is it wine wine dream Dutch wine yeah Dutch wine and I just I've already got cups of that so I don't really care about it yeah you know it's good stuff but I like a variety so I should my recommendation should be coming up here and about a week or so so I'll be getting a bunch more reviews on actual flour in here soon hopefully maybe I'll take a couple deliveries from other dispensaries to and branch out with what I'm reviewing instead of just doing and all the stuff that's closed or that I've gotten from before but like fluent I know I can get deliveries from them and possibly vitae can and med men I'm not really sure but yeah I'm ready to taste some variety I've been stuck on the same strains for a while now and that'll teach me something in the future too you know don't get stuck on the big old hype trap if if you might have some new openings coming in your area but it's all good I just got to say that that the employees at the Panama City Beach location seem pretty cool they're all very friendly and polite so far the atmosphere in general up there is really nice you know it's not there's not a bunch of grumpy people I mean it's not a bunch of people arguing or whatever perhaps the limit on minis help that I don't know but they said that the minis I talked to I guess my team in a shift manager I'm not sure but he said that the minis are still selling out and they'll be you know usually they'll be gone by early afternoon even with the two person or two per person limit so it's just a really popular item and you can't blame them when they're you know giving out really fat jars of minis they just baton for social media with those things you know they want to get on in line they want to get their message out they want people who don't have a card and who are getting from a dealer to say hey wait whoa whoa you can get four grams for the price of 3.5 and it looks good you know like that I mean so you know it's a work in progress this is like the Wild West phase that we're in right now once everything gets sorted out you know once the competition gets more firmly rooted wants some acquisitions take place then we're gonna start to see a more stable environment with better prices and better customer or care I think right now they're just you know that some of these people are some of these dispensaries are gonna get snapped up some of them are gonna get bought out some of them are gonna you know have really bad financial problems I mean just depends you know you got to see how it plays out and in the next two years I think we'll see the market stabilize a lot we'll see a bunch of acquisitions and stuff like that and it'll be a lot better for us at that point you know we just got a grin and bear it for now it is a kind of a [ __ ] show you know trying to get flour in this state hang in there and we can do it and you know another thing I just wanted to say I think I'm gonna start adding this as much as I can to everything I say because I just noticed that online we've got so much negativity not just in our forum not just in the medical marijuana community but in America we just in our whole country everyone is so negative everyone is always wants to be right everyone always wants to prove someone wrong everyone always wants to knock somebody down a peg and I'm guilty I'm just as guilty as anybody else or more so and you know we got to just start being kind man just please please please be kind", "LkT-_XMbEJA": "hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile skills this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with a cannabis review so today i'm coming at you with marshmallow kush but i'm also going to be doing pinkman goo hybrid shatter so i wanted to open this up and take a nice look at it in the account and everything and then i'm going to roll up a nice fat joint filled with it and smoke it for you so i wanted to open it up so we could take a close look at it together to see how good of a count it comes and then we'll discuss the strain more and everything while we're actually smoking it and reviewing it more so let's open it up this is the first time i'm actually trying it's gg extract so it's going to be the first time trying this guy as you know a lot of the kinds i tried before they were hog brand it has a very strong smell it looks nice and sticky it doesn't look like it came in a bad account so it does have a very strong smell and it looks very good so i'm gonna take a second roll up this nice big joint and come right back for this review all right i'm back and i got a nice fat joint rolled up with the marshmallow strain and the pink glue and i put a nice like a nice amount up in this now it feels like it might start raining on us a little bit i hope that don't happen but you know let's try to get this done before it does i want to try not to let it affect this review so let's light this joint up [Music] so it does trying to grow the wind a little bit so it lights better so it does have a very nice taste so i already did smoke a little joint of the marshmallow kind and like earlier yesterday i think it was and it does have like a really nice marshmallow type of taste to it so i didn't really want to ruin it with the shatter but i kind of wanted to do both reviews and one since i didn't do any in a while and i wanted to do an apology actually about that say because i made a lot of changes in my life i actually made a big move i got a new girlfriend and everything's going to be coming back how it regularly was i'm not going to be doing it daily like i used to be but i will be coming like at least twice three times a week with a review so i could actually taste like a bit of the marshmallow and a bit of the shatter the shatter has like a really strong citrus taste to it but the marshmallow is really sweet the marshmallow strained so it like kind of has a really really nice strong strong flavor though it tastes really good together so let's take a nice look at this strain so it's like a darker color green but it does look very nice it has a lot of crystals on it here i'll try to find a nice but they're all littler buds but try to find them bigger a piece of size one to look at at least see it does have like a nice look to it really nice looking hairs and really nice crystals i wish it would focus a little better but and it is 21 thc i believe and this is a very good mixture together the shatter and the weed it's a little windy so i'm trying to get it to light better but sorry about the delays but it does taste very nice so the marshmallow this was six grams of it that looks well minus the joint i rolled so that looks like a very nice good six grams so i'll give it i'll give it a four out of five for account ratings that's a really good account has a really good taste so the marshmallow yeah i'll give it like i'm thinking all around uh i'll give it a 3.5 out of 5 because it's a really good really good strain it tastes really good but i mean like it's not the highest in thc it's up there but it's not the highest so i also wanted to recommend i also wanted to recommend these nerd candies i already ate some the other day i got a nice good buzz off them they're 300 milligrams thc and they taste very good so if you get a chance to try those out i recommend it they're pretty good so and another one thing i'm going to be doing next is i'll show you [Music] three kings i'm gonna be doing that next so keep your eyes open that that's going to be coming up very soon so yeah i think i'll get 3.5 out of 5 for the marshmallow strength because it's really good it tastes really good gets you a nice high yeah and it came in nice account so i'll give it three point five out of five which ain't a bad rating for this shattered the pinkman goo i think i've been saying it wrong pink mingoo not pink pink mango is gonna be good in a let's take another close look at it see it does look very nice has a nice tint to it it's kind of like a sticky flaky material it's not too bad it would be good for doing dabs but i wanted to do a little special come up in a nice scenery maybe i'll throw a little dab head at the end inside we'll have to wait and see and if you were paying attention to uh my videos before i took a little break my plants are doing really good i'll do a little plant progress at the end of thing too so if you want you can stay tuned for that they're like done nice buds on them they're doing pretty good so [Music] but yeah back to the pinkman goose shatter i'll give it a 4 out of 5 because it's pretty good it's not bad at all it tastes really good nice account so yeah i'll give it a four it's not that at all so for real i'm actually getting pretty messed up of this pretty good ass joint so i did want to apologize so for taking a little break without letting you guys know at least giving us an update but it's going to be coming more regularly now i've moved from where i'm at to another spot settled in everything's going good so let me know in the comment section what you've been up to or whatever i hope you all been keeping safe and doing good during these hard times i know it could be rough still you know things are getting a little bit back to normal but still [ __ ] wild up there so i hope everybody's doing good [Music] so with that i guess i'll wrap it up thank you all for stopping in and checking out my video i appreciate when all you guys watch i really appreciate it all so if we're just uh taking a little break like that but for real coming back strong appreciate it man you guys all have a good day peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more cluster roll and watch another show", "Sdpn-iHpu_c": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with token Tim 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 all right like say hi to all the new subscribers old subscribers hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving hope they got most of their Christmas shopping done all right we got a hall from cetera we got another hall I might try to do it tonight or tomorrow I might do a smoke sesh I got a fire burning out back so I might like to roll up a blunt and smoke that let's see what else oh if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we still got the thousand subscriber giveaway coming soon I'm just trying to gather a few more things for it try to make it a little unique as possible you know me so make sure you hit that subscribe button leave me a thumbs up or thumbs down if you don't like to see it don't matter alright let's see what we got to the game alright well you know so Tara got there flower today so you know we had you up there for that well they gave out a free gift floats there I've guessed the flower line they're gonna call it float but this is a real cool jar I haven't seen anything like that for it's a stash jar it's a mason jar so you're going to take this plastic lid off and sure enough regular mason jar lid and then this is just a silicone cozy it's on there real tight by the way I'm gonna come up it'll come down a little bit but you can see it's just one the caning cars so the ones with a little design on it but the silicone thing makes it a little bit more indestructible like so I really kind of like that mm-hmm never seen one like that before hopefully they sell bees and a smaller one would be not you know they make a smaller mason jar I'll never have enough to stash in there so let's see what we got here we did yes flower I believe I forgot to take the tags off all the stuff so you gonna have to give me like a what second to do that yeah we'll leave it on the boxes we'll just want to show the boxes all right one more to go all right so I thought they was gonna do something different what the girl told me on the phone was it was gonna be like flood was gonna be the brand but then they was gonna have like rest and awake you know kind of like their a.m. their p.m. theirs in and all that pens but they actually it was granddaddy purples what I got coming at nineteen percent THC there's a squeezy jars come see a little bit of Leafs in there should a dealer went first so I can roll one but you see a few of the leaves in the bottle but there's some trichomes you can see that yeah let's take it up for the close-up look yeah it wasn't trimmed real good you can see that right there somebody left a couple leaves on there but when we flip it over you wouldn't get the light down here that's feel a little dry though which is kind of to be expected here in Florida to be honest with you guys not all the time don't get me wrong but usually when they come out with it for the first time and they hold it for a holiday like they just did this is Black Friday they just come out with their links flower today you got imagine even sitting on it for a minute like I said the but structures aren't bad they've got some trichomes on them don't know if you can see all that or not see glisten in there a little bit trim job wasn't the best but some of the other ones have been like that they learn as they go down here some learn as they go down here some dispensaries don't learn at all but so we'll probably stick these in a jar with one of them a little believe a pax I did a couple the other ones like that and it worked out pretty good alright and then we got the this is Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer if you look it up on their website it's gonna say Jackie Girl this is the Jackie Girl when you look it up Jackie girls across between Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer so this one was coming in at 18 percent this was only two flowers they had at my location I didn't get there bright and early now this stuff does look good so whoever trimmed the granddaddy purp just probably fire their asses this one's nice because I trimmed up nice nice tight bugs this one's not really that dry we're gonna twist up one of these because you know we gotta smoke something so like I said this is gonna be a Girl Scout cooking a jack for rare it is a hybrid but I'm guessing it's gonna be more a little bit sativa leaning hybrid believed the Girl Scout cookie anyways a little sativa leaning one twist up too big of a ones and like I said with my cloud to the fire here later on I'll go out to the fire you guys can't see crap out there I've tried it one night but I can start the smoke session here and then after I shoot the video while uploading it I can upload outside around the pit and finish my lunch so we might do that we say from here and it's down here my nose is up here I can smell that when I ground it up got a little bit of that fruity smell like the member berries kind of like aluminum rg4 move - it has that kind of fruity smell to it it's also got maybe a little earthy smell to it something hit me a lot harder when I first rounded up but you never know there could have been something left over in the grinder - that it mixed with it that's why I really don't do a review the first time I smoked it because sometimes there's a left over traces of something in the grinder and I'll give you a little false taste on the first one I did that on member berries one time SOT my ground up before that just was a little bit more stronger than it was and carried over alright just twist it up and see what else we got from there now I will say I never really cared for cetera set up usually they're not real busy you know usually I go in there there's two or three people in there and I still wait twenty minutes so they don't have a real good setup you go up to the counter you order your stuff right in front of everybody there's only two people at the counter then you sit down if there's room but there's only about two little small couches in there or one little small couch and a bench or something I don't know then somebody makes up your order in the back room carries it out carries it all the way to the other side the store to the for cash registers they have and then they holler out your name so as you can imagine today they got flour and wax in they look pretty busy more people in there talking unless you can hear some of the some of the guys in there you know they was loud enough you could hear them but a couple of girls they was hollering names two or three times you know all that just slows the process so I'll know we was there for an hour today got no discounts got the float thing but apparently they was one of the few that didn't have any discounts their idea of a Black Friday deal is just letting us have flour I guess so we did get some shattered we got the Tillamook strawberry coming at 68 percent THC they come in these nice little black jars they're real easy to open not like some of them we won't name names and then it's got like a little cupcake thing in there candy wrapper and it's got the shatter which I don't care for this cuz it's as you can see it makes it a big globs so trying to break a piece off of that is a pain in the butt I like it better on a flat piece of parchment paper so it's flattened out hopefully they'll figure that out soon some of them do some of them don't someone just keep packing it in there but at least I didn't just put it in a jar by itself they did put it on some kind of parchment so we'll give that a shot later on it'll give you a review on it too along with the flowers and then we got some of what they're calling soft wax 69% then my native just as wax on the thing it's just soft wax online a little different than what I was expecting online if you look at it look more buttery more like moves rosin this is more like I don't know like if you melted a turkey roll or something or caramel and neither one never had a real strong smell to them so we'll just have to taste them here later on but like I said neither one of them had a strong flavor I don't know if I got a clean dab to learn on but we can clean one real quick you let it cool off I don't wanna melt it any get a little skip out see if we can get a little better look at it and I guess it is a little dance for sorry I was looking at it yeah once you dig into us a little more wet than I thought it was and kind of touched the top and it didn't fall apart I did ask him you always going to ask him Florida because you never freaking know they tried to trick us a few times I was asked if I can get it under inhalation we're not inhalation sorry oral it's got a little bit of flavor once your smell when you broke into it I always ask him if you can get it under oral if you can get under oil it's gonna be distillate the vitae can pulled that crap on us and rise pulled that crap on us with their turkey nectar stuff or whatever they had and by takane had to concentrate jars that they tried saying was you know they kept saying a honey consistency they never come out and said honey but when you do look online it does say on the float products it does say cannabis derived terpenes at it so you're not gonna add you can't I don't think you can I mean you might add terpenes to the flower so you can't really add it to the shatter I mean I guess you could before it was still liquid when you was pouring it out I guess you could add terpenes in but usually when you see they're adding terpenes back to it it's gonna be a more of a flavored distillate so I was a little bit nervous about that and we'll see cuz this one kind of looks like it could be a flavored distillate if it pops up next week that you could buy this crap under oil on no offense time so we'll just see we'll give it a flavor test all this was 180 bucks it's $60 a piece for the wax the soft wax and the shatter their flower is thirty and eight so neither one of these two strains I've had before I don't think I've had the granddaddy purple in a flower I think we've only had it in a vet cart before let's see what else this doesn't have a bad flavor to it I just smoked a bowl before the video because I got some phone calls on no one to smoke on here but I was wanting to smoke too so I didn't wanna wait so he's a little medicated when we started can tastes more like the Girl Scout cookie I think than the Jack Herer in here it does have a little earthy undertone to it but we'll do a full review on it later along with the Laxus so I think that's going to be it guys I'm gonna try to finish the rest of this we'll see how it goes you know it is only 18% but I've had some 18% hit me harder than anything else some of the hardest hitting flowers I think I've had here in Florida it was around the 18 or 21 percent not saying that there ain't some you know 27 that are good and stuff but I think the best strains I've had have been a lower you know run 18 21 % to be honest so like I said I think that'll be it guys will try to either do a smoke sesh or the other review tonight or will see you tomorrow one of the two pins on how the night goes you know I got a bunch of kids so yeah you never know what's gonna pop up around the air you guys haven't subscribed make sure you

thumbs up thumbs down comment down below let me know what you guys are talkin on tonight how was your Black Friday shopping did you bother go or did you go out and get anything today for yourself some weed like I did let me know and until next time keep on talking my friend", "YyXDwc9OQ2M": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're gonna be checking out this crumble or this bubba kush crumble by Regulator extract and with that we're gonna go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC a comes in at or actually THC comes in at 60 to 0.5 they don't have a whole lot of other stuff but as you guys know I don't buy my candles based off of THC the reason I really picked this up was because it looked really good and it was a steal so I can't hi guys know I don't really mention prices so I'm not really gonna go into it but just know that this was really affordable this was definitely something that I would consider budget-friendly and I'm trying to open this right now and it's not working give me two seconds there we go alright so sorry guys I've been fighting kind of cold so if I sound a little funny I apologize all right so here we go sorry it really is that far off camera I was so as you can see this looks really really good zoom in for you guys so you can check that out let me educate this and play with it a little bit so the color that comes off on camera is about two shades lighter than the color that's in the actual like in person I would say it's a little bit darker than what you guys see here but it still looks really really good ooh as far as the scent is concerned it just has that really clean floral you know good concentrate taste but with that I'm really excited to try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this hey guys what's up I went ahead and tried that bubba kush and as far as the flavor is concerned it doesn't have a whole lot outside of like a regular clean concentrate floral flavor then the hai itself is more of a relaxed stone enos that kind of hits the body but that leaves your brain kind of clear-headed this one was a good one I would say it was a little bit longer than I expected it to be especially for the price and then the way that we ended up smoking it for the majority of the week and I think we still have a little bit of it is we end up topping other stuff that isn't quite as strong or just like you know you dip it in you know you take your other concentrate dip it into some of this and the combination of this with other stuff has been really really really good I honestly think we might end up picking this up again just for the simple fact that if you do end up getting something else that's not quite cutting it you can just dip it into this and boom it's good to go so all around a really good concentrate if you're a newbie I would say you could probably just go ahead and try a normal-sized dab with this because it's not gonna throw you so far out of your element that you're gonna feel uncomfortable and it is gonna give you that concentrate kind of feel if you're a newbie also remember that the THC percentage isn't relevant to you any concentrate is gonna get you higher than any sort of flower that you've ever had before just because it is a concentrate so just keep that in mind when you're out there purchasing your stuff with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "B6dS0fFenzw": "what is up guys welcome to another strain review cue the music and the intro today I am excited to announce that I'm going to be reviewing this one strain the papaya punch by quail extracts it's a live resin and papaya punch is a hybrid of two wonderful strains papaya and also purple punch the papaya is an indica dominant hybrid and it's known for producing effects that are more like traditional sativa the indica element of the strain provides a mental calmness consumers also found that the strain makes them energetic and productive so Nirvana seeds cross citral with ice to make this unique fruity strain to the pipe and from the papaya you get a lot of the sweet and tropical notes also a little bit of the spicy and herbal notes purple punch is also a indica dominant hybrid crossing between Larry og and granddaddy purple purple punch you can really get a grape candy the blueberry muffins and it's known for helping with nausea stress minor body aches and sleeplessness so these two wonderful strains combined together makes a pie a punch and what I expect is something fruity sweet smell this papaya punch right away when you open your container wax you instantly smell all of the delicious tropical notes of the papaya punch and you definitely get slight muskiness which is interesting nice punch the wax itself is pretty clear you can see right through it it's a nice golden color it's extremely stable but it's not so stable that it shatters like glass when it's so stable that's like glass you sometimes use some of your concentrates based on just like accidentally shattering and or like just handling it when it's this consistency where it's not to class like you lose a lot less and I just find it a lot easier to work with especially when you're dealing with a pens or puffs go Pete even all right okay if you are less than 18 years old please click out of this video get yourself out of here you don't belong here this video is intended only for people who are 18 years or older I do not condone or promote illegal use of any substance please do not do anything illegal [Music] [Music] this papaya punch is extremely tasty that tropical news is merged together with a little bit of that Baroness from the purple punch and it makes it very tasty you get a little bit of the her bonus the flavor is really good a lot of sweetness this is a pretty good intercut dominant hybrid that feels and tastes like a sativa right away you get a lot of the euphoric and relaxed effects and I also feel like being creative making music making videos taste-wise I would give the papaya punch from Quayle extracts a 4.5 out of 5 wonderful strain I would definitely recommend you finding this and buying it it's also pretty potent price-wise I would say it's a 5 out of 5 for the quality you get this product is wonderful I got three grams of life resin for $45 granted I got a wholesale price because I went to a a sesh in Los Angeles called maniac sesh sessions are basically cannabis farmer market slash trade shows trail extracts is freaking awesome I love their prices they have really compassionate prices all of their strings all their concentrates that I tried and I tried over a dozen different types of things from them their potency top-notch flavor on almost every single one of those concentrates that tribe is wonderful like they're all great flavors they don't add extra terpenes or anything like that the flavors of the flowers really come through when the concentrates and they're also really chilled people I also follow Braille extracts on Instagram I like them and whenever I see them they're always really nice and kind to me

public-housing\nneighborhood in London, and I'm about to meet\na guy named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "NuNwZf7d7rQ": "what's up you guys welcome to my channel disclaimer if you knew you're welcome you're old here welcome back and if you're a hater yeah what's up welcome to my channel my name is Michelle Michi whatever upload on Mondays sometimes something other days and I make lame comedy videos and review medical marijuana so if you're into any of that to today I gotta tell you guys I was gonna upload a video I had ready to go and it is an interview with my medical cannabis doctor which I might just go ahead and upload that this week sometime anyhow but something happened I I never thought I'd be making this video I didn't think this would ever happen but you guys I gotta tell you t relief has shatter [Applause] michi clocking in from the past or future whatever okay I just wanted to clarify something as far as this shatter with the cure leaf goes not every dispenser not every location has it yet and I don't know if it's gonna be like a permanent thing if this is a trial thing I know it said limited supplies only and I know not every cure leaf dispensary has I got mine in Sanford at the new dispensary that just opened up so yeah there's that okay bye they have an indica they have a hybrid and they have a sativa your girl right here picked up an indica and sativa so I will go ahead and tell you that the indica is OB TK is that right well it didn't say anything on Leafly but I fell miss on this strain and it does taste earthy and spicy by the way it did make me condom happy but I did not want to do yoga so I don't know what the yoga is all about you'll have to figure that out and I don't know why I sound like a talk-show host read on players read either is Strawberry Cough here is your Leafly stats and do it and here's your lease lease add some strawberry coughing you to leave these deaths and the effects and medical there are no negatives do we need ego I'm sorry read on players don't ever do that again I'm not gonna I'm probably gonna do it again [ __ ] what hey it's a tea that it's Strawberry Cough is clocking in ah 69.4% THC CBD is 0.3 and that's what it pretty much says for a total of 70 point 4 I don't know whatever says it's a good okay you guys and clocking in at sixty nine point eight percent THC 0.2 percent CB rate CBD and 0.3% CBG for a total of seven point three and this is your indica OB TK and they both look the same this is the indica and here is the sativa it's a little the sativa seems to me just to be a little bit lighter yeah cuz if you can compare them it is it's a little bit lighter now I had a lot of people saying that if it's dark it isn't good I don't really necessarily feel that's true because I mean I've had dark shadow before and it was bomb what I have here in the pan is some of the indica the OB TK so let's go ahead and give it a hit hmm so initially I didn't taste it and I was like it doesn't really have a smell to it which I've gotten true leaves before it had a smell to it but it didn't really have a smell to it in the jar but it tastes really good it has um hmm it has like a very earthy cannabis taste to it if that makes any sense that's what this one does that the OU BTK sounds like I'm talking about the BTK killer okay let's put some of that sativa on there I will say this it's like really hard sometimes you get shattered I've gotten Chartres and it wasn't like really hard this is like like a hard caramel candy that just got on my lip and I know all of you just saw that so oh well it's enough see that little piece that flew on my world let's put it in that that's all you need don't you be raiding the vase [ __ ] me it's not a man idiot that's why you watch hmm alright so this is the sativa I want to burn it off at least one time because that other oil was still on there I see now this one I like the taste of this one better the Strawberry Cough it has like a nutty nutty like little bat tastes a little nutty and earthy and pine eNOS to it it has that cannabis taste like I might think it's because I'm still Adam I'm still just tasting it out mmm here's my here's my thoughts on this so um they're grams I know it's not every store that has it I know some of them have this the the shatter and it's only gonna be a limited supply they said they would be getting it hopefully in stock soon they're seeing how this went and it wasn't the highest THC content or the clearest that I've seen but it's no bad I it was $60 I got a discount and I end up paying eighty one dollars for both grams so at the price that I paid I'm not even mad it tastes pretty good um but yeah that's a tea but I you know I'm an indica person but I gotta say it like the sativa a little bit better I'd I do I do I think it's pretty but it just hit me you know I mean it's got a good it's gonna cook these do it surely ain't mad at you I a lot of people were talking [ __ ] about it and they were like [ __ ] I don't like people who down products that they don't try cuz I'm gonna give you my honest review on it you know I mean it's not bad if I paid $60 before I would have been a little bit mad cuz I know I could have got something with a higher THC content but at the price that I paid I ain't mad securely I ain't mad get that little THC content up clear that up a little bit I think would be good to go so what are you guys is thought Such anyone else out here in YouTube plan any of you guys try the shadow if so were your opinions and do you think if it was dark it means it was bad I don't think that cuz I've

Sanford so by the way shout out to them because they that's where I got it from so you know hey that was literally five minutes away from my job not mad at you alright guys so yeah okay bye sorry bye bye I'm done I'm done I'm done", "xLuO9hF25fA": "yah what's going on people it's time for new video in this one we'll be teaching you how to dab without a know this was gonna be directed to the people that wanna Tory dabbing that want to press out their own roles in but don't have either add a break or a nail that they can put onto a bong and dab with that but we get into this or do you need to see these videos were intended for people they're 18 years and older and they're made for educational and entertainment purposes only now it's gonna be quite a short one today is it gonna be anything too crazy there's one method that I do want to go over there are a couple other methods that you can use however I feel that this is probably the easiest and the most foolproof one because if you've got some oil you know and if you're used to smoke an oil you know how precious the stuff is you don't get much of it and wasting some of it is a [ __ ] nightmare so what we're going to be doing is known as a cherry bomb now if don't know what cherry bomb is it's where you get a bowl of weed in a bomb you torture up and then you dab on the cherry okay it sounds a little bit weird but when you go through it name so I've got my daily driver bong here and I've got my bowl now when you're doing this you want to be prepared do not fumbling about trying to get things ready while you're hitting the ball first thing you want to do is pack a bowl of weed nice and tight make sure you get that really nice and compact you're probably gonna need a torch or a form of jet lighter in order to get this going hot enough to be able to dab off of it properly I'll tell you why you would doing everything this specific way as we go but basically when it comes to packing the ball you want it to be as dense as possible because you want it to stay in the bowl for as long as possible because your focus isn't gonna be hitting the bong your focus is going to be vaporize in your oil and you're gonna just be using the weed as a tool to do so so having a bit of weed in with there here is a bonus but it's not what you're focused on so make sure it's nice and packed and you've got a lighter that will get it hot as [ __ ] that we just got your bong ready make sure you get yourself a nice little dab ready we've pressed actual rolls and earlier I hope you can see that that's gonna be our dab for today now my recommendation with a dab some people like to get a nice little glob on the they're dubba regardless of how you want to do it make sure that you've got it nice and stringy you don't want it to be dense pieces of oil but they'll take a lot longer to vaporize off of the cherry so the thin area is and the less that's all bunched together the easier this is gonna melt and burn and you're not going to end up wasting any because at some point or another that weed is gonna pull through and if you haven't finished all your oil and it hasn't completely vaporized you're just wasting your dab I'm gonna show you what that looks like does a [ __ ] up doing this video as you can see the oil just wasn't melt in it was staying in one big glob and then you end up getting all the ash just attached to the oil itself so you can't even dab it after so it is literally just a waste of it so like I said make sure is straight so soon this is a completely [ __ ] it the first time we're gonna do it again properly I've made a couple changes I've change the bond so it's an easier angle also got myself a different daddy this one is a lot prettier it's definitely smaller but this is purely just for an example so you can see exactly what you're doing where is it there we go so as you can see we've kept the dab a lot stringier than the last one did the problem with the last one was we left it too long it was just chilling on the side of because it's hot where I might name it just sort of collapsed on itself so we've managed to keep this one nice and space tight waiting the wasted of all time we ain't gonna [ __ ] up any more [ __ ] we're just gonna crack on and do this oh Jesus well I say throughout the making of this video I have set a trend I've just [ __ ] everything up that's no different for the last clip the video that recorded basically forgot to zoom I so literally it was just this part of my face on the screen and that was it [ __ ] stupid software I just come back and basically say what I said but in a better version though the whole thing that I wanted to get across is the fact that this is a legit way to dub it does work and after I'd hit those I did not feel like I just smoked balls I definitely could tell that I've had oil so if you do want to dab either on a budget or if you just haven't got a rig you haven't gotten there or something that you can dab off of this is definitely a good alternative so not quite the same as hitting off of of course bang on or something but it's a good middle ground and it is the best way to experience your first stab should you not have the right tools also I do want to say one thing it's not only to this video but we are approaching 420 subs now I wasn't gonna do a celebration video and 10,000 subscribers but then I finally realized well I've got in for 420 I know it's a wee Channel so that's what we're gonna be doing I ain't gonna give too much away just though it's gonna involve edibles should be quite good video so if you're new to the channel and you haven't already subscribed please do subscribe if you want to see that video anyway but that being said I'm gonna wrap this video up when I finish editing I can upload a few guys hopefully I'll see in the next one soon", "j3CRe2-R8Yg": "cheers this film [Music] [Music] yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back - true so I have another training review for you guys in this video actually a concentrate review we're going up with a brand trip and we're going over the the wedding cake chatter so here's the package for you that's pretty simple so I'm really not gonna go over it because it's just just a [ __ ] envelope but if you want um there's our social medias right there so you can go check them out if you want to do some more research on know more but every what I mean so there you go on that um besides for that you guys know what [ __ ] wedding cake is I'm sure like everybody does by now she smoked weed I've got one gram of shatter gold wedding cake that's what it says the harvest eight six twenty seven nineteen which is like two two months ago from the day I'm recording this so not too old they have a size four that there's really just and what I mean so let's it's sealed by like a little sticker right there so I dropped it so let's go ahead and like take that stick with I'll crack the steel and open this [ __ ] up so yes oh I didn't open this thing up so so so we got it open Ned pretty self-explanatory pretty simple packaging I mean it's [ __ ] dope it gets the job done like it definitely gets the job done and it looks [ __ ] dope with it I mean just not really much to say about it like it is what it is you know what I mean so yeah um inside that though he's in parchment paper and your shadow right there so go ahead and open this up oh yeah just looking fire I'll get some close-up shots for you guys in a second here you guys go it right off the bat that's just looking [ __ ] fire so let me get some close-up shots at my phone real quick for you guys and then tell me down below in the comments where you guys think of it like looks-wise on then we'll get the [ __ ] spoke initiate you know what I mean so yeah just give me one second and then we'll get into this [Music] I got like 30 seconds recorded on my phone so I got some close-up shots for you guys but oh but yeah I want to start smoking on this channel I'm trying to get high right there for a second but not for oh I'm trying to focus on this so the TAC you're in though I'll give that sugar rating already I mean like it could it's [ __ ] dope for like for what it is you don't mean like a lot of companies issues like rebel envelopes and like they finally just white and boring you know I mean I always say if they went out of their way like to like put that like whole 3d and not 3d effects but like um what do you call that shiny effect on it and make it look oh I like make their own car inside its cardboard - it's not like plastic paper so yeah it's cardboard it's not paper - that's a plus but besides for that like it's nothing really too fancy there's definitely like wait [ __ ] more cool like I mean like the packaging is whatever I mean like you're gonna throw it away anyways it doesn't really [ __ ] matter but there's some companies that like that go out of the way and it makes it go faster packaging you know what I mean so it's just even though it doesn't really matter it's just kind of cool sometimes but on a scale of one to five I'll give that like a three out of five maybe a 3.5 out of 5 just because like like I said it's dope as [ __ ] for what it is like it's just a [ __ ] envelope or like for being just like a generic envelope it's not like them just a plain white one that they did their own thing I mean so look at that like half a point for being like creative and unique but they can get something more unique you know what I mean but besides for that it the next thing the looks of it looks of the shatter on a scale of 1 to 5 this shit's looking [ __ ] fire it's looking I can see like a lot of that you can see the Terps in it's looking like a little saucy ass definitely looking [ __ ] fire I don't know tumble down below in the comments what you guys think of it good you guys already [ __ ] seeing it but here's another look at it definitely looking [ __ ] fire now I constantly pick up this leg trip I pick them up all the time this isn't my first time trying them because I've worked in love their products probably they're an arizona-based brand but if I'm wrong and down below in the comments but I already know the kids are gonna be [ __ ] high quality all the time and especially for the price point so I believe their grams like normally like $40 45 50 and they chorus and like better like THCA like tops up shelf [ __ ] that goes for like more like 60 80 but like this stuff was up 40 dollars a gram yeah that's just 40 bucks a gram so but 40 [ __ ] dollars a gram that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired and they're constantly like I would say like at least once a week or once every other week they have a buy one get one free deal so you can pretty much get it for like 20 bucks a gram you can't [ __ ] beat that right there like that's not [ __ ] steel you know what I mean fire uh so the price point I mean not the price point oh I guess we could do both with the price point I'll get that [ __ ] like a when they had the buy one get one free deal five out of five laptops but even like forty bucks a gram for this [ __ ] that's still like a five out of five for like a four and a half out of five that's this isn't [ __ ] fire like I mean just off looks and then like the looks of it like just like I'm having I mean I've smoked their [ __ ] product like their products before but in this video I haven't smoked any of this yet but it's based off the looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fires it based off the looks I'm gonna give it like a in between a four and A four and a half out of five so like up one two out of five that makes sense you know what I mean oh yeah enough talking I feel like I've been rambling let's get into [ __ ] smoke now so I'm gonna get a little smaller not a small dab but a little a little decent dab you know I mean because we're getting a little taste test first see how this is so look you guys can like show you guys how well it's gonna be kind of hard for me show you but like you obviously see how it's melted on the side it's just like super saucy you can just like screen that up I don't know how well that's the cameras picking that up it's like the sides are like super turkeys like sauce you know I mean our room is cold as [ __ ] so it looks like there's no weight like noted but that's [ __ ] fire um but yeah my good at like a little decent dab nothing crazy big get a little taste test going see what this just isn't like and then other we take this would take a couple of bigger dives and get a little high test going see how I'm feeling you know what I mean so that's not Vince's it's a little bit like um shatter sugar flats like kinda has like a little bit of a sugar texture to do that that makes sense but say here's the dab like I said it's nothing [ __ ] huge nothing too small but it'll get the job done mr. Bellamy smoking that up for the nothing too fancy that's like a generic rigna didn't like name-brand but to recyclers that's where you do a pretty dope right but now so it's good this tastes though it's going to go one the pot like I said yeah [Music] my card caps so I'm just gonna use this um it'll work it'll get the job done just a [ __ ] little empty box containing you know what I mean so yeah where's that that here it is so if you guys are smoking on long cheers I hope you guys have smoked with something dank and let's get this little piece that's going because I want to take some [ __ ] fat dabs and get high so yeah let's go choose super smooth super clean the fire honestly on that first not really much flavor like it was just super clean like super smooth with Jonah man the guy didn't even call I didn't even have the urge to off like some correct wedding cake is like a cross train between like your spell cookies and what is it a trick chirayu pie right if I'm correct it's kind of shut up like a sweet earthy taste to it I guess I've been since I guess that's what I could say I had I got a sweet earthy taste to it cuz it didn't really have much flavor um it just tasted fire like some pure wax you know what I mean like I don't know maybe on this next to I'll taste it a little bit more of it'll go on for a fatter Deb multi-hit alone I don't know my rate is probably gonna change after I take this tab but just based off that first hit the this taste I'll probably give like a four or five yeah that's going for it fatter dad now sir yeah all right so I'm take a pretty fat dab right here so yeah let me take a little snake and that [ __ ] looks far like I don't know like you could just see like a little of the Turks in it like yeah like a head like that sure your wax texture to it I don't know like I don't know if you guys can really see you okay there's some oh my finger take my thumb but I don't know how I can get the camera to focus on a little bit better maybe you guys can see it I don't know it just has like the [ __ ] look I don't know it just has like it like some like a turf texture to it but I don't know if you guys can see no oh yeah that's a dive about the tape pretty [ __ ] fat so I guess this would be like a little high reading if for 40 bucks a gram line it should have [ __ ] fire there whatever seals like dripping in our area definitely pick it up yep and if you have like a buy one get one free deal definitely don't miss out on that which is called the quarter twenty bucks I don't even see how they're like I don't know that makes me wonder like how cheap they're getting it for like they cost them to make it like this sign it for 20 bucks a gram you know there's still probably like making a hella profit off but and it's [ __ ] fire sign above you know what I mean but I don't know it's just [ __ ] weird but threat of smoking along I hope you guys are smoking something thank you you guys are cheers Cheers [Music] [ __ ] bro [Music] so I don't know how well that uh smoke showed up on the camera because I think he brought us lights and a makes it like alright for my camera to pick up the smoke sometimes but I took that dad but like the perfect temperature is so light I mean like you think I got a lot of smoke but for like the size of the dab it wasn't as much smoke as a room only thing but like inches because I [ __ ] took it at like a low temperature you know I mean but like I definitely [ __ ] got all that [ __ ] in my lungs oh my god that [ __ ] [ __ ] hurt I'm not gonna lie and I'm definitely [ __ ] throwing highs [ __ ] out so if you guys can tell but not like I've been saying that [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] fires [ __ ] I got some more [ __ ] on blue dream crumble rhythm comes in like this little box a little bit [ __ ] different I'm gonna be dropping a review on this [ __ ] soon so if you guys want to see that stay tuned but I'm gonna get the [ __ ] high four point three out of five fire is [ __ ] but this I think some more fire wife's out there but you gotta [ __ ] pay the price but for being 40 bucks it's Stephanie [ __ ] dumb fire you're not I mean um like I don't have any complaints at all in fact uh but um uh yeah overall score I'll give like a four point two out of five I know that's like a weird score but I feel like it deserves more than a four but it's not all the way up for four point five yeah I mean so yeah four point two but yeah if you guys liked this video after the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do what I could show you you know what to do how many if you guys liked them down below in the comments give me video ideas suggestions suggestions anything anything you guys want to tell me you don't blow in the comments that's what the comments

juveniles does this is what I do smoke push past and shadow to go and check them up I try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news Alastair the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile stars coming at you with a cannabis tribute show today we got an exotic strain and it is called two in common so check it out I got an ounce of it it's a for a time so let's open it up dump it over take a good look at it and smoke a joint of it that I wrote and nice padding that light up so let's take a close look at it so when I got it it came nice and like vacuum-sealed up it really nice I also got a nice shadow buyer to try out at the end [Music] so this is an ounce of it trying to hold it so you can see it it looks very nice it has like really nice bright orange hair yeah hold a nice but up close it looks very nice and it is a sativa and it said its average between 28 and 30 you remember like as a strong smoke let's light it up and we'll continue to take a closer look when you get it this is from heaven but when you get it it comes vacuum seal like I said very like nice and very squished together but you've washed it up and it busts still very nice it kind of tastes like really really crystallized like kind of like a smooth frosting and it don't have just like a strong push flavor like most good weed it actually has like times an original taste and probably why sorry [Music] oh yeah that's a definitely a different type of taster was it really expected it but I know it's probably good it tastes pretty good I paid to 24 nouns of this which ain't too bad I'll say tonight came a nice good account I'll give it a 9/10 so this is the bar I will be sampling at the end of the video here so you can stay for the opie tried this kind managed [ __ ] awesome I do really enjoy it I've been wanting some really good different kinds of smoke but a few ounces of smoke at the same stuff mixing it up a little bit as you know cuz I'm doing reviews on you just let your note I'm gonna be doing diletto and platinum cookies next and I just did chocolate stone which pretty much finishes a trio of the skunk like I got chocolates gum yellow skunk a twice gun so go check those oh really explain [Music] so I was expecting to get a new chair for the videos and stuff for my birthday I was gonna bring it on but it's just gonna be a little late so I hope you guys like that when it comes to the nice-looking one so hope you guys like I got new equipment coming for my cameras got new cameras and then mics and all that stuff coming so all my videos will be a lot better quality soon so I hope that you stay for those if you like this give it a sub cuz those will be coming soon [Music] yeah that's pretty my job and my plants are doing good they go with very nicely feminized seeds to do with some other kinds of strains to grow in the minute throwing the monster you guys can see how they do too so I really hope that you're all doing good now that the weather's didn't wanna hope y'all get no doing some [ __ ] stand distant for people but still getting out and having a good time I'll give an overall rating I think of like nine five to ten comments during it's a very good straight it's original type of taste ITC Clinton I'm starting to feel pretty good I feel pretty lifted you know I feel like I'm pretty nice and uplift that I enjoy it I feel nice so I definitely recommend it and just case you're wondering I like to say every once in a while these are the papers I use those you can go see me bio so the biodegradable stuff if you smoke a lot of joint so every that really cheaply we should try them out that's what I use to smoke my joint most of the time so Casey wondered so I did do a review of another type of chocolate bar another THC one it had 250 milligrams too but was only like half the size of this one this one so this one so this one has a nice little pattern on it I guess what to say it just says what it is it's 250 milligrams ten point four milligram extra two per piece so it's 250 milligrams all together and to ten point four two milligrams each week so what I'll do is open it up and I'll try a few and I'll let you know in the comment section later on so here I'll have to put this down [Music] so let's break up a little there's a really nice milk chocolate [Music] so it does have a really nice milk chocolate taste to it I don't really taste too much - you see anybody does taste nice actually the aftertaste I do people he tastes the THC it does taste very nice so this is a shatter bar and you can search at euphoria extractions to find it it tastes very good I do taste the toffee a little bit it does taste very nice I do like the milk chocolate very very good taste so yeah I'll finish this last bit [Music] [Music] it does have a very very nice flavor not too sweet which is very nice and healthy a little bit of toffee tasting so I'm gonna end it there I guess now it's done English so I'll be back but I have to go now that we're all good in stone but I got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm glass you know", "3bmybTbJ7Jk": "banning in Rome smoking weed weed is from the earth God put this here for me and you take advantage man medical knowledge is only a lesson total if you know can't watch this video see you guys it's like midnight medication session for me and uh it happens to be Saturday so call this Saturday and I found the healing corner the other day a couple days ago I picked up a couple products and that may come across a concentrate but I don't think I've had before so I grabbed it's a virus strain from advanced crowell apps and it's called the um there's a lot--oh it's a lot of shatter and what that is it's the gelato crust with the dose you don't so even the gelato press the dough sido is it's a lot yeah so revanche gloves oh I've had it in Flour form before they actually just recently had it out on the floor form it's a fire strained extremely tricked out wicked poet so I'm really excited about trying to cheer for I haven't had a good had a good shatter in a while so I think it's to be a good medication session for me I haven't got my oil rig here kind of pretty nice and clean so uh I'm pretty sure this is gonna be a good one so here it is CTU man P name it's called the hybrid all J and this is clacking eighty-seven percent THC so what I'll just check this out I'll just check it out together here's what we got dance crews think of these musical packets here I [ __ ] stinks oh my god I smoke from way up here oh wow that looks nice there's a lot of it - there it is here's the package itself what's a I'm sorry girl but so we're doing with it looks like this little package a shatter it's pretty damn full okay get this nice little neo print chasing of it and this [ __ ] is just oozed out as you can see all on the sides real nice and clean um plus is a nice soft soft chatter so here's what we'll do you do with these shutters and I really like what's actually in a form like this voice actors could snap off against you and go do they take my hand a little bit use it up like this it's just human do a thing it's really worth you you popped open that's beautiful yeah let's move this over here so you can see so now you can see on the edges here these nice little cleanup spots that's right get this nice solid piece of shatter here but again it's move your point spread out a little bit see real clean like super clean so it's hard but my grants still warm that's one all right now but you can move it click off these nice girl you know sherry dabs this is there's a lot of just like shaking oh thanks yeah yeah we just see okay so intently that's it one pretty good dad right here so I got this is my first half mm-hmm you want more of it as you can see I mean you do get a nice amount of shatter and this one's really workable some of the other you jail shutters you touch and it kind of just goes everywhere this one's a lot more malleable and workable so a couple dad's right here dick going and yeah we're gonna medicate so again there's my dad that imma do right now oops I'll get one we're going I'll be good for the night everybody take the shower so what granted it's hard to give you some super nice footage to work with I mean cuz it's just it is it's just shatter so it is what it is but to take more or less the name of the game when this one's give you the potency and the effect of the medicine because I did a lot of strain itself has always been very wicked fire from my experiences with it done here the seat am repeating this first tab here it's pretty chunky - Oh in the Shipping Act it's 35 bucks for the healthcare so they've really been really economical with the prices as well but this should come down off your second here really again this is the Delano shadow from advanced growth apps you've won here in court economy now pause this video grounder the the can't fill requests I click in the country its scroll down let's see the hydrilla J and maybe doing dabs of the Toledo shutters like we already know hey guys let's check the shell well it's like over medicating push it and I would remind me like an iced tea flavor Maxell like Kenna like lemony iced tea it was extremely good and she meant right in the face I don't you could see my eyes right now but they're instantly squinted up like that was fantastic they go from zero to 100 right there I think no medication a Mentalist [ __ ] well it's way too much honestly don't need a second to have it all not even a little bit I'm gonna do it but Wow holy crap alright so as far as the medicating fix let it go it's gonna it's gonna amp you up and kind of eval at the same time my anxiety went away but I got like but I guess it's a hybrid so I got a layout of that I got a lot of energy flake this is a team aside whatever strains are coming from that and then I feel very uh pretty happy definitely good mood changer you know it looks like I like stuff right on the sides here you see oh there's like a lot of that stuff on the sides there that's like this really soft really real Whateley wow it's like the Terps li try it out of it oh my god so I'm scraping up all that [ __ ] sighs right now well that Lucia was wicked soft so I just scraped up all that just seeing with you know and I scraped together kind of like you see it nice little ball and this [ __ ] was soft it was I mean they know the whole thing is soft but it was much softer so I'm curious about how this will having a flavor a different effect on it because it was definitely some really weird stuff on the sides [Applause] yeah well that should calm down for a second um this is gonna be a good night time or a date arm strength and it's gonna be one you're kind of I guess everyday type strains it's gonna get you right where you want to be but it's not to be underwhelming we're all powering to find to get you to right where I need to be so it'd be a good overall every time every day kind of strength for more or less anything just a good overall strength right word yeah well Wow it was oily pieces on the side there the time war of juicy like it real juicy flavor it was delicious Lucius I had some extremely good chatter so uh yeah their shadow game is deadly kicking up nitro they also happen to have the Tina Dean silence pressure enough for a 25 bucks traffic gram so uh it's a dr.

had a very nice taste to it but it wasn't too harsh on the throat or nothing i mean it did give me a good little kick overall tasted very nice has like a nice orange kind of like maybe a little bit citrusy but kind of like an orange taste to it it is nice and strong so the effects you're supposed to get from it is uplifted happy and euphoric so hopefully i feel that way i am starting to feel like a little uplifted and happy already and the taste says sweet earthy diesel and woody i don't really taste that i kind of taste like orangish a little bit like like a sweet flavor it actually tastes really good so yeah it's not bad at all i definitely recommend it it's a pretty good for doing dabs the texture it is it's kind of like a sticky like it's like like i don't know kind of gooey not too hard like it looks kind of hard but it's more like a ghoulish so like i said i'm gonna be doing kind of like a three-part god series i'm gonna do the the gods green crack shadow started off with and then i'm gonna do god's deep purple and then i'm gonna do god's gift and i also got death bubba hydro i already did death bubba um that wasn't hydro just kush so i'm gonna be doing the hydro version of it too so keep your eye out for all those coming i hope you enjoyed the little dab review or shatter review i hope you enjoyed it i hope you're all having a good night peace now it's time

somewhere where medical marijuana and/or marijuana are illegal do not try this at home sup guys chefs here a chef's calm put together another concentrate review for you I'm looking at some killer concentrates nug run lazy OG shatter lazy is going to be a good hybrid I'm guessing probably 60% indica 40% sativa depending on how much food I have on my in my stomach it hits me either way if I have an empty stomach its first thing in the morning and I haven't eaten breakfast or anything like that and I take a big fat gap with a lazy eye hypnotic a sativa a very energetic very talkative dry mouth right away if I eat a big meal like if I have a huge dinner and then dab some lazy right after dinner it's a completely opposite effect the way it hits me is more lethargic more relaxing more completely indica like my head would get very very numb and relaxed my body gets really relaxed my eyes get real heavy and red right away so for me it's a true hybrid that hits me either way just kind of you know depending on what I have in my belly as far as looks go it doesn't get much better I mean it's crystal clear yellow gold very very pliable very workable - some people would call this a SAP instead of a shatter but it's definitely a shadow I've had this piece you know maybe to my fingers here so it's a little bit warm but even with its warmth it pulls right apart like that as you can see the smell it is pretty unique - lazy it's very spicy I'm picking up a little super Silver Haze in there it's really nice the taste with a the the smell comes through into taste a lot of times that's not the case but with the Lazy what you smell is what you get a nice clean piece with some cold water and the flavor is unbeatable an average sized dab is all you need with the Lazy I'm not really feeling the need to take big giant globs in order to get nice and high the the THC level is high enough that just you know an average-size the app puts you right where you need to be let's get right into this Cheers [Applause] then they'll just ate up that Deb completely desire vaporize in a half a second real clean flavor a little bit of maltiness a little bit of sweetness that I wasn't expecting but real spicy like I said the smell if you like the smell you're really gonna like the flavor they were very similar but when I exhale the inhale it's real spicy but when I exhale I get this a little bit of like a vanilla like a malty flavor almost no complaints at all real nice I've been munching on my bag of cookies here as you can see I'll talk about this later so I've got a pretty good amount of food in my stomach and the amount by the immediate feeling is just relaxation my eyes get a little bit heavier I can feel my back you know they let the aches and pains I normally have in my back slowly they'll start to get a little bit that they'll start to reduce a little bit here and there but for the most part the thing I like most about it is the immediate hit I mean as soon as you exhale you know you just took a really good dad I just realized what time it is I have a meeting I have to head out for so I want to wrap this up if you enjoyed this video click the thumbs

distillate today today I'm using the jetty extracts wreckless rainbow 0.5 grams here and this recipe is simple as hell you're going to need 2 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup sugar and your distillate doesn't have to be the jetty it could be anything you prefer and vegetable glycerin is an optional step here I know that jetty comes already activated ready to go I could literally take this push it on my tongue and it get me high that's why I'm super excited about the jetty extracts I actually made a quick little video about this product in particular I'll throw up in the info card but today is simple as hell let's go ahead bring that 1/2 cup of water to a boil add the 1/2 cup sugar push in the 1/2 gram a distillate mix it around put it in our simple bottle and get ready to make some cocktails yeah this is just a mary-jane I ain't do this for my stoners and from my cannabis enthusiast talking edibles and bring it comedy get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session Hey yeah true love for my troopers light it up and I'm on it this might take me way back sweet man I got five on it in the cutter sativa anything that you me break it down like the weed this is trooper Stevie troopers I'm a STONER I'm smoking it's not happy so I hope you find this recipe helpful and to be honest I think you could even simplify it more as you see I had the water pitcher of boiling water I think you could just straight-up add the distillate into that with the sugar already in there and it'd be good to go [Music]", "5chSXBlj8ko": "what's up you guys and today we have another review a

thanks for tuning in for another video this is gonna be a video that I've done before this is on wildflower hemp company they're one of their CBD concentrates it's their CBD shatter so I reviewed their CV shatter last year it was probably one of my three favorite concentrates um from last year so this is a review on their shatter from this year now you saw me review the libraries and so I I bought the shatter in the live resin around the same time but I was more excited for the libraries and since it was limited release so I viewed that but I don't think it's no longer available so I'm gonna be reviewing the shatter so that if there's anyone out there they'd like CD concentrate that some interested in getting some good CD concentrate they'll be able to so wildflower hemp company it's I've talked with the owner a few times on Instagram real cool guy he's out of Oregon and he pretty much grows everything on his own and then used some of that flower and he makes his own concentrates so this is shatter a CD shatter it sells for $30 a gram on his website but if you you can get like 5 grams for $120 so if you buy more you get a pretty good deal I'm just gonna run through the labs on this so CBC 4.77 % CBD 73.5% THC Delta 9 is 0.15 so federally legal THC a is three point nine nine percent so about four percent THC a if you don't know what THC a is th CA turns into THC when heated I don't know what the exact conversion ratio is but I think majority of th see a will turn into THC so this is federal legal since the Delta 9 THC is under point three percent but it has a higher THC a so if you have no THC tolerance this will probably get you high if you enjoy hemp flower that has some THC if you enjoy hemp concentrates that have some THC the THC and low levels tend to bring out the effects of the CBD it's called the entourage affects all the cannabinoids working together so if you like strong hitting CBD concentrates definitely check this out anyways I picked up a couple of grams of this 2 grams of this probably a little bit before Thanksgiving I just haven't got a chance to review it yet but I've got a chance to use it so I'm gonna go ahead and bust it out I wouldn't it's not really like a it's got more of like a gooey consistency it's not like a classic shatter that you know you can snap in half it's got like a nice sugary appearance in CBD concentrates are slightly different than THC concentrates so THC doesn't crystallize until it's like in the upper 90s I believe CBD will start to crystallize once it gets to around 60% so the parents of CBD concentrates are often different than THC concentrates so even though this is called a shatter you may be expecting like what you've a classic THC shadow but this is actually what most CBD shutter looks like that I've gotten so I probably used about a gram of this already so I know the effects on it I'm just gonna smell it right now and tell you it's got a nice piney smell to it a little bit of earthy smell definitely like actually I don't it's got a little piney smell but mainly citrusy it's got a I didn't give you a look at it is it focusing so as you can see a nice dark golden sugary appearance to it and I'm gonna trust my cameraman is doing a good job so I probably had a gram left of this stuff so I'll do add a blast but the effects on this stuff are awesome it's definitely more like I would say like more just heavy relaxation but it's not like it's gonna put you to sleep unless you do a few of them it can put you to sleep but I dab this throughout the day it's the CBD is interesting effects it's almost like a numbing effect on your body not really like your body feels you for it but it kind of just gives you like a numbing feeling which i think is why a lot of people use it for like pain or anxiety the effects are great though I don't know if I want to say this or not but like if you drink a couple of you know nice beers or something this pair is great with that or if you're using any other herbal supplements for relaxation this would pair great for that or if you want to balance out your THC high so let's say you smoked a lot of THC bud and you want a more robust high this would be great I have a lot of friends that smoke a lot of high THC products and they'll come over to my house and I'll give him a couple CBD dabs in the like whoa like I feel a lot higher now but they're like it's more of like a body high not the head high that you get from CHC so if you enjoy using cannabis and maybe in the past it gave you anxiety or paranoia and you want something to relax this is definitely something it has THC but it's more manageable high so the effects on this 10 out of 10 CBD constant this is probably the best CBD concentrate that I've been able to use shadow to wildflower ham so also shout-out to slim jim juicy send me a bunch of rosin and it's rosin and live resin or probably the best forms of concentrate in my opinion so get a nice little dab of this loaded up and also guys if you have any favorite CBD concentrates or any favorite hemp flour this season let me know in the comments because I'll be looking to review that check this out so this is like an essential oil box I was gonna throw it away but I kind of just made it into my little uh concentrate to having holder so yeah any favorite concentrates I think that the country in the u.s. is probably going to federally legalize marijuana within the next couple of years you know it's whether you like it or not it's happening more and more states it's not it's not gonna harm you and it can make people a lot more chill and I think make people think I think something our society is struggling with is like to really think about stuff that you might not normally think about something like cannabis can change the way you think and make you think about things in a different way which I think it can be really beneficial and a lot of people just need something to help them relax and it's a lot better to use cannabis I picked this Bangor up on Black Friday I forget the name of the company I got it from but uh it's got this kind of opaque bottom so it's uh this is supposed to be easier to tell when it's heating up when it has the opaque bottom but I haven't notice that but I have to let this cool down for a minute appreciate you guys watching though I'm gonna be reviewing some cosmic cherry from star seed botanicals it would be the first time I reviewed anything from star seed botanicals this season if you guys haven't noticed there's a the hem quality this season is so much better and last next year will be the same now that there's a higher demand for hemp flour also if you ever go to dispensaries I'm seeing CBD at so many more dispensaries now CBD bud like hemp okay", "3htTQSwx84Y": "when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates [Music] today i'm dabbing on one of my personal favorite consistencies this is called sugar starting to sesh off with this live sugar from grassroots oh god that looks beautiful that sugar is such a pretty bright yellow color all right i'm just gonna dunk it right in there oh ah delicious man holy crap [ __ ] yeah that treyo g is a really dank earthy flavor that's [ __ ] fire got a little bit of sweetness on the back end too it's pretty nice there's a lot of different words that people use to describe cannabis concentrates some of the most popular are ones like shatter sugar butter wax sauce diamonds the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of a concentrate not the actual quality so one isn't necessarily better than the other just based off of its consistency but today we're going to take a deeper look into sugar wax it's a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a dispensary before you've probably seen it on the shelf at least it's created through a solvent extraction process just like shatter or wax but it's not necessarily better or worse than any other consistency it's just different everyone has their preference but personally i think this is one of the better consistencies all around i just think it usually has a nice terpene profile and it's easy to work on a dabber but i don't want to put too much emphasis on the importance of a consistency honestly i've had consistencies change on me before i finish smoking the concentrate honestly if you leave shatter sitting out in the open on a warm day it's not too rare to see it sugar up there's actually a lot of science that's involved when it comes to making concentrates it's a little overwhelming when you just look at it but sugar is really just a term used to describe any sort of cannabis consistency that kind of resembles like a wet sugar there's not just one way to get to the finish line here but no matter how you make it sugar typically has great effects a great smell and a great flavor but it's very sticky and crumbly i don't recommend using your hands on this concentrate i recommend getting a dab tool and scooping it up the stickiness really helps to stick to the tool usually let's just get a nice little chunk on here and get a little bit more than that oh yeah now we're talking i really like this little scooper dabbers i feel like you can get a decent amount of concentrate on them when i'm dabbing on a cloud banger with a turf pearl in it i usually wait about 90 95 seconds before i take my dab we're at 90 seconds right now so let's go for it oh yeah it's gonna be a good tent oh yeah it's perfect god damn i just love weed man it's the best i'm assuming that's something we can all agree on here dude just smoking and dabbing it's just incredible but anyway sugar wax is often found as either a cured or a live resin and the only real difference between live resin and cured resin sugar is that live resin sugar was made with fresh frozen material while cured sugar was made with fully cured cannabis but the main difference between the two is typically with live resin you're going to have a more noticeable terpene profile but it's usually around the same thc sugars usually tend to be around 70 to 90 percent thc sometimes with live resin sugars companies will just get little thc diamonds and sprinkle live resin terpenes on top of that until it's like a little sugary consistency and then they call that sugar there will be a saucy coating over the diamonds it'll look just like sauce just a little more dry it's called sugar as well but it's really not the same thing as sugar wax but sometimes these concentrate consistency names just cover up a couple different consistencies under one name i actually have two perfect examples here as you can see both of these are called live sugar you can see live sugar right there and live sugar right there however this is what was inside of each container as you can see this one on the left is what i was talking about where there's little thc diamonds just coated in a live resin sauce where this one over here is actually more of a waxy consistency but it still is a sugar when you look at them independently you'd say that they were both sugar but when you look at them side by side you'd honestly say that they're kind of different looking concentrates they're not even the same color the saucy consistency is much more of an amber color while this sugar is much more of a yellow color some might even consider this more of a sauce consistency but to me that's sugar you can leave it on one side for a little bit without any of the stuff pouring out of there and live resin sugar and live resin sauce often look very similar to each other the main difference between the two is the thc percentage and the terpene percentage sauce typically has a lower thc percentage and a higher terpene percentage than sugar while sugar typically has the higher thc percentage and the lower terpene percentage but still has a great flavor so that's why i typically like to go with sugar so i feel like you get that nice thc punch while still getting a nice flavor and like a delicious overall experience when it comes to the smell and the flavor but i'm about to take a dab of this saucy sugar now and see which one i like more this drain portlandia is absolutely fire it was actually recommended to me by one of you guys it has a super high mercy level this one it's actually only testing at 2.8 which is still pretty high but i've seen it testing it upwards of seven here's the stats for the portlandia sauce for anyone that wants to see it pretty high amount thc and thca while still having a great terpene profile and i'm actually impressed that the sugar wax had good flavor now that i'm looking at the stats it's over 90 thca but it's still a great terpene profile let me know in the comments whether you guys prefer when it's more of a sugar wax consistency or went into the little thc diamonds with the live resin sauce on top i don't really mind either way i like it both ways again it's hard for me to pick a consistency because really i don't look at the consistency i'm looking at the strain and the thc and the terpene percentages when i'm buying weed and the consistency of sugar is just not uniform in nature it even ranges from like a light yellow to a ambery color like this let's scoop out our dab i think it's almost time to dab too god [ __ ] not dabbing all that i'll drop that though all right wish me luck on this one [Music] huh oh my god [Music] oh yeah killed it oh my god that was a good hit oh my god holy [ __ ] that portlandia is [ __ ] amazing i'm not kidding i'm really glad that whoever recommended that recommended it shout out to you but honestly i just love sugar because of how easy it is to get on a dab tool and honestly i think that it has the dopest melt shots when i'm filming my snapchats however i do feel like it is much harder to do than other concentrates sometimes i think i'm just taking a normal sized dab and then once you drop it in there it just turns into this giant puddle and you're like holy [ __ ] i was not intending all this i feel like when i'm dabbing butter or shatter it's so much easier for me to have an idea for how much i'm taking but when it's those little diamonds and all of a sudden there's just a giant thca rock in there you don't really know how much that weighs and you're like all right well let's find out how high i'm gonna get but i still think that sugar has a pretty nice well-rounded high and flavor no matter what form you have it in and i love flavorful concentrates and sugar is not the terpest there is but i still think that it has a great flavor profile and i think the butter and sauce are probably the most terpy for those who are wondering and if you're new to dabbing do not get overwhelmed if you see all these different consistencies at the dispensary and don't know which one to pick honestly don't even look at the consistency if you ask me just look at the strain and like the thc and the terpenes whatever you're looking for if you're a thc shopper look for the thing that's the highest thc if you like a certain terpene look for the terpenes like when i'm looking for a concentrate i'm looking at the terpene percentages i want something that has a really nice terpene profile most of the time concentrate consistencies are all basically the same thing they're all just different concentrated forms of cannabis it's really the cannabis you want to focus on and depending on the concentrate sometimes it'll change consistencies by the time the company packages it up and it actually gets to you bho does not have the longest shelf life and especially if you're talking about something like shatter or butter they can change consistencies pretty quick so honestly i wouldn't even say that labeling at the dispensary is 100 accurate you really don't know until you see it but that's the video you guys let me know what consistency of concentrates you want me to do next i did this before on sauce and you guys seem to really like it so i'm gonna make it a series so let me know what consistency you want me to do next i can do shatter butter wax diamonds let me know make sure you click that

made shatter I know you know I love shattered my favorite you know form the concentrate yeah we love it stable take a look at this stuff this guy's is not a shadow this is very much you know almost like a almost like a live sugar like I actually have some live sugar it resembled that more than des and Shatter you know a very large amount of it was oil slick to the parchment that could not even be retrieved unfortunately so there was some loss there you know as far as looks it's not anything fancy you know does have a nice little gloss to it it is a sugar but in fact that you know you know we're calling this shatter as far as D Crower choice you know our dispensary is a made wreaths having this tag as a shattered well this is my shot in no way will form whatsoever there's a shattered now if they told me hey this is some Bruce Banner sugar I would say man then this looks pretty good you know bad the best sugar but it's not bad sugar but to say this is shatter [Music] deceiving so course you know we gotta give it the chance to be the truck as far as the the high on this is actually pretty intense you know it's Bruce Banner is known for it comes on real strong it's it hits you fast you know as you're taking the dab you know you're not gonna think about it but within about I'd say 25 or 30 seconds boom you realize you're feeling it you know you're getting that now grab a chunk of this so as far as so the the taste the taste is a very interesting one has a smooth you know citrus kind of offset to it more like more like a grapefruit than an orange citrus but you know still that same citrus taste however it could just be because of this batch and why it's you know not real shatter II or shatter at all in my opinion it does have kind of a diesel II taste to it as well then I'm not so much used to with Bruce Banner but you know that she could just be this batch however huh as far as taste goes gotta give it a 7 out of 10 so you know it's a tasty one it's not gonna be a taste it's gonna be foul something you're gonna wanna you know take a drink right away watch it out of your mouth actually really good flavor comes with it like I say you know looks are deceiving one thing I like about this is it's a very fork you know it's definitely strong head high it brings on the high sativas you could feel it maybe you know a little bit more than you feel the body highly relaxed with it but it's an uplifting high which is pretty cool you know so this is definitely something you know if you're with a you know group of people or something this would be something you know you throw in the vape in and you know you're having a great night you know you're gonna enjoy it you're gonna have fun so as far as high goes you know I gotta give it an 8 out of 10 like I said looks are deceiving you know I don't like that it's you know I'm expecting shatter and I get sugar but you know that does happen before I mean I've bought shatter and got butter but I mean it's not taint soup or nothing like that thankfully now you know let's get down to it overall and overall high on this Bruce Banner has to be you know got to get with the 7 out of 10 if the looks would great if came out you know looking like you know actual piece of shatter you know like I say you know I make shatter so you know shatter normal everyday glossy glossy shatter that's my 11 strain mix right there this stuff would be a lot more appealing in my opinion we're actually gonna take a little dab of some of my shatter right here you see here you hear the little pop now that's shatter shatter like we know and look not that sugars anything worse not the sugars bad I like sugar it's a good consistency but when I buy shatter I expect shatter there's nothing wrong with that especially in some of these crisis like I said though this is $25 per gram so wasn't bad but when you go for something you know we like to get what we were looking for and sometimes it's just kind of disappointing when you see something that you're getting excited you go to opening look at hey but like I said it looks on this in particular strain we're deceiving because like I said you know overall high on this is a 7 out of 10 I mean the high on this rating is 8 out of 10 but the overall is the 7 out of 10 it's definitely something like to get again but now I'm gonna be at least be expecting it to possibly be like this and unfortunately that's not always a good expectation to go into a shop think and say hey you know the product and buying may not actually be what I'm looking for it's the same strain it's just a different consistency but anyways here we go with a nice shattered ad right here for you knock down our little backpack is there you know the one good thing I will say about this though is that you know rating THC wise as far as percents go came in at 71% so that's pretty good you know 25 for a gram of that it's not bad but like I said overall 7 out of 10 looks we're deceiving on this one hopefully next time they come up with what it was I did pick this up a brief to reach dispensary in North Las Vegas location which you know is still my just my dispensary a choice you know a little bummed it I you know I didn't get what I was expecting but you know sometimes I haven't thought of life you don't always get what you want but we get what we need anyways to

channel there isn't really anything new taking calculus so I'm gonna have to slow down with the videos again I'm still gonna put out regular contact as I do but you know whenever I can other than that I had a pound sold for me so I'm not happy about that either but that that's more so personally that doesn't affect me and you know but for this video we're really just going to be talking about ethos genetics and my opinion about them as a company as a whole generally speaking I think they're a great company they've achieved a lot of success in the last couple of years since I first saw the mythtanic on I saw them carry on 2018 in Massachusetts and I purchased a few seed packs room and even right now right actually right next to where the cameras recorded an attempt of four movies in there which I'll show you but ethos genetics to me has always been a it's they're almost like Apple products for for cannabis seed people they the service presentation they have is phenomenal they're at almost every event they give out free packs all the time they have great user interaction on social media they produce obviously the most important thing they produce fire genetics the only issue I've ever had and which is why I say is sometimes you'll get a little bit of hermaphrodite strength like insane the membrane was one of those dreams where I talked to other people who were growing it and they had hermaphroditic characteristics meaning they expressed both male and female sexual traits which often results if you have exceeded bud which to the eyebrow is completely up I mean if you're hoping to make money off of it you're hoping it's okay you don't want to so there's that criticism but that to their defense ethos your guys's defense the process of making a seat feminized does increase the chances of mutations such as that like you know such as that happening there that's not even the only communication that there's like plant albinism there's there's parts of the planet that'll just randomly blowing nose like I'm haven't seen like a leaf just growing up this is because cannabis plants are mast cells meaning any of their cells could convert into whatever they need at any point which is why the chance for hermaphroditism even exists in case there's no males if there was ever a population where there were no males that one of the females will turn into a male still the role that's just how it grew it is a weed now what I'm going right now this is oral cut cookies and I really like this one a lot it's not I can already tell it's not going to have as much of the yield as the in Sangamon great but the way the notes look is how I want them to look their very trunked out very colorful I'm going to show you footage of that if I haven't already I'll should probably show you some more gonna do that who the [ __ ] cares but yeah overall I've been pretty happy with each ocean X now me personally I haven't been able to get the nose that huge yet but I chopped it up to my own user error I'm still kind of learning as a grower I am using Remo nutrients a couple of other supplementary brands as well but mostly Remo nutrients any you guys have advice to give some you know if so what's the secret they dig about them over to it I'm all ears and as for the [ __ ] that stole my pound you're an [ __ ] enjoy the video guys I hope you enjoyed the footage my criticism if you're thinking about buying because genetics I hope this video helped you a lot and if you haven't already smoked while watching this video that I hope you get hot right thank you", "wAru6geqGU0": "[Music] hey what's up 4/20 fam we're back again we got another strand of you guys we're looking at some concentrate today guys we got this orange cookie shatter the reef dispensary guys this is gonna be coming in at seventy four point five percent THC and let's see that eight high mean 1.29 milligrams being my nursing at one point seventy three and limonene at 0.50 and line Alou at zero fifty milligrams so that's not too bad guys it does have a two point eight milligrams CVD rating on this so that's also pretty good thing if you guys are recurrent medical side we're gonna go ahead we're gonna jump into it we're gonna take a couple down look you guys we're going to talk about it so of course with the shattered reviews are a little bit different looks the ports are always a bit quality when it comes to shatter so first and foremost let's check it out see what it looks like so as you guys can see at the very beginning you you know we're gonna get close to not to to you know super fancy but it does kind of a nice now we could talk about it all the time let's actually yeah get into it so first rate we're gonna hit there's gonna be this little hi meds helix rig we got right here alright guys so as far as looks go I'm gonna go right ahead we're gonna hit it with seven out of 10 it doesn't look bad do my best help you guys get a good view of it all right Venus okay you drink shout out Raiders it's that raider love guys you know about it go try to fake it you know you love and even if you ate them you love all right guys grab those dams get them ready get your

go Cheers three to this one I love it no stuffers a lot has a lot of flavor in it this is what I was informed is called a in cycler versus a recycler actually never tried relieve that picked it up because it was such a unique piece very thick glass very durable tested so that case is absolutely wonderful if I had to absolutely rainy Mountain eight out of ten on the taste of this orange cookie it tastes [ __ ] amazing guys holy whoo gotta love it alright well I catch my breath guys take a second nice amber color nice really good turvy taste even though it doesn't have very high levels of like mercy you know I never have a very citrus application so I love that still smoking a little alright guys so we're gonna hit it on the other honey break with a little bees on any of you guys got a check check it out I love this one I figured you know we'd go orange we got the one cookie we have to oh sorry I don't know likely right there yeah the dad's guys you have to we're gonna end this video with this so taste definitely it's a eight looks seven out of ten smell sometimes like well it has a little bit of a smell I mean shattered normally doesn't have her smell all these crumbles butters things like that when I really come across a lot more Turkey but shatters normally not so much so as far as if I was to its part like this if I was to choose a rating for the smell I would give it a 4 out of 10 it's not very strong there is a little bit of tones to it but not for anything that's just draws right away to you to think oh my goodness your mind is going I smell this wonderful so in my opinion smells I really don't go for when I come to shatter no no taste taste is absolutely wonderful high on this absolutely incredible is low guys cuz I have been dabbing on this a little bit to get the feel well you guys know how to do my reviews I want to get a real aspect for it before I tell you guys I want you guys jumping in on something that's not really for you now if I was to burn overall on it I'd give it a 7 out of 10 it's a very good strength definitely something I'll pick up again definitely something you should try it become across it so nice and toasty one so I mean it's just kind of a it's definitely a relaxing strain it's more of the calming indica dominant hybrid it gives you a lot more of your relaxed that you're looking for in some of these strings so I recommend it to anybody wants to get some relaxation so cheers guys oh yeah this one really pulled up with flavor whoo all right guys you guys already know if you guys like the video like the video you guys want to subscribe subscribe from where you know I got a lot more content coming out and as always to all my gifted out there you guys got to stay lifted you know stay tuned I got a lot more stuff coming for you guys giveaways videos products you know peace", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram

coming up soon [Music]", "PXvwzsZ2Reo": "with woody from up coffee carry extracts one of my favorite extracts when I'm here in Colorado so what's so special about your lab in the extra so one thing that's unique about apothecary extracts is we're vertically integrated we grow all of our cannabis here in-house and most of it is actually sold out of our dispensary locations we have three locations in Colorado Pueblo Colorado Springs and Denver awesome yeah I went to the Broadway one last night and got some fire yeah let's go check it out so we have how many plants we got the building here James this is one of three cultivation sites that we operate we're gonna go check out the bedroom so this is the badging room right here wow this is nicely set up yeah one thing you'll notice is the environment here it feels really it's almost almost a perfect environment oh yeah perfect each room changes its own hair so you can see three different scales of production all the plants that you see over there on the left are getting ready to flip over into flower here within the next week so that's how high we it's awesome some unique strains that we grow here the Tropicana cookies the jam band our in-house project the raspberry lychee who we also have blackberry banana Kush lemon GE one of my favorite new strains classic we grab the star dog Death Valley cheese the blue lemon tie among a few other streams you got it going on right now well I was I did a live feed on the way here and I talked about I could see that you you and your team really care about the product what you present to the people his highest standards you know absolutely you know one thing that you will find is all of our you know the higher ups at apothecary are true connoisseurs and passionate about the product really passionate about cannabis concentrates and we do everything in our power to put out a really clean Heitor bean extract awesome let's check out some more stuff they extracted out sorry it's funny this is the starter he runs the squash op this is our solving this extractor awesome so maybe we can get him on policy got a nice little present yeah yeah peer pressure but he's getting ready to do some pressure you get some bottle and I can show so what happened looks almost empty now we actually just moved into a new facility Friday is our new Pueblo map this will it will still be an operation that we may end up doing something at this facility but really all of our operations will be down look at this but now this is a bubble ash well boats training to look around for all got to get my nose on this we all need are these looking out beautiful but my quantity - one is 777 he said he might come yeah it said and then when they press this oh my gosh fire and then when they put it into one of these in the back oh you get some diamonds from this diners philosophy but you can actually die map dot - that's how fine it is we got some stuff here right now what's the average time you leave stuff in the back depends on like if you want to make really nice diamonds oh so like if you would make really large diamonds you know three weeks plus but for just a basic crystallization I mean these guys can crash on a jar overnight I want to show you this is some of us it's that pressure still no some raspberry cheek batter ooh what was some rosin look at this rosin here that's the and you know as saltless is becoming more and more in demand that's all the Salinger's one thing flower refreshment work one thing I really like about someone's fashion you can't line up supplements okay witness hydrocarbons don't even really clean up an extract that's absolutely you know poisons and sprays you know just a really deficient plant and and you can clean it up so nobody knows that is the diffusion length with rosin you can't you know you don't have a great product you're not going to make your awesome or it's going to be something that's so undesirable nobody wants to smell bad it tells me that it takes my bark to speak of looking at on the right point nine percent THC a 99.999 point but 99.99999 point THC a right there that's a big jar guys I'll nobody can see how much is in there because it's so white but there's what so now which one are you getting ready right now what is this Sarah diesel so the sour do you said that we just looked at those 25 25 micron well it's different Mike but now can you explain the difference on Mike grunts real quick the smaller size is what you learned yet and why are you different sizes that sometimes each side smell is broken down to a different granules and holes usually secondly is the most impressed I was working is we're really just going to go weekend and now you want to even write you do you don't want no gaps or anything why is it that you don't want to gaps in there so that way whenever you squish it out it's all messed up even so everything awesome thank you it's free to go with us yeah oh man look at all this stuff working yes it this is all bubble hash in your people what else we got here you have anything besides these are a raspberry Gucci right more raspberry lychee that's a East Coast sour D cross at the blackberry cush Wow grown and bred in house a type object it's a real angel oh wow that does that mean Wow and that's the things like you know watch it took me a newt it even creates tips up to absolutely different Turkey yeah in mind you don't get that true expression until it gets pressed yep you know what I mean you know the strain could have very little smell in bubble hash form and then when it's finally pressed out it's just as loud as ever so much repressed sometimes or it's high in goes I are right because that truther people we're going to move on to the production facility where everything gets packaged graham set out so here we are in the packaging area of apothecary extract so this is some jamman that we are getting ready to draw at the various facilities oh that is so means this Jamaican skunk crossed with the headband yeah all saw the was nice she's got a very very unique oh so that's actually so that's the higher micron yeah so check that out yeah rosin is just getting turf here and better to love the science behind it I just you know what I was I said I've been in two decades I dreamed it you go like this but I never dreamed that it would go yeah so yes so all of our all of our saltless is in this essentially woodgrain lid just as a way to differentiate between our Soliman hydrocarbon your high quality stuff ended up absolutely laughs the shadow games rings laughs a shot yeah it's getting ready to you like it looks like you're like a kitchen actually I can't kitchen kitchen cooking but it's not you all chatter yeah let me show you what we got here all proper and I Turkey everything we do is about preserving the Turks there's our bubble hash makers right there 15:28 packagers know what does the average pakistani do - how many do pack a day ground on a lot and they needed 600 40s live version last month I think we grabbed out just medically it was like 53 thousand grams and then in inch on average a you guys back all the coastal up for

smell it okay so what it looks like [Music] they put the little peepee on the bottom side the purple punch and you get like a berry smell a sweet smell a little bit of a purple smell the strain is purple punch or punch is a sweet and sedating in the cut dominant hybrid the genetics are Larry og and granddaddy purple and it's known for smelling like grape candy or kool-aid the healthy dab from

the berry flavor comes through I also get a lot of pine flavors overall flavor-wise I'll probably give this a 3 out of 5 the price is five out of five being at $15 [Music] the cool thing about the strain is it gives you a two punch effect both to the cerebral and to the body this is a perfect strain paired with desserts or as a dessert the effects may help with nausea stress body aches sleeplessness the main flavors that I smell from this is the berry and the sweet I get hence maybe Hensel flickery but doesn't come through very well on this batch and that's the purple punch by

stuff is just make sure you don't want no more than that that's the perfect amount stir that in there mix in there first before you put your concentrating in writing down turn down the heat all the way too low make sure we're making this you be patient because you want to make sure you strike you know concentrate in chocolate at the right temperature so it can go into the mold and a perfect temperature so you're concentrating don't it's like they're so careful two minutes okay so now I think this is at the right temperature and we have our concentration different prices different

there [Music] they see me I don't have patience for this it's easier to pour chocolate into the mold so the chocolate doesn't start stiffening up on I don't know how many chocolates wasn't gonna get

WE DID REACH OUT TO NEW MEXICAN NATURAL MEDICINE, WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK.", "_NjcqNifHfc": "what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with something a little different this time so what i did is i went to the liquor store and i got a gram within 10 price range of a sativa and i got a gram within a 10 price range of an indica so i'm going to try to roll up a nice joint of both of them and see which one seems to be better or rate both of them anyway see which one comes on top they're both 20 thc so it should be a fair fight so let's get into it i'm gonna roll a nice joint and get this started this here is one gram of the tweed backstreet exactly how it came in the container and this here is exactly one gram of the edison lime light this is the endica and this is the sativa this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view we're back and i think i'm going to start off with the baker street from tweed simply because it's a lot drier because i'm going to give the edison company a point because in the limelight it has the thing to keep it fresh so it's a lot fresher than the than the baker street is from tweed so i'm gonna start off by smoking this one because it'll go quicker and then we'll smoke the limelight so let's light this up and get into the battle of the buds i just thought of that i thought it'd be a cool name so that's what i'm going to call these little episodes so it does have a very nice taste it's not the strongest flavor but it does have a very good taste to it it's like i can taste a bit of like sourness to it but not over overly kind of like the diesel type it tastes from the sour diesel kind of taste in it it actually tastes really good though i do like that flavor so there's nothing wrong with that and i did do a close-up before i rolled the joints so i'm going to show you that here in a second but it'll hold the butt up for you these ones like i said are a lot drier so they bust really easy like and the powder just by simply pressing on the bud so i gotta be careful holding it up so i don't pulverize it into powder but i think that's a really good idea to have the things there that keeps it really fresh because it helps it stay nice and moist we're not moist but it's doesn't crush the powder as soon as you press on it you know i guess it's good for some cases but it's not the greatest for others so i'll show you the close-up right now that's the [ __ ] i like this dynamite bomb is in the bomb then i light it up blow it to the sky and i can't deny i'm not me when i'm not high no i'll if i just stand by and pop the fight blow it up to the sky and canada so what's sweet up in my pocket not the caulking popping but i got one [Music] so that was the baker street by tweed it's a nice looking strain but as you see coming up the limelight has a not a lot nicer look and i think it's just simply because of the what the hell are these called anyways whatever the hell these are called something boost those help a lot though to any companies that are thinking of starting up or you already have one you should put these in there makes it a lot better i can definitely tell the difference especially having them right side by side like that and what's wrong when it's powder sometimes it's hard to get like a toke and then like even sometimes like the smoke won't go through it because it's too powdery and stuff like that so sometimes it's good like especially if you smoke it in the bomb but it ain't always the best for a joint let's see how much faster this joints joint's burning compared to usual because it's really dry but there is nothing wrong with it it does taste good it's a good smoke and you can't expect much i guess from the liquor store for ten dollars so it isn't that bad at all yeah try to hold it up so you can see it it's really not that bad that's pretty much what that i got left from the gram after rolling this which ain't too bad it is just a gram after all so i think i'll give the baker street from tweed for just a single gram or whatever i'll give it a 3.5 out of 5. it's not that bad for a cheap little gram some 3.5 for that but the edit the limelight for medicine already got a little unfair advantage just because it was not really unfair they're the ones who threw it in there so i get an extra point for me for the texture of the limelight i'm going to give it a little bit of minus because it's dry as hell i mean you can't get butt any drier so that's but 3.5 out of 5 for raiding ain't too bad i think we'll get into lighting up the limelight so this one isn't as dry like i said so it wasn't quite i mean like i'm didn't have to like what like powder like it's hard to get it all up you have to use the thing to scoop it up or whatever this one kind of just breaks up nice and like nice little bud so it's easier to put in a thing and just roll nicely so i got this nice joint i'm gonna shut up and light it up so the limelight has a little bit of a stronger flavor i don't know if it's because it's kept fresher or what but it tastes a little nicer i didn't actually give the little the baker street a sniff test so i'm going to give it a sniff test real quick i'll give them compare the smells so the limelight or the baker street i can smell it a bit but it's not very strong smelling the limelight it has a little bit of a stronger smell but not that much of a stronger smell does smell pretty good they both smell cleverly the same but the limelight has a little bit of a higher scent not very much but it does have a lot stronger of a flavor this one tastes very good so to be honest i usually like indicas but so far it seems like the sativa is a little better in this case i think it's simply because it was stored better and has the thing i mean the tweed containers a little nicer but really what's it matter i don't care if it comes in a bag half the time the best ones come in a little bag so i don't really care about the packaging so here i'm going to show you guys the um my lights over here so i got to hold it up like this so i'm trying to hold it so you guys can see it good but here i'll just throw the close-up now that's what's up so that is the close-up of the limelight like i said you can see a big difference how that little package thing made it a lot better for uh i guess for storing it because it's a lot fresher feeling it's a lot nicer looking in the end so i'd say like i said if you're a company definitely use those things if i start something up i'll have to definitely try to use those but i don't know if you see my last video but i'm gonna start giving away juvenile style stickers so if you want one hit me up juventus juvenile styles at gmail.com or just let me know in the comments we'll figure something out i'll give an overall rating to the limelight i'll give it a four i'll give it a three point five vote of four because i want to give it too high out of five because i want to give it too high one because it's just a cheaper grab but just keep that in mind it has it's a little bit better than the tweed baker street just because it's a lot fresher and stored a lot better and yeah they're both pretty good grams for the price range i think they're both like 950 ish something like that so definitely worth it worth it definitely worth it i recommended you only have 10 bucks and you need to go get a gram somewheres go try them out and i'll throw a plant update here either before or after this so i think it's day 55 now 56 something like that and i'll have to look but we're getting up there and they're almost done so i'm excited for that i hope you all are doing good and hope you all get some good [ __ ] to smoke at home thanks for spending time here with juvenile styles pace i know it's gonna be all right i got the light for the rate i fight rip the mug and pack it in the pipe give that delicious butter light inhale when it goes [Music] it's dead it's okay", "t-jjilGQ_HY": "man ain't enrolled smoking weed waited from the earth God put this here for me

] excited about this train it's from advance girl labs and I've never had this strain before just the name of it alone is making me go nuts um it's the LSD quick we're gonna trip I I don't know what a trip and it's not technically LSD like the paper bladder acid but it is the strain LSD and it's actually in the shatter form um they don't have them flour yet which they if they do I'm [ __ ] definitely gonna get that too but as of right now it's just in in chatter form and hey I'm pretty appreciative about that alone and if you've never heard of the LSD it's supposed to actually have like a real psychedelic effect when you smoke it's supposed to be like heavy heavy potent psychedelic effects and also it's supposed to UM be very euphoric and it supposed to have a long lasting medication effect on you also it supposed to have a really good body in like cerebral high because the there's a decent my supposed to be a small to some decent lot CBD as well the lineage on LSD I'm real quick on that it's the UM it's kind of a funny name it's the mazar-i-sharif the mazar-i-sharif crossed with a skunk number one so the mazar-i-sharif cross the skunk number one um i supposed to as far as like statistic states what's definitely really earthy pungent you know scent to it so we'll find out and i'm really excited about this we need a dad dope i got to sneak up here in the attic for a little while whole house shut down so a little bit meantime medication time and i could definitely use these heads [ __ ] up here though so don't mind me from sweat all right so sooo we go i also picked up a couple of the products actually from the healing corner today um I haven't done a review on anyone with one of them iPad before its medibot I'm sure he'll quick these these are from purely check these out these are the lavender lemon bars if you've never had these these things are [ __ ] awesome like they're really awesome they're $20 for three of them down the corner and they're pretty phony you know like 20 milligrams of THC I'm sorry like 28 milligrams a CBD and like almost 70 milligrams TV seeker lavender bar and once he's up and they [ __ ] got a heavy medicating effect me I was very surprised I took him forward they're really great um if you want to say something I'll actually do a quick medical review on those if you want me let me know I'll tell you know also then also

pre-order it all in there right now as we speak in [ __ ] reserves on this [ __ ] they don't have a lot of it so I grabbed a half gram and also got being smart about it another half gram like I said when the fire comes around the smartest thing to do really is to stock up because sometimes strains like this when you know there are a small batch strangers you guys know for the future they don't want them elapsed like if you see but how this looks like some final get it next time and the next time finale but [ __ ] its out like I don't want to bring you back next week the thing is it might not bring because when the small-batch runs come around and this is a small batch run they just don't have a lot of it so well it's there it's there and it's gone if you come back go I don't know if they even do a regeneration cycle it is what it is so I grabbed myself a gram I'm excited about that and let's check it out LSD chatter that's things and it does have really plunge it like sweet and

this from they believe that this is a batch of multiple strains they're gonna be looking into that and if I can find out that information I'll update the description but if not then I'm not sure what strain this is under the impression that it's multiple also so I will note with it being such a small bag it was a little difficult getting this out but just have some patience and you'll be able to figure it out I've never seen a concentrate come in something like this before I went through with my air conditioner on and you know hey it was all smushed out so I had to go and fold it up and layer it on top of itself but it doesn't stick too bad to this paper if you just pop it in the fridge real quick and then take it out and peel it off gently you should be able to do it but this is the most insane Mouse clean CBD concentrate I've ever seen in my life whoa every concentrate for CBD I see is usually just some isolate crap or something some sort of hard something or other or just some like crappy wax this this is crazy guys and it smells like like like shatter like it smells like shatter this is absolutely incredible you guys I'm gonna be transferring it from this to some parchment paper so let me do that and I'm gonna I'm gonna weigh this out for you guys and see what how much this is this is almost a one-point to my friends absolutely there was that one seven but absolutely incredible guys keep going up still I cannot cannot wait to give this a shot I have my email going right now I'm gonna give it a dabber few try to see what temperature's best so I just don't have like a reviewer fail so I'm gonna take a couple small dabs of this just to see what temperature it's best at and then I'll be right back for you guys it goes sorry for the really poor lighting there's just not much I can do without getting a whole lot of glare that's why I don't do really I don't take hits on camera anymore just because it looks like crap but I got this at 475 right now the terpenes on this are absolutely crazy it tastes incredible like absolutely the effects are so great like for real guys like this is such a mood booster it really will get you through through the day tastes amazing guys oh my god wildflower hemp company wildflower hemp cocom I'll leave the link of the description actually in between showing you guys this and taking the stab I have been talking with the person who runs the show over there they're gonna be taking through the steps that they can to prevent squishing during shipping [Music] great great great quality I've never seen CBD shatter like this like you guys have no idea what this means to me and at 30 dollars a gram head shops around here or selling [ __ ] for like I don't know 50 60 dollars a gram thirty dollars a gram for this beauty guys

quick video had to hit a prize this morning Friday January 3rd I hit a prize Irie boom boom boom grab a few things today but only one that I'm doing a review of right now I grabbed sour banana sherbert cartridge at liquid live present cartridge sour banana sherbert right there I also grabbed brownie Scout this is called brownie Scout by rhythm 34 percent THC I'm not doing that either and I grabbed another blueberry headband and I also grabbed this is what I'm doing the review up by oh Jesus butter by Cresco right there it's the bio Jesus butter by Cresco you see those stats to kind of small right there yeah let me get you open this up here not let you get a look at the what the wax looks like and I'll do a dab of it to different lens if I seem like I'm a little bit further back it's because I have the 50 millimeter 1.8 lens on my camera I wanted to try it out see how it looked different perspective you know I like doing different perspectives and stuff so this is back in my original spot in my chair in the living room and let me do a dab of this buy of Jesus I paid it I paid 65 bucks for the gram of the spy oh jesus not too bad for the gram of the Bible Jesus for 65 paid 70 for that blueberry headband again that stuff was good for 70 it's worth it nice bye oh Jesus that's looking real nice that's the bye oh Jesus butter live butter by Cresco very nice-looking very nice smell it smells amazing this is the bye oh Jesus let me do a dab of this you know what you know what I think of the bio Jesus of butter by Cresco don't some in two puffs go to throw a little in the puffs go also the first I want to bang a dab at this with you guys let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section this bio Jesus is coming in at 81 percent THC eighty one point four five nine and then THC is like one point zero five three so it's like 82 percent probably right around there THC not bad for bio Jesus now I have had violent Jesus and a cartridge before co2 cartridge but I've never had bio Jesus and abs and I did have bio Jesus and flour before which was pretty good it was okay didn't have much of a taste to it dull and lack of terpene profile the reason I bought this one here was this was only 65 bucks and the but tender pointed it out that they just got it in last night he said hey man you know we got five of Jesus in for $65 a gram I say hey man let me get one I was gonna grab jet fuel by rhythm but that was 84 the gram so when I saw up ahead by of Jesus for 65 that just came in they just brought it out this morning I was like let me get one of those instead about jet fuel but then I grabbed another because this is only 70 for the cured resin 93.2% cured resin for the blueberry headband and this flower here which is going to be pretty good that brownie Scout in that cartridge that sour banana sherbert cartridge which I paid for yeah I dropped about he see it was 235 I think I had $10 worth of credits so spent 235 the eighth was 55 this grand was 70 the cartridge was 55 and that Graham was 65 for the buy of Jesus yeah 235 bucks hopefully I can make this last me for a couple couple weeks I'll try to ration it out but I be smoking some stuff up and to had to leave so I really gotta ration this out so it's not set my timer I'm probably gonna have to go in a little early cuz I just a couple seconds there because of that little delay I did I was reading a text message yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know what you think about this new 50 millimeter lens they said I am a little bit away from the camera now the camera is probably 2 or 3 feet from me normally the camera would be really close and I would have the wide-angle view but the cameras like real close to me with this way it's not so much of a wide angle but the picture quality should be a lot better on this video than the other ones alright Cheers bye oh Jesus that's nice it's got a nice um earthy floral kind of flavor with a little bit of a sweetness to it very pleasant very pleasant I like that a lot bye oh Jesus by Cresco yeah smells fantastic I am going to throw a little bit up in the puff go got to clean it out though darn it so I'm not gonna throw it in puff coat just yet I'll do another dab real quick oh yeah man that's nice this is an indica yeah I bought I bought hype this is a hybrid cartridge this is a hybrid this but a blueberry headband this is an indica to buy oh Jesus I know it's first thing in the morning it's uh what is it almost ten o'clock quarter to 10:00 and I'm doing dabs of buy of Jesus like I told you before if you're a veteran smoker and you've been smoking for a long time now you know it depends on what you want I want to relax so by Allah Jesus is good but if I wanted to be uplifted and uplifting then I would get a sativa like I said I was gonna grab the sativa the jet fuel the only reason I grabbed the bio Jesus is because it was $15 cheaper for the bio of Jesus and the THC content was exactly the same eighty one percent so 15 bucks is 15 bucks you know I mean this brownie scale was 55 cuz it's the rough cut they have rough cut and premium but the brownie Scout this was thirty four point eight percent THC love you'll be able to see it on the box this is real small 34 point zero seven nine yeah powerful stuff I don't know if I'm gonna do a review on that now I got all this stuff but the blueberry headband I'm not has already did a review I might do a review on that cartridge yeah very tasty Jesus mm-hmm mr. bio Jesus the box there's the stats see the stats there there we go I had a touch on it to focus right there yeah Cresco live butter by oh Jesus oh you guys have a great day peace I'm out", "B-Im1QApqUU": "what's up guys we're back with another

like a third I think it shipped like 40 bucks now for a half gram or some [ __ ] like that a mate they've been doing the same process but this time they ran it with their Strawberry Cough strength I think it's called the Scarlet as far as that's concerned as far as the CTL MP n go so we're gonna dab it up it's a nice ateva strawberry cloth if you don't even about the strawberry cloth genetic twice it's a little bit hard to find out I mean it can kinda go either way and I don't even know this one's actual truth another they say the Strawberry Cough could be have the genetics of a Hayes and then the Strawberry Fields the Hayes and the Strawberry Fields Mike Hayes starting field - strawberry cloth but then on the flip side if you do some general kind of Strawberry Fields he says the Strawberry Fields came from the strawberry cross coffee and you know it's all see like an flicks their strawberry coffee another one Strawberry Fields he's sure to field strawberry cloth see something there in the genetic ladder doesn't match up but that's time to do with strawberries strawberries it's supposed to have like a real they see the strawberry cloth supposed to have a real you know fresh strawberry smell to it and then they call the clock was there so much expansion that even the most you know veteran smoker will be coughing from it so we'll find the [ __ ] out and that's not all I got in the back let's see what else we got here now we're there got some stuff yeah this is the scarlet it's an overlock ball right now so we'll get to that in a second and what else I got in here

this morning I'm bringing to you guys the sweet tooth strain review you guys put down what you would like to see and the majority of you wanted to see the sweet tooth so here it is I've got myself a couple of dabs worked up here and what we're gonna do is we're gonna start off with the quartz banger and my is lower temperature dab to get a good flavor profile then we're gonna ban one note on the email get a good mid-range temp see how that's feeling for us and then we're going in with a really hot one on our quartz bagger to finish it all off and give it it overall review of what we think hope you guys are doing okay so we're gonna let this nail cool down a little bit here I've got my first out of the sweet tooth now this is an indica dominant strain supposed to be really good friends saw me kind of anxiety that you're feeling so we're starting the day off let's hope we're kicking it off right should be cool now [Music] right right kind of cotton candy kind of taste to it which is really nice it's not like overly sweet but as you can see definitely pretty potent and scripting my lungs pretty good way up I figured the best way to find out how strong this really was to go ahead and smoke it in the morning and I'm just that first tab it's got me it's great me really good kind of surprised so the next steps I've got my email set up to my average area about 750 or so oh that's gonna where I'm like let's bring it down a little bit I was noticing less Lane that that was a little hot so I'm Lorde it down to about 710 we're gonna take our next dab there we'll see how that goes we're gonna do it off of visiray year with the email and we're gonna use the nail itself to see if we get a bit of a different plate up profile from the flavors and this is kind of seen how it hits us a little dabber Oni nothing crazy so so far I've got the sweats working up as a morning start off this is this it's pretty good and kind of already feel like kind of creeping through my face a little bit chillin great tennis this morning I've been feeling really tense Wally you kind of seemed kind of loosening up loosen up so that's good all right enough with the chitchat let's jump it let's see how the second dab does us who of this sweeping all right Cheers [Music] we're in two of three jams well we're doing this interview it uh-oh you know I'm trying to figure I'm trying to get my my thumb one what it is with the sweet tooth I like it I don't know if the sweet tooth it's like a real strain and it's just kind of like a combination and I feel like it's kind of a combination it could be wrong I'm not gonna be completely wrong but uh it's a strange feel like it's uh it's not like overly sedating or anything but uh it's kind of washy it kind of comes over in waves almost definitely enjoying the flavor it's pretty city it is pretty tasty kind of got this like candy kind of like a sweet almost cherry no it's maybe maybe watermelon dose I don't really know but uh it's pretty tasty I'm sweating I feel pretty good I know the eyes are certain to itch the first day was really nice that was a good kick off dab man that one's got me going a second to have on top of it just really really solidified what the first one started the first one kind of you know kissed the lungs warmed up the last one really just put it over and now well that's like a blanket them it's not top of me you know it's a hot comforter I'm like whoo Dan gonna whoo you know I'm saying from this last out this is gonna be it really this is gonna be to see how it does when we do a bit dabbe suited taste is like on a bit bigger of a dab it even gonna go do it off yeah you know you know we use that a lot and I feel the taste is pretty much the same all the way around let's go super low we're gonna give it a try with the old trusty blue and see how it does so let's do it okay guys this nail is nice and hot now oh my god a good size down oh yeah oh it's [ __ ] huge oh that's unnecessary that's unnecessary we don't need to do it that big cheers everybody [Music] I've gotta say I really enjoyed smoking this it's pretty nice it's pretty heavy hitter does grab the lungs um I've really enjoyed the flavors pretty good each rig and each temperature seems to give different notes man which is really cool different uh different parts of the flavors speak damn I wouldn't these the different make it taste so on the back of my nose it's more like it's more sharp more salty like oh my gosh that's just how it works though I'm feeling super super medicated I think I think I'd say off at all the sweet tooth is definitely worth trying if you ever come across it in nearby case should I give that a try I'd say do it with that being said guys I think that's all the time I've got for today I really hope you've enjoyed this video and want some more videos like this let me know hit me up in the comments otherwise guys for Billy hope you'll have a great but let's fill the next time I'll catch those eyes around the way [Music]", "Lu-2PoSmPpk": "what is going on YouTube family this is pressing peat the press and puffin coming at you with another one so it's gonna be a little different today anybody who follows me on Instagram noticed that I had an issue or even saw my video with the grass roots Bubba diagonal live sauce or live butter it's live butter it was more of a sugar so I instagrammed him I posted about it they emailed me grassroots / and asked me to send them my address oh they gave me a choice I could a drive two and a half hours back to the dispensary I bought it from and return it or be keep the product which I don't mind I enjoyed the product and they would send me some stuff so I chose option B obviously I'm not driving two and a half hours for one one half gram of product just not [ __ ] happen so I got my box from grassroots sent me a little bit of stuff so we're gonna crack into her and see what they sent me and then I'm gonna do a review so get my handy-dandy stabby pokey stick here right in Nice so when I emailed them and I want to email anybody now I finish it with stay safe and be well be well primarily being the point and this is a shipping label they sent me and right there stay safe and be well hahaha it spreads see love spreads the the good good vibes good things spread so oh a bag good looking at grassroots I appreciate the hook-up I got a grassroots shirt and it's in my size and no they didn't ask my size they just got lucky Oh Oh yep I'll be wearing at my next review and the grassroots dab Matt oh yeah can always use another dead man cactus I only have two I have a big one from Doug Smasher and now this one so and they're both black and white which is awesome sweet so shout out the grassroots for the love and the hook-up I appreciate it that's awesome it's a nice quality t-shirt yeah next-level apparel never heard of them but it's nice soft but good quality I like the color the dark grey and I I wanted a grass root shirt yeah deeply that's what's up yeah okay so let's get into it we are reviewing shatter prism by Alera this is grape pie great pie shatter I did the homework on this one folks it is grape stomper crossed with cherry pies indica heavy dominant hybrid so according to the packaging in the you know molera they're basic basic basic with their packaging THC a seventy eight point six eight one CBD a zero terpenes B mark one point 106 human point four six three little all point four four nine car point three to eight this point three oh nine limonene point one five eight be pining 0.079 terminal 18 point oh seven eight PI nine point oh five six that's all she wrote folks now I picked this up on April 4th this is April 9th actually it's the 10th now and this was packaged on the 13th so not the freshest not the least fresh so you see it's still sealed at the nice little sticker there we're gonna change that real fast when we bust her open now these are those childproof containers I keep talking about the one that defeated me when I first got into the program it took my wife and I both to figure this damn thing out and even then we couldn't I finally got it so you have to push in on the two ends while pressing down on this tab and then you can pull the tray out like so that easy but it took I don't know why it took us a bit to figure it out now of course this is trim run it's usually what happens with the layer that's what you get that's the envelope break you're open it's dark you know I expect that with Alera it's not the darkest stuff I've ever seen with them actually actually this is better looking I'm surprised usually it's a weird green a weird green color but this is actually it not a bad color it's a nice amber it's a it's actually nice-looking shatter I'm surprised that's actually some of the better-looking stuff I've ever seen from Alera and I don't mind they're shatter it's a little expensive for my opinion for what it is but I [ __ ] with a shatter or sometimes when it comes around we have a nice big old fat chunk here we're gonna stick that bad boy they go i dabs stick that in there another little piece top it off now I almost forgot actually I did forget I broke that off and I wait I didn't weigh it so we're gonna weigh it without what I just put it in the Deb and we'll see exactly what we got here okay you folks saw me load up my two big chunks into my Jeep and connect so I've got two nice chunks in there the chamber is pretty full in fact I'll pull it out here so you can see so you can see that chamber is full chatter okay and I just weighed what was left 1.05 so it's probably you know pretty sight of this little over 0.1 I would say it actually 1.07 1.07 so I'm gonna say that that's probably 0.4 0.5 maybe so yeah with over not only was a better looking than normal but it was over which I like to see so shout out cool air for that at least let's crack into it and see how she tastes now like I said it's grape pie or grape stomper and cherry pie grape stomp or cherry pie so supposed to have you know sweet flavors to it but it's also supposed to be a little spicy from what I read we'll see alright cheers folks hmm Wow not too shabby okay mm-hmm I tasted it you got a little bit that grape little bit that cherry it does have that little bit of a nutty spicy exhale like I said that's actually an accurate description that they had yeah sweet and a little spicy I like it grape pie all day long yeah definitely a favorite for me as far as the lair goes time for a haircut again oh that's good stuff it's right where I wanted to be this morning having a rough day at bad night last night not having a good day this morning this whole corona virus things got my [ __ ] [ __ ] up my schedules off because of work being messed up so it messes with my sleep schedule messes with my routine and I don't know how many of you watching suffer from PTSD and anxiety but one of the things that keeps me functioning well is a routine it's not a lot of unexpected you know a general routine I mean I can have your usual daily stuff of things that get thrown at you but my whole world being thrown into turmoil like this is not good it's got me just freaking out for no reason ever I'm gonna have some reasons but I'm taking I'm freaking out to the extreme and I know it's to the extreme I just can't stop it - even though I'm aware of it I can't stop it from happening I just have to kind of try to roll with it and get past it it's kind of like back in the days when I used to you know trip I used to just have to tell myself look this is temporary it's only the trip it's just it's gonna go away so I have to tell I have to try to keep telling myself is this what I'm trying right now is you know medicating Aniki it's only temporary it's gonna change it's gonna go back to normal or you know obviously it's not gonna go back to the way everything used to be because nothing ever does but I just it is what it is so this is what I needed today because this is starting to calm me down it's making me feel a little better physically as well as mentally it's calming very calming I will say that I was pretty I was pretty anxious to worked up at the beginning of this I put on a happy face but I was pretty pretty upset when I started the video so it was nice to get a care package and to have some medicine so it's little things like that to brighten my day little things like that but it's huge to me oh yeah definitely like great pie that's one I'll buy again I don't care what you think about the company now that you just stand myself but there are some things I will buy I'll buy their flour because the press as well I won't vape it I think it's trash for that but it presses well makes good wax so I will buy it for that they're shattered once in a while if it's if it's great pie I'm getting it redheaded stranger I'm getting it um otherwise we'll see but those two all day just because I mean they're expensive for what they are but I like them so it is what it is I gotta be honest you know people can hate everyone you can jump on the bandwagon I hate to I hit on them too because they do have some garbage I'm not gonna lie but the same one oh this is good stuff this is actually the best chatter I've seen from mallero quality and effects it looks fantastic compared to the other stuff it's like this weird green color at least this had a good proper amber I mean it wasn't as clear as I'd like but it was a good proper amber color not that weird green [ __ ] also shut up - mama an ex-con John my business partner and best friend who makes these awesome rise & grind shirts hit him up they are awesome they are comfortable get him in long sleeve get him in short sleeve it don't matter I'll get it in a hoodie man I mean it's not that time of year but uh I wear hoodies all year-round so that's just me I know we're not doing the cannabis festivals but all the products will be available online through us just hit us up we can make that happen hopefully I'll have some prototypes here to show you personally I'm ice to channel otherwise check out ex-con John he's got him up there and some recent videos to show you what we got also like I said Prizm great pie by Alera it's a wind folks overpriced boy win I like it it's good stuff I'm not disappointed at all I actually kind of wish I bought a second one just because this one is pretty good its heady a little unfocused but its heady which is really needed right now is to kind of clear my head or at least clear of the bad stuff so if you are not a subscriber hit that button below we hit 200 thank you all that is freaking amazing I mean it's nothing in the grand scheme of things I'm a little nobody but 200 to me that's freakin

really really nice scrape for you guys today we have some white strawberry by one of my favorite growers big Bill's buds I mentioned it before but I guess it's worth mentioning again that he grows and I know all organic method and I'm just kind of kind of like with the work good work of this because I have so much work to do today shopping business because I am bad about that and I just was so busy you know in the past sometimes in the past I would just give people pictures that [ __ ] was easy here have a picture have a poster in the middle that video anyways close up this white strawberry almost my dear like it's been flipping someone my videos upside down lately and then I'll try to put them together I can't figure how to flip the damn video back up right anyways I'll probably hit a picture a video of this towards the end nice little honeycomb patty that will make beautiful deal beautiful color man look at that alright alright there we go about this white strawberry finished up and I'm actually shooting this video late I i I've I've had this this strop white strawberry ran for weeks now and I've been smoking off of it and I just been slacking on on doing the the finished video but this this stuff ended up hurting so so fast it's the been the fastest purse that I've had in in months and I think it's just due to the quality of the trim the freshness of the trim the the the higher quality the the fresher the trim I'm not I don't mean fresh as in wet I mean fresh as in it was it was trimmed it was dried and it was cured properly and and then and then fresh fresh from there and ready to ready to go but the stuff is almost it has a crazy consistency it's the most like it looks like seafoam or like I don't know it's very it's very delicate you can see it kind of it'll break quite easily all these little tunnels pieces but it's a really really beautiful color and inconsistency and it's just it's just a pleasure to smoke it really it's it's [ __ ] awesome it tastes incredible I really wish if I could I would give a DAB to each and every one of you watching this video I I swear I would I I so wish that you guys could all try this anyways yeah there it is white strawberry oh gee rascal I pick those buns", "fc7_KgERnqc": "do you ever suck some dick marijuana ha no no I can't say here it looks good patience jee seeti weed reviews medical marijuana

because it's very high power indica shading tunbridge that flower always made me feel fantastic and I really need an in the current it now so if we're getting to get up the g13 it's got a lot of a crazy background information on it and try to find out the lineage of it like the actual lineage of it you can't even get you know why because it's me about government oh nice Ben but apparently urban legend says that the CIA and the FBI and all these other secret government society so I can which the by the way if you didn't know they actually hold them the patent on the patent for carrying marijuana we've done or not you can actually check it out the government itself holds the patent on baqir that the carrying of marijuana the caring of cannabis like the [ __ ] original patent behind Kier cannabis they had so obviously at all obviously the government always had a big hand in weed marijuana world from very GetGo and obviously doing everything it's how goes it is what it is it's going to get [ __ ] foot the hands on everybody's balls um there's they apparently grew a whole bunch of strains of marijuana that's what constrains the most strongest ones the world and they picked out a couple strangers like g one g 2g 3g 4g plastics eventually the strain g13 happened to be the top number one winner and up there it is so I or if that true or not I honestly don't [ __ ] know but all I know is like a great strain of marijuana can smoke the [ __ ] writing is fire so let's check out it's cheap as [ __ ] too it's like 40 bucks a half gram of the shatter so it should be some good

go along this is the majority of it come on come on you can focus focus it's a nice color rosin that's for sure but the smell something about the smell almost from sorry almost reminds me of CBD but

juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view by the way you should sub to juvenile styles this channel is really dope now enjoy the video what's up world i got edison limelight ultra sour cush strain from nslc so i'm going to do a little review of it i've done it before but back when i was uh i always say i guess a little cringy and less uh experienced i guess we'll say so now that i'm a little better a little less stiff and i thought i'd give another few so i'm going to give you guys a nice close-up of this and then when i get when the close-up's finished i'll be back with the joint rolled up so check this out because we're down we light this up and light this up in a cup i can't stand up be a cyber monkey like the end of the part i get twist up keep your lips shut [Music] don't [Music] [Music] so i'm back i got the bat let's light it up and get high as my hat but it might not be that high but anyways let's light this [ __ ] up it does have the nice sour taste to it that i was expecting i mean how can you not limelight ultra sour so i'm wondering if because when i went and bought it it actually just said limelight so if it's the limelight must be part of the i don't know part of the company edison limelight ultra sour because i know ultra sour is a strain i've had before too so is it limelight or ultra sour it's a little confusing either way it is a sativa and it's 22 percent thc and it's not a bad grab as you can see it's a very nice like light green color it has some really nice colored hair on it has a lot of crystal too so and that's not a bad account for a gram so we still got this after having the joint so that's definitely not a bad gram from the liquor store and it was nine 9.78 or something like that so that's not a bad price for a gram so what i'll do is i'll throw a nice little piece up into the bong we'll taste it in the bun and then we'll rate the taste and then the smell in account everything else so let me pat a little bowl there we go as you can see we've got a nice little bit up in there let's take a hit hold on the hole's clogged a little bit i should have poked it through first oh god i'm gonna have to poke this first my bad there we should be good now maybe a little too good oh that was a nice day i wasn't expecting that you can see those little birds floating around my head [Music] i'm just playing but it tasted nice so that's all it counted besides it made me feel nice so yeah um i'll give the rating for the taste i'll give it a four oh no i'll give it a 3.5 i give it a 4 if you really like this sour strains but i have a 3.5 for flavor it's pretty nice flavor for rating for a pound for the gram it's not a bad gram at all especially from the liquor store they can look a little stingy sometimes so i say i'll give the account i give the account a three and a half as well it's not a bad account looks like a decent amount for a gram maybe i should start weighing them up for you guys on the reviews i might start doing that the next couple reviews weighing it and seeing how much it weighs compared to what it's supposed to be i might start doing that so i think that we'll give the limelight or the ultra sour the limelight ultra sour will give it an overall rating of 3.5 pretty good we pretty good ground but it's obviously just mediocre it's not top-notch but for the price it's a pretty good ground so that's where this one's from the liquor store it's the nslc here and i've had a few other strains from the edison cannabis co they're not too bad at all they have some pretty good strains so yeah i'll give an overall rating 3.5 to that and if you watch my videos i want to start intro and true interviewing like pop photographers and different kind of like weed influencers any kind of weak content creator so if you puff and record stuff hit me up and maybe we can set up an interview be pretty dope so with that i guess i'll leave it there i still got the stickers for juvenile styles if you want one hit me up in the comments or at me on

an acronym for one of the cannabinoids in the cannabis plant honestly as far as medicinal value all of the cannabinoids are medicinal but the association of THC is generally the fact that people use it to get high CBD does not get you high yet is known to relax you nine times out of ten the people that are using CBD really lead CBD medically elite focuses on CBD we do everything from breeding the seeds all the way to the extraction and purification process our products go through the gambit really from things that you could combust to skincare products I personally have been a cultivator since 1996 and so I've had a lifelong passion for the plant guy came from an IT security background ended up running one of the world's largest team of computer hackers and during that time I was still cultivating cannabis but the real birth of the company to where everybody quit their jobs and said this is what we're gonna do professionally was when Colorado legalized in 2014 our laboratory space is approximately 2,000 square feet it's in a former cleanroom environment all right so we start with stripped plant material and then we load that material into a column that crude extraction comes out as an oleoresin it goes from that into a alcohol bath and that basically precipitates all of the waxes fats lipids out of the solution and then we have to remove the alcohol from the oil in a rotary evaporator you're using controlled heat lots of vacuum and a condenser once it is through that process we fractionally distill the oil which removes impurities through a boiling point process and essentially the purified substance crashes out of solution it took us about 50 pounds of raw material to get to this one kilo of purified isolated it's basically organic chemistry 101 you're dealing with rotary evaporators you're dealing with Buechner funnels and vacuum assisted filtrations you're dealing with fractional distillation stills so yeah the labs pretty advanced especially for a cannabis industry the benefits of CBD are still being discovered on a daily basis you know generally speaking it's an anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic it's a neuro protectant people are using it for everything from breast cancer to epilepsy to aching joints and stress relief so we've seen CBD change people's perception of what cannabis is on a significant level I mean barring any unforeseen federal intervention I see the future of CBD as largely limitless right I don't even think CBD necessarily belongs in a dispensary environment I think the future of CBD is in everybody's home food and or medicine cabinets it'll become more and more commonplace as people realize what it is and what it can do for you [Music]", "mTsoEEmz7Rk": "hey guys today we're gonna talk to you about rosin not only are we gonna tell you what rosin is but we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool

know the drill i won't go over it let's see what's inside rainbow pride outside we've seen it before probably see it again i'm your rolling tray brand materials q cue angelic music if you were one of the lovely lovely people who took advantage of my referral code and got me a discount as well as ourselves make sure to take advantage of the chance to win your next box for a dollar that's pretty cool i'm certainly going to enter um it's really easy you just have to post a picture of your box once it arrives so check it out nothing to lose a lot to gain we talked about the add-ons last time won't belabor the point and everything else is brand materials so what's in the box we got pre-rolls we got flour and we got two vape cartridges it looks like as usual uh i'm gonna start with the flour so you guys want to see some sick close-ups here we go first one by cypress cannabis cypress og and indica at 23.2 percent so on the high end not as high as the thirty percent that we saw from the excellent uh indico by chicha's dash last month but three grams high potency and uh looks to be really fresh green nugs so let's pop this guy open it's tamper sealed which is always nice to see child safe and very potent smelling now it's piney it's green not lemony not chemically cleaning product and really yeah like cheesy dank not diesely much at all a couple out here um besides just the quality of the flower i mean if you take a look at this guy it's it's clean i love to see these glass jars um and i love to see all of their like cool little logos this guy looks like a smiling uh bud himself um solid blue color packages and distributed yeah nothing surprising there in terms of branding materials didn't get one on these guys so what have we got here well first touch right i always like to see whether it's dried out dry on the outside but very sticky on the inside i won't go so far as to call it moist but at least properly cured um what you don't want to see is you open this up and you start to pull on it and it it crumbles and creates a lot of uh small bits and dust almost but this is it's holding its integrity very well and when you look at the inside it's as frosty as the outside light green color some orange hairs very dark overall looks really good um should be should be something worth trying um so far i haven't been disappointed by one of these strains yet so there we go second guy northern emeralds another eighth this is durbin poison and it is 21 thc 0.4 percent cbd and 25 total cannabinoids they rate it as an almost pure sativa so there we go and a very similarly strong sativa this one attractive packaging minimalist uh sort of cannabis leaf diamond logo and look right into it and you see a lighter green color and a little bushier honestly so let's uh let's pop it open all right now you love to see it packed all the way full very orange with the hairs doesn't look like it's been manhandled too much um oh stuffed in there pretty tightly see we can pull out all right so this is sort of what i was talking about when i was saying bushy right they're not as dense and compact as you see uh sometimes and not sticky at all on the outside and that's not a bad thing you know um but it is a difference to note a little crunchier a little crumblier yeah not as sticky not as dense on the inside but you may notice really well developed crystal structure i have every reason to believe this is going to be pretty uh potent and uh durban poison which you also see in uh the hybrids i think girl scout cookies has turban poison in it so uh pretty well known strain um just by the look of it i kind of wonder if it was growing outdoors in terms of products not much about this one either so just some good old-fashioned outdoor grown probably northern california durban poison sativa very fragrant floral kind of scent citrus but lightly more like grapefruit or something than like the pine salt heavy smell you might associate with some sativas very light just like the colors kind of like green so this is like the most stereotypical sativa i think i could imagine right light green flowery smell probably going to be uplifting you know intense high behind the eyes some pretty cool uh hairs coming off of these so hopefully that looks good on camera because it's pretty intense looking out in person but different not the same um as the indica that i already received from cyprus so two very different strains an eighth of each and as always i'm pretty excited to try it so that's the loose flower all right pre-rolls we've gotten between two and three every time and this time it's no different got a couple different ones take a look at one at a time the one that draws my attention first is by cream uh cream of the crop was one of the sort of flowers that we've seen before you notice this guy it's um the same sort of branding so i assume it's the same company minimalist in terms of color but very uh ornate now rise to the top twenty percent thc so fairly strong not like the um lola lola ones that we got last week 26 cold water hash infused but these are also infused you can see here four gram or four times 1.3 gram infused pre-rolls so this isn't just one let's pop this open and take a look at it so this is an interesting little alien uh looking device but it appears to hold as they said four pre-rolls i've got our little sticker on there getting used to seeing these um this is a new one there's an arrow on the top but i assume i'm going to have to slide yeah and then there we go so that's a slip little thing um a lot easier than having to squeeze but i don't know if that would be as good for somebody with like thumb issues but not too hard so looking down the barrel right four pre-rolls and not only are they infused but if you will take a look at these they are coated in what looks like some keef or at least otherwise powdered material um these will be a real kick in the pants anytime you're mixing different forms of cannabis to create these infused pre-rolls you're playing with fire so to speak okay so let's uh let's put these guys back where they live [Music] all right so that is actually i mean that's the amount of pre-rolls or material i would expect to get in pre-rolls in a given box so this is a big pickup once again cream genetics this box of magic in your hands contains four cream cones feature our premium canvas hand dipped in hash oil and keef deliver a smoking experience that helps your mind and body ascend oh and this is this is kind of cool so there's a taste like feels like perfect for listing there and i've mentioned this before but i really think this is the next step for the industries to begin telling the consumer what to expect from the product because there's a lot of variation but as we get better at reading and refining these strains i hope that we get more precise in what we can say that they can do or not do i'm that's awesome this is this is this is cool uh look forward to trying one of these but that's not the end of our pre-rolls which is pretty cool as i mentioned we got two more first one up is going to be sunday driver and indica by one life all right in this very tropical uh little container here now i believe i actually have yes yes one life superior cannabis premium cannabis it's grown without shortcuts cultivated with care nurtured for quality superior taste of roman consistency a result of our meticulous attention to detail our mission is the art of storytelling okay so they're colorful storytelling it's pre-roll but it a full gram it looks like which is nice another great pickup this is the artist edition you'll see down here on the bottom and no other information about the strain besides that is once again a sunday driver so see if we can take a look nothing too complicated there a little pop top and this is a hefty cone all right i love when they're tapped in at the top like this instead of being uh you might see them twisted the twist can be hard to light so um i'm glad to see more brands moving towards this besides that i mean pretty generic looking um nothing i wouldn't expect from a nice pre-rolled cone so spark this one up sometime yeah all right and last but certainly not least a very intensely packaged taylor's quality rolled sativa blend pre-roll coming in at 14.9 thc and no cbd it's got a much higher quality glass container unlike the other ones we've seen so far and a very earthy uh sort of organic farms looking logo fire for less says their sticker um and it appears that their logo is an acorn so this is this is very uh back to the earth granola crunchy and you know you kind of want to kind of see that from the canvas brands right so let's see what we're working with here all right oh so now here's a good comparison for what i was talking about this is a twisted end right here in an otherwise very similarly shaped cone so when you go to light the end of this you're often gonna um have trouble getting that like because there's no air moving through or around it um you can snip this off uh or even you know just hold the flame to it for a little while but when you pack down the tops like that you can draw the flame into the cone and that usually lights a little easier they used a raw cone to make this and probably raw rolling papers based on the kind of brown color so really sticking with that organic earthy sort of vibe a good brand choice for that now do we know anything about these guys we do not all right so taylor's quality rolled sativa clocks in as my sixth pre-roll since it was four from cream of the crop and one from one life and now this one from taylor's quality roll so big uh pre-roll pickup this time for me compared to previous boxes now last but certainly not least the vapes uh i love these i already busted one of these open because i vape all the time i love it um so we'll start with that guy now this is a shape of package that i've seen before because it's rove they're one of the biggest uh brands in cartridges uh for a long time now but this is not their normal black packaging um this is plant pen this is rov x neptune valley so a little sustainability feel to it and a very attractive cardboard outside featured farms premium cured resin super sour diesel from neptune valley clocking in at 95.7 percent so strong um in the past when i've got rove cartridges uh they're very dark looking liquid it's very viscous and i have years ago now i had issues with them clogging up on me but this one so far so good uh you see to open it there's a little button on there just press that in press on the other side slides open so inside here we have our cartridge and we can see ooh rove reward qr code on the box and cartridge use and care instructions and like i said i think they used to have a problem with clogging but uh these instructions explicitly say not to preheat or overheat so i think they're pretty confident in the viscosity these days and you'll note it's really really light colored it's not an amber oil this is green ish gold completely translucent and you can see right through it you've got a nice rubber stoppers on both ends of this and probably only questionable thing about this cartridge design is it's got a metal tip which isn't necessarily the nicest thing against your teeth but maybe i just shouldn't be gnawing on the ends of my vaping cartridges as i said 95 strong um this one came with a little bit of dry mouth when i first used it and i think that's just indicative of the overall strength more than anything strain specific so yeah a a high quality rove cartridge is my first one this is about a half gram of oil so and does rove have anything to say for themselves pure strains featured farms is rose signature 100 cannabis terpene line encompassing the freshest most pure strains directly from our top cultivation partners all right so this is similar to i assume cream of the crop um their attempt to appeal to a more discerning customer base and i have no complaints i i love uh i've been trying high quality products so another big another pickup for me okay and the last thing i have comes from irvana which their tagline is for every ounce we sell we plant a tree so this month a lot of more earthy sustainability focus products i don't know if that was deliberate or just the mix that i got but that's the theme that emerges so take a look at this this is not your typical um vape cartridge box one it's all cardboard and you can't see into it and two it's kind of like slick buttons now they say it's 100 recyclable and sustainable so that probably has to do with it it looks like it was folded a lot more intricately than you usually see so what do we have this is blue dream all right a sativa nine point three percent thc point two percent cbd so let's see blue dream percentage there remove this sticker and it looks like we pinch these sides see what's in there and once again they're slogan about trees and here's our [Music] cartridge look at that you tracked a little guy in a cardboard sleeve [Music] okay so how cute is this got our protective sleeves on there another clear very light yellow looking oil vervana branded on the bottom hard plastic green tip and it's a ceramic cartridge which um in theory burns a little cleaner i don't know um that i've ever noticed a huge difference in the quality of a ceramic versus the more normally wicked vaporizer cartridges but that's why it's a little lighter colored on the inside if you notice so blue dream a sativa almost 90 thc another one that's probably gonna send me straight to the moon uh and not be very sedating uh which is you know sometimes what you're looking for so there it is right our final one if we would like to sum up this month was two vape cartridges two eighths and six pre-rolls so i mean this is one of the bigger pickups i've gotten i'm really happy with it everything seems strong and of quite high quality so knocking out of the park nightclub uh thanks for watching this far guys if you're interested in getting your own box check out my referral

like that anyway - really good strains by themselves now I've had the flower version of champion city chocolate and you know what it is almost cheesy like it's very strange to explain it's like cinnamon sugar you know that they put on cinnamon toast crunch on top of a slice of American cheese and then washed it down with a milkshake made of mulch so it was interesting to say the least [Music] so I was wondering how is that gonna transfer over into the shatter so what do you say we just cut the BS and take a day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right well we've give it a little bit of time to take effect and you know what it's not bad I don't know if I'd say that it's like really good but you know fir first chatter it is decent it is very effective and you know relax relaxing

one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment

what's up world welcome to sorry about that welcome to juvenile styles today i'm coming at you with alien og check it out so i got this nice joint roll of it we're going to light it up and give this strain and these buds a nice thorough review and of course i got the bomb to try it out and that as well so let's light this up and give it a nice review so it has a very nice taste actually it's like i taste a lot of crystal but i also kind of taste like kind of a seasoning type of taste maybe kind of like peppery a little bit it does have a nice taste and this was 28 percent thc so it's not too bad it's pretty high up there definitely at higher but it is up there with the strains and this is three grams of it minus the joint that i rolled so i think that was a pretty good account for the three grams so let's give it a little sniff test i kind of through the bag i kind of smell a bit of vanilla in it although i do kind of smell the like spice seasoning type of taste or type of smell like i taste in the joint smell very nice though so i'll give you the close-up here now if you've never seen my show now you know we get so high that we fly [Music] but i know it will all [Music] [Music] let's take another look at one of these other buds this is a nice sized one here it's not a bad looking strain as you can see it's kind of frosty nice crystals on it and i've had this strain this bag for about a week or so i think so it's a little dried out but that was my fault i should have took better care of it and stored it a little better but i can't blame that on the strain so i'm not going to leave that in the rating so the texture because i remember when i did get it it wasn't quite as dry so i'll still give the texture a nice writing for a texture of these buds but i'm going to give i'm going to take a bomb head first before we write the flavor because it's not fair so i'm going to throw this down for a second and we'll take a hit from the bomb well i got a little bit in there from the last strings one second let's throw a nice little piece in here at least it's dry like i said so it breaks right apart there we go got a nice little bowl up there let's light it up um that's pretty good oh that gave me a nice hit so i'll say give me a second all right i'll say i'm gonna give the flavor i'll give the flavor a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5. it's pretty good tasted nice nice tasting straight so i'll give you a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5 for the rating for the flavor it's not too bad i'll give the same for the texture of the bun because it's pretty nice buds a little dryer now but it wasn't so bad when i first got it so i count i can't breathe no i'm just joking i can't stop choking now i'm just playing but yeah i'll give the account so it's nice ass three so i'll give it minus to join so i'll give it a nice i'll give it a 4.5 per account because that's a really nice thing and i think this alien ochi deserves an overall four out of five it's really good i definitely recommend it and this one was just three a's so it wasn't four but still a really good joint a really good strain i definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out try it out and i'll show you guys the plants that i cut down early what i got out of them you could definitely tell that they're way too early some of them ain't the buds ain't too bad like one of the plants i think was pretty close so it's not too too bad but the rest of them likes it not it's just so i think i'm going to use it to make a little bit of hash or something like that so that's what i'll use that [ __ ] for and i'll show you guys the plants now and i want you to let me know in the comments how long do you think left i don't think there's not much left because the main ones that are closer closest there's a couple that needs a little longer but i think the closest ones are about at least 50 percent brown hair so it said to make sure they're around 75 to 90 percent and the trichromes are bulbed up and everything so um yeah if you have any advice how long you think they're going to take you can let me know i appreciate it and yeah i hope you guys are all having a good night and hope y'all got some good [ __ ] to smoke i'm gonna leave it there you'll have a good one peace hundred thousand views really more to go this the show hundreds of different strains of smoke there's no joke breaking

for cannabis patients in Chicago and cannabis lovers all over the world over 21 years of age today we're gonna be going over another fine product from Cresco we're going to be going over by oh Jesus live sugar [Music] [Music] by oh Jesus from Cresco is an indica dominant hybrid its parentage is biodiesel and gumbo now the ladder gumbo I've had that in extract before and in flower and you know what guys while it is very effective strain it's not one of my favorite tasting it has a very heavy distillate smell I taste and you know and that's almost it almost transfers as like a chemical taste I've noticed but you know what I haven't had the bio Jesus in extract so I figured you know what I'll go ahead and give this string a better shot than I gave either of its you know mama or daddy so what do you say we go ahead get it dab in us and then we'll go from there okay so right when you open this you're gonna be greeted with a smell that's reminiscent of like I don't know citrus yeah like citrus and you know what this smells like the gumbo so I'm gonna go ahead and say that this is gonna have that distillate flavor as well you know I can almost smell like smell that flavored you do you know what I'm saying like you understand what I'm trying anyway yeah so sweet smelling with hints of citrus the texture itself is a lot like apple sauce it looks wet but it's not it looks delicious but yeah it looks and moves a lot like apple sauce okay well I'm done looking at this thing let's go ahead and get one in us yeah this stuff is almost exactly like apple sauce here go ahead take a look you know I wish that we could better cuz I mean it's pretty it is it's really pretty it looks delicious it looks like something that you know kids should eat but they shouldn't because this is for adults and people that need it alright guys here we go nostrovia Cheers Slainte all that clinky clinky [Music] [Music] Wow okay that got really harsh towards the end of the hit I don't know rough and yes the distillate taste is there and it's heavy but looking past that distillate flavor I'd say that there is on the very beginning of your hit on the inhale it is a bit citrusy it's like citrusy with a little bit of like earthiness to it not so much pine but yeah I don't know it's it's a it's a strange flavor and but then you're assaulted with the distillate flavor and you know what some people might like it I personally don't but I'm weird I also like yeah anyway but yeah so besides the the distillate flavor very earthy very citrusy and I wouldn't even say like lemon as much as it is like a tart you know that gives it that citrus flavor so overall you know it's it's pretty good so far I can feel it working a little bit but let's go ahead give it a few minutes and then we'll go over the effects now while I might have had a hard time getting past that flavor I'm glad I did because the effects are amazing to break it down it's a bit cerebral just a little little bit but very euphoric uplifting and I'd say that this is a very very good strength for relieving stress and anxiety possibly even depression to do to the uplifting factors but also this is an excellent pain reliever it happens fast and it has total coverage okay not just out pain but also you know pins and needles nerve pain headaches this this is good stuff I found that the only real drawbacks to this strain outside of the flavor would be the fact that it does leave you a dry mouth maybe dry eyes and that's not really red eyes but dry but yeah very dry mouth you're gonna need something to drink or keep some gum with you you could try a cottonmouth candy I don't recommend it because the way it works it fight it fights your dry mouth by making you vomit okay so you gotta kind of yeah maybe stay away from that one but yeah outside up some dry eyes some dry mouth this does him feels like it could have just a bit of a potential to be a little dizzy but yeah outside of those three factors guys this is or four factors including the taste but I can look past the taste because the effects are great okay guys well that just about does it for me here if you like this video please go ahead give it a thumbs up if you haven't done this by now go ahead hit that red subscribe button and from everybody here at the bodega I would like to say thank you for stopping by thank you for your support and

where the markets going so that's what we're gonna do with it I've been saying that for a few years now well we finally got everything in although it was like I said a long-ass season and we finally well I guess we got one more plant that we're we got hanging right now it's the last one but other than that that is it so we will be doing sorry I gotta set you folks down there for just a second now we can go take a look yeah there's the last plant thing enough there here's one of the last of the air the last can of the oil that I made purging out here in the sunshine looking out over the lake

when I post this but anyway got a rep all the the pink called the breast cancer my mom had breast cancer so it's nice to it's nice that they represent breast cancer with all their pink stuff on that's relieved so today I'm doing a review of what's it called northern hash plant it's a pre-roll I never really liked the pre-rolls cuz they grind it up too much names hurt the trichomes but no it is what it is pre-roll northern hash plant I'll tell you how I feel about it this smells nicer hmm like berries almost all right so I've said it before I'll say it again why I'm doing this as they pack it too tightly in these pre-rolled joints and it's just unbearable to smoke so this is the way I smoked all my pre-roll so far from truly I don't have a problem with that all right here we go tell you my review on this that one tasted really nice upon inhaling it's one of those really likes you can you can almost tell that it's gonna be good as your inhale so as I was going to my lungs around here or I'd realize that it was gonna be good then my lungs that build up did bother my wonder - and then I started coughing and I kind of sting a little bit a euphoric sensation right I went up from here up to my head and went on further to my hands solid euphoric feeling I wouldn't say it's the dating I wouldn't say too much about it other than its euphoric let's see what's supposed to be it doesn't say on here oh it's an indica hmm in the current euphoric well just goes to show that none of the none of the descriptions for any of the weeds are truly indica sativa it doesn't really matter if you're gonna read if you're gonna get a strain read the description because didn't because see what really doesn't even mean anything anymore honestly like it's supposed to mean something but when you go to truly when you read the descriptions you'll get yourself a sativa that works like an indica and an indica that works a good sativa and like I said okay what is anything anymore really right so I'm gonna try one more boy I really liked it one more one ball kind of made me feel made me feel good I feel like there's somebody just handed me a bowl of this stuff I'd been like but since I got more I might as well go for the second one and up the feeling I've got right now I feel like this if I were to just like choose to smoke to relax I don't think this would be it honestly I feel more alert but calm now if you look like a do stuff and still be calm with one fat hit of that so let's do it another hit let's see if I can like be coherent still in a social environment no I'm not social right now it's just me obviously on screen but the thing is you're listening to me and I'm kind of being social even though it's not in real time I'm socializing with you I mean you could write a comment down there and I'd probably respond um if it's something like worth responding to something they're just like oh great if you say something I'll generally not let's talk let's start a community let's network this one's for you I hope you have something in your hands so it could smoke together stolid strain not to relax them even feels nice to cop you've been a nice coughing feeling the first one hurry the second one I'm enjoying this cough there's even like a subtle taste and on the exhale my car even when there was no smoke I liked it well that's my review guys like and subscribe if you're new to this channel I don't know if you're not how are you doing it's about you know it's not this sentence about me me selfishly it's okay I'm really high right now damn you know yeah you know I didn't mean to be all superficial just a second ago this channel is about everybody everybody who likes weed not just me feel bad I always wanna redo this whole video cuz I did that I don't like oh my god who the [ __ ] am i oh oh my god I totally crushed I'm sorry you guys I need to stop cussing I'm trying to get monetize eventually well I just probably stopped talking because I was don't have anything else to say alright you guys take it easy back", "7F-rOC4RUAA": "[Music] all right so we'll start with the ingredients main ingredient Betty Crocker milk chocolate brownie mix now this recipe calls for two eggs all right and then two ounces we're also gonna have someplace to put it all in makes it we're also gonna add fluent full spectrum cannabis oil concentrate now this dispensary it's one of my favorites see here this is THC 88.2 1:9 Wow and I see the name is battledore fluent they speak cannabis whenever I'm cooking this this normally is really hard to get out it's really concentrated so it always helps to put it in warm they could I normally just might crave a cup of hot water get it really nice and hot and just drop this bad boy in there for a good five minutes and come on up just like oil all right first things first you want to go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees go ahead and spray your pan whoa whoa it's like that okay we have to read the hot water that's right hot in about five minutes and this time I decided to just put it in a little bowl put in the microwave for like about 10 seconds make sure you get time be careful getting that out of there it's very hot one way to tell that your product is ready is by looking at the little air bubbles you'll see that the air bowl will go up or down real fast all right so we have our concentrate and our vegetable oil we'll go ahead and dump this in there's 500 milligrams make some pretty potent brownies oh it smells it smells very good and you definitely want to let the oil cool down a little bit before you put it into the mix there's my eyes because you're putting eggs in there and you don't want to cook the eggs not yet one of the best things about coming with concentrate is it's essentially a oil and you can put it in anything anything can rise anything that use oil with you can mix it alright so now that we have our brownie mix inside the bowl we'll go ahead and get some eggs one that's two and asked for the recipe add three tablespoons of water now we have all this we'll go ahead and stir this or we'll give it one more mix ago we put it in there make sure it's all nicely evenly mixed because you don't want product that has a little bit here and a little bit there all right so he just makes us wrap around all right once you have everything makes well together should look like that nice and consistent you don't want to over beat it one of the advantages of using concentrate is that it already comes the carbonized so whenever you cook it it won't impact the THC in it whatsoever all right and we're about to go ahead and put this brownie mix into this pan and let the magic start all right now that we have everything here and in here all right we're all good to go all right so we'll just go ahead and get everything your ovens preheated to 350 we'll put it in here BAM all right now you should put it for 42 minutes if you're using a square pan like I am but just to be safe put it to 39 that's not a good time oh I think she's doing so it looks like it's sad 42 minutes right now see ain't it nice and cool now that we've allowed the brownies to cool now it's time to cut them up keep in mind that until we 500 milligrams of concentrate so what this means is that we'll divide it by how many pieces that we play [Music]", "J_0_qwXlhEM": "[Music] [Music] ah yeah guys what a big Dan over here coming back got you yeah and now we're doing a quick little video because I get a million questions asked about this subject pretty much every day I get at least 10 to 20 comments or emails asking about this subject and the subject is how to make THCA from shatter or wax or pho all yeah so uh there you have it you got some saucy turkey diamonds the diamonds are around anywhere between 96% eighty to ninety nine point six percent THC a and you can see the nice derpy a little bit of Terp sauce layer in there with the Terp sauce will contain random cannabinoids from CB g CB d CB and stuff like that and then all your Terps whether it be in lemon een pining and the rest of a mercy and all that stuff but um yeah this video is in explaining what diamonds are it's explaining how I make my methods of making THC TAC a or diamonds or sauce turf sauce or turf diamonds or whatever you want to call it you can see that the crystallization is fairly big with the strain and yeah you can see the diamonds themselves are nice and clear and the sauce layer is nice and golden okay so let me break it down alright so first step is you got to make your you got to make a BHO pack the columns pack the tubes wait uh this is exactly how I do it I do fresh plant right off the plant right into the two pound columns on a closed loop fold you axis then I go from best value of x mmm I use only try ice I don't use liquid nitrogen right into that I just packed the column the jacket on the column with dried ice I packed the tubes full with my material which is a fresh off the plant you could do it with dried buds whatever you want but I just the best herb profile will come from live plants or fresh frozen something like that and then I do my run just like anyone else I'll blast through the column and then I'll pull the ball valve and then once I pulled a ball valve I will it'll dumped into the dewaxing chamber and then I'll let that sit for a little while let it be wax I'll pull that ball valve and let that dump into the collection pot I will then heat the collection pop however you heat your collection pot I just use a hot water bath and then while that's heating and evaporating back into the solvent tank getting yourself in potty or BHO I will then look through the sight glass and I'll leave a good amount of butane left in it now that's up to you how much you ran in and all that so I'll make sure it's nice and soupy so I could just dump it right out now when it's nice and soupy I release the pressure and then pop the cap and then dump it into a jar just like the bigger the bigger versions and these balls right here the big quart jars I will then cap the jar I'll put it in a cooler that the cooler Pole has some dry ice in it so it stays nice and cold and then BAM I'll leave that there and I'll pop the jars maybe once or twice a day burping them and after about five days you'll see diamond stone form at which point I will not use dry ice anymore and I'll keep it pretty much every room temperature and then I'll perform a two three four times a day I check them randomly and I'll burp the jars just you probably don't have to do that but I just do it to make sure the pressure isn't building up so much that's going to pop the capsule off or break the jars for anything so I check on them from time to time open them up and check on my own see how they're growing after a week you'll see bigger diamonds after two weeks for the biggest diamonds something similar to this now it is all strain dependent some strains have much bigger Terp Terp layer and then some strains have smaller diamonds more turf some strains have bigger diamonds less Terps yada yada so that's all up to the strains but that's how it's done I don't you know pentane wash the solvent I use for extraction is just n butane from best value back switch is 99.9% pure butane medical grade extraction grade comes in the green tank you can buy all that stuff right up best value packs they got a good prices good material and I never did me wrong but out yeah that's how it's done so uh I know I did a video with the robot voice trying to explain this and I feel that video was uh sufficient and I think it gave all the same thing I just said broke it down much quicker and you didn't have me up in there saying and all this shift so for everybody that just wanted a little revamp of the process that's how it's done that's exactly what I did to make these that's what I do to make all all my Terp sauce or diamonds or whatever you want to call it that's how I make it I hope this helps anybody out and if you liked the video smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already and throw some comments and you could shoot me an email visit the website whatever you want to do and I'll get at me I'm down I'm always here to help and uh yeah there you go beautiful diamond so you can see they're all nice and clear swimmin oh yeah okay guys I hope that helped enough big Dan over now peace out [Music] [Music]", "0KJx4_C-bf4": "[Music] [Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back for another stray interview this time we got something better than we had last eight okay those are you guys that tuned in last week you got to see I smoked some weed that we didn't really want to smoke it this weed is a little bit different as Dan says we're bringing you some more cake I mean who doesn't like cake right I like cake we've brought you guys wedding cake we've brought you London pound cake this one on honestly in my opinion just our first glance better than both of those this is the lava cake from viola yep viola you know the first time we heard about them was in Colorado obviously they became friendly competition pretty quick out there and they are led by Al Harrington the Hooper you feel girls shout out to Al yeah I don't know how early he got in on that I don't know when we were out working in Colorado like Dan said they were pretty good competition for us out there as far as extracts go I don't know if I remember seeing their branded flour back then this is like 2014 to 2016 or so to viola extracts which I got this at the Hall of flour so we have it sitting on the table here just to show you then this is like their extract packaging this was some diamond sauce but again I'm doing extracts out here now too right they are but that's I believe that's what they started only doing Colorado because it was they were there Instagram was viola extracts so no and now that you mentioned the Harrington thing I do think I remember hearing something about that like the company like his grandma was named viola and that's what the company is named after so it sounds like he's been a part of it since the job yeah regardless we as far as quality goes I always liked their stuff back in the time that we spent Colorado especially live resident it was ghostly when sauce first started poppin they had a lot of really really good sauce back then yeah I don't know what the I don't know what their market presence is like out there now I haven't been back to Colorado in a couple of years but out here they've started to pop up I'd say a lot within the last year for me I've been seeing them a lot on the flower side yeah okay it's something that a lot of brands have been doing a lot of brands that especially just started off more on the extract side going over to the flower side now you've seen 7-10 do it but we've done it ourselves with turf X mile is done it and it's been interesting to see of those kind of concentrate players that try to dabble in the flower game who's been coming with the heat it hasn't yeah I mean definitely their packaging is clean I really like this opaque purple jar it's almost like a flat matte purple I'm at it too great yeah great game baby and then they even if they got a dog little lower on our icon I guess you could say on the top there it's just a bunch of these turning inward kind of like our turf X drops that turn inward so I [ __ ] with that I like the weed - yes the weeds gonna just spark this Jay which is what I was gonna say let's get back to the damn review shout out to buy although they're a great company lava cake guys so this is great pie and they make Girl Scout cookies that's the cross on this and when you take a look at the close-ups it's definitely leaning towards looking like GSC don't you think yeah yeah it's kind of show some characteristics on both definitely but as far as like the way it breaks down and the way it looks at first glance definitely a little bit more cookie leaning is that Audriana rato genetics that does this well I mean yeah we're just talking about how by all the started out in Colorado so I would guess that they picked up this wrong if they're growing themselves out here they could just be sourcing it it's probably Canada auto cut out of MIT I was just a great pie and dim it yeah I mean that's what I was going off of great pie is archived great pie is it we're getting we're getting too deep into it you guard this we have some pretty good wheat in front of us here as far as the smell on it so you're calling it log a cake which to me means it's another one of these pastry slash desert tech terms which have really become popular in the last few years I've got like like you said just the cake ones that we done biscotti gelato all the stuff that's really been hyped lately tends to be strains that are named after like baked goods or like I said other desserts or stuff like that those it's always interesting to see if they're actually gonna taste like what they're named after right you know I'm saying stead of Sour Diesel or og cush it's like back in the day there was a lot more strains called that you know stuff like that what didn't necessarily describe the way it should taste like nine pound hammer yeah I'm go into that expecting anything but when it's called lava cake you're expecting it to be chocolaty kind of lava cake yeah I think it has that primal honestly man I hate to beat a dead horse but I feel like we'd only has so many like different lanes of Terk profiles and like this is kind of remind me of the dog vaults again and I swear I mean it's a lot more sweeter but like it's you know what I mean it's got that same [ __ ] smell and I hit the joint and it's got it's got a little like it's definitely our features with the dogs dogs waltz in the flavor yeah I feel like it's not quite as pervy is that but as far as like more of the more of still that like sweet skunk enos that you get from that strange that's what I'm getting with they're not not as it's in handy yeah you know it's in there for sure but like I said yeah it's like it's more creamy cakey it almost smells like a fresh-baked [ __ ] you know pie or cake I guess I guess you could say cake or pot there's great pie in it it's called lava cake so it smells like a baked pie or baked cake that's what I'm going yeah I'm getting it way more with the smell than I am getting it with flavor on this one the smell it did kind of have to don't tell me it had a little bit of that baked good things that the things you're talking about that I associate more just basically then make cookie or whatever flavor I'm not totally blown away but I do really like the look of this stuff and I do like the smell I guess I was hoping for the flavor to compare or a mine a little bit more of this I gotta I gotta smoke a little bit more of this stuff I'm not I haven't quite made it my mine yet I'm almost ready to judge it I got a drunk my hand I'm gonna pack a bomb there and we're gonna get to rate in this stuff it definitely looks the look and you know like you said the smell is there I think it could smell a little louder what's the look it does look the look but it doesn't talk to talk not just in water it walks the walk a little bit but it doesn't talk to sorry all right what it looks a look yeah I like it well if you were gonna read this stuff we're gonna break down the number hold on to that for one second where are you going with I don't know I got a handful we don't know what to do with it but I am smoking this joint right here and the flavor is good but you know like I said it's got some of that baked goods thing wrong but it's got more jobs walls to me I'm getting a lot of that coming through the flavor more than the smell and yes I don't know man I think I'm just like if you just want me to rate this overall you know I'm gonna give it an 8 I'm giving it an 8 it's good solid week I'm not bad I'm not mad I'm not mad at the purchase it's definitely I was gonna say the buzz might be the best factor you're the best part of this particular strain and listening to Utah kind of gave me reassurance that that's probably the case come on why I'm high off the great pipe and wobble shy that's right whoo like I was saying earlier it does leave a little bit to be desired with the taste I feel like it's good it is good wheat looks I'm going to give a 9 on this one smell I'm gonna give an 8 taste I would probably give a 7 and then buzz I would probably give like a 9 so I don't know whatever that averages out to I think about eight eight and a half I think it's pretty fair for this one it's good when we agreed guys it's really good when we agree we're given an eight across the board there's only two people on the board yeah I mean it's good we like I said not mad at the purchase you know I would love to pick this up just about anywhere it's good smoke could have a little bit better flavor a little bit more pungent of a smell other than that you know looks are pretty damn close I like the way it breaks down like big nugget and all your left is these tiny little stems I hardly any stem weight breaks down really really nice I mean good stuff we've tried probably what this is for me this is a third batch of lava cake I've tried from different place yeah and it's all pretty similar so I'm guessing yes the same I'm pretty sure sir although I've noticed that there's there's one I think that has like more color on it and then one of this wasn't that flight line ringing yeah I've only had the lime-green one once or twice but I think I like this a little bit better lime green purple goodish GB in a Swisher or a Dutch backwards it kind of worried anyways anyways yeah so I think we're gonna leave now yeah we need to get out of things falling apart of the scenes but I gotta pick this first pack it up if you guys are out there still watching this at this point why it would be my view our smoke along with [Music] [Music] money going and proud money going alright I'm the trend time the trip had ass [ __ ] on the planet but the city got the world watch out the worldwide Lily rocking to and Millie slap you silly if I can't you talk", "Uk3A06ooQyw": "hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now let's try the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with alien og and three king strain cannabis so we're gonna do a nice review of both strains today i'm gonna light up a joint of each and we're gonna go over how good the buds are and how nice they look and i guess how well it tastes and everything else so let's light up the alien oh g strain first and see how good it is and take a nice look at it and then we'll light up the other time so [Music] it has like a really nice sweet taste to it the alien og so it's a little bit of a lighter green than the three king they're both hybrids though so let's pull out a nice bud and take a close look at it as you can tell it is a really nice looking strain has a lot of crystals on it nice light orange hairs it does look very nice so that's three grams of it it looks like a pretty good account to me i usually rate the account and the taste and everything all a little bit separately but and we'll rate it out of five so i'll give it for taste i'll give it a 3.5 to a four for taste out of five because it has a nice sweet taste to it the buds are really nice and compressed and packed so it does bust up pretty good and it's 28 percent thc it's a hybrid like i said both of these strains are it does have like a very nice taste it's very fresh tasted as well it's a very count we'll give it a it looks like a very nice account so we'll give it a three and a half to a four for a count as well the alien og i heard a lot of good things about it so i guess it is a good recommendation so i definitely recommend it get a chance to try it is a very good strain [Music] and it busts up nice and very nice so it's burning nice it is a good straight i definitely so we'll jump over to the three king stream like i said it's also a hybrid it's a little darker colored though we'll put this out and wipe the other one up and see how good it takes [Music] i just don't want to draw the video too long so we'll jump over to the other so like i said it has a bit of a darker green color to it [Music] it has like a bit of a stronger taste but it's a bit sour it's like actually quite a bit sour taste to it but [Music] it does taste very nice so let's open the bag and pull out a bud and take a close look at this cut [Music] so you can see that's a very nice looking butt like i said it's a darker green but it does look very nice tastes very nice it is nice and strong tasting that's two grams so it does look a little bit less it is it's a gram less so it does look like a nice account as well though so we'll give it about a three and a half for a count as well because they came in a pretty good account and when i say account some of you don't know what i mean i mean the amount that it comes in doesn't look like it's the nice like a nice bang for its buck if it's like a like a good amount for what it's supposed to be that's what i mean by a count so i'll give it a three and a half per pound i'm gonna give this one a four at least for flavor though because the taste of it is really strong i do like the nice taste and weed nice and strong tasting so i'll give it a four at least for the taste because it is really good so for the alien og i'm to give it an overall rating of four and a half because it is really good and if you like the sweet tasting wheat i definitely recommend it but if you like the sour a little bit different taste stuff [Music] so i'll give the three kings an overall rating oh i'll give it a four to four and a half as well they both have a nice taste to it and it's a strong good account and high percentage i forgot to say the percentage of the three king was 26 so they're both high percentage chc they're both nice and good they both make them feel good [Music] yeah at least the four for both of them i definitely recommend it so i want to say thank you all for stopping and spending some time here juvenile styles i appreciate it i hope you are all doing good in your life and hope you all got some good [ __ ] to smoke at home y'all have a good night peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show", "l6O4e6aqyBE": "what is going on YouTube take number [ __ ] two because I can't be left alone so this will not be an unboxing this will just be a review because now I've already cracked the damn thing open so let's just get into it shall we first off this was going to be allegedly you know so much sponsored by my and uncles companies the GM room Brewing Company and the French manner both in Newfoundland Pennsylvania area the reason I say it's sponsored by them no they did not directly sponsor the video but in a roundabout way they did my wife and I are going to stay there on our trip down to visit some friends and business partners and they were kind enough to give us discount and gave me a little bit of a refund so I used that money to get myself some medication today in the middle of the week kind of an impromptu trip so I got some prism shatter mocha lope bile era mocha lope now I wasn't sure about this because the name that's deceptive you know I didn't know what to think so it is pretty fresh today is the 18th of February it was packaged January 28th of 2020 the potency analysis is basic as pearl air as protocols you know they're basically on everything THC a seventy six point five five one CBD a zero so there's your potency analysis terpenes be Merck point nine five one B car 0.455 pining point two two three Lin point 208 humanly no point one five five limonene point one four one biz point one three to be pining point one two three Turpin alene point o2 to you know not too shabby so cracker open and I will say this I have not tried this yet I just cracked it open and then I got interrupted so this looks a lot better as you can already tell isn't the last couple of layers shadows I've had all my Alera shatters have all been dark all of them every last one of them they all leave a little bit of dark residue in the bottom of your banger and that's just the way it is however Alera has been stepping up their flour game and it looks to me like they have also been stepping up their concentrate game because that is actually some pretty nice-looking shatter a little more snap and pulley than shatter but it's a lot nicer looking than the last few batches I've had of their products so not that I've had any complaints about their shatter I seem to you like it I'm one of the few who is at least willing to admit that so with that said let's try these effects Oh before we do that I get homework on this one a mocha lope 80/20 hybrid indica dominant a cross of Oregon Afghani and chocolate supposed to have flavors of chocolate and coffee that is a bold statement chocolate and coffee are two of my absolute favorite things on this earth so we'll see let's get into her shall we the handy dandy G pen Connect get a little uh yeah a little bit of fat glob here we'll go a little bit crazy on it to test it out see how the flavor is I know I didn't use the dev tool I'm running off the cuff here I normally do this all in one take I never edit it's always live that's just the way I do it but today it's been a long freaking day I got rear-ended at work yesterday in the company van I just got my taxes done tonight so I'm just now getting home just getting a chance to medicate they just have to bear with me folks let's spin round so you can see it warm up and give her a shot shall we don't chocolate her coffee tastes so far a little bit of woody little spicy in which I expected that from what I read hmm we shall see not too shabby there's no throat burn it's pretty smooth okay I can taste a little bit of chocolate there I don't know about the coffee okay maybe I don't know we'll see it's going again get another one try second round now this is supposed to be some decent effects and stronger couch locky relaxation type effects which is exactly what I want it's which seems to be working so far I'm already relaxing calming down I was pretty pissed a little wound up how about work and then of course getting interrupted I get frustrated about some stupid [ __ ] sometimes it's just the nature of it unfortunately and I don't like that aspect to myself I don't I'll be honest with you I don't like having a short temper and I wouldn't say I have a short temper I really don't but certain things will just bug bug the crap out of me and more than they should and I don't like that I'm working on it though that's going again Cheers okay a little bit of coffee in the aftertaste there there's subtle flavors they are subtle this nice though um my first impressions it is smooth more than normal I usually have a bit of a throat burden problem with the layer shatter but I don't have that right now what little burning I've got is because I'm a little raw from all the coughing I've been doing lately and some yelling I've been doing in the last two days so no this is actually really nice this is an upgrade Valera's stepping up their game a little bit I think and that's good I want to say I like to see improvement when it's needed I don't like to see people sit stagnant my first room for improvement great you know move up the ladder which is awesome so Alera doing it up Cheers so I would say this is definitely nice a little more expensive than I want to see $80 for the gram before any discounts or anything like that I would like to see it more like $60 for the gram 65 maybe but definitely not 80 um I'm not mad about it though this was a little impromptu you know extra bonus I picked up this and I picked up some pharmaceutical rx so I'll be reviewing that next be my first time reviewing any of their concentrates so that a little little preview for you guys Oh we'll get into that we'll get into it in the next couple of days so we shall see but yes this mocha lope is killing it this is good stuff I'm feeling it so uh I'm gonna call this one a win I'm going to kill it here and just say guys I'm medicated I'm starting to get a little rambley if you're not a

thousands of sub species known as strains they are commonly hailed by distributors and recreational users for having their very own distinct benefits and effects for the longest time I thought that all strains of cannabis must be one of three types indica strains that are said to have a sedative relaxing effect sativa strains known to provide a more uplifting cerebral effect and of course hybrid strains which are thought to possess qualities of both indica and sativa right well what if I told you that everything I just described is just too vague to be accurate the effects that a strain may have on any given person depend less on the type of plant they consume and more on a person's body chemistry and the chemical properties of cannabis itself a recent study reveals a huge variability in the cannabis species with terpenes and cannabinoids actually having more to do with strain effects that indicates the Teva plants do what are terpenes and cannabinoids you may ask terpenes are compounds that provide a very distinctive smell and taste of each strain while cannabinoids are compounds in the plant that our body naturally has receptors for researchers proposed that Mir seen a commonly found terpene in cannabis is responsible for battling conditions like anxiety and insomnia so surely a strain containing nursing must be an indica strain right well not exactly your scene is actually found in both indica and sativa however it's the amount of mere scene that determines the type for example if your scene is found in a specific strain with a volume greater than 0.5% the strain is considered to be indica but if the volume of your scene is found to be less than 0.5% the strain is considered to be sativa with so many strains like this does the notion that all indicas today and all sativa is invigorate even stand true there are also other factors of play like a person's metabolism mobility and genetics each person metabolizes cannabis differently a strain that works on one person may not necessarily work on another for example this is Bob and this is Steve say both Bob and Steve smoke one gram of the same strain in one day after consuming his portion of cannabis bob is capable of functioning normally and goes about his day however Steve on the other hand feels much more potent effects and has to take five before he carries on his day why is this among many possibilities Steve may have specific physical ailments that affect his ability to metabolize cannabis unlike Steve Bob may have more scepters for cannabis in his brain stem allowing him to accommodate a larger dose so one can see how the type of plant had no influence in this equation whether they smoked an indica or sativa strain due to their respective physiology Bob and Steve would still react to the cannabis in the same way shown before you so if factors like chemical compounds and a user's unique physiology determines the effects a strain has on us why do we continue to use redundant terms like sativa and indica when they have no scientific merit at the end of the day sativa and indica exist as broad terms used to simplify a much more complex process many experts say it's due to convenience for a novice cannabis user these terms may help navigate a diverse field of which they have little knowledge simple terminology certainly comes in handy when an 85 year old grandma who is using cannabis for the first time has to differentiate between a nighttime strain and a daytime strain to alleviate her pain however convenience should not supersede true information advocates of the plant should be aware of all the properties of cannabis in order to help novice users out to the fullest given how long false information is circulated about cannabis for centuries the onus is on all of us to understand what cannabis truly is only then can the proper medicinal and recreational value of cannabis be truly recognized thank you for watching the puff puff post and

walmart parking lot cannabis review but it's all good i'm waiting for an appointment so i figured to kill some time i'd do a little review here hey you welcome to my course review at juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke crush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view the wind might make it a little difficult to get this done but we're gonna try to do it so let's light this up and then we'll take a nice look at the buds and when i get home i'll do another little close-up so you can see it a little bit better so let's take a walk over here it has a nice crystally taste it has like i kind of taste like a bit of a citrusy flavor but not too strong um so far the taste is a really good taste but it's not one of the best flavors i've just i just finished doing grape soda and jungle diamond and they were both really good top-notch strains so maybe i'm being a little modest judging this one right now because it is a nice flavor it's just not quite as strong of a taste [Music] [Music] we would do it again but it is a nice looking string it's not a bad strain at all the wind put my joint out so i gotta rewrite it just one second [Music] the wind is strong out here so it might not be the best video but i'm trying my best to with the wind like this so let's take a nice look at this here you all find a littler bud so we'll just take a look at this little the biggest one here because i don't want it to all blow away like i said when i get home i'll do a close-up and i'll throw it on here so you guys can see it closed up after because i'm a blaster looking good at my hat i'd be the mad hatter take it all to the bladder i like to dance when i'm faking i'm smoking on shatter it's only a gram so we'll give it it's not a bad game so we'll give it a three out of five for a count not a bad account it's not two weeks so we'll give it a three out of five it's not bad at all like i said it's only one gram but still and the flavor it's not bad at all it's just not as [Music] so what i'll do i'll give it a three for flavor as well i think i'll just give it an overall rating of three it's not a bad how you doing juvenile seems like you're dealing with a little bit of wind out there huh well i'm here to try out the bomb part for you guys so let's get this done you're right that's not too bad i would say around the 3.5 myself back to you crazy so with that i'll end it there i guess i'll give it an overall rating of three out of five it's not not a bad strength y'all have a good night and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] this morning now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all dirty stone but i got lots more

them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view boo [Music] what up world juvenile styles coming at you with mokey kush strain review so check it out i hope i'm saying it right it might be mochi either way we're going to review this strain it looks beautiful i can smell it already through the bag it smells delicious and i got this nice ash joint rolled up of it so let's light this joint up and give this a nice review alright let's light it up whoa that has a beautiful taste to it that really does that has a beautiful taste it kind of has like an orange type of taste to it i find it tastes like kind of like yeah like an orange is kind of citrus taste it tastes beautiful it tastes delicious almost like the orange crush or the orange push pop stuff kind of has a similar taste to that is very delicious tasted or the um what was it called i can't mimosa that was a really good strain as well so let's take a nice look at these buds and then i'll describe the taste and everything else a little bit more so it has very nice fat juicy looking buds check them out as you can see there's a lot of crystal on there i'm going to come at you with the close-up now this is the mochi stream beautiful frosty kind of got like a purple tint to it as well let me know if you tried this copy in the description oh so for that check that out though ain't that some beautiful looking but let's pull out some more so this one came with pretty much all bigger buds there's a couple buds that are smaller but not tiny just smaller compared to the other ones you know what i mean so wow that's a nice looking stream this one might get a 5 out of 5 like the rest i liked it last um not the last one but one before that i forget grape soda that one had a 5 out of 5. beautiful so oh man that smells delicious too it has like a nice orange smell to it beautiful taste i mean beautiful taste but beautiful smelling as well so yeah it does have a beautiful taste we'll give it the first rating we'll straight give it a five out of five for taste because damn that tastes beautiful so a count this is five grams so for a count minus the joint that i rolled of course but that's five grams i can't say that's a bad five grams the nice big fat buds like and so you know i'd say it's a pretty good five grams i'll give it a 4.5 for a count rating but it makes up for it with the taste it is delicious so for texture and density of the bud i'm gonna give it a five i'd say for that too because it's a nice hard bud covered in crystals and they're big too so i'd say i'll give it a five here i moved the light over a little bit so you can see it a little better so i'd give it a nice five out of five i'd say for texture it's a very nice nice dense bud covering crystal nice and sticky let's bust this bud open in half so you can see in the middle of it now that looks very nice hopefully you guys can see that good don't worry it'll be in the close-up it's a beautiful beautiful stream it is so sticky and it stinks so good like oh man that's beautiful so i'll give this an overall rating of five out of five i would say for the mochi or moki i hope i'm saying it right that is a 28 percent and i'm pretty sure that it's an indica i'll have to check it up and i'll fix i don't remember what they said so i'll put it in writing if i'm wrong i'm pretty sure it's an indica though and pretty sure it was 28 29 thc it was really nice really nice kind so like i said i'll give it at least i'll give it a 5 out of 5. yeah it's a good good account so yeah i'll give an overall five out of five nothing wrong with it beautiful taste and i definitely recommend it if you like to taste some different tastes and strains it is beautiful and if you're wondering i got mango i don't know if it's coming out before after this but that's coming out i got dire dr however you say it death bubba dyer dire death bubble yeah i already did normal death bubble a couple times and i got blue fin that looks like a delicious one too and it's another one smell right through the bag you know so make sure you keep your eyes up for those there's some other good strains and they coming out soon so if you've been keeping up with my mars hydro grow let me know in the comments how long you think they're gonna take before they're done because i'm super excited and if you have any strains you want to try out let me know i'm gonna put down i mean you're not obligated or not but i'm going to put my paypal and the description and if you ever want to go and check out like miku siku or any places around you want to donate i'll and me to try a certain strain i'll go and try it 100 but besides that on this channel i think i'm going to do my rap news once in a while again and i might start trying to do some other things to make it more entertaining so i hope you all are enjoying your night hope you all get some good [ __ ] to smoke and if you have any art you want to draw for juvenile styles any ideas let me know you can send it at juvenile styles gmail.com and you can also add me at twitter that in the description or wherever you want to say hey to your boy you know what i'm saying so you all have a good night stay for my update or check out the full update later on i hope you all have a good night peace", "pWRMKzO6n7g": "hey you welcome to my push review a juveniles girls this is what I do smoke push past and shatter - go and check them out I try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now it's there to show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with cherry pie strength cannabis reviews so check it out looks like it has some very beautiful buds I never smoked that yet myself but I did open it out in the sumela and it does have a very nice cherry like smell to it and it does have a very sweet smell to it so what I'll do is I'll like this join up we'll pull out some buds and take a close look at it so it does have actually a pretty nice like cherry taste to it it's which is kind of surprising it really does taste nice it is really nice and sweet actually so it's definitely going to get a few points for actually tasting really nice it does taste really nice actually nice and fruity and very light yeah you could definitely taste the cherry in it it is really nice so that definitely going to give it a couple points on the taste rating but take a look at these buds they're like really really nice they actually got kind of like a blue tint to them it's very beautiful looking so it's actually kinda like a bit of a silver color but with really nice bright orange hairs like it is very beautiful looking and covered in crystals never actually see much bud that looks really like that that's really really nice look inside so well and they're all beautiful like that see every single one of them is beautiful like that looks very nice so I'll start off by writing the account that's supposed to be seven grams so I'll definitely give it a nice rating for it count actually kind of makes me question the rating that I've been given some wheat that's been really really good but this is really really good I'm going to give this a five out of five I think because this is some very really good weed it's a beautiful-looking it's a beautiful tasting I'm pretty sure that it's high THC because most of them if they look that good and taste that good are usually pretty high up there whoever grew this card definitely put a lot of work at heart then they're they're bucking plants and if you like my reviews you should look over the next one we'll be doing Acapulco gold live present that's gonna be some good [ __ ] so keep your eyes out for that that's gonna be up next oh come this way says the passion wants to say hi I guess this is my best friend Sebastian he's stashed our terrier that's a half German Shepherd and half pitbull trying to get in the way a little bit but it's alright now come here but yeah this cherry pie strain is a very good strain giving a top-notch rating five out of five beautiful tastings beautiful looking came in a nice big account make sure you check the description after I do the recording and stuff I always put it push through in fact in the description so you can learn more about the strength so maybe I'll go and take a quick bong hit of it and throw at the end of this video I'll show you that but I am really liking this cherry pie the rating is nice and everything so with that I guess I'll leave it there let me know if you ever tried cherry pie strain yourself if you've enjoyed it as much as I did or if your strain was as good it is very nice so with that I appreciate everybody that stops and spends time over here juvenile stars you guys have a good night peace now it's done I'll be back but I have to go now that we're all dirty stone but I got lots more videos so you can stay with shows so bust up some more fish to roll and watch another show now I'm glad to know [Music] you", "BJ7co8AsrFY": "hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with tom ford kush so this is a really good strain i can tell by smelling it it almost smells like the white wedding which was a really good kind i tried from the liquor store and it was like 40 something bucks for three and a half it was like really really good so let's smoke the big joint i roll to this and take a nice thorough review of the tom ford kush so it is an indica and it's 25 thc which it ain't the highest but it's up there so let's light this up [Music] [Music] i rolled a little bit of tight little tight but it's not the weeds problem it does have a very nice taste though [Music] so it has like a actually really sweet taste but it actually tastes really fresh too so let's pull a butt out and take a nice look at the buds too so this one here this is a very nice size bud let's take a nice close look at it so it's like a very nice color green with very nice hairs lots of crystal on it it does look very good so this is five grams but it's very compressed so there's one nice size buds and they all the other ones are about just medium sized butts but they are all very nice and it does have a very strong taste it tastes very delicious the best way i could describe it it's oh no strong flavored but it's really sweet and it's like strong flavor but it tastes really fresh you know some weed you can taste it it hasn't i don't know it just doesn't taste that fresh but this has a very fresh taste to it it's hard to explain but it does taste very nice like i said it's an endica it's 25 percent tom ford i definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out i've ever met oh i can't talk i recommend this kind too it's pink island kush i'm pretty sure i've done a review on it before but it's a very nice kind too so if you ever get a chance to try the island pink skunk it is pretty good too it's 25 indica as well and yeah it's very good i'll take a bite out so you can have a nice look at this kind as well because it's another really good kind i do enjoy it has kind of more of like well it says skunk so it has more of like a skunky smell to it but it has like a very nice taste to it it's a little sour tasting but it tastes very good and deathbob is another good one too but i've already done a couple recommendations or a couple reviews on that i'm starting to feel pretty good up this stuff already it's definitely a good strain i'll give the taste of four out of five at least because it's a pretty [ __ ] good taste i was maybe even yeah i'll say four out of five it is a very good taste and i am starting to feel pretty freaking good so let me know down in the comment section if you have any recommendations you want me to try or if you want to see me do a review of it i'll try to get it out and we'll try it out so with that oh yeah i wanted to say if you i know i already smoked i didn't get a chance to review i smoked i was impatient but this stuff the willy wonka or willy's wanders by diamond it's a very good type of shatter i definitely recommend it sorry my dog does trying to get out or whatever so we'll end this off soon so i can take my boy out so with that i'll give the um account rating it doesn't look very big but it is very packed buds are nice and hard so i know this will get a good a good amount of it so i'll give it a three and a half out of five for a count by a four and a half a four out of five for taste so yeah i definitely recommend it you get a chance to try out the tom ford go get it for yourself or the willy's wand is shattered that's that's pretty good too it's by diamond concentrates so go try that and let me know what you think about it like i said if you have any recommendations here you want to see me try put it down in the comment section if you like these please subscribe for more they'll be coming up two to three times weekly i can't do daily all the time anymore because i got some [ __ ] i gotta take care of but i'll be here as much as possible i'll try to do more with that i appreciate everybody that comes

having a good night peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show", "2ImrKTyshJA": "[Music] - but Stevie it's your buddy Jack how to make moon rocks I've been getting tons of requests for this video so here it is trying to fulfill those requests what you're gonna need course your bud just a quick delicious lemon tree across between Sour Diesel and lemon cush my two favorites in one of course you're gonna need your Keith nice bottom of the grinder filled here and saving up for this and of course your th distillate you can use shatter he's gonna have to warm it up a little bit this here is from yak it's a food grade you can literally just like put it on a cracker put it in your mouth and eat it and I will do the trick you can dab it but it's really dark and the reason for that is they use a grain alcohol distillation process instead of butane part of their like company thing is trying to leave more nutrients in it some of the chlorophyll some of the other nutrients in the herb to give it more health benefits and make it more medicinal so I'm just screwing here - when we started making them you can use that you can roll it in it however you want to do it but let's just start diving in here I'm gonna bring the camera in and get some really nice cool shots for you guys and show you close-up how to make a moon rock to lift off just like this guy right here oh my shirt take that beautiful mug that Keith and that distillate coat the moon rock I should have gone a little slower here savored it so I ended up kind of spreading around with the tip and you could have used gloves maybe - let's go ahead and spoon that on got a little lazy let's go ahead throw it in there roll it around really that up get as much of that tasty key from that beautiful but as we can scooping it working it just like that and let's just hope that looks nice now let's go in and crack that come on crack let's back up and you can further and break it down into as many pieces you like and further coat it leave it as is do what you want to do but that's just pretty simple take your distillate coat it on the note roll it and keep drop keep on it hit it smoke it get high as [ __ ] these moon rocks were solid but I believe and I know actually I can make better with a different distill it and that's that let me get it better you know it doesn't need to be Sharlee this shade is strong but the reason i say that too is because you saw how dark it was and it was very thick and a lot of times on the ones that i've seen my friends make and the ones i've purchased I feel like when I crack them open that THC distillate is a little clearer it's a little more runny but this one's still solid don't get me wrong I'm not trying to hate on the product it was good would I do it again probably but I'm gonna find something a little bitter I want to always take it up a notch for you guys so thank you for showing on this video thank you for being true buds enjoy this last Buddha rock with me load up whatever you have roll it up I'll wait a second what let's smoke up I'll catch you guys on the next one I hope you liked all the videos I've dropped this week I think I dropped like six or seven but you know you can always count on those Wednesdays and Sundays for sure anything in between is kind of like a bonus that I try to throw out there just keep it cranking you making cool stuff creating conversation bettering the community and just being true buds true cannabis culture you", "DHxmWKapDeQ": "okay guys we're going to go through the distillation process this is the main part of the wheat which before you plug it in especially when it's dry always make sure everything ears off okay guys most important everything's going to be off you don't want to start it off being dry what we going to do this unit here that your thermometer the treating the temperature in here you've got to be safety that you've got to make sure you don't practice it people like a piece of laboratory equipment it is so what we're going to do is our first thing we're going to go through is we're going to go through a cannibal like so and the box it comes with the unit you see here I have it on my on my note bored here so I can just take notes as I'm going through and that's a good idea to take notes important so what I'm going to do is I'm turning it on full ahead and get on variable so it's all folks you got variable you can go and change the wattage to the heating element but we're not we going to go full tilt so that's on I've got about half a gallon in there it looks a little over half a gallon so fired up we're going to be putting the lid back on and you can see it anyway doesn't have to go a certain way we go anywhere next from here once you put your gasket copper mesh you don't have to do this but I do and there's four rolls of copper mesh that comes with the unit and you can use both the glass all the stainless you have to do it together it's really up to you the glass is a little more of a novelty you can watch the process and it will teach a lot about distillation process so there we have it oh my god okay now putting on the top of the snow okie dokie here we go Tiger up gasket I hope you got another clamp yep yes we do right set our alarm set the alarm for around about 150 site it alerts me for when it's up to temp well allure to be at 150 so I know he's it's a 20 degrees Fahrenheit away from starting up so hey guys how are you so I'm after the distillation has done its job but we can see what we've got back here and you can monitor that anyway so what we're going to do this has been off let it cool down for a good 15 20 minutes and be careful with this unit as well and we've got our Bowl here just you know and you will lose some of course you know just that have to any subject mystery stuff that once friend of mine has grown I don't know if you can see this but it is it's a beautiful car very nice color so I know it's going to be quite hard to see you guys but um and I'm pouring I think we're doing the mango so you can see how much material we got left here and actually what I'll do is I'll Marcus mark the bottle as you can see here just think it was a bit of an education so we know you know if we are losing any or if lights then you will back engineer it and find out okay where is it going we're realism okay so there we have it just pour it in like so like before and we haven't cleaned this this is from ma from the time before so we're just going straight into it again dealing with the solvent sorry solvents are yeah just caution you know it's all about common sense yeah so always have some common sense and if people are smoking just tell them to do it outside or whatever but just at all common sense so we had that and plug the sucker in okay again the alarm is set 1 50 60 when that goes off in a be phenomena are ready to start okay so on why this is heating up as well I just want to go through with the about keeping a library of what you're doing you know library information history about how you doing your rants and and do it um you know you're going to have a sort of a know what I say a database of all herbs spices or brought down to their arrest like you see here okay so you can do anything from onions peppermint strawberries mins eucalyptus whatever it may be and then you go into all the fruits and everything like that if you want to mix it with the cannabis you can add all the flavors you want to it and you can render them down put them in these jars and you can have them stored away and when you want to do some blending just bring your jars out hey guys that's here I'm going off i set it off about 150 side just lets me know that it's just about being primed because from 150 to their arm the 172 and beyond it's just very quickly so I'm going to take that off here and now i'm going to be set my alarm i'm going to be sent my alarm to add about 170 for 175 because when it starts to get closer to the any of this it's a of course is going to be a lot more water down there and so the ethyl alcohol gets less and of course the temperature will rise so when it gets up to learn about yeah 17 for 175 then i know that i'm i'm getting close and of course you can always go by how much ethyl alcohol is coming in as well but other than that and what i am going to say is well there's the thing that i was talking about previously and I always keep samples of every herb spice just everything everything that I do and just basically what it's doing its up you're creating a library and and you may got some great data and feedback from all your experiments and it just goes to show you are any plant you can get the algorithm from majority anyway so I guys do not and improve what we do here so I picky still now once I rented this down and then show you basically what we've got and that will go to so as you can see it's been running for 20 odd minutes or so anyway so what we're going to do is that you can see the blue line is here so you know we're rough you got about an inch so what I'm going to do is on the start I'm going to put it on bearable it's on for rebels just the other side you click it and then I'm actually going to its not backing it down a bit you don't to back it down too much because you're going to get to take a long time to recover the solvent so you know and this is what you have to learn and that doesn't take all that long so I'm turning the dial back just a little more and you'll see the flow rate change jar would not I would not leave this as it's running in this stage because you haven't got much to go here and you don't want to burn the closer you get to the blue line of course it's are leaving nothing in here you've got a chance of scolding it and you don't want to do that you know discolor you lose all your two things and and that's doing any any hurdle spice or whatever it may be okay just as the second time the alarms gone off I reset the alarm okay it's gone to 176 it's now rich 176 letting you know it's getting really low so what we're going to do is we're just really going to turn it down low now we've probably port of the way to go or quarter of an inch to gosh you say well I don't smell any took things there so it's a good sign I'm going to turn this off and and have a look-see which is in here and then if I think I can i extract I'll board the solvent I'm going to do so it's not long about just render it straight away ice we're just going to now pour the contents out of here and the reason i was saying before to take note and history about each extracting you're doing and how long it's taking and the temperatures take note and so you can be repetitive repeat it all the time without ruining your loan you learn a lot from doing that way to anyway talk to you go okie dokie so i'm going to pull the contents in here smells absolutely beautiful so there we have it you really can't see you guys but well let's see what happens when I slowly keep this up and get rid of what's remaining in solvent or moisture okay see what happens just got to download some okay here we have it this is the mango that's the salt from the other two runs and up just pouring us in and just repeating the process guys quite simple you saw how much was in here okay and same again still goes on like so just make sure nothing stuck to it and put you catch my mother I always say you never ever leave this still working when nobody's about there's always somebody about okay turn it on and off we go so when this is all finish I will turn it back on okay you", "l7dP70VFo90": "site is going I can't even read my Twitter feed I [ __ ] these people I don't live if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the [ __ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "VSj3JMwq5U0": "hello frosty is in yeah Miska Terios up these tourism look that's the one I'll keep them in separate the

everyone that's luck Dan locked on coming straight to Babylon and from Babylon we shall always escape today we have my way while we shatter that's right my way while we shatter last week I did the Mount with wildflower so if you didn't see that video go back one week and check them out but today we're gonna compare the smell and taste of the shatter compare it to the flower and most of all we're gonna see how did the medicinal properties compared to each even though this one has a stronger tac but I also think that when you have the flower you have more medicinal properties because of the plant and their whole nature of the natural extraction and other than a man-made extraction but that's nevertheless we're gonna smell this Maui while we shatter mmm the smell is one of a kind I never ever smelled something so sweet and so tempting to taste just from the smell hey I must admit I score big on just when it thinks to those guys that lo lo Haga apothecary they really did made the medicine at a nice price for all the patients to enjoy but nevertheless no more prolonging let's taste this on Maui why we shattered I know you're seeing the concoction of me loading the dynamap any questions you may have concern of how that process took place just drop it down in the comments I was glad to get back to you guys on that anything else just hold on one second and also have a special treat at the end of this video so if you are locked in and locked on this long please check them out at the end I mean maybe some we get a laugh and maybe somewhere think it's funny but either way it's all entertainment thank you very much for locking in and locking on and checking me out oh man it tastes just like it smells yes it's a winner begging a little hug mean apothecary you might see me again later today I should have got a couple more grounds at that one whoo that's that feel good aroma mmm yes baby I like it when it does it like that in at the price point it was a very good deal and I'm very happy so let's keep this medicine gang strong and keep everyone living prolong so Aloha but don't click off this year I have one more feature for you guys at the end [Music] and I know every eye will see [Music] [Music] [Music] till they get away I'm passing garden with", "3Gfj1uhpFWw": "[Music] but guess what i'm coming at you with jimmy hendrix cush train check it out hey you welcome to my course review at juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view sorry about the start but you know what let's get into this strain it looks delicious it all came in one big bud as you will see in the close-up because i did the close-up before rolling the joint so you could see exactly the whole bud was it was all one button it was three grams so maybe a little bit over but the whole bite is exactly three grams so i just wanted to show you it all in one so if for babbling so much let's get into lighting this up and reviewing this [ __ ] hmm i need a second to let that sit it kind of has like it has a nice taste but i'm having a hard time trying to think of words for it have you ever had the jack hair kind i feel it has a kind of a similar taste to that it's pretty good yeah i can taste a bit of citrus but not a lot i don't know it does taste a bit citrusy but it's also a bit sweet it's not a strong flavor of either it's kind of a mix up and it's like it's like nice it's a nice strong head of flavor but it's not too harsh on the throat but you definitely feel it a little bit so let's take a nice look at this but instead of me discussing how it tastes all day like i said it was all one big bud i ripped a little piece off at the bottom to roll the joint up so you could see it all in one i did the close-up first so let's check that out [Music] now [Music] animosity [Music] all right we're back as you see this but has a really nice color to it and it kind of seems to me like it kind of has a bit of a pinkish tint but not a very strong one just a little bit of a pink tint to it it's one hard ass bud too it's nice compressed but i will give the texture for this but a nice rating actually i'll start with that this time we'll start with texture and then i'll get into doing the bong hit and then we'll rate flavor so it does have a really it has like a nice flavor but it is a bit like it's a mix between a nice like a sweet kind of like a fruity smell and or like a berry kind of smell maybe and kind of like a citrus smell as well it is a nice smell though i want to rip it in half so we can take a look in the middle yeah hold it back so you guys can see it with the light it's a nice looking bud and like i said it was three grams nice beautiful beautiful smell so i'm gonna rate the texture of the butt it's nice hard but i don't know if you heard when i broke it in half i did it by the mic so hopefully you heard it it's nice hard but nice sticky crystally but it was like you definitely have to use something to bust it up for sure so i give the texture a rating because it is a very nice beautiful bud nice hard but i'll give it a nice i'll give it an actual five for texture beautiful but all one i like that nice heart but i'll give it an actual five for texture let's do the bong hit got the bomb here let's put a piece in and it sits right hard buzz even this little piece gotta try to bust it up good enough to burn so i was out not a little bit before i started doing this video i'm just really freaking cold also got me sniffing a little bit but it's all good though let's light this up oh daddy that tastes good to be fair with you guys and the bong i definitely taste a lot more of the citrus it definitely has a lot more of the citrusy taste in the bun that tastes good though i'm going to take another go and then we'll jump back on the joint finish the review that is good now sometimes i recommend smoking the weed at a joint or whatever i want to recommend smoking this kind in the bomb it tastes really nice oh that tastes really nice yeah i definitely recommend smoking this kind in the bomb it tasted really good so this got me [ __ ] up i'm just playing let's light this back up finish the review as we do so i'm gonna give i'm glad i did the bomb hit first this time because i'm going to do that from now on but for the reason i'm glad i did that first because it tastes better in the bond and i'm going to give another little bit extra points on the rating of the taste because it definitely tastes a lot nicer than the bomb so i'm going to give it a 4.5 at least for taste it is very good tasting and jimi hendrix kush is seems to be pretty good i would rate it if there was like say kind of a god rating of my absolute favorite i'd put this just under it because it's pretty good definitely recommend it you get a chance to try out the jimmy hendrix kush pretty dope so like i said i'll give it an overall rating a 4.5 i think that's pretty fair it's a pretty good ass bud texture got a 5 though out of 5. and if you have any suggestions or [ __ ]

usually\ndo we're gonna have some fun and we're gonna blast some Keef we don't do this\ntoo often this is a nice canuk cookies Keef very powerful so let's get started\nwe're gonna fill up our extraction tube with it this always makes for good\nquality shatter you guys okay as you can see that's pretty compacted in there\nand it will be if you ever try this you guys you should never ever ohhhhhh alright\nguys we've got our tube filled here I just want to say if you're ever gonna do\nthis this is basically like a solid plug in here so you can't use coffee filters\nyou should either use some steel mesh filters or strong nylon filters these\nare a hundred and sixty microns were gonna slap these on and we're\ngonna go outside and blast this alright everybody we're outside we're ready to\nblast this Keef and just remember everyone this is not like blasting bud\nit's gonna be a lot more pressure in this - so we're gonna activate our green\nmachine let it do the extraction for us and we're gonna walk away at a safe\ndistance and watch this alright everyone here we go check it out you guys look at\nhow dark yellow that is wow that's gonna be powerful that's looking good all\nright you guys we're outside now and we're just boiling off our butane liquid\nthat we've blasted our Keith with soon as this evaporates our going to throw it\ninto the vac oven alright guys we finished boiling off our\nKeif here we blasted the Kief and we boiled it down this is what left is left\nand now we're going to throw it in the vac oven all right you guys we're back and we\njust pulled these concentrates out of the vac purge oven on my left here this\nwas our keif we blasted and this was regular bud and there doesn't really\nlook like there's too much difference so I'm going to give each one a little\ntaste test for you and see how that goes ok  you guys we're gonna start off by\ntasting this shatter just heated this up here we go oh that was very tasty this is to keef\nblast here let's try this you know what they are so similar you\nguys I can't believe it I could almost hardly tell the\ndifference so it goes to show that blasting your bud is probably just as\ngood as blasting

rip one breath okay guys the diamond OG shattered the diamond OG shatter dab hit with the illusion glass i'm going to be taking a hit from the ball from grab live beneath the nano with some zed hash plant cheers amazing devs and that hash plants for days the dog and og shatter and lissette hash plant baby one hit the maritime ways whoo amazing the diamond OG shatter the zed hash plant purple dispatch we're brothers garden you guys are [ __ ] amazing if you guys like this video give us a thumbs up we're going to keep on pushing the limits by the end of September we're going to be doing the one gram gab with the email using the beer brother concentrates hell yeah this is just working away up baby well thank you so much everyone have a rockin Thursday amazing", "jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys [Music]", "JpYcxSzApZY": "Manning in Rome smoking weed weed from the earth god put this here for me G C 3 rams medical marijuana boy I molest turtle beautiful spring lovin if you're not go back inside be cold two guys txt two years um it's [ __ ] like still februari but it's like spring all i had to get outside here and just just look little beautiful just a beautiful day spend the yard it's Sunday morning early and I figure I do a little [ __ ] wake and bake review some tabs is that the hewa corner to the other day I'm Aaron scroll that dropped off a fire new shatter it's a citrus app cheddar on this intercept was a flower that was in recently at twenty-seven percent he'd seen last week where I did I think is like same thing right on 26 27 th a fire eye strain I'm familiar to the intercept that's the gorilla glue number four across with the tangent Gorilla Glue number 4 across continue this is Teva it's pretty high cards Kaiba and they got in the shadow form now which is causing confirmed bands bugs also remember that served the shatter now in the parchment paper city squish it dab it up you're losing you losing your shadow from the old you know old school classic taneously started off with so that's awesome also secondly this is the first time they've offered to shed her in a full gram from used to be sold in half games I'll actually have it in one grand form it's a little bit economically press it's like right around eighty dollars for the whole gram so that's actually pretty straight for Connecticut as far as kinetic goes to the fact that you can actually get the whole Bram now and so just half an you know front through your meds real quick so excited about that so on it's a damn good alright so here it is what they're calling it is the um yeah this is a TV on I 82 because it has a basically a two percent H seen it and done that's a pretty poet too so well you can smell it right through the jar you immediately get some of that it's like a mild moldy like Thank like orange attending with that good yeah with your latest got it that's what happens is you get out of here bugle container you get these look Josh I actually boom and then inside of here I'm gonna have your gram making a happy grin alright okay thanks and it looks like be actually looking at look like right there you see right in there do the piece of shatter that's sitting in the corner that's it okay Clint yes let me stop this is awesome to get the whole gram get the punch paper inside and I any fingernails so he's going to dab it here just hang out yeah yeah there's a little piece of Opie's watching and I'll pull up for the first time okay so you get your parent now you get in like this one big fat as Glavine here you know when you open it up it's just give you like a big rock let's check it out just we see what you get for ramming oh yeah that's much better looking that's not drop us in dirt good okay so here's what yet what's next pretty nice figure out look look at my side huh gorgeous all right really nice day um this trees yeah but ok sign its back to the weed is what you get like as you can see finger wise it's actually piece and duct sighs it's like about twice the size on my whole top of my finger and you can see it's a nice solid slab I'm shattered well this is the citrus sap which again is a grill glue number four crushes the tangi real clean looking cheddars you can see nice golden color and reddish no bubbles nothing time watch let me show you some as you can see here to be shower solution here see it's just like a Sears one big heart piece of shatter it really is it's nice there's a good piece of concentrate for here sure now are you like what do I do now here's the trick you take your one day with me gonna do a little hang here we go you take your shadow fold it back up in there carefully do not drop it be very upset you dropped it fold it off and there make sure you got a little bit of leeway on the edge there because it's not only way it will spread over the edges now what I do like fold the corners in like that just makes there's no problems no I just like this this hold on my hands it does 40 seconds yeah kind of keep crush on it pressing it press press press press press press there's a lot of your seat takes a little bit more time to make it malleable what you're basically doing is you want flatten it down and you want spread it thinner so when you pull it off pulling off nice thin dabs let's stretch and save your medicine we won't clump up on you and snap off that's bad thanks now I did that four cups like it's now watching it when I open the pack paper ready smoosh it around you open it up and watch this feeling that happens yeah one little extreme basile it's obviously a hell of a lot bigger now now watch when it's like that we can do I take a diver let's take yourself a little piece make sure you come on see easier now say boom there makes it so you don't have to like basically have it snap off and then fly and lose it and be pissed too austere chatter so see you're still some nice tab right here is what we're gonna dab on your zoom them a little bit CCO qualities focusing on dead no we're focused on the Deb I'm do two of these get my morning started right let me keep moving so we're dad pulled out here that's I get the dab going nice so again beautiful Sunday morning wedding great day to do some dabs oh my dad fell right off my right off actually split into two okay so what that being said let's call out like this it's not really cold cold it [ __ ] what I should find snapping everywhere you want me to like right off so i take it what i can know what I lose already squish now if that ever happens to you just read squish it see oh really what sticky kind of pain two balls but it'll go latch it it'll squish right back in so basically just one note you want to take on that is a what you pull off your dad it's been anything but like extremely hot outside don't wait too long to data because all those that was tough so there have an experienced leaders here what happens squished it it was to come back together let's get a dad and get it in there we go okay let's get that down the Florida before hardens up and he falls off you huh ok so my Sunday morning we can dig dad on the citrus app and again pardon sign once knocked up all my dad's my dad's want to fly off the Taylor here I'll be so pissed if he said they fly off the table it chicken with doing okay hey I'm gonna try not to lose my dad's here it hadn't shipped laughs in the wax flat from the win I my work my lack on the floor have you so upset that's a whole gram so upset okay I've again citrus a chatter gorilla good number for Gus's the tangi seems like it definitely good strands do you wake and bake with definitely has changed you wake and bake with i'll probably just one day i'll try to snap off another one real quick and then I keep moving on it's beautiful sunday very nice inside open release inside enjoy the spring weather I didn't get here I'm excited about this first outside whole season it's getting his hat on [ __ ] up I was excited said a few great citrus up chatter cheers that's fantastic it has the flavor profile that's really really distinctive Oh a ton of that tangi glue but it's like this it unlike real the glue flavor just like what was in the arm [ __ ] outside also girls win it huh personal mount right there oh we got sun grill restaurant a kid who's that grill the same same distinct test but then you get that tan you ain't still you feel in your head um this is a great daytime medicine if you want to start your day camp capo just feel good just feel happy right your son citrus up chatters definitely gonna do it I feel good right now I had a really shitty night last night I downstairs up all night structure nude is what it is and I was just one we got medicated and feel better this morning this actually is doing a trick good it's taking my stress away taking my worries wet definitely had some really bad sleep issues why didn't feel rested and I bounce you I just did want that hair you feel kind of rested which is nice um it's just shattering the pieces out here I'm gonna do a one more dab with [ __ ] out of Dodge definitely go down to healing corner put yourself Victor cell phone set your sub shattering again this is the whole brand you're the whole van now adays we should get the half primers which is nice i'm glad they did that i'm going to looking forward to all before the shatters they come on i hope wink wink come back are with the foodie pedal shattuck stations fire tease scratched your toilet I'd love to try that again look try again um okay so we got my stuff stressed out here we got one more dad going on and we'll leave all you guys enjoy your sunday he's here oh [ __ ] [ __ ]

alright so that's shadow put away safe I'm good there this is a great eight hamstring it doesn't [ __ ] get y'all freaked out immediately and like get you all the coaches smokin all paranoid I feel good removed I definitely will start my day I'm actually really excited about suit the day may bring now because of this um I'll be back next week some [ __ ] fire whatever comes down with healing corner grounding hand corner its best dispenser in the state Connecticut by far Tyrone down there said hi and yeah you're a scientist in this nice weather it's [ __ ] gorgeous all right now there's absolutely no reason at all you should not be outside enjoying this get yourself some citrus F shattered drilling over for cross to change you can do some gaps um licensees you can see I'm not like [ __ ] like though they just sorta [ __ ] fact out I feel good feel focused and ready and that's like what you went with meth marijuana you want to make you feel like I'll [ __ ] out of it you're actually doing this Terry get your [ __ ] done not [ __ ] just beer all [ __ ] up all day that's not how it is anybody has that misconception about the medical everyone but Kylie just watch your Stellar's now I use this for [ __ ] purposes to actually just get me back to kind of look normal look click that a [ __ ] night now I feel kind of known every second dad I'll probably feel great and wants to go to the following day alright work we do chase I that one [ __ ] around my balls and it's got like this really spicy peppery aftertaste let me I sell that one was really nice hey guys good i Accord pixel is hell out JC two ears happy Sunday guys", "ozjrp7D213Y": "i just wanted to stop and show you this before we start the review so you can see up close look how beautiful the pink in this weed is this is the strawberry chem dog you can tell by the look and smell it's going to be delicious so let's get into it hey you welcome to my kush review at juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with bow strawberry kim dog like you've seen already that little close-up it is a very beautiful pinkish color and it smells very delicious it actually smells very strawberry like in the smell so i'm hoping it has that taste too and well yeah let's light it up and give it a review like always but i'm just a little excited because it looks delicious i've been wanting to do this a little while so i've been waiting off so i'm finally decided to do it so let's light it up that has a very nice taste to it wow that tastes very good so to be honest it does have a very nice strawberry taste to it not like strong like a fake drop like taste it actually smells i mean tastes kind of like fresh berries like i don't know how they got that in the flavor but it's very delicious it don't taste like just the normal drops or not and it's definitely not just those it tastes very nice so let's take a nice look at the buds so it's a little late if i seem a little tired today it's just really early in the morning i just wanted to get this one done so i could smoke it you know so let's take a nice look at the butt this is very nice looking buds here i'm gonna turn the light up so you can see the pink color better um has it too much a little bit too much there i don't know it has a very nice pink color to it so i'm hoping that you can see it hold on it looks like you can see the pink a bit more when you open the bud right up so let's do that so this is the middle of it you can see the nice pinkness to it it looks very delicious very nice looking buds and it smells so good to it like it smells very delicious like very sweet and like berry-ish man it smells and tastes very delicious i don't know what to do with this right now i don't i'll just give it a five because it is very good to taste to look the account that's two grams here and this is what i got for it so let's see that's two grams there plus this joint for how good it is to like i'll give it overall rating of five five out of five very very good if you ever get a chance to try the strawberry chem dog it is very good i definitely recommend it especially for flavor for hot like i can't like overall it is a very great strain if you get a chance to try it i definitely recommend it i might go and see if i can try to get an ounce of it or more because it's very good so like i said overall rating of five strawberry chem dog this is a very good strain so i think this is like the second one i gave a five out of five to i think it was the rockstar too when they were both by the medicine man the medicine man sorry so like i said if you're lucky definitely go and check out see what else he got because i'm gonna go do the same and i'll let you guys know in the videos because whenever i get new you know i'm going to come at you with a review of it so with that i'll leave it there i hope you all are having a good night your own i'm not having a good night at home and i hope you all get some really good [ __ ] to smoke with that i'ma leave it there and take up i hope y'all are doing real good i really appreciate spending time over here at juvenile styles you know i do so y'all have a good one peace", "MK0W4NcEVcg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] what's going on guys this is gonna be my homegrown guerrilla glue shatter what can I say about the plant I put it outside like pretty late it was probably I wouldn't say much taller than taller than like a foot foot and a half maybe two and no it was definitely under two feet and I just planted it in the ground and probably went about month or two and a half maybe it wasn't out there very long and I got five ounces off that plant which wasn't like super great but it wasn't bad like I thought I was gonna get like an ounce or two the buzz weren't like super super dense but they were big I think just because it the roots kept dislike going everywhere like maybe the nutrients wasn't really able to get to everything so it wasn't bad the smell wasn't really like a regular gorilla glue it was almost kind of like peppery it sounds kind of weird but it was like like a peppery kind of like spicy kind of smell but um like the exhale on it it was it had like that uh earthy gorilla glue kinda taste but it wasn't like super super like present but in this it's more so like a little bit of like Bolinas with what's the word yes like citrus but it's not like like a regular citrus it's like sound like a twang to it the feeling and it gives you I mean I think if this were like some top-shelf guerrilla glue it would be like more useful you know what I mean I mean it right now I like it works for just like clearing your mind and just like you can be focused on one thing and like all these other things will like can still like come into your mind but you're kind of just like whatever so it's pretty good for that it works pretty good for like my neck pain like have like a pretty stiff neck all the time it's not really like a strain that I would use for like eating or anything like it doesn't really make me want to eat more food it's kind of kind of makes me want to like I don't like I could smoke this and I could like be content with not eating like it's not like jumping out of me like oh man that piece of pizza sounds good it's like no I cleaned this though I've been having like a hard ass time cleaning that I don't know if you guys can see that but it's like well I think it's like little water stains I think the water where I'm at might be like hard water or something where it's just doing that because I didn't really have too much problem when I was at my parents so yeah I live alone it's kind of you know you're learning new things like learning that this water is doing things like that and yeah hmm how big of a dab should we do on Iran I gave it to somebody and it was probably 2 ounces I think I weighed that with me and it was bud two ounces of bud try not to ball out too hard don't really want to like smoke all of it but um because it didn't finish all the way and it was outdoor I only got a little over a gram per ounce which I mean it's not bad but the top shelf that she has she usually gets like 6 or 7 grams per like 2 ounces so I'm definitely gonna work on like trying to get this gorilla glue down like pretty good cuz um I have the cat piss down pretty good but I just I didn't have like enough to run it because I I mean that plant got 3/4 of a pound so that was like the best yielding one but I wasn't able to run it because I smoked most of it and there's probably no I don't want to say like a half-ounce like there might be I don't know I feel like this is gonna die don't you do it Hey told you I'm not doing this low caption no that's not gonna work I mean it's kind of um that's kind of like a cami I cam dog kind of um like a funk to it but it's really um like citrusy kind of not like like some regular like citrus skunky type stuff but it's really it's really um odd I mean it tastes good but it's just it's hard to really pinpoint like what taste that is I mean it's definitely some pretty good stuff I just think I could have done better growing it and then I probably would have got like a better yield I'm gonna run what is it part of the last plant that I harvested that's Gigi she unfortunately started growing into the ground because I put her in a pot that had holes in the bottom so she just started growing and growing and growing and she was at least like oh I see out of the bucket like if you just cut it off with a dare line and probably be seven maybe eight feet with the bucket closer to like nine like it was it was ridiculous in the bud turned out they turned out like pretty frosty but they they were like really lanky just because it just they kept growing like and instead of like fattening up I mean I was feeding it like nutrients bloom nutrients and stuff like that so it shouldn't have really been doing that but I'll try and I'll try and work that out this time damn thirty minutes I think we'll take one more dab and then we'll be out of here medicinally I would give this this particular batch right here like a six maybe high six like it's not what it could be and I don't want to like criticize myself too hard cause like it's really not that bad like if it was bad I wouldn't be smoking it because I don't smoke garbage like it's just not I don't know but like maybe like a high six for like just medicinal reasons but like just in terms of like getting really high and just like feeling good this is a I would I give the other gorilla glue top shelf I gave that like a twelve just in terms of like getting really high like an eight eight and a half like I really I like I really enjoy this stream like I recently stopped smoking like the the top shelf gorilla glue and just kind of like leaving it alone mmm it's good I kind of just overdid it but now that I have this I'm kind of back on that training again cuz it's it's a really good medicine and it does work for like my anxiety and my depression and and and it works for pain pretty well I mean I think either grilling we might work a little bit better but that's just because it was probably growing to like thousand watt lights and by people who know what they're like really doing I've been doing it for quite a few years and it's on like a large scale so I'm really excited to grow this year I just bought I just bought some seeds from attitude seed bank I didn't just buy him it's probably like a week or so ago and they shipped him six days ago so um there's sunset sherbert I don't remember what company there by but they're feminized and I'm hoping they're gonna be pretty good see that I was trying to rest it on that it was just like this is a very social strain I think like it just puts you in like a pretty like good mood oh damn freaking [ __ ] see you guys the next one", "tZ25ZDmcp-Y": "what's up well this is juvenile Stiles here and today I am doing the gorilla

real for real I hope you all have a good year hope y'all been having a good time pace", "YXpfchNKqm0": "hi I was doing some plant extractions so I thought I would share my process here you can see the ground up plant in question normally a chemist will do setup like this this is footage stolen from nurdrage if you don't know him go check him out anyway the key feature here is the soxhlet extractor it is a device that you can load up with stuff and it will automatically cycle the fresh solvents through it it is basically automatic self siphoning device if you like me don't have such logic structure or any glassware basically you can use method that I am using here so this is just basic filter paper that I modified to allow vapor to pass through it of course it has to be compatible with your solvent on top of that you can place random container that you will fill with cold water ideally this should be glass container but in the past I have used even polypropylene plastic cups also here is some kindergarten science in case you wonder how you can make effectively holes in this filter paper you can see that I intentionally offset the first hole from the bottom this offset basically depends on how much material you have now let's put in just a little bit of a solvent I'm using 50 milliliters of ethanol put your stuff that you want to extract into this filter paper do this outside your extraction container because you can contaminate liquid then a few your cooling container with water and be sure to keep outside dry now you can turn on your heat source and just wait actually you should periodically check the temperature of your cooling water one little problem this setup have is that the filter paper likes to suck in the solvent and carry stuff with it this is not a big deal unless you work with extremely small quantities in which case you shouldn't use this setup anyway you should continue with extraction until you see that the solvent that comes out of the filter paper is basically clear I guess depending what solvent and what you are extracting here you can see plant material after extraction and you can see that is quite off-colored and at this point I tested the extracted plant material and I can confirm that the chemical was not there and here's the extract it should be pale yellow oily resin material but you can see that it has quite greenish tint to it this is due to presence of chlorophyll in this part I will try to extract the chlorophyll from the extract itself unfortunately only way I can destroy chlorophyll presence is by UV fluorescence which would not be so terrible but unfortunately my only resource is this PCB exposure unit I built sometime ago this is about 120 watt light source and the radiation from this Fink is overwhelming when you turn this thing gone basically whole world looks like it's dead and I will have to make some adjustments to the scene so you can see what I can see and now we are cooking there may be much better solutions to separate chlorophyll but I know only about one solvents that can do this and that is propane or butane or mixture of two now this will be a little bit crazy but actually propane mixed with ethanol is not quite that volatile but it's still pretty much flammable so be aware of that at least I mean it should be unless you are five years old anyway so you can see that there is quite clear separation of two fractions since that chlorophyll content is not that different though also in the visible light this is really nice but the question is how do we separate this seriously what did you think if you have one you can use separatory funnel just never never plug it up even though it should handle this pressure there wouldn't be much much higher than one atmosphere of pressure I mean do you see any problem here I repeated this extraction about six or eight times now on the left side you can see the butane fraction and on the right side you can see the ethanol fraction the ethanol one is quite muddy it seems like it has some water content in it to be fair I also fill tributon fraction through some filter paper so but still it wasn't muddy it seemed to be contaminated by some solid pieces now both fractions are right and you can see quite clearly the color difference now let's look at this under UV light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can see this reddish fluorescence that is quite specific to chlorophyll this is the beauty infraction even though you can see some orange a green fluorescent blobs there on the other hand in the ethanol fraction you can see that the whole material is this orange green fluorescent pink although even here you can see some quite a reddish spots that could indicate some presence of chlorophyll so the separation is quite good but not 100%", "2Tr4hIr3m98": "what's going on everybody watching smoke one I'm gonna do a review on Dutch Hawaiian true flower today I truly they have this

purplish tint to them it's pretty good nice strong tasty flavor 23 percent THC to have half I bred between what's happened occur and half the people it's a hybrid for those who don't know what it means but it's nice and strong gives you a nice high it's pretty good to smoke when you're on the go because that's having a have a don't make you raid out of it you can still maintain yourself and it burns nice and smooth I could sit there and talk for a bit it don't go right oh boy I don't burn right away and it's a decent price for how high it is it's not the highest pH level but it's got a good

start with straight form and we can actually get through this review without that happening so let's light this join up and take a nice look at these buds [Music] Ono has a nice crystally taste to it but I can't really get nothing so the filter came out but we fixed it so let's get back in the smoker I don't know some climate like like kind of like a two inch taste to it but I don't really feel like it's like two tuna he's tasting it is kind of tastes a little different but besides that I really don't have nothing to original taste into explain but it does taste nice and strong so don't get me wrong I'm not saying that it don't taste a bit of taste very good and very strong tasting but it just don't really have too much of an original taste to explain you know what I mean or to describe just taste like some pretty good decent person so let's take a close look at these bud very nice juicy box as you can see they look very nice it's a nice light green color but it has some nice light bright orange green hairs they do look very nice please and see it's good there so that is about six grams - the joint that I rolled up here so it does look very nice I'll give it a three and a half four count the taste tastes good but like I said there's not really much original originalitycheck [Music] but it does taste good and there's nice strong patience so I will give it a green half to a poor poor taste as well because it does taste very nice [Music] so it does seem to be a very nice-looking strain nicely everything seems to be very good about it but seem to be feeling all right sober

this new series is going to be the search for good cheap kush so i'll find some good cheap strains and good priced ones plus good quality and we'll do a video about it so you'll know where and what kind to look for or where to get it so here's a new series the search i hope you enjoy it start the show hey come with me i found some cheap wheat no stems and no seeds just high thc juvenile styles this is me leave a like maybe sub be b g it's time to blow some tree what's up world welcome to juvenile style so i'm gonna come at you with three different parts but they're 100 ounces because at this store um empire healing they have if you buy two or more ounces they have a couple strains that are a hundred dollars an ounce if you buy two or more so i decided to get all three that they had which was grapefruit blueberry and critical cush so i decided to get all three of them so what i'm going to do is do a three part series but i'm going to stay here and do it all at once and smoke a big joint of all three of them and do a nice little review so you know how good they are to see if you want to go get yourself some of them or not because that is a pretty good price for a nice ounce and they do all seem to be pretty good have nice smells and whatnot so let's do a review of all three we'll start with the grapefruit so let's light a nice join up that i already rolled and i'm gonna dump it out and we'll review the buds real nicely like so yeah let's dump this open like this up i'll just dump it out on my tray here so that i can hold up a few nice buds to the camera so you can take a nice look at them so the grapefruit it did bust up really nicely and it does seem to have some really nice looking buds and it has a nice a nice citrus smell to it so it does like smell a bit fruity so it does it does like the smell does live up to its namesake anyways and the taste it does it does have a nice like you can have it has a little bit of a plant taste but it does taste nice and sweet and a bit fruity so it does have a nice taste so yeah hold the buds up a little closer so you can see them they ain't too bad looking buds yeah we'll find a bigger one here there's a nice size but there see they're not bad looking buds they do look pretty nice and like i said it does have a pretty nice fruity smell to it there's a little bit of leaves left on it that could have been trimmed a little better but not it's not bad at all like there's not really any shake or bottom of the bag it seems to be all nice buds like so it is it is trimmed really well and so far for the taste and the look of it i definitely recommend it for the price so it does have a really nice taste to it it has a pretty nice smoke so um not sure exactly how much percent it is but i'd say it's at least in its 20s i would guess so it's probably about 23 to 24ish it's really not a bad kind it is definitely worth a hundred bucks i would say i definitely give it a recommendation so far there was one seed in this bud that i busted up to roll this joint with but i busted a couple open it doesn't seem like there's very many so there's probably only a couple throughout the bag but that's probably one of the reasons that it was a little cheaper but i'm going to be putting this out when i'm done and i'm going to be going straight to the blueberry and then straight to the critical push so by the end of it i'll probably be really high so make sure you watch through the whole series i'm not going to record like i'm going to record them all at once but i'll be posting them up in different videos so keep your eye out for all them i'm going to do these ones a little [Music] different sorry we had a little problem but yeah i'm going to be doing these ones a little bit differently but i'm going back to the old stuff or the other videos if you don't really like this style i just wanted to try something a little different but yeah we'll go back to the buds so they are very nice looking bud stuff especially for the price like i said 100 bucks an ounce can't go wrong so i got these ones all from empire healing like i said if you want to try it i'll put a link to their website in the description so you can go and check them out if you want now i'm not going to lie i already smoked a little bit of the blueberry kush and uh the critical push within the last few days because i just thought about it being a good idea to do this little i guess hundred dollar review thing because so you all know where to go and get yourself some cheap weed that's good too i just wanted to try it out so yeah um i went and grabbed these and i grabbed like a couple thirds like the sour tangy i'm gonna be doing next and the orange push pop i just did i got a whole bunch of like the 4a kind so i could try them out and do reviews on it and then i got these ones just to smoke on the side and that's when i was like hey that's actually a good idea to probably do a little hundred dollar ounce review so instead of rambling on i just let you know this is a good strain i definitely recommend the grapefruit kush it's pretty good strain especially for the price like i said and with that i should leave it there and jump to the next one i hope you all got something good to smoke and i hope you all having a good night peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can't stay for shows so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show", "Z0Uwl-eK1Vg": "I've got a rare strain of smoking on today it's a strong

can start to feel a kick it out here a second alright guys it's about a minute and 30 in and the effects are still coming in pretty strong I can feel it behind the eyes my head is getting kind of like it feels like it's under pressure yeah the indica effects are really really strong it's not really it's kind of coming to my body but mostly in my head right now not like in a sativa way but just feels it feels nice very relaxing oh yeah I just wanted to say I did not actually have to purchase any of the weed in this video that you see here I'm not gonna tell you exactly how much I got but I

my loyal subjects we back at it again yarn over fo going on we back at it within that video we get out here from more in-depth review on the white sugar diamonds the 99.9% THC crystals the diamonds that we reviewed on our other video link will be in the description down below but that was a Waxhaw we reviewed more than just one wax we reviewed six different forms of waxes and took a dab of each one in one sitting the link will be down in the description below so you can go check that out but today if this video we'll be doing a more in-depth review on those white sugar diamonds you know we'll be taking a better look at them we'll be tasting them and then we're also gonna take a dab of them by themselves and we're gonna take a dab with that with a little bit of other wax just to see on the flavor and the potency see if it actually can take effect on the other eye like if we were to mix it with another form of wax as well so let's gay since we never got to do since we never got to do a full-on review on my new piece not really that new it's actually like about a month old now but still my frequently new piece my honeydew as you guys can see it's got water hose perks we've got um perk here in line there it's gotten great pull that's a fantastic piece the honeydew overall it has a fantastic pool it rips you can take a small eyes dab and you'll still get a fat rip out of this thing it pulls really really well all right guys 99.9% look at that oh my goodness if you guys can see that look at this bro it literally looks like glass look at that oh my god now guys if I were to break one of these big crystals it would turn into nothing but see-through diamonds like those guys oh my god look check this out look at that [ __ ] guys now that has been broken down [Applause] all right guys this is a fat dab of this 99.9% TAC diamond crystals guys cheers oh my god I'm done that was insane you guys don't understand our filet was like it tastes great oh my god I'm done [ __ ]

gonna be talking about indica and sativa and hybrid you know those three weed strains one makes you all energetic makes a queen house and one makes you up to the couch and sleepy and naptime but is it really the case I hear a lot of different versions of the story we're gonna dive into the science and to the reality of those topics tonight with the monarch Animists we have Jerry in Austin and myself Troy from fortunately Bebe's own we are your three modern cannabis and tonight we're gonna be we're gonna be vaping a bunch of weed and exploring indica or sativa what do you what do you guys have a pin on tonight go ahead Austin I'm gonna be vaping on the one form from Planet of the vapes and I have the vortexes sitting here and we may pull off the sticky break we'll see how long this thing go all right oh man yeah I'm rolling with the one as well but I'm sticking it on this thing I got a chance last week the polar blast this guy was there with these ice mugs for bongs and he packed some full ice and he had a little you can smoke with it but he has a little little kind of gone connector here so we can put the one right on there it's a perfect little walk around with some ice cold so I'm kind of stoked right now I got some hippie Crippler which I believe is an indica dumb and it Hybrid feels that way we'll talk about what that means that's a pretty cool contraption Jerry I'm diggin it so you're you said you said it's an indica dominant hybrid I think so it feels that way to me so in the traditional strain definitions of cannabis they always say that cannabis has like two different species of sativa and indica but in reality it's not really species of the plant it's all it's all one plant even hemp is the same plant at plant as marijuana but as far as the indica and the sativa the traditional wisdom kind of says that indica makes you you a Orpha body high in sativa is more like a mental euphoria but how do you how do you see those results with what you're vaping now you said it's an indica dominant hybrid would you say those effects are a reality you know it's all about how we communicate and you know we've had got this anecdotal thing like you said sativa indica and the hybrids and and what they mean and it really from experience it's a way to communicate there's some other guys come out with some new ideas but typically when I say an indica dominant hybrid I mean something that's gonna kind of take it down the middle I'll get I'll get some good head high as well as some some little bit of body feel but then towards the end I get a little sleep here and a little more cow cheese so you know like about a ninety minutes a two hour ride that kind of goes like that kicking ass I'm gonna be vaping on both I I went out and I chose a very strong known sativa and a pretty strong indica so I have Sour Diesel lemon cush going on here and then I have purple punch for my indica and I'm gonna vape sativa first and I've already been then I've already been vaping sit even already have kind of a mental high and halfway through the show I'm gonna switch to an indica just to see how things go Austin I know you have a lot more smoking background I know you're you're a full time vapor now and you're also in a legal state so from your past smoking experience yeah have you have you ever even been mindful of indica or sativa or notice the difference in the smoking world so I would say that I've noticed a difference but I couldn't tell you what it was you know I just because being in this net time you know I can't just go to the store and say hey I want in the car hey I want sativa I just get hey let me put some material in my blunt let's bump this [ __ ] and I'm gonna go play some video games either I'll play video games all night or I'll play video games I'd fall asleep you know so but I did I do notice though that there is there was a difference because I remember sometimes I would get like anxiety just like a whole bunch of [ __ ] anxiety from from certain strains and other strains I just felt a lot more relaxed and wanting to watch some some movies and [ __ ] heat some chips and call it a day until I saw burn up a little bit so from from the smoking days I don't think I ever paid attention to be honest with you yeah you know from for me and I remember my smoking days it was a lot of the same and I think there was two different highs that we had but it wasn't it wasn't so obvious like there was like the high where we'd get out and and and do demolition derby on the righthand lawnmowers at this farm and then there was a time where we would just all pass out on the couch and just you know watch some dumb movies but we never we never really associated it to different strains we just kind of thought it was more of what are we in the mood to do like we always treated canvases hey we're gonna go get high we're gonna do something whether it's gonna be watch it at watch a movie or we're gonna go [ __ ] around and I still treat it that way even though in the vape space I do notice a pretty significant difference between sativa and indica I just power through it no matter what you know I was today I was doing some more research on on the differences just because I wanted to have more of an understanding of what the traditional wisdom is right and I came across these articles I'm gonna read to you some of what this article said and it says it gives me examples of both the Innoko and the sativa and it says the major qualities of indica medical strains include increased mental relaxation muscle relaxation decreases nausea decreases acute pain it increases appetite and it increases dopamine which is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain's reward and pleasure centers and they say that that's that's used mostly for night time and then there is the major qualities of sativa okay are in anti-anxiety antidepressant treats chronic pain increases focus and creativity it increases serotonin which is a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of learning mood sleep anxiety and appetite and they recommend this for daytime use so upon reading that you know that that really kind of breaks it down to me and like I said when I would back in the smoking days I can relate to both of those back then I wasn't paying attention like oh this is what it's making me do but I can I can remember that there's definitely a difference I just couldn't pick and choose when I would get that difference yeah I think I think a lot of that is the differences are one there they're subtle I mean if you take a super strong sativa and compare it to a super strong indica you you make the very biggest difference but everything in between is is really just kind of in between and even a lot of sativas that I buy and and I have the luxury of being in California where I can walk into the store to the dispensary and look at oh these are the 15 sativas and these are the 15 indicas and these are the 30 hybrids that are in between in reality almost all the sativas are also in between and almost all of the indicas are also in between like all of the strains always have kind of some of both like there's there's not a lot of strains that are one end of this thing that makes sense because now somebody will tell me what strain I'm getting right and they'll say I'm getting blah blah cush for example and I'll go to leaf Lee and see you know what is the most dominant traits that I'm gonna get from this plant and even it will say creativity and [ __ ] energy but then it'll it'll it'll show some of of relaxation you know I'm saying cuz you have the bars where it just shows you how far on that bar system graph you get from each of these things that that are prominent in the strain and there's always some some of the other yeah that's a cool set I like to where they break that down and make it really easy for you to kind of check it out sometimes I look at it and I wonder am i setting myself mentally by by you know what I made am I am I am I gonna create that now you be yourself the placebo effect yeah there you go there you go so I always wonder about that cuz I mean they really are I mean it seems like everything's some sort of a hybrid look man I mean I'm I'm still in a state that just became legal and I still don't know that I really trust some of the stuff that I get here I just got a whole bunch of blue dream and it just looks like whatever you know I just you know and I literally got it just because I thought it would be and I wanted to see if it was whatever so the one thing we've learned about the whole indica sativa hybrid thing is it's really not as cut and dry as the three labels make it out to be and when you get into the science it's really about the terpenes and the entourage effect of all those different terpenes and cannabinoids because there's hundreds of them every every cannabis plant every kind of a strain there's hundreds of different terpenes and cannabinoids and every every strain has a different combination of them and those different combinations all deliver in effect so even if one strain has grown in four different environments at four different regions with four different soils and four different climates that same strain will essentially have slightly different turkey and cannabinoid profiles because of because of the way it was grown and give you a subtly different high or majorly different to it depending on the strain don't you love organics I mean the possibilities are endless man I just love that you can take one strain and come up with all kind of different things just based on environment and it kind of mimics us man we come out as little babes and the environment just beat us up and runs us around and then we're a certain way you know and you know they focused on THC a while ago and everybody's always about how much THC is in this thing and I go man I'm so sick hearing about that I mean this is the first thing we discovered a while back and it's all we know and so that's how we measure it and then we started noticing CBDs and so they start you know tracking that stuff and oh look at the medicinal effects and then all of a sudden it was it a few years ago that the terpenes started making a big difference and all of a sudden that was all that mattered and now I'm here in southern flavor noids are gonna be you know the next thing and it's just there's so much going on in this thing we don't know I honestly think we don't know what's up I mean we're at the tip of the iceberg on this thing so we could all like get passionate argue sides about something but I think it's all gonna get re proved or disproved or deeper figured out later and we're all gonna be wrong about most for you guys that are there listening or watching if you're wondering what terpenes are myself personally i had to google it i wanted to i wanted to get more information on what what terpenes are and what I found is that terpenes are the fragrant oils found in plants that determine the character and effects of cultivars I believe Cu LTI VAR s cultivars we're never in a question mark that one they are found in all living plants not just cannabis terpenes play an essential role in wine aromatherapy and perfume because of the psychoactive effects of certain terpene combinations that stimulate aroused or sedate so that's where like you were saying troy the entourage effect the different the different terpenes are gonna give you different effects regardless of if it's indica or sativa dominant terpenes play a big role yep yep absolutely yup we don't and we're only tracking like about a dozen of them right now there's there's tons of those as well I mean that's what I love about it is every time we discover some of this stuff we go look man how much we can figure out with these 12 or 16 and then there's like another couple hundred in there messing around - let me tell you what's I know I just got those plenty of the babes one today and I've been i've been using it man and I'll tell you what this thing puts out [ __ ] clouds it's got a little a session time around here and I let it sit at 4:30 with my CBD in here and I just and I just roast it man you can give some [ __ ] clouds out of this thing you're gonna be relaxing from that bad action there I like it yeah man this same thing is filling up this little polar thing over here with these good little design men when it comes to like customizing your high and choosing like what kind of energy you're looking for I think that's really where vaporizers shine because when you smoke a strong sativa you can still get really stoned and versus we're just smoking at us and in the could harder tell the difference when you're smoking when you're vaporizing you can isolate those temperatures of the terpenes and cannabinoids so you're not not boiling off the sedate of cannabinoids you're kind of selecting your high by choosing the temperatures and I forgot where this was going really high I forgot what I was saying CBD actually CBD does vape CBD does vape at 4:30 100% I actually pulled up the chart that we will make sure that we can show you during the video but I found a chart online that actually breaks down the different compounds are in the THC you know lets you know from from 220 degrees all the way up to 450 one which is combustion alright so you know we've got from 220 where releases THC a a strong sedated anti convulse event all the way to combustion which is 451 where it states that the fire it releases toxic chemicals by producing smoke into the air and the good thing is with these vaporizers especially the battery-powered vaporizers is we can actually control the temperatures in which we've a bath so we can medically or recreationally extract the specific contact yeah and get those charts are getting nicer man that's that's pretty sweet I like how I laid that uh yeah I really like this one you know it's different from smoking you know you smoke and you basically poof it all goes up and you destroy half of it and then you get the rest of it all at once and when you're vaporizing you can you can dial in certain temperatures that only go so far in terms of what they're gonna to liberate and that was one of the draws to me when I first started vaporizing because you know like like we were talking earlier you just get whatever you can as far as herb on the street and you don't know what you're getting and and it's hard to get a sativa but but I could take any of those hybrids and they're always hybrids that I could get and throw them in my vape and keep it at 350 to 390 and really have that heady daytime social cleanup thing that I thought I was chasing and then I could keep the rest of it for at night I bump up the temperature and use the same or at night and and they'll be my night cap and I still do that now I've got a I got a whole dish over here right here that's everything that I've baked at a lower temp and I'm gonna beat it up later at a higher temp and that's been one of the great things about vaping for me is being able to get the flexibility from from the machine that I wasn't able to get on the street from the way yeah I think I think that's absolutely right man and it's almost like vaporizers are a better tool for customizing your high than relying on indica versus ateva versus hybrid and all that [ __ ] for a lot of people because you can you can vape an indica at lower temperatures and not get sleepy high and you can vape a sativa at a higher temperature and get the sleepy high because I I do it all the time on accident and that's well it's really cool to like like what you just touched on Jerry is is the temp stepping where you can take any strain vape it at 350 save it for later if you want to put it back in your vaporizer turn that [ __ ] up to 400 and extract the rest of the compounds that are left over so you're not you get everything almost out of out of vaping and and what's even I cost my lungs up earlier and I thought I muted but I didn't these mics are setting us up but uh that that's another thing that I really love about these vaporizers man is you can take this material that I've been using for a long [ __ ] time and you know now with with my current knowledge I've wasted so much material just by burning it and and just burning it alone waste the [ __ ] material because of the fact that you can temp step by by going at a low temperature from let's say 450 to get your Cleary 15 that's what I meant 350 right then going to 400 right and then you just so happen that if you really want to you can save your avv and then make edibles so like you're really extracting everything that you possibly can out of this [ __ ] miracle plant from these vaporizers and for instance I mean I got you got the butane vapes like the vortex or the butane vape like the sticky brick we can't really control temperature but with with this planet of apes one for example you can they have these things out there where you can really customize or hi and extract all all of everything this planet has to offer I just want to say that that scream you hear right about now is pakalolo don't worry man I got you I got you my man pakalolo is moderator at [ __ ] combustion and he's been preaching this forever about these these temp charts they're getting better on the web like I said but but they've had some that are out there forever and it drives them nuts because people come on and think ok then at 370 we're boiling this off in this other [ __ ] ain't and you know we're dealing with an organic structure that is is interwoven as depths and and as we vaporize we start on the surface or the outside and then work our way in and and if you're gonna convection vape and you stir it then you more exposure and different things and so it's not as cut and dry as I set it at this temp and I only got these compounds but anecdotally you can kind of draw the line in there and it works I mean for me that line is three nine D to 400 if I you know below that I get one thing and above that I get another and and and and it is a sativa indica kind of effect but yeah it's not as simple as just pushing a number in and getting it but but those effects are there man that's so true I don't want that a lot my first because I was using it you know medicinally trying to vape during the day and and solve my my focus issues try was trying to trying to replace adderall with cannabis which at first I thought was impossible but vaporizers and sativa made it possible and then as my tolerance built up I realized it's not just the sativa it's it's just just the cannabis that's amazing yeah we've really got a lot out of the temperature thing these days and actually one more thing I want to say about temperature stuff I was about a year and a half ago I was at a show talking to the guys from ghosts and they were doing some research I run into some where basically they were saying that the terpenes the in in in in in our plants start to get destroyed at about 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's when they start to get destroyed though that's why the the first temple net vape started out at 3 30-somethings 338 or something like that because they want to make sure that if you really wanted to get everything and that you could with all the Terps let's let's have a temp that won't destroy anything hit that first and he can move on up the the chain there and so that's kind of I was fascinated by that and I started trying to figure how I can incorporate that in my vaping controlled and I started out with a herbalizer blowing up a bag it I'd started at about 335 and hit the fan and let it blow up a bag and then I just hit the UP button and it hold it in and just kind of scale it cuz I think it goes so fast and over the course of about 45 seconds I could scale it at the top get one bag that kind of had the full spectrum and man I'm telling you they were taste and thick and I'm an amazing like it really was just a fuller bodied experience and so that's why wouldn't that volcano came out and I saw that program was like dude they made some little that'll automate this [ __ ] and it's really cool I recommend anybody who wants to [ __ ] around with full-spectrum vaping especially if you're doing the bags or something start below 350 and and catch everything you can I I think I I think I noticed a little stronger sessions yeah definitely if you if you stay at 334 or in that window for a while you get you get all the mayor seemed I think it is I think it boils up for like 334 it's supposed to be the most euphoric and psychoactive one and if you stay at that temperature you you keep it without destroying it and you can also isolate it but I wanted to go back to what you were talking about with the ghost and what they were talking about with with SERP II and destruction there's a lot of data out there and I want to point out that looking at data points and applying them out of context or in a different context and other than what they're recorded in is is is dangerous you know there there's some some bad decisions that get made looking at weird little data points and I've heard I've heard from vape engineers and vape CEOs you know tales of I go if a vaporizer is blowing vapor out your lungs and it's being wasted that came from it from a data set somewhere to you know somewhere he they looked at data and said oh this is this is indeed THC and cannabinoids therefore you know it's a wasteful wasteful thing to exhale vapor I just wanted to I just want to point out that data can be until many stories I took a bag once because I was like I'm gonna find a [ __ ] out I took a bag and I had an empty one next to me and I inhaled from this one and exhaled into that one and I just did it until the freshman was done I was like whoa and then I took that second bag and it was like moist or humid you know and it in and and and it didn't really do anything for my hi I was like I don't ever want that [ __ ] again I remember shotgun hits I wonder that if that really works I don't know like it at all I'll keep my vapor fresh thank you very much go through all these [ __ ] trouble [ __ ] rebreather vapor so I remember in one of our previous discussions you guys were talking about a nose test some tests that we can use to to identify whether it's a sativa or indica heavy strain can you yeah that shit's dope man this this guy max Montrose out that the trichome Institute is uh he's the guy I was kind of referring to early in the show man this kids on to something he's trying to redefine how we how we how we how we describe cannabis and from from sativa indica to a broadleaf and a narrow leaf marijuana whether or not you get into that and all those other stuff I don't know that's against linguistics but this nose test thing is Isla [ __ ] JIT and I'll put a dollar in the jar it's the [ __ ] did and I think the kid needs to get credit for it Troy and I lucked out and got to take his class out there in LA I think last year and man it was a lot of fun I learned a lot of good stuff man it was really cool interpreting class is what it was interpreting 101 by the trichome Institute that was a incredably insightful and educational day man not only do we get to hang out but there are so much amazing weed content and the biggest take home for me I mean aside from the indica sativa like oh whoa okay this is really how it works is this nose the nose test is what max calls it and here you can see like when you when you sniff you sniff your jar of fresh nugs you can you can kind of get a feel of where the where the cents hit your nose I should switch back to myself because I'm using my [ __ ] hands and stuff so when you when you smell your your nugs you kind of base the where the smells hit your nose like the impact of the aroma so here I'm sniffing this Sour Diesel lemon cush and it's the sativa which you should be feeling up here but in reality it's kind of hitting my nose in the middle so in the term of this the spectrum it's more of a hybrid than it is a sativa even though I use it as a sativa and it gives me more of a sativa effect on the flipside this this purple punch what when I inhale this for one it's like straight-up purple I can feel it like right here like the sides of my nostrils and the flare like in the Bell like I can that's where I can smell and feel it it's it's it's down it's down here and that is more on the the true indica of the feeling so an indica dominant hybrid you'll feel it here and here but if it's like a super strong sativa you'll get it up in here but even even with the solicit Eva's that I've found I still get some in the middle and in the lower part have you have you had a lot of experience with sniffing your weed Jerry yeah man since that class I've been playing there's a lot of fun man and it it works man I mean I can every time I'd go to my buddies and he pull out this big bag I go let me see and just and all you have to do is pay attention to where you feel it not what you smell not how it smells just where do you smell where do you feel the sensation of the smell which which never occurred to me before never I was like what the hell is this kid talking about and wow yeah it really is and when you feel it down here because it's it's it's it's lower I think of it being more grounded more of an indica as opposed to higher more in the head like a sativa and you just kind of go wherever you feel it on that scale and and you in and if you do it a few times and you really notice it you'll get to the point where then then you just don't even think about it you can smell it and know what's coming it's really cool yeah that was cool as [ __ ] how you just describe that like when lower lower in the ground and higher into your head like that's that's a great [ __ ] description and I just pulled out I just pulled out my CBD lifter which is supposed to be a sativa and I feel it I feel it like like here and even with the CBD fantastic yeah and that's that's cool [ __ ] yeah it was real cool when they first did that class and he taught us that technique he unfortunately he didn't have anything to demonstrate with and I had was funny I had ordered weed and I had weed on the way but it didn't get there in time when I when I got home that I was so excited to try it almost all of them kind of had the same impact in my nose and I was disappointed I was like is this really a thing because I bought I bought some sativas and I'm awesome indicas and they all kind of had the the same very similar then but then I found a few like the the XJ 13 and this green crack that hit real high open here and then I found some purple punch and this blueberry muffin xeno type thing that has a real low and yeah man sure as [ __ ] and then when you vape those that consistent temperatures you you do get more of those highs do you remember what he said about how to sniff it he had a little he had a method for himself that worked where he would like kind of go and they need and then he come in and do a short and then I forget what but then he'd go three pulses and I think the last one was uh he was like going out of like four or five different ways to smell it and I mean I can imagine if you don't know what's going on watching somebody do he's like what the [ __ ] this kid making fun of wine people in that moment but I could be wrong I don't know there's somewhere I don't know where they are I was like look at a good Tuesday but really what I do is I don't have that method down but I just I really just I breathe yeah exactly I just keep going at it in different ways until I feel feel it in the right place I do it similar to how you know inhaling or you're snowing coffee or something else though it's you a sniff test on you know that's that's super cool especially when when getting material that does not have a label on it old and those illegal states man gold I mean you got here you have that knowledge you can go into your guy's place and know what's up you can pick stuff feel totally I wish I knew about the sniff test when California dispensaries were still cool where you could go in and they had the big jars and you could actually like put your face in the jar and pick nose with chopsticks and wait a mile you can't do that oh I think there are still dispensaries like that but they're not all like that anymore like all the recreational stuff is like prepackaged and childproof and yeah you don't get the sniff your nose if you're buying you're good to say this year or I am is comes in a sealed package see it the old medicinal ways were pretty [ __ ] awesome this is dope so let me ask you this question I've always tried to figure out how can I remember these different breeds of cannabis both Innoko and sativa and somebody told me one thing that registered was with when you when you think of indica think of in a couch yeah and then obviously sativa is just opposite of that so you're not gonna be in the couch you know that's kind of a cool little term I heard back in the day hell yeah man tell you that that's that's one thing that I've always I've always remembered I've always used that as well in the couch yeah right sorry we're not using the leaf terms yet man I want to help the kid out but nobody understands me when I talk his language is I know man and for a while I tried to like I tried to pin it like every time I would say it's a TV I would be like oh this is a narrow leaf marijuana it's a sativa and then every time I would talk about indicate this is a broad leaf marijuana and then you got to deal with the haters in the comments right yeah are there haters that met that say some [ __ ] when you have every time dude there well it should be all love me and we're we're all goddamn smoke some weed and have a good [ __ ] day preach preach be like that why isn't it come on man can't we all just get along spread [ __ ] love vape owned with compassion I'm officially switching over to my purple punch with the g43 actually I had one little bowl of it earlier in the BAP cap and it did slow me down but I can still feel my my mental snappiness I want to go to a legal state real real bad just so I can be just so I can go and get some branded labeled [ __ ] and just try it well I get the effects that they say is on the [ __ ] lay people I don't know because I've not tried it I just want to try it and see how it goes yeah that sounds really fun man hopefully it's not depressing but at the end of the I'll still be a happy camper regardless of what effects like that it is cool just to buy legal weed just to walk into a store and buy buy a weed so liberating the first robbing probably more than the first six or ten times that was that was I was still giddy like the first time I bought it how I was giddy you know the first time I bought three ounces at a time I was like I don't think I don't think I've ever bought more than an ounce at a time I used to buy two or three ounces sometimes up to five ounces at a time and I would buy from this dude who he lived in Humboldt and whenever there grows would come down he would load them up in his car and he would have a big big bundle in his car and he would list this [ __ ] on weed maps like I would find it on the internet and text him and he would come up and he would show up in my garage and he would display all he would he would start pulling out these big outs bounce he's like oh I got you know bubblegum cush I got this and I got this and I got this and I got these you know and so I pull them out and smell them and one day I had a table in my garage and he probably had 20 different ounces and I was like pop them out and smelling them you got a UPS delivery the UPS guy like oh I got a bag oh cool when I was excited for my package that's hilarious so it was so surreal what's real boy dave has moved away he's gone man so I'm now a dispensary boy I've been going to couple them around here and it's it's it's been fun getting the sativas man I'm starting to get some things I like I uh I've been going to true leave and I like this um this member berri they've got is a great hybrid these guys here sunshine cannabis did a pot called Gainesville green which I'm partial to haven't been a gator myself and man that was a great sativa to walk around with man that was one of the I gotta get another one of those that was good I think those are some kind of strains that I'm digging these days that's cool member berries member Berry is good I always like to have both like I always like to keep some sativas and some indicas and I and I do well not right now my tolerance is so high that I deserve a bit high temperatures and then just go for more of a quick thing where the temp stepping and going for efficiency right you're kind of getting right to it aren't you yeah I'm gonna hit this g43 yeah these all of my indicas right now are extracts actually and the same thing I went to truly even got one of each and now there was a shatter and a crumble and uh the rosin and I got them all in because so my sativas are flour my my indicas are extra nice big Oh hideous Oh God in the g43 I'll tell you one thing man I haven't figured out edibles yet on this stuff III took I made some some butter the other day with it with a pretty good hybrid man I ate a big lump of it man I made like a butter sandwich man I was knocked out dude like two hours later I was on the couch like I'm moving I'm going anywhere I've passed out for a while woke up still grogs it was crazy it's crazy grogg so I don't know if you can get the same effects with edibles or not but I haven't haven't any luck with it have you Troy as far as getting sativa indica and edibles I'm really good you brought that up and it's not on not on our list of topics to talk about but I was actually just thinking that while I was inhaling this because I've actually read some some [ __ ] I think strain central is one of those guys who says like all edibles are just edibles like there is no sativa or indica edibles I don't know if I fully believe that I understand that there's going to be some loss of those crucial terpenes but I don't think it's it's again I think it's one of those things where there's there's some data that shows and then people go oh yeah blanket apply this data to everything and data is is contextual so III think there are still indica versus sativa effects in edibles I think in your experience I won't honor what you've experienced well I've had very mixed results and I and they haven't been promising but there are there are some this brand of gummies that I buy where there are indica gummies and there are hybrid gummies and nurses he become easy I can eat a bunch of the sativa or the hybrid gummies and be [ __ ] awesome like I can be high and I can be awesome all day and I when I was in Illinois I think I went through five five hundred milligrams or so the indica gummies from that same brand will put my [ __ ] to sleep well so not crazy coughs elected to sleep well they they make me so comfortable that I just like oh my god I was gonna die was gonna do this thing but the couch is so [ __ ] comfortable I'm just gonna you know yeah but me it could be placebo it could it could be in my head I don't know I don't know yeah this is interesting I'm not I didn't even think of that just because I can't I don't it edibles ever I mean I think it's actually goddamnit I mean there's they're chemically different you know what I mean so in terms of but in terms of making your own edibles that's something that I should experiment with that I've been doing my own edibles with concentrates who's making my own edibles with with like a grandma shatter our grandma oil sauce whatever and just quickly decarboxylated and making it in viewing it with butter but that's something that I can test I think I can get some sativa super-strong sativa concentrates that will challenge you should you should you should test it and then we should talk about it in a faded episode or something and see and see what the results are because I'm curious to know if that is a that's something that we can shed some light on I've not really mess with to me edibles myself to be honest with you we can she make it modern cannabis episode about it Jerry you're in a legal state and you can have that holes right you know I can I can buy some not as good a selection as you a lot of tinctures but I can I can make anything you know I can go buy a sativa and you can make it out of it or something wonderful I think we should do an edible episode where we take a bunch of edibles and and try to and try to get through an episode yeah well we need a we need I need to goddammit I want to I

styles orange push pop cannabis cush review enjoy the show hey you welcome to my push review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with orange push pop kush string so we're going to do a nice review of the orange push pop string so if you've seen my videos before you know that i've done orange crush that was pretty good i mean it had a nice orange taste to it but i found it kind of had like a strong like kind of orange peel taste but it did taste all right so this one has like a really strong orange smell to it just like that one did but it doesn't have like kind of like the peel has like a bit of a smell this one don't really have that smell to it so it smells really nice and strong like a really orange citrus smell to it though it does smell really strong really nice too so check these buds out it does look very nice it's a nice light colored green and it looks to have like a lot of crystal on it looks very nice so let's light this nice joint up and review the taste as well [Music] so it does have like a really strong orange taste to it but it is a nice actually really nice sweet taste it tastes very nice like the orange crush i found kind of had like a bit of the sweet but sour taste to it that's what i was trying to explain like the peel taste but this one is just like really sweet [Music] i don't really taste much sourness to this one but it is a very strong flavor it is really sweet so let's take another look at the buds and the account and see how good account this came in this was 2 grams so it does look like it is a really good account nice packed hard buds they look very good it was a little pricey i paid 35 i think for three of this one but it is really good tasting and really good account seems like it's worth it because if you throw that extra couple dollars in usually it is worth it sometimes you don't really get that good of a deal whatever when you expect it when you buy the expensive stuff but usually it is pretty freaking good if you pay that extra a couple dollars but this one i'll tell you right now i'll give it a at least a four to a four and a half out of five for flavor because it is a nice strong taste it tastes very good and the account looks very nice too even the buds themselves they do seem like they were well taken care of like trimmed really nice [Music] it is overall good strain i'm liking it so fat [Music] so what i'm going to do next i'm going to be coming at you with captain american og shatter so keep your eyes open that and i got cookies and cream strain and sour taggy too those are going to be coming up soon plus i got a few more but i'm not going to keep going on what's coming up soon just keep an eye out i got lots of good stuff coming up so [Music] like i said for flavor i'll give it like a four to four and a half at least because it is a very very good flavor i do enjoy it's nice tastes really nice like [Music] and it's really high thc i'm pretty sure it's like at least 25 to 30 percent thc it is a really strong strain and it does taste very good so i definitely recommend it i'll give the account rating i'll give it about a four as well it was pricey like i said but it came in a nice account i got this nice join out of it and there's still a nice few buds to roll a couple nice ones so i'll give it at least a four for a count as well because it is pretty good [Music] so overall i think i'll give the orange push pop an overall rating of four to four and a half because it is a really good strain i'd definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out i say do so if you like more of a sweet strength try the orange push pop if you like a bit of the sour kind that is sweet too but not as sweet just a bit of sour try that orange crush because that was a pretty good strain too but i didn't care too much for the sour i mean i do like the sour strains but a little mixture was a little different for me but i do recommend both for different people like depends on what you enjoy but they are very nice buds i'll hold it up again for you to take a little better look this is the biggest one that came with them they're all nice buds but this is the biggest one it came with um four nice size buds like that that's what i i took about the size of this one to roll this joint with so it was a really really good account [Music] and buds are really really nice so like i said definitely recommend it and i want to take a quick second to say thank you all for coming and spending time watching my videos i appreciate everybody that comes out here spends time over here with juveniles does i really do i hope you all are doing good and having a good time in your own lives have some good [ __ ] to smoke [Music] until the next one y'all have a good day peace [Music] now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show though bust up some more crystal and watch another show you", "opBfXbES-Rk": "[Music] hey you welcome to my course review at juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke kush hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with bop purple cotton candy kush so check it out it's actually a very nice looking purple color and what i've seen so far it smells delicious whoo so let's light this up and give it a nice thorough review like we usually do so let's get it going wow it actually has a really nice sweet taste to it too it does have a bit of a cotton candy-ish taste to it it actually is very enjoyable like of course you're gonna have a bit of a planny type taste but it does have a very nice cotton candy type of taste to it so let's take a nice close-up look at these buds they're not the biggest but they are nice looking bugs so yeah we'll pull this one out it's a nice looking one okay we'll grab one of the more purplish colors because some of them look more purple than others as you can see so well we'll take a look at this one first here let's take a look as you can see it's a very nice looking bun it's a nice light green color has a very nice layer of crystals on it and it's a nice sticky kind it's a very nice sticky bud this kind so let's pull out another one and take a look the taste is very delightful i have to keep i have to remind you that is a very beautiful taste i definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try this one there we go this one looks like it might be a little bit more purple too so you can see a bit of the purple in this one looks very nice so let's bust this one open and look in the middle of it we're gonna say this one's pretty sticky so you can see right in the middle it's a very nice purple very nice purple right in the middle so the whole bud looks very delicious so this here was three grams minus the joint i rolled so that's actually what you'd be getting if you get three grams of this and it's from the mis miku siku place i'll put the facebook link and the description again it is a very very nice strain so we'll give the taste a rating first it will give the taste a nice i'll give it a 4.5 to a 5 out of 5 for flavor it is a very delicious screen you get a chance i definitely recommend it like i said oh and we got pineapple star coming next so make sure you keep your eyes open for that and i want to mention something real quick if you've been watching for a little while i'm going to i'm a drawer i like to draw so i'm going to go and start a little thing either on instagram or twitter or both and i'll make sure i put my twitter link in the description too and i'm going to at the on my intro i always got a little picture that i made so i'm making a few pictures and i want you guys to vote on which one we're going to use some of these ones ain't done but these are some of the ones that i got drawn so far i just started earlier so these are what we got so far i'm gonna draw a nice bunch of them and i'm gonna get all you guys to vote and whatever gets the highest vote we'll use that for the picture in my intro just start us up so i'll leave it up to you guys to decide which one we use it's gonna be a cool time i think and for account we'll give the account for three grams it's a really nice three grams too i think maybe we just give this all around 4.5 to a five out of five because this is a beautiful strain all around it's very delicious looks like it came in a fat 30 grams so i'll definitely give it a good rating you", "reVsZC_T8t4": "what's up YouTube that freaking guy from Hamilton here coming back at you what a shatter string with you at the green crack from we deliver of

a little more calm really calm some good stuff actually I didn't know how I was gonna feel about it I liked it just really relaxing yeah super relaxed I smoked some rzb slumped it's not bad not bad if I want a good slump alright tell me what you guys think of this strain I personally like it I would smoke it again just to relax I feel like this wouldn't be good under a stressful situation you know need something done this is not what you'd want to smoke maybe you would know shot smokey before I do so in fact all of a sudden I feel like doing something but yet hmm very good feeling bill go do something maybe I'll sit around thinking about doing something and end up doing something maybe the munchies will kick in not yet so feels pretty solid all right guys like subscribe", "WdP3D_7iLP8": "hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now let's get a show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with god's deep purple and god's gift i'm gonna do both at the same time because i don't have too much of both of them there's about a gram of each so well this one was about two grams and this one well god's deep purple was about two grams and god's gift i only had a voted gram so i figured i'd do them both and one so what we'll do i rolled a little bit bigger of the joint of the god's deep purple and i rolled a littler one of the god's gift so what i'm going to do is smoke the nice big fat one of the gods deep purple because it seems like it has a bit of a stronger smell and it looks like it's a bit of a stronger bud so we'll start off with actually maybe we should we'll start off with the god's gift and then we'll jump into the god's deep purple so we'll at least give the god's gift a little bit more of a chance you know what i mean so let's light up the god's gift first and then we'll jump into the god's deep purple so let's light it up well it's underestimating it a little bit i think because it does have a very nice taste to it it's kind of like i don't know kind of like a nectary sweet type of taste it's not like sour and has a very nice like nice sweet taste to it so let's take a look at the buds that we have that's not a bad taste either it's kind of smooth on the lungs to be honest and if you have some scratchy lungs or whatever i'd say probably a pretty good strain because it is pretty smooth so these are the bugs i have of it oh hold on i'll turn the light on i usually have it on already there we go [Music] now you'll be able to see it a little bit better hold on there you go [Music] i'm not working with the best camera i do have to get a better camera so we do have we get we got what we got you know so as you can see it is a very nice looking bud very nice looking strain it has a very sweet smell to it but it's not an overly powerful smell so i wasn't sure how good it would taste but it actually is kind of pretty good so i definitely underestimated it a little bit so out of five i'll give the god's gift for flavor sorry we had a little bit issue i give it a three for flavor because it does have a nice little sweet flavor and we only got a one gram so it's not really the best to give it a rating for a count but i'll give it an overall rating i'd say of three because it's a pretty good strain i definitely recommend it if you have some like some scratchy lungs or whatever you don't have the best lungs i'd recommend it if you don't like the like over powerful strength taste and stuff i definitely recommend it so i think we'll numb this out and jump over to the gods deep purple so that let's light up the joint of the gods deep purple so like the smell this one does have a lot stronger of a flavor but like the other one i was saying the other one would be a lot better if your lungs ain't the strongest but this one has a bit of a kick to the throat but i really like that usually when it has that it's usually a pretty strong strain so i do enjoy when it has that so this one the flavor is a lot more sour though i definitely taste a bit of like the sour diesel the sourish type of taste that the salad diesel has you know it is very delicious though let's take a nice look at the gods the purple bun this one is just one nice size bud it is a very nice looking bud and it's a lot lighter of a green but it does have a very nice smell i think you may be able to see a bit of purple in there i don't know how well you can see it in the camera but there is a bit of purple to it it is very delicious very delicious straight so if you're going more for potency i would go for the god's deep purple but if you're going for something you could just kick back and smoke with your grandfather or something you know definitely go for the god's gift but either way they're both good for their own thing and i'll give an overall rating of flavor and everything an overall rating of i'd say i'll give it at least a four because it is a very good taste it's very delicious as with the gram it's only two so i can't give it the best rating for a count but i'd say it came in a nice account that nice big blood plus this for 2 grams so yeah i'll give it an overall rating of a 4 out of 5. i definitely recommend it you get a chance to try it out and with that i'll leave it there i hope you all are doing good and having a good night and have some real good [ __ ] at home to smoke and thank you all for stopping by and spending time at juvenile styles jobs good night [Music] now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for shows so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show you", "z_wm2gjJX4k": "as you can see it has very nice looking green hairs i mean orange hairs it's a very nice looking light green with bright orange hairs hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now let's get a show thank you for the view yo what's up my stoners welcome to juvenile styles today we are going to be doing wedding cake sunday driver hybrid so check it out on my channel we've already done boom wedding cake white wedding and now we're doing wedding cake sunday driver hybrid it looks very delicious wedding cake was very delicious white wedding was very delicious and this one it smells looks and i guarantee it's going to taste very delicious so let's light this butt up and pull out the bud take a nice look at it and have a nice thorough review of it and have a good time and relax like always this one actually has like a very very sweet taste to it it's actually a very strong taste but it does taste very very sweet it's almost kind of like i don't know what to like kind of like honey a little bit like it's very sweet tasting and it is a very strong flavor as well so these buds are a lot more packed than the last one we did which was campfire og that one was a nice packed bud too but these ones are even more so compressed i think it's because they're a little juicy and sticky too so check them out so it does it is a lighter green too it's a lot lighter green i'm trying to make it so you can have a good look at it it is a very nice looking bud it isn't the biggest but if you can see it has a lot of crystal on it so i'm trying to get it so you can have a closer look because it is a very covered up and crystal is a very nice looking bud so it has this one and this one i already rolled the rest of it so i already rolled the rest of it up in this joint so like the uh campfire oh geez i think i said in the last video i got three of the chem fire og and i got three of the wedding cakes sunday driver the wedding wedding cake sunday driver was only was five bucks more it's not a big deal but the campfire og it was 25 and the wedding cake sunday driver was 30 for three so from my experience you always get what you pay for when you pay a little bit extra you always get a little bit better i mean they're both fire though i mean the chem dog or campfire og was also a very good strain and here i'll put this up right now so you can see that was the bud from the that was the campfire oh gee but if you didn't check see that video that one was just posted so you can go back and check that one out so i gave that one a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5 for overall rating in this one i think i'm going to give it a little bit more it's kind it's a really top-notch bud sorry we had a little issue so i gave the campfire og on the last video i gave that a rating a 3.5 out of four and this one the wedding cake sunday driver has a little bit more stronger of a flavor it seemed to come a little bit less account or not really less account but more compressed buds so i'd say you'd probably be able to get a little bit more out of the kemphar og but the taste and everything else it seems to be a higher amount of thc in the wedding cake sunday driver i believe that kemp iog was 28-ish and the wedding cake sunday driver was 30 32-ish something like that i don't remember i should have wrote it down but it didn't and what the i'll give at least a four for a four to a 4.5 for taste because it is a very delicious strain i am loving the flavor is a very delicious strain and the smell it has a very strong smell it's like kind of like a sweet like it does kind of have like a bit of a honey smell but it has a little bit of a lemony smell but not very much it's not overwhelming like some flavors are but it is very delicious and i'll give i guess i'll just give an overall rating of i'll say at least a 4 to a 4.5 out of a 5 for the wedding cake sunday driver it has a very delicious taste very nice smell to it it's good to count and it's like covered in crystals nice and sticky as hell when you're trying to bust it up so with that i'll leave it there and i hope you all are doing really good in your lives and have some very good [ __ ] to smoke y'all have a good night now peace time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more crystal and watch another show", "rq_iqMN7W_M": "[Music] [Music] welcome to juvenile stuff 23 cannabis review enjoy the show hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now let's start a show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with blue dream cannabis review so check it out i already rolled up a nice joint of it and we're going to light it up and review and take a nice look at the bud and how good the strain looks so let's light it up and see how it is and how it tastes and then we'll smell it right so it actually kind of has like a nice peppery taste to it like it's actually almost a little spicy a little peppery like but it does have a very nice taste this is just a gram but it's not a bad account here i'm going to move the camera up a little bit this is a gram but it's not a bad account i got a nice join out of it like i said and there's still this much to smoke so let's open it up and see if it smells like a taste so i'll hold it close up so you can have a good look at it it does look very nice it's a nice darker green but like a nice layer of crystals on it it has a nice like it's like spicy smoke it's actually very good taste to know you get a little bit of an extra point for being original because it does smell very nice and it tastes very nice it's different right it's original i like that when it's a little bit original it has a different taste you know you don't want all your [ __ ] to taste the same i like ship it's a little different so i'll give an extra point for that it does seem to be a very good strain but i want to take a quick minute and say apologies for being out for the last couple days but i will be back pretty much daily with videos if it don't come out daily i'll be out the next day there's going to be a little bit of changes some big changes though and everything's going to be good you know every video is going to be good and everything's gonna be good so apologies for being out for a few days but i'm back and we'll be coming harder than ever whatever hope you guys like it so we'll get back into this review there is a very nice like spicy peppery taste i've had hash and stuff that had like kind of spicy pepper taste to it but it like didn't taste good but this actually tastes really nice so i'm gonna give it like a four out of five for taste because it has a nice strong taste and it actually is very like it's good taste and it's not i don't know the last kind of stuff tasted like weird i didn't really the glass spicy type stuff i'm talking about like it kind of tastes a little weird so this one tastes enjoyable it tastes really nice so um this blue dream it's really good so didn't come in too bad count the ground i got enough for another like maybe two good joints out of that after this one so that's not too bad for the ground it has a very nice look to it nice dark grey with lots of crystals so it was definitely growing well it's a good strain nice and strong so i'm starting to feel nice so uh but i'll make sure i put the kush facts in the description to say a little bit more about it i don't know too much about it i bought it a little while back i meant to do it earlier but so much more different strains kept coming i wanted to try them so i didn't really get a chance to so this blue dreams pretty good i hope that you guys i don't know if you guys ever tried it let me know in the description if you guys ever tried it let me know how much you liked it i got purple urkel coming next and i'm not sure what the other one but i got a few good strains coming soon so those will be out in the next couple days anyway and i hope that all you are doing good said i apologize for being over the last few days but we're gonna come back now and yeah some big changes i hope you guys all enjoyed my video i hope you're all doing good i appreciate spending time over here at juvenile styles you guys have a good night peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more crystal and watch another show now i'm blessing though i i think we did some sweet maneuvers from that movie backdraft i never saw backdraft you", "1cv-dxjfbHE": "[Music] [Music] what guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny we're back again for another string review today we are checking out another one of the most heavily requested strains on this show definitely the most heavily requested Oh gene this is the Billy Kimber Oh G from garrison life this [ __ ] is gaster when you think of gasps this is what comes to mind right yeah I feel like this there's a million oh geez out there right and we're always trying to think about like what makes one different than the other right there's a lot of oh geez like the old school oh geez they used to have subtle differences that you used to be able to tell like every time you saw Tahoe you could pick it out between OG back and right right nowadays it's [ __ ] Tommy so jeans you know Bobby's OG and everybody's got their own [ __ ] og right out of it it's just names thrown on a different [ __ ] when I look at OG I feel like there's three different main types right yeah and I go on taste when it comes to that it's mainly you got that kind of more fuel II pine saw lemon you're gassy if you will side of the spectrum right and then in the middle you've got more earthy that earthy earthy which is honestly my least favorite in the middle you got I would agree you know this is the CCC official OG breakdown by the way you know there's opinions everywhere this is our OG breakdown three different kinds you got your super gassy lemony like he was talking about and then you got your earthy right in the middle right and then on the other spectrum what do we got we get that kind of more sweet Marshall oh yeah almost say like marshmallow light like if you guys have watched our pure Kush review obviously I think we've done a couple of them now you guys know we love that strain but we love it so much because it's that rare end of the spectrum where it's that cush that super far on that sweet cereal milk and marshmallow we type turf that's what makes that one different from all the rest of these oh geez that we see more typically this one right here I would say is really really heavy on that first side of the spectrum right gassy lemony pungent fuelie but it does have a little bit of that sweet thing in it too right so I'm gonna describe it as being right in them so we got three different sections in the middle we got this time I got this side earthy being in the middle I'm gonna put this one about right in the middle or even a little farther from the middle of earthy and straight gas cuz this is kind of like Sour Diesel II almost like it has the smell a little bit of that gassy rotten sour smell but it also has the OG it also has the structure of a beautiful OG bigot blown out nose but they're not too blown out they still got their density to him but my zip just was filled with donkey dick all [ __ ] huge herbs we have been smoking on this for about a week we've smoked garrison let this is probably my favorite OG to smoke in the last year we got a note down down this stuff I'm just gonna do right now cuz that just stuck in my finger look at this I'll take test on 1 million out outside of the nug we didn't even have to break it up dude that's outside the nug if you break it up and stick your finger on the inside of the nug this stuff is the stickiest weed I think I've smoked in a minute so it's definitely hitting on that cylinder right there 10 out of 10 on the stick factor for sure for once your boy forgot scissors and this is probably the last like a weed that I would want to forget my scissors for or a grinder or something yeah as you can see it kind of just gets stuck to your hands just oh you're gonna end up with a lot of weed and green bump on your hands if you definitely you know if I try to break this up and you got to do this little maneuver and then the hair who out there knows the hair I know I did it another string review with that boom all the oils gone smooth as a baby's ass pretty tight this one when you hit it ooh as you can see it's kind of got a delayed punch you know it's it doesn't feel super expansive as far as the smoke going down but when you exhale it it kind of settles in and it'll kind of come back and just give you a little reminder you know as the buzz kind of settles in coach good but the flavor is there right away right you're fresh up for it let me know what your palates be like oh it's honestly straight sour OG funk which is my favorite kind of OG you know like I said I love sour but it doesn't grow that good honestly it's not that pretty there's a few sour cuts out going back in the day there was something elemental like the yogi or something like that that was pretty but honestly I feel like that resembles this almost I'm just you know obviously these nugs are a lot bigger but fresh off a rip straight sour OG just funk a lot of people sometimes get mad I see people in the comments when we compare sours to oh geez and Kent or kind of refer to that all as like the same family or whatever there are certain wheat nerds out there who have a point and I get a little bit annoyed with that you know but I think what we're talking about gonna make those comparisons is all about the aroma and the flavor and like the terpenes present in that strain I would like to see the actual breakdown of you know 10 different oh geez and 10 different sours by 10 different growers and see what are those common turbines that are overlapping in large quantity yeah yeah definitely I I don't pay too much attention to the terpenes we should probably get studied up on that it's something I would like to demo our more about obviously there's so much progress being made with lab testing and being able to test not only for THC but for you know molds pesticides and then being able to test the actual you know different cannabinoids and just the different aspects of cannabis that go into making that one string rather than things that you're gonna find an OG crisper example that you're not gonna find in other strains which brings me to my next point whatever it is that's in OG just gets me higher than anything else yeah to this day that way true five years ago yeah ten years ago I'm so hot and it's true today just off one bomber guys like we don't have test results on this stuff not that it really matters like I always say but this stuff slaps you in the face man I'm thinking this is definitely 25% plus and like he said a cannabinoid ratio in combination and OG it just hits every time man like every time even the earthy stuff and even the marshmallow is stuff it's all fire this is just our favorite one right here honestly it lives up to the hype the Billy Kimber has been making some buzz lately yeah I feel like it's really blown up in the last year right like different strains have come and had their waves the og wave has really faded out over the last couple years obviously there's people like us a lot of the people that we hang out with that I'll wet too whether it's a grower they always keep the og in the rotate rotation or if it's a smoker they just always you know like to keep a little bit of OG it's one of those strains for me that for some reason I never get tired of I feel like there's a lot of really good new hype out there now but it's hard to find something that checks all the boxes ya know it's like yeah oh gee tastes good it smells good right it looks good as far as like there's when I break these nubs up there's no stem that I have to take no it's all bud very meaty very sticky and most importantly it gives me the desired effect it tracks the punch and I like the type of high that I need below G we've been giving out a ton of nines and tens but you know good weed just deserves a good score and you know we like that we'll stay there till the end of the episode if you think if I let it you know I can walk around with this on my finger all day that's that's the level of stickiness yeah particularly this is just good [ __ ] Weed Man I mean Billy Kimber oh gee by garrison Lane we've been hearing the height we finally got our hands on it and I'm loving it I'm glad we were able to keep a little bit to [ __ ] do for this review because we were mad busy this week and we each got an ounce of this and this is all I have left I can own I could you know this all day you just tweak this number ones like it's just like squirt not gas man just like leaking it out the gas is definitely the main focus right but like you're saying the more you can't smell it all day because I get little hints of different little things yeah it kind of reminds me of the rude boy that we grew in Colorado kind of it's got that real okay honky okay well that I love the Roubaix archive seedbank if you haven't tried another structure too similar look this is this is what I want really good Oh gene to look like some of the nugs as you guys can see in the close-ups were absolutely huge that first glance I was like okay I would have probably you know there's some times where it's an ugly this with a side bud and the side bud and if there's a little bit of space particular I always cut up here some of the nodes weren't I would say maybe broken down great as much as I would want but once I started actually breaking the weed down to smoke it and saw how there's no stem weight in it at all and you know you can't be mad at that at first like I said going off bag appeal I was like this looks great this smells great good trim job obviously OG is usually a pretty damn baby trim job one of the easiest strains to turn up there is but overall I was like yeah might be if I have to knock grants for one thing it might be the bud on the cake factory oh yeah but I don't even think I can hate on that after breaking down look how skinny these stems are I mean honestly I was gonna adopt it for that too but I'm not it's cuz you know these stems are so damn skinny which is great I love low stem weight in my sacks and like you said their word was a little space between you know the main cola and like maybe a shoulder bud right here but at the end of the day this is such good way and we may be lost at the most 1/2 gram instant weight due to that so it's like and that's like being generous yeah exactly after I mean I sub when I got the odds of my gosh by 3 grams of stems in there after smoking it down to this last eighth right here and seeing how many stems I've actually had this workout is that way it's less than a gram it's super crazy node to stem size ratio right you get you probably won't be able to pick it up on the camera if you look at that one so maybe that none of takes up 1% of the fun in circumference of the nuts dance to men it's hidden on everything honestly I'm gonna go right into written it this is a nice bud we're describing weed in a whole bunch of different ways that we don't normally do that screen reviews I feel like that's indicative of where this buzz kind of takes you yeah we've been smoking this for like I said the last week and I have gotten more creative [ __ ] done this last four days then any time maybe in my entire life as far as videos ideas music for sure we have been crushing it the last four days and it's all been fuel off of this garrison land og I guess it's sparked in some old rituals from the old cush lineage of the CCC for twizzle but like I said I'm gonna go into raking this stuff you know we waited til we got down to at least mine well is my last nug of my own so I'm glad we got to this review it's like he said on effect 10 out of 10 we got more creative [ __ ] done this week than I think we've done in five years at least very cerebral very cerebral very creative very giggly very just all-around like the great buzz double-fisted oh really we look for OG aren't it could be you know obviously overall as a bud it could be more frosty okay you guys see me in these [ __ ] videos I see a lot of people in the comments she never the time what the [ __ ] yeah I'm high today yeah what was I even saying oh yeah the looks so open all has just weed as a whole it could be frost year but og doesn't typically get that frosty so I'm giving this a town of 10 on look for OG because it's got a frosty it's pretty frosty and it's got that lime green and to wrap it up flavor is just tank 10 straight gastrique funky fuel [ __ ] whatever you want to call it Oh G funky funky funky fmk 10/10 anything yeah I really don't think I need to go into too much detail about this one this is the guy blue guys you guys know how much we [ __ ] love oh gee we had a one on this show we our anthem song is about is called OG this right here is everything I'm looking for in an OG the reason why this is a 1000 is because if I was trying to explain oh gee cut to someone who had never seen it smoked it heard about it before and I was trying to explain yeah this is just the best train that has been consistent for the last 15 years it's the one that has stood the test of time right and it's for a good reason this right here is a perfect example of a batch that I would want to show them this really exemplifies all of the main traits that make you special yeah and another quick point to make is that for the most part overall OG has become watered down over the last I'd say five to seven years especially it's more difficult to find a really really good quality OG at this than it was in the past but you also got to realize that Oh G is also in everything today oh jeez in cookies oh jeez in [ __ ] all these new genetics it's in gelato some way some way or another it's an I feel in here if you go far back enough to cookies or whatever you know like I feel like it's used more than anything in print give it to give you the desired effect to really add some kick to some of these other strings that may be more flavorful but just don't pack the punch that you're looking for and exactly so yeah garrison Lane OG Kush garrison Lane Billy Kimber Oh G cush right here Wham definitely check this out if you are in California if you are in SoCal shouldn't be too hard to find yes let us know down there in the comments what strain you guys would like to see reviewed next make sure you smash that like white and turn on notifications you don't miss the next string review which will be next week that's right when we return for more that's right two twins and I call on both Jasmine's no but what they calling me Kat okay boy pegs been smoking on Krypto fat daddy chest like a missile [Music]", "WTfenC_FumM": "oh my god dude that's so flavorful i was expecting it to not taste as good as it does today i got my hands on something i'm pretty excited about smoking on some banana og flour from moxie got a little bowl packed up ready to go that's delicious it's got a real dank earthy taste to it while it still has like notes of banana and some creaminess in there as well but this strain review is going to be a little bit cooler than my other ones that i normally do typically i only review the flour but when i was picking this up on the menu i also saw that they had banana og and live resin so i grabbed both banana og live resin banana og flour so stick around i'll take a dab towards the end of the video but first let's talk about the flower banana og is a cross between you guessed it og kush and banana kush the effects of this strain are amazing and they come on super quick like that one bowl got me feeling pretty good already and when you actually look at this weed man it is crazy it is like all trichomes you can see a little bit of stem and some plant matter under all those trichomes but this is seriously caked up this is some beautiful [ __ ] weed and the more i break these buds open the more trichomes i find it is an absurd amount of trichome coverage and the weed is super sticky i'm gonna stick two nugs together and see if they just stick together by themselves this is the ultimate sticky test can two nugs become one yep that's pretty impressive that is some sticky ass weed but this banana og is a pretty light green color with little orange hairs poking out of there as well the nugs are nice and loose they're not dense at all but they still had a really nice bud structure to them it wasn't like a bunch of shake in the jar and the weed is super fresh and cured perfectly i'm super impressed always by moxie they just have like the best curing process for the weed in the state in my opinion granted they do rarely drop flowers so they might just pick the perfectly cured weed for when they drop it but compared to most of the other companies around here i just do not get as good of a cure from the other companies if you're from pa you know what i'm talking about it is not rare to get dry weed straight out of the dispensary but the scent of this strain definitely lives up to the name it seriously smells like you were smoking some og kush in an ice cream shop it's like a banana split with nugs in it it's [ __ ] crazy it's like a mix of fruity flavors and creamy flavors under that og kush flavor if you've smoked og kush before you know the flavor it's just that like classic dank weedy flavor i can barely fit this whole bong in the shot i gotta back up a little bit that's fire dude such a great taste at first you taste little hints of banana and vanilla and then it's just overpowered by that pure og kush taste if you're a fan of fruity strains or that classic og flavor this drain is definitely up your alley and those two flavors just pair really well together that like dank grassy taste with the banana and creamy flavor it's just a nice experience i really [ __ ] with the strain but this flower is testing at 22 thc and the terpenes on it aren't out of this world but the smell and the flavor alone are just so overpowering to me that like it is a very impressive flower to me terpenes mean a lot more when it comes to extracts than flour to me if it is flour and has a high terpene profile it's typically good but flour doesn't necessarily need a high terpene profile to smell very pungent and have a great odor to it when it comes to flour i think a lot of that really has to do with how it's cured my main complaint about this drain is it's a little stemmier than i'd like it to be but it's really not too hard to pick that off i feel like when the weed is super dense it's hard to sometimes pick all the stems off but when it's nice and loose like this you can just pick all the good stuff off and then get that stem and throw it right in the trash can i'm gonna pack one more bowl up before we try out the concentrate i had smoked this flour before i did the video but i haven't tried the concentrate yet i only had a half gram of it so i didn't want to waste it moxi's concentrates typically only come in half grams which for some people they really like that because it's pretty expensive but honestly i feel like i go through a half gram so quickly then i don't always like to pick it up they do have grams too but i feel like 80 to 90 percent of their concentrates are weighed out to half grams but like that's only four or five dabs like only one dab if i feel like being crazy so i kind of feel like i'm wasting an entire jar if i just go through that so quickly but they only had the banana og in half gram so i had to grab a half gram i will enjoy this four or five dabs trust me delicious the high is mainly like a nice spacey head high but it's still like noticeable in the entire body as well and i still feel like present i don't feel like super zoned out or anything but sometimes i feel like my brain is just going a mile a minute with these random ideas and high thoughts i'll catch myself being like i wonder if my dog knows i'm high why do we bake cookies but cook bacon what if kobet doesn't exist and just nobody ever wants to hang out anymore i don't know man it's just a nice spacey high but now i'm going to take a dab of this live resin it has more of a wheaty scent to me than a fruity scent i'm curious how it's gonna taste it looks like some beautiful sugar wax though nice and crumbly a little drier than i like my sugar to be but as i've said about consistencies it's really just a preference thing it really has nothing to do with the quality of the actual product but i'm about to take a dab out of this little guy it's practically the size of the banger it's so small it's got a great function for such a little piece though oh yeah it's a little too dry for the dabber so i'm just going to dunk these three little rocks in all right choose you guys oh my god dude that's so flavorful i was expecting it to not taste as good as it does oh wow that's super sweet it's weird it really just smells more like the og kush and like a carafeline scent where it's like a little peppery but it tastes just like the weed smells like it's super sweet you can really taste that banana it's like really noticeable the banana is definitely the most noticeable flavor on the concentrate holy crap it's pretty much the same effect just a little bit more intense like it's definitely more in the head than the body but i'm still feeling higher in the body as well but this is like a true hybrid high where it's like you feel present you don't have like a total couch lock but you still have that like stress free like happy high feeling you get from the indicas if you like hybrid trains this is definitely a good one to pick up moxie really hit it off the park with this one it's probably my favorite banana themed strain i've had it's a nice sweet flavor without being too sweet i just love this blend of dank weed and sweet fruit it's really a delightful mix but this strain was a very exclusive flower i was literally only able to get 1 8 of it that's why i thought it'd be fun to add the concentrate as well let me know if you want me to do that in the future by the way i can't guarantee that i can always get a concentrate of the flower form at the same time but if i can i'd love to do that for a strain review if you guys think that that's a cool addition but there's a 1 8 per patient limit at the dispensaries because literally the dispensaries get such small batches of this flour but hopefully moxie flour becomes more prevalent one day and it's something we can just always see on the shelves this banana og is definitely one that i want to get again i'd rate this strain a 9 out of 5. [ __ ] i'd rate this strain a 9 out of 10 and honestly i feel like it almost should be bumped up to a 9.5 out of 10 after that brain fart it's a super strong strain the weed was strong the live resin was stronger i'm [ __ ] lit i really hope this stream comes around again soon and hopefully in a bigger bath so more people can enjoy it but let me know what train you guys want me to review in the future i got a lot more on my plate that i want to review but i love hearing your suggestions you guys recommend some pretty fire strength to me i always appreciate it that's the video you guys make

a little bit more oil okay you can't really see it like that and I've been already [ __ ] around with my camera trying to see the best way I could get to show you guys and so I had a putting a jar here so this way I could keep my arm steady and we'll see how this goes but you can see right that pretty golden but if I shine my LED on it it's really golden though it's kind of got like a couple spots that are darker than others but that's just where it's more gooey as the rest is more solidified but it's there it's good stiff like I mean overall it's really good i mean i still got to get out of DAB here so see if i can show you like it's still chunky right like it doesn't want to break off or anything but just scrape into it and then it still kind of has that small little gooey tune to it so just get dab on there though okay just got to wrap that around will strings of leg [ __ ] high looks like almost hair at the time I get confused but now I got a DAB ready and it's nighttime and [ __ ] so I was planning on doing a little bit of nighttime tokes see if i could get this to sit still again good that there are not gotta move this jar see I should have got a little bit before before and I'm not prepared at all for this I've been trying to get prepared and I slowly got [ __ ] over but ok let's get to eating up this dump but so yeah guys I ended up making this batch just with a one gram of purple kush and yeah guys like I know one gram really isn't a lot to do a run on but I mean I've been waiting on a buddy to come by and pitch on another run but he's been moving slow so I just decided to take a gram my own stuff for the moment make a quick run and I mean it turned out alright i ended up getting point 23 from one gram run so for one gram I felt as if it was a good good bit for the one grand that I put into it but okay that nails hot so get that dome on there and then the piece is freshly clean so it should look good should look good but Jays guys who it always tastes just so good I swear it's just like as if you're vaporizing it and yet so good it's so good but hey guys so I just had to quickly show that I figured [ __ ] it because I know there's a few you that real big oil heads out there and why to see a couple more dabs than that but i'll hopefully make a couple more videos while dabbing unless I just captured some more clips of me dabbing and then I just make another montage or something but I don't know I'm undecided on that yet but till next time guys I'm out not out but about", "uuZMx0cnKY4": "what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with number seven eight and nine strains of the 12 strains of christmas so we got mango kush sour diesel and pink candy hey you welcome to my course review at juvenile style this is what i do i smoke cush pass and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now it's such a show thank you for the view so i think we'll start off by lighting up the pink candy and then we'll go to the mango kush and end it off with the sour d so let's light up the pink candy give it a nice review and then jump onto the next so let's light this up and see how it is and then go to the other ones so this actually has a really nice kind of like a candy taste to it so it's like hmm it does have a really nice sweet taste to it i kind of like taste kind of one of those like you know like the bow tie candies or whatever i kind of taste that a little bit kind of like a minty like candy taste tastes really nice so let's take a nice look at this bud so this pretty much was all one big bud this is two grams minus the joint that i rolled up of it so here i'll hold it so you can see it a little better there you go look at the nice crystal on that it's almo it has a nice like kind of purple tint to it really nice looking bud so it's pretty much all one bud that tastes really good so it has a really nice sweet kind of candy smell to it too it actually smells really delicious so that's a really nice looking bud why don't we break it in half and take a nice look in the middle of it there we go oh that looks very nice and a lot of crystal it's a nice hard bud too a little sticky but it's very nice and i'm pretty sure that this one was 28 thc and the mango kush i'm pretty sure was 26 and the sour diesel was about 21. so this is a really nice looking strain that's all except for this joint that's two grams of it nice fat two grams so i'll give the rating for the flavor a nice i'll give it a nice five at least five i mean at least a four four out of five at least it's a very nice taste and strain so count that's a fat two grams as well this one the purple candy came from me miku seco the uh diesel was from smokers and this was from a good friend of mine so the mango push so they're all really good i can tell by looking at them i haven't had them yet as you can tell so they are looking really good though so the mango kush especially looks really good so i'll give an overall rating i'd say of at least four four out of five to the pink candy it's a very delicious taste i definitely recommend it let me know if you tried it into this in the comment section and i want to let you guys know sorry things are a little different for christmas i try to do this little i guess christmas special type of thing so i hope you all are liking it i hope you all having a good christmas things we'll be going back to normal right after christmas and i'm going to start taking a long hit of each strain too instead of just smoking a joint i'm going to do both we'll smoke we'll either take a bomb hit and then smoke a joint or vice versa i think it's a good idea i talked to a few you guys on my live about it it was it seemed like a really good idea so i'm gonna do it so like i said i'll give an overall rating of at least four out of five to the purple candy it's a very nice strain i definitely recommend it um so if you get a chance i definitely say try it out but as for that i think maybe we should jump onto the mango crush and see how it tastes so i'm going to nub this out and we'll try the mango so yeah this one's the mango let's light it up oh that has a little bit of a stronger flavor like a stronger head to it and actually it's a nice taste though it's a i kind of taste a bit of mango like kind of a citrus like taste yeah kind of mangoey and it seems like it got a nice hit like you feel in the back your throat feels nice though tastes nice so nice warm feeling in the back of my throat tasting that so this is five grams of the mango kush that seems like a really nice account especially for 5g so let's take a nice butt out and take a nice look at it this here seems to be a nice fat bud as you can see it is a very nice looking bud as well this is a nice hard bud too it seems to be a little less sticky as the um purple candy was but the buds just just as hard so if you compare them the uh what about that one is that it here yeah if you compare them the uh i don't know that's not it that's one that's going to be coming up next though orange cream make sure you stay for that and orange cookies those are both coming up soon so make sure you stay for that but the purple candy i put it right here so if you compare them they're both look pretty close to the same color this one might be a little darker but they're both very nice looking strains so let's take a look in the middle of this bud as you can see it looks really nice too it seems to be a little lighter than the uh purple candy in the middle of it but they both look like very good strain so now let's give the mango cush a smell test oh yeah that definitely tastes i'm definitely definitely taste why do i always mix why do i always mix those up it smells very good though has a nice mango smell to it so like i said that's a nice fat five grams it might be a little extra cause like i said a friend of mine had given it to me but it does look like a nice fat five maybe six but he said that was five so it looks very nice so i definitely give it a nice taste rating it has a bit of a stronger flavor than the purple candy did but the purple candy um lived up pretty good to its name the purple candy actually kind of had a bit of a candy table taste to it but the mango does too so i mean they're both pretty much live up to their expectations for flavor they both taste very delicious so i'll give an overall rating i'll give the mango kush at least a four out of five as well maybe four point five out of five it's a very delicious trade so i definitely recommend it if you get a chance to try it out i think we should jump onto the sour diesel so let's light up the sour diesel joint things are just a little different right now because uh christmas and family you know things are a little hectic so you know how it is things are crazy that's why i appreciate all the you when you stop by and spend time with me at juvenile styles because i know how busy it can be so let's light up the sour d let me know in the comments if you like some of the songs that i posted up in the last little while because if you do i'll post some more i had some fun doing those i mean the dmca one wasn't as good as the thank you one i just kind of wrote that quick because i wanted it to be out there [ __ ] as soon as it was started like picking up so i could have spent a little bit more time on it but i didn't want to waste too much time on it neither i just wanted to kind of like make my point so i didn't know what else to do so i just wrote that little diss track so the sour deep that actually has a lot it lives up to its name in the sour i definitely taste the sour to it and i kind of like do kind of taste a bit of like like the gas taste you know what i mean like the diesel taste tastes very nice though i like that it's a nice switch up i like switching the taste up of my weeds so let's take a nice look at this bud but wow so you can't really see it good through the bag so let's pull it out oh shoot i'm throwing the bag at myself so here we go let's do the bud broke in half as i was pulling it out but it does look very nice so this seems to be a lot lighter color of a green this is almost like a lime tent green like a neon green looks very nice so let's snip it it has a really like kind of like a creamy smell to it actually but it has a nice sour smell too but it is like an ice cream smell like a nice creamy smell to it actually smells really nice i kind of taste it and the flavor a little bit too but i find the sourness kind of over takes the like kind of cream taste you know so yeah that's the but it kind of broke open as i was pulling it out so that's the middle of that one so they're all very good strains i wouldn't really i don't know they all have their uh good couple good qualities about them i'd say they're all kind of similar and look i mean you could definitely tell the difference between them but they are all very good strains if i was going to pick one of my a favorite out of the three i would probably say i don't know it's a good competition i don't know i'd probably pick i think the mango crush had a little bit more do you see i'm not sure i think the purple cushion the purple candy and the mango were close to chc so i picked one of those two just because they're a little higher but they're all really good strings so i'll give an overall rating of an even four to the sour diesel and a 4.5 did i give a four i gave a four out of five i think to those so i'll give a 3.5 out of five to the sour diesel just a little half a point off that's all they're all really close so with that i hope you all are having a good christmas i'm gonna try my best to get the last three up by christmas tomorrow it'll be up and by tomorrow night sometime hopefully so it's just been really crazy i want to have them as soon as possible i hope y'all being patient and i thank you all for being patient so what that i hope you all are having a good christmas like i said thank you all for spending time with me on the holidays a ho ho ho and a big piece out [Music] what's up world so if you just watched my vote my fourth episode of the 12 strains of christmas and this one's the fifth one then we're still on day eight but they are looking nice and i still wanted to throw a plant progress update on here and it is christmas eve so if you celebrate christmas i hope that you're having a good night that you are having lots of fun with your family or loved ones or whatever i hope that you're all having a good time so we'll take a closer look at these for a quick second and end it off so you can go and open some gifts or some [ __ ] so they're doing great and thanks to mars hydro for the lights hopefully you send me a good gift too y'all have a merry christmas hope peace", "79_mfx8LPoA": "welcome back the Dutchman's medical marijuana Channel today I just want to show you some of the products that we make in-house for our patients out of our very high quality meds what we start with here is some very high concentrated potency shatter wax that we then will dissolve into coconut oil at a specific temperature to get this beautiful golden oil this is a THC oil and this one here is a CBD oil the thousand milligrams per bottle and each one milliliter or CC is equal to hundred milligrams per milliliter at a 70 to 72 percent concentration so basically this product would test out at 72 to 78 percent you dissolve it in a 1 to 1 ratio and you got yourself the same mix here so this is CBD shark shock which is an 80/20 indica sativa and here we have Blackwater oh gee it's a 60/40 sativa indica 100 milligrams per milliliter and then over here we have some capsules which I put points 1 milligrams per capsule so 10 capsules is a gram and what I use is actually key or a hashtag bug key for bud hash I'll make that and then put that into the capsules so it ends up being a very very nice strong highly concentrated form of the product inside of the capsule my older patients a lot of people were more gonna be more discreet can't smoke around their kids or families or will have lung problems any kind of medical issues especially where they can't smoke because the biggest problem in our industry is that doctors will never give us the go-ahead they'll never be on our side because they can never legally tell you it's okay to smoke pot because of the smoke part of it but if you ingest it through other forms they tend to be more on your side when it comes to that so even the many the doctors who are who may be online about it or ok with it but don't agree with the smoking part they will agree with this part so this is just some of the products we make here in house for our patients capsules I easy sell these for 50 bucks to my patients for 25 the oils are $35 for 10 million model and typically you'll see the stuff sell for $75 for THC oil and a hundred for the CBD oil but spry patients I do $35 so it comes like I said right from the highly concentrated version of wax or shatter that we make and then put into the oil product hope you enjoyed our video want some more information just hit me up and I'll get you some more info thank you", "kOLDzSlgkFc": "welcome to juvenile styles juicy fruit cannabis review enjoy the show hey you

it seemed to come in a really good account as well so let's take a bite out and take a nice look at it as you can see it's a really nice looking green it has a nice layer of crystals on it you can't really see the hair as much because there's so much crystal but it is a very nice looking strain it has a very very sweet taste to it i mean smell it has a very nice sweet smell to it and it came in a nice account because that's three grams i already rolled up this nice joint and there's still like a decent amount out of there so i consider that a nice three grams but the flavor is very sweet like it's a very very nice sweet flavor it kind of does have like the juicy type of taste to it it's very nice so i'll give like the taste like a three and a half to a four because it is a very good taste and i'll give the account it's a pretty nice account so i'll give it about a three and a half to a four as well at a five there's a very good account i definitely recommend it so if you ever get a chance to try juicy fruit it is a very good strain and with that i'll leave it there i hope you all are doing good having a good night peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go

Here we have the original Mango Biche and  this is a plant that a lot of people have been looking for  for 25 years but here it is in the mountains of Cauca and our friend Barrito is taking them out  This is a fungus that attacks the plant. Smells like mango  First squeeze and then smell - Oh my god! it smells like lemon grass\n- Yeah bro - It's lovely, lovely, lovely..\n- Okay, I'm going to go for a little walk Simon - Smell the difference between these 2 \n- Let's go look for another few pheno's Where's that Christmas tree we saw  when we walked in - Where do you come from?\n- From The Netherlands - And are you a marijuana grower\n- Yes The plants that they have already harvested and dried we can see how much they have next door So they work the whole year round because it's 12/12 here - I'm Franco - Is Franco\u2019s hat funny? Its laughable.  If I were him I wouldn\u2019t wear it to school.  What do you think about? - How old are you Jose?\n-  Eight years old.  - And do you help with the crops a little? \n- Yes.  And what do you do? Do you help to plant?  Yes, I help to sow. Very well, and how do you plant them?  - I take them...\n- Yes  - I put the solution on them I mix them very well \n- Yes - Then I make a hole in the ground and I put them in it - very good, very good  And when they harvest the crop - Do you also help to clean the plant?\n- Yes. Okay.. - Do you like the plant?\n- Yes - Do you like how smells? \n- Yes And is there more than one type of plant?  Are there different plants?  Yes, what are their names?  We harvest the marijuana The regular ones or which ones?  Yes, the regular ones What is the difference between the two types?  I can't talk about this Okay - Good - Very good.  \n- Amazing Good job! Ask him if his friends also help him Do you have more friends of the same age who help you?  Are there more kids like you who help with this?  I have friends but there are down there . Okay Stay in school, school is very important.  Work with marijuana for the money  but don\u2019t quit school, its very important. - Okay\n- Okay and they had no other choice than to grow cocoa  and to grow marijuana because the flatland was taken away their crops were taken away and they kicked them back into the mountains and this is what happened to the local people and it's good to see that... and to also tell that story... because in our western civilisation... we only hear the story from one side It's always the capitalist sides and we call these people guerillas  We call the terrorists We call them communists  We give them all kinds of names But in the end most all these people in the world are just poor and farmers and surviving on what they're making for themselves and again here is another example  of how hard these people have to suffer because of government things and  - Capitalist\n- You can spend a week... reading books or websites about Colombia and Colombia's history and struggle... and you will not learn what we have learned in a week on the ground here listening to people. Seeing the faces Seeing on their skin what they go through and feeling on our skin the tension in the air or the good vibes in the air You learn a lot from that  as a human being. As a grower It's a green avalanche you can't stop it and we believe it's the right thing to do  We really believe it  - Yeah\n- No... Nobody can tell me that it's  legal or illegal.  It's just the right thing and you know when it's the right thing I have no nails Right We got him Let's see... Shit dude. That's... - A Colombian tick\n- Look at that fucker. Yep A Colombian tick with a whole lot of THC  from your blood Okay for the final... This thing has been on me for 2 days Okay and I go to Simon being like dude help me out here man like I don't know what to do like am I fucked here? and he's like no bro. No it's cool I get like 10 a day and I just kinda just leave them on man like 10 a day Like oh well you know Fuck, that's great advice man I'll just leave it on  What did he ask you? Like don't the guys get offended when  when you call them gorilla  You know like. What guys? Who did we call a gorilla? - Yeah the Big guys? What the fuck?\n- It's a little bit disrespectful. No? I didn't look at shit.  I took the plane  - I am here with a fucking camera\n- Look, look - Do you think I am looking at wikipedia for one week?\n- But everybody forgets... - If I come here it's...\n- The guy is speaking English for only one year - If I come here and there is a Tyrannosaurus rex\n- Hey - I would believe it. No problem\n- But also if you only speak English for one year Don't forget You see... Check it out dude Those records and those tapes that compose that wall there are from the same years that the  Punta Roja and the Colombian Gold became famous  - An extension on the \u201cplan Colombia\u201d came out. \n- Please The 'Colombia plan' was the program that the government launched when Andres Pastrana was president,  an eradication plan to supposedly improve the quality of life  of indigenous people and peasants. And we realized that this was not really the idea of the 'Colombia Plan'.  The true idea of plan was to create military bases, high mountain military bases. - Is it to control the territory? \n- Yes, it is to control the territory  and that has affected us a lot  because there are daily battles and in the end we civilians suffer the consequences who have nothing to do with the armed conflict.  The Colombian plan has followed a control of illicit crops it has been a military control a military takeover in the entire department of Cauca,  and that has been the conflict we have had to deal with So we peasants say that these crops that we call illicit but are really subsistence crops for us . Because there are nothing else? and you don\u2019t see here only marijuana and coca, you can also see here coffee, corn, banana, yucca.  Here the big problem we have is land tenure Land ownership here is tenacious because  whoever owns the land has only 30 percent For example,  there are people who have 6 arable lands  but have 8 children It is not enough.  The land does not grow  but the family does. - Very interesting. \n- That is why we tell the national  and international government that  we want to change in the productive part but first we have to change land tenure because there really   is no where to cultivate an expansion of territory is needed. And that only the government can do, right? Yes, that\u2019s why we say we need a development plan a life plan and a survey for know  how many of us are in our municipality, who doesn\u2019t have land who does. Who has health and a house because none of us have a good house. We all live in houses made of wattle and daub which fell, destroyed by armed conflict. And that has been the big problem that we have here in the department of Cauca,  land tenure. I sincerely want this to change because   the only thing we are living now is a military occupation  and there is nothing do to about this. Our children have no options  So some of then go to the army  because they have nothing to do  or go in others ways. - Looking for other jobs?\n- Yes, here aren\u2019t many opportunities, many people leave here For this reason we ask the government for a change not just for Cauca\u2019s department, for all Colombia. I honestly think that the government should look  at the interest of future generations  our children\u2019s children.  What will happen to this conflict  that we are living today? When we die, what are we going to leave for our children?  Many people think future is coming  but future is part of what we make before. That\u2019s why we want to government to realise  who it is really owns the land.  - It's a human right.\n- It's a human right - It's a constitutional right\n- Yeah, is a constitutional right   Here is my friend if you want to ask something else for your movie. Thank you very much Maybe somebody's gonna put an M16 in your coolio tonight", "ey4Yp4d2XR8": "hello i hope you all are having a merry christmas so far and having a good holiday whatever you celebrate i just wanted to let you know before we start it up that things are going to go back to normal right after christmas and i hope you all are joining the christmas special so far i just wanted to apologize that things are a little bit different and make sure to remind you to stay to the end to see my plant progress because they are doing real nice thanks mars hydro for that again i can't wait to see what you sent me next and something is coming soon from them so make sure if you're not already subbed to some so you'll see what they send me because i'm super stoked too i hope y'all like the review so y'all have a good night and have a good life peace hey you welcome to my course review at juvenile style this is what i do i smoke push pass and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles coming at you with the fourth episode of 12 strains of christmas so what we're going to do to make it a little different and special today i'm going to smoke a 10 gram and review it and we're gonna put up a five dollar gram against another five dollar gram from two different stores and see which one turns out better so we got green crack and black rhino they look like they're both really good grams so let's start off by reviewing the three grams of alien og i rolled up this nice joint of that and i already have two nice joints rolled up of each of the five dollar grams as well so let's light this up and see how good the 10 one is and we'll compare it against the five dollar ones as well to see if it's much more worth it or if it's better to go with the five so let's light this up and see how good it is so this has like there's a nice of a stronger taste it kind of seems like it has a bit of a stronger taste but it's not like a really strong flavor i would say it kind of has like like a nice crustally taste to it and tastes a bit sweet but it's not a strong flavor but it does taste really nice so let's take a nice look at these buds and then we'll give them a sniff test and a closer close-up look at them too so this one came and i got three grams of it and seems like a pretty nice account i got this joint plus this let's go so let's take a nice look we'll pull up the biggest one here wow that looks like a nice looking bud yeah see if i can hold it so you can see it better hopefully you can get a nice look at it it is a very nice looking bud so it's a nice light color it looks like there's a lot of crystal on it let's bust it open so we can take a look in the middle so nice thick as a butt looks very good let's give it a nice sniff for a nice smell so it does smell very nice it smells like the nice hydro used to get back in the day you know it just has that nice like girl smell smells very delicious so let's take a look at these little buds i guess hold them up so you can see nicely that's the whole three grams that's a nice fat three grams so a nice look a nice smell a nice taste it's just not like a strong like a type of original flavor that i can kind of explain to it just tastes really nice kind of like some dro so that tastes very nice so i say we'll jump on to well let's give it a little bit of a rating so we'll give the account rating we'll give it a four out of five because that's a fat three grams so we'll give it a four out of five for a count and i'll give it a nice at least a four for flavor i like the dro taste so that's a very nice taste so i'll give it a four out of five for flavor and i guess we'll give it an overall four out of five very nice strain alien og try it dope when you get a chance and let me know if you already have in the comments let's dab this out and try another kind so i say well dude let's do the green crack first let's light up this joint that i got rolled up the green crack so let's light this up so the green crack it tastes really nice and it has a bit of an earthy taste to it kind of like an earthy plant flavor it's kind of nice though it tastes really nice so i'd say this kind of has a bit of a homegrown taste but it's a nice home-grown taste it's not like a bad flavor yeah a weed memo they taste pretty nice actually though so i'll hold it up so you can see that's a gram of the green crack and this one was from smoker s and the gram of the black rhino we'll be looking at is from um mitsu i know i'm saying that wrong it'll be in the description so they're both from a different store and i thought it was pretty good idea to put them up against each others and to see if it's worth putting the extra couple dollars for the ten dollar gram so so far i prefer the ten dollar flavor and the look of the ten dollar bud does look a little nicer but these look nice too here i'll pull some out so you can see it better so let's pull it out i taste maybe a hint like maybe a hint of lemony taste into the green crack this one tastes really nice so and i've had green crack before that was a lot better but you can't expect a a or for a bud for five dollars you know sometimes you can get really good deals but this kind is really nice though and it smells really nice it kind of has like a bit of a lemony but a kind of like a glazed smell like a sugary sweet type of smell and tastes a bit lemony i mean smells smells a bit lemony so that's definitely not a bad bug for five bucks at all we'll dump it all out so you take a quick look at it i would say it looks like it's a little bit more a little bit of a bigger account than the black rhino but not much it's a nice looking bud though especially for five dollars i think it's definitely worth it so i'd say if you get some weed at five a gram especially if you're just buying a couple grams of stuff if it's not like complete [ __ ] it's probably pretty good if it's pretty good it's worth it so as long as it's pretty good these uh the green crack she just said it was around 20 and i believe it with the taste and look and the smell so i believe that's about what it is the black rhino um i think it was 20 as well or 21 so they're both around 20 which ain't bad but nate hi the uh alien og i'm pretty sure it was 26 percent thc so it's obviously a little bit more more thc for the price so um i'm still going to be putting the plant update at the end of this they are growing real nice now so make sure you stay to the end because they are doing really well and i can't wait to see how much we get out of these i'm going to go through the whole process with you guys and i'm going to show the yield too and then we'll do a review of every different one that we get and i think it's going to be a great time so i hope you all are having a good holiday so far don't matter what you celebrate whether it's christmas hanukkah anything else it don't matter i appreciate all of my viewers everybody that stops i appreciate it big time so let's finish this review though i just want to let you guys know i appreciate it so we'll give an overall rating of i'll say at least 3.5 out of 5. especially for the price it's definitely worth it if you're around terrell nova scotia i'd say jump into smoke arrest i don't i hope i'm saying that right i'll put it in the description as well drop them and see what they got so they just opened uh back up two days ago i think it is this is when i first went in it's the day they open up so it's pretty cool actually no we'll put this out and we'll jump on to the [ __ ] black rhino so let's see how good this is if you're not keeping up we were at three four five six we had six strings of christmas now so we need six more before what two days now two days to do six more so let's get out i knew i had to do something to get them in here you know i should have started this a lot earlier in the month but i didn't have the idea until like closer to the end of the month so i'm hoping i can get them all out before christmas i'm trying my best the black rhino this tastes pretty nice actually so the black rhino kind of has more of a stronger taste and a stronger flavor it kind of has like a kind of a hit of citrus i find yeah kind of like citrusy sugary like kind of like crystally tasting too tastes really nice so i do like the flavor this tastes really nice let's take a look at the black rhino buds well maybe they came in about the same account what they are they seem shoot i dropped one of the buds we're good so they seem to be about the same account we're gonna dump it out so take a close look sorry the setups a little different for now things are just a little different until right after christmas but i'm trying to keep things about as normal as we can on the channel but things will go back to how they were right after christmas so let's take a nice look at these okay to see it's a pretty nice account as well for a g note so let's hold this up see that's a pretty step g too nice looking buds these uh are a little bit darker than the last couple we just looked at i find but they look very nice as well so it has a nice amount of crystal on it i hope you can see a little better i hope you can see it good because my light seems to not be doing so good i'm gonna have to get another one so i hope you all are having a good christmas so far because i haven't been having too bad for one myself all kinds of nice weeds to try out i hope you all got some good weeds to try out at home so i'll hold one of these up for you pretty nice looking but let me know in the comment section which one you think looks the nicest out of the two five dollar ones obviously the the ten dollar one is going to be a little nicer looking a little better but let me know what you think looked better in the comment section i'd like to know which one you think and let me know what was the best cheapest bud that you found at what strain it was and i think we're going to hold the contest for the art contest so we'll for the picture that we're going to put in my intro we'll hold it until january that will hold it till the end of january and that way it'll give everybody time to draw some pictures if you want to send

juvenile stuff this is what i do i smoke cush pass and shatter too go and check them out i try them all for you by the time i'm done we'll be on the moon now let's start the show thank you for the view on the third day of christmas juvenile style's brought to me jack hates kush and i'm smoking it like an o.g so let's light this [ __ ] up and give it a nice review so we skipped the houndstooth and the ultra sour i'm gonna do those ones next because i got the this one here and i wanted to get it done because it looked like it was going to be good and i got a nice recommendation from the guy at the nslc saying it was real good so showed out to the guy at the nslc man i don't know your name sorry but there you go let's light this up so that has a really nice taste to it it's kind of like it's kind of like a nice sour taste it's almost like the ultra sour but it has a little bit of a little bit of a more of a crystally earth taste it actually tastes really nice nice mixture and it is a strong flavor so let's take a nice look at these buds it came in some really nice buds so here's one of the nicer sized buds here it's a darker colored green with some nice dark colored like kind of brown goldish colored hairs but it's very nice looking so hopefully you can get a good look at it and it is a really nice sour smelling bud it actually smells really nice and delightful so let's take another look let's just dump them all out right into here so we can take a nice look at it so this is what we get for three and a half minus this joint so that looks like a pretty fat three and a half and it was only 32 dollars at the liquor store so and that is whoo that's a super sour smell it smells delicious though i like that smell it's a very strong lemony sour smell it smells very good especially if you like some sour [ __ ] so i haven't had some nice sour tasting like kind of lemony taste and weed in a good minute so it's a nice switch-up it is a very nice-looking strain so let's start off by writing the flavor so it is a very delightful flavor especially if you like the lemon sour tastes i'm gonna give it a nice 4.5 out of 5 for flavor it's delicious so smell i'm going to actually give it a 5 out of 5 or smell because that has a banging smell it's a very strong it's almost like pure lemon sniffing that it smells delicious so and price wise 32 for three and a half especially at the league store not bad at all and this one is i'm pretty sure it was 21 i just want to make sure 21 thc it has 0.07 cbd in it and yeah it's a very good strain i'm pretty sure this one's an indica i'm not sure i'm trying to find out i don't want to tell you guys it's something that it's not and i can't see where it says it on here so i'll look it up and i'll put it in a description i'm not sure pretty sure that it's an indica though but it might not be so don't take just take that with grain cell because it don't stay on there i don't want to tell you the wrong thing so account rating will give it a nice [ __ ] nice we'll give it a bang and four and a half for a count because that's a nice [ __ ] that's a really nice account i get a nice good fat nice few good fat joints out of that and oh [ __ ] she went oh but that's my fault i could have busted up a little bit a little better but i was excited to get up into it so wow it does taste delicious though i definitely recommend it this is my first time trying jack hayes so there's purple haze and now we got jack case so i hope you guys are enjoying these 12 strains of christmas so far i'm not sure

been used for clothes shelter gold magazine and in the spiritual practice today i take you on a journey to explore with me the culture of the wild [Music] hello it's really amazing nepal everywhere the ganja is growing look this big tree nice ganja tree so i can sit here watch my friends playing pool eat my mc this is really this is good lifestyle actually we have your weed yes what do you want to say about this village this time it's a really cool village because everywhere you have gunshots moving yes in different priorities trains thc cbd levels very good i know why do you want to invite every cannabis patient who cannot afford their medicine come to nepal here it's growing everywhere cannabis enthusiasm yes everyone who loves wheat come mom this was a journey into the unknown i just heard from many stories and books that cannabis is a part of the hindu tradition and even a part of the buddhist culture and religion there is a story that says that buddha was living on a single hemp seed before he reaches enlightenment and there's also story in the hindu tradition that the lord shiva saved the world from the poison and cured himself after with the power of the cannabis plant so there are many mystical stories around hemp and around the himalayas that i wanted to explore shiva is mostly associated with the consumption of cannabis in the hindu culture but shiva is not just only a god it also have a deeper meaning shiva means the universal self or the higher self and represents the three principles of the universe destruction creation and existence the most frequently used mantra in hinduism is um and it means i bow down to the entire outer and inner universe shivaya exactly means the five elements water earth fire wind and spirit a perfect scenario in the context of nepal it is having a lot of beauty over here wow wow even you can watch the moon in this time wow i love this moment with this greenery [Music] oh great sunset today [Music] and this is the difficult road we stopped leon i'm not seeing you in camera yeah difficult really it's hard to go even we are trying our [Music] best [Music] [Music] [Music] up your aim from the street of nepal [Music] look we have already good seats we can grow them thank you tonight we're gonna make some [Music] bangles [Music] [Music] look this is the biggest hand tree i ever hold in my hand this is no choke this is a so much wood come closer you have to see this this is like the tree you can you can build with this it's so strong it's the skin you make the fiber these are the branches of the tree look this is so strong strongest vibra we make this seed fashion bags we make from the same plant cannabis cannabis bags seed fresh once again once again [Music] strongest in the world [Music] yeah we are leading to home this time however we have tested however we have tried about the hemp how it becomes fabric we are just giving a practice so it is all here leon is working hello everyone say hi to camera yeah he is mr leon he is as like a researcher of him we are really in great village we have so many things over here they're all mother working [Music] sometimes i really felt like in a dream world or on the other planet or like i have fallen into a time machine [Music] it was really impressive to see this ancient culture still alive people living without electricity without mobile cars without mobile phones with all this modern technology peace with nature these local tribal people in the himalayas they still know how to live in harmony with their surrounding they all have great families with all the generations in one house you see these long very big plans this is hundred percent sativa when it's pure sativa it grows very high this is maybe five or six meters in this [Music] south [Music] come on i want to show you this thing bigger than my arm [Music] this is so huge [Music] here's some seats i definitely need this [Music] train look this is a very nice plant it's like smells like lemon haze you see the leaves they only have three that's a very old sativa stream i think yeah landrys [Music] and these have three you see only three it's very special let's take some some [Music] seeds did you know that this nestle is a sister of hemp it's the same family yeah full of him [Music] let's go up [Music] i was feeling like in the heaven of hemp it was incredible to see so many hemp plants in one place i could not imagine that there was even more than that i have seen before the whole country we calculated there are more than 9 million kilograms of cannabis fiber available and only 3.5 percent is industrialized yet so in these days i did not know that there is so much hemp so i was really overwhelmed and highly impressed by seeing all these wild growing hemp cultures everywhere in nepal and i'm really grateful to my friends who brought me on this journey and brought me to these villages yeah it is like paradise the house of henry the house covered by him you can [Music] come come [Music] [Music] wow [Music] foreign [Music] right wow many trees [Music] cannabis is growing wild in nepal in huge amounts and have been domesticated and cultivated since more than 6 000 years clothes the ropes and the ancient fabric was mainly made from the wild growing hemp because it's the long life lasting very strong fiber is made [Music] as you can see this hundred percent sativa plants growing very high and produce a lot of stock and very small flowers the benefit of this genetic is that it is reproducing itself by having two genders in one plant so it was able to survive for the last 10 000 years without any big help of human hands [Music] [Music] they're broken like this they produce more resin we can make bang from this bangla [Music] wow smells like gasoline very strong terpene since more than seven years i'm traveling through southeast asia to collect different ancient cannabis genetics and on my research i found that in the area of kazakhstan mongolia and the himalayas are the roots of cannabis sativa the first cannabis plant in history was cultivated in the himalaya region so i chose this region of the himalayas to find the different phenotypes different genetics and strains and research about the best uses for construction material fiber food and medicine another this is we are in heaven [Music] guys let's go to the next place we're down we go down it smells like mango amazing this smells like mango yes this drain but the seeds are not ready let's go here [Music] wow this smells like cheese pine tree we will extract all these terpenes in november after the harvest we're gonna make real cannabis stuff from these plants such a good turkey spectrum and all smell different [Music] oh yeah some seeds look [Music] some seeds [Music] you keep them [Music] take some more seeds from this plant it's a good strain and the seeds are finished in this plant many finished seeds you see the dark ones are finished the green ones are not finished a lot of female most of the genetic in nepal is a two-gender like female and male in one plant so they all have seeds but this one is more female it's very unique to find female plants in nepal because the original hemp is two sex to tender in one plant so it pollinates itself but you still can extract the therapy fabric clothes paper [Music] actually ten thousand products you can make from him it's amazing let's take this tree down these have seeds yeah get some seeds from here [Music] wow this very different smell oh that's even too much smells like puffy [Music] this will also grow smaller you see it's only height of maybe three meter other plants seven meter [Applause] and you you cannot see this get not so much light because it's on the same spot how much tree you think here are maybe five hundred one thousand trees more than a thousand trees i think it's this is really so big after see in season these all birds will become biggs [Music] now you like wow look purple oh let's take some seed from this very good [Music] get ready some [Music] [Music] they're smaller yeah seats also smaller [Music] a lot this together you see female and male put together will get a lot of seeds pollination this is like sex now baby it's a mix i think look it already broke when it was young and it repaired itself it's very strong cannabis cannabis can even grow in desert can grow on very bad conditions survives every condition plant king according to the ayurvedic science cannabis sativa is the king of the plant world if cannabis extract is added to an ayurvedic medicine the medicine will increase its power more than 100 times the research of this very ancient old culture is saying cannabis is growing freely and wild and can survive mostly any condition so all over the himalayas the hemp plant is spreaded widely i don't need water or any fertilizer to survive and to grow up to three to seven meters high it's a very good genetic it's full sativa [Music] this ancient and wild growing cannabis sativa genetic have a very high medical property according to a research made in canada they found out that these land race cannabis that have 100 sativa genes have a very special terpene profile the terpenes giving the different smell to plants trees fruits in the nature and according to science and research these terpenes have a high medical effect so we are collecting these wild land races to bring them to medical laboratories in america and europe to start our own scientific research and develop a special cannabis medicine and at the moment we are developing an industrial hemp industry here in the himalayas in nepal and we're creating the supply chain to make it possible to deliver more hemp paper packaging products more hemp bags and clothes and different hemp fiber products to the world with the intention to reduce microplastic at the moment the use of the resin is illegal in nepal since the 70s it got prohibited and it is not possible to do medical research inside nepal but we're bringing the seeds outside to breed them and to create special feminized seeds to be able to deliver to the customers every cannabis is not the same cannabis there are special genetics who have special dropping profiles and these landries that grows in the himalaya have a very special drop-in profile that even can help for viral infections or other infections where a typical indica or other cannabis genetic would not work so for people who cannot afford cannabis treatment in israel america or europe they just can go to nepal and become a part of this ancient hemp culture live in a village and collect the medicine and the food freely and wild [Music] so so [Music] so hemp leaves and hemp seeds are an amazing power food did you know that the leaf of hemp it contains 10 times more iron than meat does so with 10 gram of hemp leaves you get the same amount of iron like with 100 gram of meat especially when the hemp is young like now you can see very small leaves it's very easy to digest the fibre if the leaves get too big it's a bit difficult but you can make a powder and put it in the smoothies [Music] the world of [Music] the world of hemp is really fascinating did you know that you can make over 10 000 products out of hemp [Music] you can take the fiber like this and you can make clothes you can make ropes you can make bags like this so actually hemp is a food since more than 10 000 years that's why the humans developed an endocannabinoid system so we basically produce 80 cannabinoids with our own body and the cannabis have around 140 cannabinoids so by eating the hemp seeds for over thousands of years we developed this cannabinoid system because in the past the people did not cook so they were travellers there were no mars and they only eat hemp seeds while they were walking they just baked the protein the iron calcium magnesium you have all minerals you need so why do you buy walking you have just lived on hemp seeds because it is growing on the streets everywhere on the roads of course they also ate some other food like berries or purples but the basic diet was actually based on hemp this is all wild grown here [Music] you don't need to work a lot with your ham farmer because the plant produces so many seeds [Music] and reproduce itself every year you only need to harvest so the the first uh paper in egypt it was made from hemp inside the stem this is the hem steam and you see inside is a lot of wood and from this wood you can make an amazing paper together with the fiber it's extremely strong the first bible was printed on hemp [Music] paper open the gate hemp gate [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in dogs oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we are dropping from district of nepal welcome to all the tourists among all countries this is the mystical place having a different view [Music] hey [Music] wow this is a cancer tree this is the real him oh my god [Music] [Applause]

marijuana before we review", "nUEVpOUqRmA": "thank you for that report Derek well getting the biggest bang for their buck is putting some marijuana users at risk the trend of making butane honey oil is growing across the north state as are the fires and severe burns that often come along with that process I should use reporter bit Carlson got an inside look at these drug labs and has more on law enforcement officials concerns in a special report Bret yeah Alan and Kyra this butane honey oil or some call it hash oil combines the leftover remnants of the marijuana leaf and the highly flammable gas butane these labs are popping up more frequently across the north state and with the high rate of accidents associated with the process officials are working to nip this trend in the bud and if you combine this with smoking marijuana at the same time it's almost like lighting a stick of dynamite an internet sensation and now a marijuana trend in the North State manufacturing the plant form of the drug into a sticky oil similar to honey we're actually seeing more butane honey oil labs only are not stopped from Paradise to Bangor the Butte interagency Narcotics Task Force has broken up several butane honey oil labs in the past few months alone it's a way to knock off the microscopic trichomes with a few simple products a Schedule one drug becomes a firefighters nightmare butane is heavier than air so it'll go to the floor it'll leach its way out until it finds an ignition source and once it finds the ignition source it'll violently explode very hot very fast that's how they're often discovered too after the lab explodes or starts a fire the unsafe practice has taken its toll on experimenters and surprisingly many are very willing to share their dangerous experiences online the moral of the story is butane is flammable and will think twice before your actions I am an idiot now the Internet is littered with information on butane honey oil even video clips including how-to steps so it begs the question why on earth would people put themselves and their homes at danger for just a small vial of THC according to most of the pages we found online it's a way to use the entire plant and provides a different type of high but the way law enforcement sees it no high is worth an explosion or several years in jail it's the same punishment if you were making methamphetamine there's no exception for making hashish with butane you can possess it with your medicinal marijuana recommendation that you can't make it what the lab has gone bad marijuana users have the scars to prove it and usually the people that stop using it are the ones that suffered some kind of injury scary stuff well officials hope education will prevent people from even trying this at home because this is a lesson most people don't want to learn firsthand for Action News I'm Britt Carlson"}
